The game was *much* more exciting than I expected.  And Dracula was *really* hard to kill. Great game!

RATING: 6
Highly thematic but you really need to understand all the cards, counters, special powers etc to play the game properly and to allow it to flow smoothly. Rating therefore is very tentative and whether an improved understanding will lead to a much richer game (and therefore higher rating) or just turn it into a one sided luck fest remains to be seen. I hope the former because it has lots of potential.

Fun every now and again with the right group of folks. It has a lot of things I don't like: needless dice rolling, lazy design (specifically related to combat) and a whole bunch of randomness. Also one or two mechanics seem rather overpowered. Specifically, Dracula's ability to move anywhere on the board out of nowhere can cause the game to come to a grinding halt.

After three plays, two as Dracula and one as the Hunters, I've decided that the game largely comes down to the presence or absence of a few powerful cards: Hypnosis, Devilish Power, Evasion, and a couple others. Any of these cards can, if they appear at the right time, swing the game completely in the other direction. For me this is too much chance and luck in a 3-hour game. I really wanted to like FoD; it's got a great theme and a unique mechanic with Dracula's trail. But it's no fun when the previous 2 hours of play are made irrelevant by a single card.

When reading the rules I think it SOUNDS fun, but both attempts at playing it bombed completely. Felt drawn out with everyone getting bored about halfway through, and no one liked the strange anti-climatic combat system with cards instead of dice. I'd like to give this another chance, but that is unlikely to happen.

Dracula tries to rule the world. 4 Hunters must work together to find his hidden trail over whole europe. During nights Dracula is strong and might attack the hunters. During the days, the hunters can equip and prepare themselves for his encounters.

Draculas movement is hidden, so it's  abit like "scotland yard" finding his trail. With thematic encounters and event cards the hunters get on draculas trail quickly and a cat & mouse games begins.

The combat between dracula, his minions and the hunters is heavily based on luck and can ruin the game if you throw unlucky.

Fantastic hidden movement game, though it relies a bit too much on total bull for balance (such as Dracula's "Go anywhere" card, or the hunters' drawing "Newspapers" at the very beginning of the game).

RATING: 4.5
Not really that fun in my estimation. I've been pressed into playing it a few times and will likely play again because those in my group really enjoy it. For me, the game just isn't mechanically interesting as it's basically hide-and-seek - with a combat system that is particularly droll. Dracula is always running for cover and the others are trying to get to the perfect cards that, once revealed, blow his cover and win them the game - after a lengthy and uninteresting number of moves to back Dracula into a corner. This sums up the entire game: "You move there, then I'll move here and then he can only go to that place or that one and I'll play a card that will reveal which place he's at and we'll have him." Every game leads to this precise statement. Sometimes, Dracula wins.

This was fun! With 5 players it was nice, with two players not so much. Enjoyed it still, though.

The combat rules are a bit of a disappointment, perhaps I waited too much from this game...

RATING: 7
Hmm...I haven't really played this enough yet to say too much.  I expect that it's rating is more likely to go up a bit than down a bit.

Above all, this game is full of theme and atmospherics.  The designers did a great job with that.  Strip all of the chrome away and there's maybe not that much left, BUT the chrome is well done - and not too much for what we have.  It's kind of in the same area as Pirate's Cove I guess - the themes are very different but it's the same kind of fun, light-medium, bit of strategy/lots of theme sort of thing.  Where this one is not as good as that is in the fact that it can be MUCH slower to get to any sort of a climax.  Strategically, there's more going on, but when a fights start, PC is more edgy.

Some folks are going to want to knock this down for having too much chrome and not enough elegance or clever mechanisms (I can sense them sharpening their, ahem fangs, as I type), but actually I'll be fairly happy to see this periodically hit the table.

I am a terrible Dracula but I shouldn't hold that against the game.  I think Letters from Whitechapel is easier on Jack than this game is for Dracula, but that could be the lack of experience we have as detectives in Whitechapel.

Either game is great fun.  One on many can cause hurt feelings in games like Descent (which is more confrontational).  This is just 'catch me if you can', but unlike Jack it is possible to fight back with Dracula.

RATING: 6
Great components.  There is a lot going on in the game, however the special cards seem to be the key, either putting you on Dracula's trail or allowing him to teleport away.  The game is fun if the players keep it moving but if you are playing with analysis paralysis types it will drrraaaagggg. Having multiple people play the hunters doesnt particularly add/detract from the game since they have little to do individually on their turn and in combat your best play is generally straightforward and obvious. One caution: Alert the hunter players about the "Evasion" Dracula Card in the event deck, lest they flip out on you when it shows up.

It is confirmed. Fury of Dracula may be a good game and experience (I actualy think so), but ameritrash games are not my cup of tea. To spend more than 30 minutes prior to play the game reviewing the rules and having to use continously the rules for understanding the meaning of each tile and many of the cards is not something that I enjoy. Maybe if I had played often this will not be an issue, but since my games have been few and apart, I will need another 30 minutes+ the next time. I am not in a hurry.

Me cansó y me pareció un juego largo. No logró meterme en el asunto.

RATING: 7.5
Very interesting investigation game, even playing everyone against one mastermind (Dracula), a kind of game I don't appreciate too much, I think this one got my attention by the way it is played in the search for Dracula, it appears a little bit disbalanced at first for the hunters, but it is fun for everyone that is playing.

RATING: 7
This would be just a bit higher if the basic chanciness involved in trawling for Drac wasn't so high.  If he's spotted very early, the game isn't an enormous amount of fun.  (I say this having never played Drac - the lack of fun I report is on the hunting side.)  Things are much better if the hunters are adrift for a while - the tension and the scope for logical deduction ramp up together in a nice way.  Like most people, I find the combat system a little clunky, but I don't think it makes me less likely to play this.

I really enjoy the theme of this game. Playing Dracula and trying to outmaneuver the other four players by yourself can get intense and is quite rewarding when you succeed. The collaboration required when playing a hunter keeps the game from feeling dry and when someone finally stumbles upon the count, it's exciting to know the group's strategy succeeded.

I've read the rules and think this will be great.  People have complained about the combat and game length.  Complaining about game length is ridiculous.  Umm, require less victory points for a victory?,, just a guess though.  Use half the board?  You have options people.

RATING: 8
Definitely a preliminary rating - but the play we had was very entertaining! The many rules aren't so hard to manage if you watch Rahdo's video to get a strong idea of framework first, and then just flip through as you need them. So thrilled I was able to get a good secondhand copy, and it even came already sleeved.

Having had the chance to play it some more, I'm pleasantly surprised that, while it's not something I'd sit down and play twice in a row, we've been able to finish games under 2 hours without trying to rush. (I am reticent to teach the game to certain types of players with a lower attention span, though.) Both the hunters and Dracula have a great deal of fun. While more players helps, two player is a perfectly fine experience as long as the hunter player doesn't mind, perhaps thinking of it as having multiple units rather than having to take on the role of several players. Will eventually write down more specific and organized thoughts.

Un jugador maneja a Drácula y el resto a los cazadores que tratan de darle caza por todo Europa. Drácula viaja en secreto, pero determinadas cartas u objetos de los cazadores pueden revelar localizaciones de su ruta, y hacerles ver a dónde puede haber ido. Faroleo, deducción y agobio mucho mucho agobio sobre todo si eres Drácula. No conozco juego que me agote tanto, en el buen sentido de la palabra, como este; más divertido y complicado ser Drácula, aunque de cazador supone tambien un reto. Buenos componentes, mucha ambientación.Tiene mucho azar, pero le viene bien para representar que hay que correr riesgos, que nunca vas a estar seguro de si haces bien en cada momento... Los combates son interesantísimos. Un juego diferente, para jugarlo por la noche y sumergirte en él.

Thematic game, based on bluffing... who would have thought that I'd like it? It one of the classic FFG games, sadly out of print for a while, which implements the hidden movement system better than any other game of its kind.

OK I admit it, I'm a sucker for theme and bits, which possibly makes this my favourite game. I love the atmosphere, the hunt, the tricks and feints that both sides can pull, although I want to play it more before rating. My only concern is it seems to take a couple of plays to wade through the rules, unless there is an experienced teacher. 
Other than the occasional frustrating rule ambiguity, and the fact the designers missed the opportunity to make Whitby the UK mainland's northern port, this is fantastic.

RATING: 8.2
This is an excellent one-vs.-all game.  Dracula's hidden movement mechanic and his ability to place minions, blinds and spawn vampires really makes this game shine.

The investigators having to decide whether to chance taking from the items deck, risking giving Dracula more power, makes for some difficult decision making.

At first it might look like the cards you draw determine what you do (kinda the game playing you) but, as you know the cards better, know what to expect and when you want it to come out, the game becomes more interesting. Combat is also interesting and original, but its mechanics is something you really have to get used to.

Un buen juego de búsqueda pero que es tal vez un poco largo y farragoso.

A veces las partidas pueden hacerse muy largas.

Creo que se disfruta más con pocos jugadores, 3 me parece un número perfecto.

Tras probar la nueva versión, me doy cuenta que en la misma se han mejorado algunos puntos débiles. 
Se ha reducido la duración agilizando algunos aspectos del juego, se han mejorado mecánicas y se le ha dado un lavado de cara al arte gráfico. 
Creo sinceramente que la nueva versión está más pulida que esta.

Particularmente no me disgusta esta mecánica, pero tampoco para jugar a este tipo de juegos todos los días.

Superb update to the old GW version.  Lots of theme, smooth gameplay, and plenty of fun for everyone.  Good table talk is essential as well as part of the fun for Dracula, who gets to hear the hunters debate how they are going to locate and catch him.  Also, there are lots of ways to adjust the game balance if players feel one side has an advantage.

RATING: 9
A great game that offers two different playing experiences depending on which side you play.

The hunters get a cooperative-deduction game.  They have to coordinate their movements to cover different parts of the map, not only to narrow down Dracula's location but to clean up any new vampires he has left in his trail.  The hunters have different innate abilities and will collect different items and powers and players try to use them where they are best suited.

The Dracula player goes solo and must figure out a way to use his clever assortment of powers to evade the hunters -- not only to save himself but also to allow new vampires to mature before the hunters can find them.  

This is all built on a cool system where Dracula choses his movements by placing a trail of face-down cards.  At each location he can drop one of many different types of traps, or if he thinks that the hunters won't find it he can try to spawn a new vampire to help him win the game.

Dracula has other tricks besides the traps he places.  He can sometimes break movement rules by staying in one place while appearing to move.  Or jumping two spaces instead of one.  Or when desperate he can take a boat to one of many destinations.

Most of the time, the hunters are on the offensive when it comes to combat.  But in the right circumstances Dracula can try to kill a hunter by catching him alone, poorly armed, and at night.  This is a nice counter-threat and another way in which Dracula can win the game.

This is getting long, but I'll also mention that the combat system is really clever too.  Players simultaneously pick which weapons they are going to use, which match up in different ways.  I also like that the hunters control the flow of the event draw deck, but the cards can benefit either side.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
While I've enjoyed playing the "hunters", my only experience as Dracula was pretty boring. A lot of downtime while the others are planning (true, one has to listen and to learn how to outwit them, but since there are up to 2-3 options at any given time, I simply had to sit and wait).
So - I will probably want to play again, but not as the a-priory interesting role.

RATING: 9
Fury of Dracula is easily one of my gaming group's favorite games. 

The game plays almost like a teamwork game where players try to beat the game, but instead all but one player is trying to beat the remaining player (Dracula). 

It is a game of hide and seek or cat and mouse...  Dracula moves about the board secretly while the other players try to find and destroy him. Players are constantly discussing where Dracula could be, how he got there, etc.

Dracula, while powerful, is best kept in the shadows. He can attack, but unless he has a really good reason (good chance of killing a player), he shouldn't... If he attacks it better be during the night when he is most powerful. We've learned that Dracula's best strategy is to remain a few steps ahead of the players and force them to encounter minions. Games always seem close, but it is extremely difficult to win as Dracula - which makes it very rewarding when you do! Usually we have one of the more experienced players be Dracula.

The game can last a long time - especially if the Dracula player is good at evasion and trickery. A typical game lasts 3 hours or longer. This game IS game night. Thankfully since it is a teamwork game, it is easy for a player to step out for a few rounds, while the other players play for him/her.

Great game. Fun theme. Excellent choice if you are looking for a new game to bring to the table!

This is everything I expected it to be, thought it seems harder for Dracula than for the hunters to win, given the sometimes devious cards that the hunting party can play to track down the fanged count. Production is also top notch with great board (one of FFG's most instantly readable) and
fantastic art. Rating might rise after more plays.
Definitly one of the best horror games ever written and a great revamp wich fixes all the problems of the GW version while keeping all of it's charms.

So I search the countryside for Dracula while encountering traps and minions, arming myself with weapons, and trying to deduce his location before he can grow a vampire army?  Awesome!

Wait!  Once I have a vague clue about where he might be, I SLOWLY trudge over to the area, confront him, and experience one of the LAMEST combat engines around?  No thank you.  

Seriously, a three hour game that climaxes in a series of dice roles?  I'd rather have Dracula escape than fight him in another combat round.  Unfortunately, I feel that the putrid combat mechanics, long play time, and confusing rules overshadow the cool deductive element.

RATING: 6
This game is great fun.  As Dracula, there is nothing more satisfying than to slip right through the hunters' fingers and watch them spend the next two rounds trying to figure out how you escaped their "perfect" trap.

On the hunter side, it is electrifying to have the dark prince cornered, the sun rising, and only a trip out to sea left for him to desperately contemplate.

Bluff, timing, and resource management are the hallmarks of this game.  Knowing how the combat cards interact (especially what happens when you LOSE the combat roll) is key to maximizing Fury's fun potential.  The game plays best with 3 players, in my opinion.  This is my favorite medium-length game.

Edit: After dozens of plays, I have to bump Drac down a few points.  The endgame Resolve-powered teleport festival is annoying and unthematic.  3rd Edition is superior.

RATING: 7
Somewhat nice game with intruiguing core idea. Unfortunately favors too much hunters and the combat system is too complicated to teach. The 3rd edition improves this game greatly.

RATING: 8
A very clever implementation of the 'chase the hidden player' mechanisms seen in Scotland Yard and Letters from Whitechapel. This mechanism is already hugely entertaining, but the addition of means for Dracula to fight back, and the ebb and flow of day and night (meaning there is incentive for Dracula to strike) give this game a deeper tactical layer and therefore make it richer overall. A real shame this is out of print.

RATING: 6
Rating is for one play.  Enjoyed the game but it really needs to be played quickly.  Five players has too much downtime, I think three would be optimal with two hunters to each player.

Update: Since played many two-player games.  Works best for two in my opinion, not overwhelming if you know the rules well.  Use the Memoir'44 card holders, one for each hunter, it works fantastic!  I'm hesitant to agree to play this with three. My only qualm is I'm playing a very very good Drac player and have not won a game yet.  Came close once and learned you need garlic *and* a stake to kill him before he escapes!

Update: OK, even more games played and I've upped the rating to a 9.  Initially I thought there were a few unbalanced cards such as the one which lets Dracula move to any location on the board.  But I found out first hand today that the "Ignore just played event" card pretty much screws up that plan!    Two player is excellent but I think for some people the three player game would be a little more manageable.  I couldn't imagine playing with 4+ again.

Update: Dropped again, my taste for heavily themed Ameritrash has dwindled.

can be overwhelming as a two player game as four hunters are a lot for one person to control, besides that it is fun as long as the dracula player doesnt forget a card. Dracula seems weak in this game, more of a run away instead of fight aspect.

RATING: 8
Highly entertaining with beautiful components; I bought this game hoping for something similar to "Scotland Yard" and I was not disappointed.  

There is great interaction between the hunters s they attempt to track Drac all over Europe.

It's an evocative experience full of close escapes and surprise attacks.

In my experience it can be hard to predict how long this one will last.  A bad Drac player combined with skilled hunters will lead to a very short game.  But a talented and timid Count can create a game that bogs down a bit after a couple hours.

If I could somehow shave 30 minutes of the playtime of this game this might be a 10

My idea of how to spend a perfect evening. A game that blends subtle skills and tactics of avoidance. This is no head-long charge, slash-fest. Dracula is a strong individual, but if hes careless and becomes trapped even he cant resist our heroes working in concert. Great Gothic theme realised in wonderful style. Tense cat and mouse style pursuit tends to immerse all players in a fashion more akin to a good film than a board game. Dracula impersonations are a requirement from the outset and played in a slightly underlit room with plenty of red wine sets the mood to perfection. Get some painted figures and this is as good as it gets for me.

Szép játék! Ha jól láttam, egy régi játék újabb kiadása. Egész hosszú volt a szabályismertető (45 perc kb.), pedig összességében elég egyszerű játék, csak sok apróságra kell figyelni benne. Draculát kell elkapni 4 embernek, akik eleinte vakon tapogatóznak Európa térképén, de aztán egész váratlanul közel kerülhetnek a grófhoz. Tetszik a játékmenet, néhány dolog különösen (pl. a lefelé fordított helyszínkártyákra rakott lapkák, és a karantén), de nem tetszett a szerintem egysíkú csata. Volt, hogy ugyanazokat a lapokat tudtuk csak kijátszani hosszú körökön át a küzdelem során, és szinte kizárólag a kockadobásról szólt a dolog. A másik, hogy volt egy abnormálisan erős lapja Draculának: teljesen bekerített helyzetben váratlanul eltűnt, gyakorlatilag elölről kezdődött a játék:) És végül, bár ez engem nem érintett, állítólag kaotikus a szabálya a játéknak.
Még annyit, hogy nem nagyon használtuk ki a játék kooperatív jellegét (pl. csapatosan támadás), annyiban merült ki az egyeztetés, hogy kb. ki merre menjen a térképen.
---
Második játékban én voltam Dracula. Továbbra sem tetszik a harc, bár ennek az oldalnak több a lehetősége. Túl nagy a szerencse szerepe, a kártyák, lapkák és a kockadobás miatt.

This game is just too long for what it is.  You run around aimlessly trying to look for dracula for hours.  At one point you think you got him cornered, only to find out that he can teleport and pretty much start all over again looking for him for hours.  Maybe if I played Dracula, I would have much more fun as I play run from the other players and mock them as I hide.  Maybe not, because that is just jacked up.  I have only played the game once and that is enough for me.

Fury of Dracula is the ameritrash twin of Scotland Yard.
The premise is the same: one versus all in a hunt, but in this game the prey has fangs! And, at night, you don't really want to catch it...

The game is very thematic, but it is a bit too long. And much of its length comes from a convoluted and baroque combat system based on cards, that is often too long in achieving any result.

I'd like the idea, but it really shows its age: all the micro-rules, while thematic, are a chore to bear in mind. And many of the things this game does well, Letters from Whitechapel does better...

I found Fury of Dracula stupidly random.  Where is the strategy?  The outcome of almost every action that I made was determined by chance.  For example, you never knew if drawing an event card would benefit the Hunters or Dracula.  Travel by train to either corner Dracula or lose your turn based on a stupid die roll.  I'm not even going to get into the lame 6-sider/card combat system.

Anyway, The event cards seriously hampered Dracula.  His initial board position was too easy to deduce.  On turn 2 the hunters were able to reveal his last location.  During the next few turns we drew 2 other event cards that revealed too much of his path.  Perhaps I was expecting a more challenging version of Scotland Yard.  

Actually a better question is "Where's the narrative?"  My experience went something like this... Van Helsing visits Vienna.  Dracula is not there.  Van Helsing attempts to board a train.  He is delayed.  Van Helsing then encounters Thieves who steal his pistol.  Next Van Helsing encounters Dracula and punches him in the mouth, but Dracula manages to dodge a stake to the heart.  To me, this sounds like a pretty boring narrative, but I guess there are some people who would probably love this storyline.

RATING: 6
After only one play I'd rate this a 6 with potential to move up.  As a hunter the game takes far too long, but I think that future playings would benefit from a less severe learning curve.  I want to try it again to give it a fair shake.

RATING: 6
A spiced up version of 'Scotland Yard' with a nice theme. However, gamers may dislike the high luck factor of the game (random hunter movements during the first turns, card draws and the fights are based on 'compare one d6 to another'). Seems to be more fun when playing a hunter instead of Dracula.

The game is not perfect, but once you take the time to learn it forwards and back, it's an amazing game. No other hidden movement games I've played allow the hurted to become the hunter, then reverse those roles every few turns. 

While 3rd is prettier and has some improvements(cards rather than chits), they broke some key elements, namely several turns at day, then several at night.

Game is a 10, not because it's perfect, but because of what it's been to me. It was my 1st "designer" board game and was played for hours and hours before I ever branched out into other games.

Truthfully, I've only played this game a single time, so be that as it may ... my comments are probably a little skewed.  

While with many games I eagerly anticipate my next time playing the game, I felt no such draw with Fury of Dracula.  I felt that the chasing game was much too ridiculous to actually root out Dracula ... without a good deal of luck.  We played a 2v1 game, and we just so happened to find Dracula ... mostly, though, because we needed to finish the game, so I think that Dracula didn't run off when he could/should have.  Then, as if the gaming gods knew that this had to end very soon, I proceeded to throw 6 after 6 after 6 after 6 in combat and Dracula was sent back to his coffin -- his eternal coffin.  

I know there are times when luck will run the gauntlet and cause big shifts, but this was all-in-all an unsettling encounter with that Lady.

Adjusted rating upwards after playing a few more times. Great "one versus many" game in the tradition of Scotland Yard. My favourite of this type. Rules are a tad cumbersome and play time can be long (which led to my initial lower rating) but after we played more complex games (such as Arkham Horror) and became more familiar with the rules, play time and relative complexity of this one shot down rapidly. Plays fine with 2 but is nice with 4 - however, if your group is intent on discussing every single action and making mass decisions expect play time to balloon out substantially. I'll enjoy playing this as either Dracula or one of the hunters, but only with a group that wants to play quickly and casually. Great theme and components.

I've played this four times so far, and have really enjoyed it despite losing every time.  The action and rules are perfectly suited for the theme, and the mechanics are well thought out and cohesive enough to provide a satisfying play experience every time, even when the players employ a variety of strategies.  That being said, the game has some obvious weaknesses, chief among them the odd combat system that *seems* like it offers some strategic options, but all too often just comes down to a roll-off.  

Later: Aw, fuck it.  This game is AWESOME and who am I to fight it?  Yeah, the combat can be a little wonky, but more often than not it's quick and satisfying.  Yeah, there's a touch of crazy randomness, but who cares?  It's fun, it's simple, it's Dracula vs. the vampire hunters, it's everything it should it be.

The Fury of Dracula is all about theme: you really can see the story unfold in a fashionable way as the hunters retrace Dracula’s trail and close in on him. All in all it feels like one of those black and white movies of old that develop on both atmosphere and mystery rather than a special effects and CGI modern piece of trash, which is rather surprising but deeply appeasing as well.

With a pun that only works in Italian, we think «La fuga di Dracula» (Flight of Dracula) sounds more appropriate a title than «La furia di Dracula» (Fury of Dracula) as the only thing the eponymous character had better do is fleeing from the start.

RATING: 8.2
Great game for gamers who enjoy deduction and fans of the genre. The game is significantly influenced by the sequence of 'event/item' cards besides good strategy. The experienced Dracula usually wins the game if the hunters are newbies. Most of my friends prefer to play as Dracula. Occasionally, a hunter may feel left out as he/she is too far from the action, but that may be partially resolved with 'sense of emergency'.

Excellent reprint from FFG.  A 3-4 hour game of Hide n Seek with Count Dracula.  If you don't catch him in time his recently turned, skanky, vampire brides will wake up and he wins.  Very tense game with excellent mechanics, components...everything about this game is awesome.  Too bad it's OOP.

Scotland Yard with a twist.  Cooperative aspect turns some players off.  Loads of Dracula period flavor.

RATING: 8
Have introduced it to my school students. I raised its rating as it proved an even better game than I originally thought. If you like deduction games with some race and combat strategies thrown in, this is a game you would love. Not a euro in the area of calculating pathways to victory but a lot more psychology. It's very tense as Dracula!

The FFG components are spectacular as well. I've played the original GW version when I was younger. I prefer this ones' card system for Dracula's path. A destination card plus the encounter on top. This allows for encounters to be revealed but not the destination and vicea versa, as well as the hunters to prepare better or be mislead to the importance of the destination.

RATING: 6
Interesting idea for a game, but takes too long on average. Hunter vs. hunted has been done better both before (Scotland Yard) and after (Letters from Whitecastle). The extra fluff with Dracula leaving encounters to slow down the heroes, or the somewhat clunky combat system, really just detracts from the main appeal of this style of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very fun semi-cooperative hidden movement game. Not as complex as a skim of the 20+ page rulebook might have you think; combat is the most complicated part of the game.
The first 20 minutes or so can be slow, but once Dracula gets some encounters on the board and the players start tracing his trail, tension mounts to palpable levels.
I have yet to play a game with better theme-to-mechanics integration.

Longer, more lavish and chrome-laden upgrade to the original. If you have the original Fury of Dracula and enjoy it, then you may not be missing so very much if you skip or wait to get the newer Fantasy Flight edition. If you haven't tried the original and the subject and theme are a strong tug on your gaming dollar, then an excellent game about chasing Dracula to ground awaits! One of the best book-to-game adaptations ever made.

The luck is a little too crazy in this game -- a small amount of luck can sometimes cause extreme results.  But I like this more than I usually like these type of games.  Dracula's hidden movement and powers are clever and well done.  Much better, I think, with three players than five.

1 play.  Seems like a fun twist on Scotland Yard.  Not enough fighting with Dracula.  Fiddly to have to spend time choosing which item/weapon cards to keep (max of 3) since you rarely fight Drac or his minions.  Complexity is moderate, and the learning curve is made worse by the fact that players ought to know a lot about the contents of the item & event card decks.  The Dracula auto-escapes (to anywhere) card is very powerful... and I'm not sure if the Hunter Resolve ability to teleport via the "sense of emergency" balances this out.  Seems like there are too many "cancel" event cards in the deck... we had Drac succeed with the auto-escape card after canceling our cancel :o(  Others say: the combat results are too dependent on the die rolls... I agree.

This game can really create a lot of tension.  Between the cat-and-mouse hunt and the way that cards are drawn from the bottom of the deck, this can be a real edge of your seat game.  It can also be a little slow, but I find that to be the case if you aren't playing correctly (c'mon, Dracula player, ATTACK MINA!!!).  The combat needs to be seen from both sides before you can even begin to fully comprehend it (which I'm okay with for my own evil reasons), and when you do get it, you find that it's the kind of combat that while, yes, you need the dice on your side, you also need a solid strategy (in this case, trying to predict what the opponent will play) in place first.

One of my most favorite games.

RATING: 5
On it's way from FFG!  I'm looking forward to this one hitting the table.  Looks like a title my wife and I can play together successfully.

Played the first game, the hunters cornered Dracula around Saraejvo.  Good use of Heroic Leap (twice, due to another card allowing us to pull it from the discard pile and good (poor?) rolling on Dracula's part won the game for the hunters!  Interesting game, though we found the combat to be a bit frustrating at times.  It will be played again though.

We played again, but the combat continues to bother me.  It was a long session, and if Dracula had not decided to not use the Escape(mist) card in the combats the game would have gone on another hour or so.  I think we would have eventually caught him in the day and finished him, but the hunters were quite well equipped at that point and he didn't really stand a chance outside of running away some more.  I suspect that Dracula needs to make a kill the first night then run away like crazy after that in order to win.

With a game collection like mine, I doubt this is going to hit the table again, as I have a large number of games I`d rather play over this one.

This game could easily be a 9 if Dracula was more powerful. The game shouldn't be called fury of dracula as much as it should be called "the stealth of dracula" because being undetected is way easier to win than killing characters.  Still it's got a great theme and a great hidden mechanic system.

No soy muy amigo de los cooperativos, y este lo es. No obstante,es un juego entretenido. Admite hasta cinco jugadores, de los cuales, uno necesariamente ha de ser drácula y el resto cazadores que deben encontrarlo y matarlo en alguna de las ciudades de europa que vienen en el tablero. Los cazadores se van desplazando por el tablero. En cambio, el movimiento de drácula es oculto y viene determinado por unas cartas (boca abajo) que van determinando su ruta. En el momento que un cazador visita una ciudad de la ruta, la carta de ruta se desvela y permite hacerse una idea de por donde puede andar drácula. Además, en las ciudades, drácula puede ir dejando "regalitos". Los cazadores se van haciendo de objetos y desvelando eventos según van viajando por europa. 

El juego termina con victoria para drácula si aguanta 6 días sin ser eliminado o el contador de vampiros llega a 6.

Es entretenido. Tiene deducción. Los combates se resuelven con un método tipo piedra-papel-tijera.

Played  several times with two players.
Fun, frustrating and agonizing to be the hunters trying to catch Drac. 
Played it as Drac for the first time. I think that playing Drac is a bit more fun than being the hunters. The reason is that its not frustrating and agonizing to be Drac, just a nailbiting feeling together with a stone-in-the-stomach feeling. :)


Have to see how this stand with more players. 
But it was a blast last time we played.

This one has become an institution around here. Right around Halloween, we invite friends over and they chase me - the dread Count - around Europe.

It's not a game that we play often, but for two couples, some wine (Red wine. Always red.), and low lighting, it's a great time.

It adds to the deduction model of Scotland Yard, and there is a combat element that is somewhat limited (frustrating?).

We've tried playing with two on the random weeknight, and it falls flat. However, it's the perfect game for the right circumstances.

RATING: 8
Nice adaptation of the hidden movement mechanic, with great theme. Long, though we are learning as we become familiar with the rules and strategy. We all enjoyed the experience, which seems very balanced with field of search not to expansive with the number of hunters. Brilliant mechanic of having the encounters hamper the hunters, while they are needing to challenge them to find new vampires and reduce scoring opportunities for the Dracula player. At the same time, Dracula attempts to battle hunters at key moments while staying hidden. Event card play provides the right amount of correction to keep the game from being stalled, yet not too overpowering. Battle resolution has a fresh approach, and gives the game a break from the search mode. Rate an 8 for a few overpowered cards in the deck. The blood flows as bullets are dodged and holy water is used in an attempt by hunters to vanquish the beast.

The final result is less than the sum of its parts. It does neither the cat-n-mouse component, nor the combat very well.

That is too bad because the theme is super fantastic and fits the mechanics. It's a good idea to elevate the cat-and-mouse genre above Scotland Yard.

But that component is weak. The map is relatively simple and the chase is not that exciting.

But where the game really falls apart is the combat system. It's lame...and we were indifferent as to the outcome of the fight. We efforted a group fight, but Dracula could just pick on one person to pound on, while the others in the group just watch. That's a lousy and unbelievable narrative.

At the end of the day, I will gladly reach for Letters from Whitechapel. But FoD will likely get a future pass.

The one game I played dragged on as Dracula kept escaping when we closed in on him. After 3 hours, the end wasn't anywhere near and we had to rush what would be our last moves to get killed quickly at the end of the day. Definitely not the kind of games I enjoy, despite the good company!

It took a while to get into how the game was supposed to work etc. but once I had crossed the divide into the sweet embrace of Vampire haunted nights this game took on a new dimension.  During an early combat I distinctly rember thinking, 'oh shit, I'll just throw out any card, this is really dull'.  But a few turns later and the combats I was in were great, definitely an awesome game!

Plus you have to love any game with a Dracula miniature that appears to be gesturing to himself as if to say 'what, me?' with a 'this is slightly unfair' look on his vampiric face.  Sorry buster - but you are DRACULA!!!

I also enjoyed hearing the Dracula player complain, 'Damn this is a hard game for Dracula' as he munched his way through three of the hunters.

One of the few games where one player opposes the rest that really works. One player is the prince of darkness while the others are Van Helsing and Co. who persue Dracula hoping to destroy him before her achieves his evil goals. Nicely balanced with clever mechanics this captures the struggle between Dracula and his persuers very well. The only down side is the length of play which can be a bit long for anything but a big gaming session (i.e 4 hours plus).

Ahh, so much promise, so little payoff.  This has to be my biggest disappointment thus far in the world of gaming.  Combine the mechanism of Scotland Yard (one of my childhood faves) with a theme I love (any horror, really, but literary themes are cool), and I was excited.  And in theory, the game should be great.  The theme and the mechanism work good together, the art is great (as per much FFG product) but - it's just not fun.  At least, not for two.  The game seems to take an eternity to get going, with the hunters blindly thrashing around Europe.  If by chance they bump into Drac, then great, we're off and running, but if the Dracula player is any good, it's not hard to evade for quite a while - and as far as I'm concerned, 4 or 5 cities deep on the trail is quite a head start.  Basically, unless you stumble onto Dracula or get a good card draw, it'll be quite a while before any combat occurs.  The encounters with the followers are just ok.  The system for hunter/Dracula combat is pretty cool, and lots of fun, but unless you get a bunch of hunters together in a joint battle (which is pretty damn hard to pull off), Dracula can often win (or escape) with ease.  So essentially, a lot of ho-hum and waiting around, for a few minutes of actual fun.  We tried the game once with 5, and even then, it was pretty lame, and our guests were unimpressed.  We felt bad for making them play, and after that, I sold it off.  Maybe someone else more dedicated than I can hone a strategy that leads to some fun.

The first co-op style game I have really liked, even thought it's not the first I have played with an opposing player (LotR, Shadows, Galactica).

The theme is pervasive and encompassing.  The deduction, with its subsequent strategic decisions, makes for well-thought-out plans.  The combat is a hoot, and allows for the best laid plans of mice and men to come apart.  The decks are filled with fun stuff, the artistic design is great, and the players (not just Count Dracula) have interesting decisions and fun powers.

My only issue, honestly, is the length.  Oh, and that I waited four years to play it.

I enjoyed this game more than I thought I would. It's sort of Scotland Yard done with a fairly immersing theme. Good stuff. This game was owned by another player, but I'm the rule reader-teacher, so I had to read the rules. It was fairly easy to learn, considering how much is going on. We referred to the rules fairly often in that first game, but it didn't annoy anyone. Fun, tense stuff.

I really like this game. Sure, I wish it were a bit shorter, but it's a lot of fun and very thematic. It may be better with fewer players (3, maybe). 5 seems a touch thin; not a lot for the hunters to do individually, and the game time balloons as much discussion takes place. Also, you need a wily Dracula who is familiar with all the options; playing Dracula requires more familiarity with the game than playing the hunters.

Couple tips for the Dracula player:

Your strategy will depend a lot on the initial disposition of the hunters. A common initial Hunter setup is to put one hunter in each corner of the board, and then work their way towards the center. This makes sense, because the peripheries of the board are easier to search earlier than later. But, if they go this route, you can set up near one of the isolated hunters and try to kill them the first night. Remember, hunters will only get stronger as the game goes on, while you will tend to get weaker. If you can pick someone off the first night, that means by the dawn of the second day you're halfway to winning. It can be somewhat risky, but unless a hunter gets lucky on the weaponry in the first few turns, they can't do a lot to you.

If the Hunters set up concentrated in the middle and work their way outwards, your job will be a little tougher, although they most likely won't discover you for a little longer. Use that time to set up a New Vampire (use Dark Call if necessary to get one) and lay down a web of encounter tokens. Then, while the Hunters have to split up to deal with both you and your New Vampire, try to isolate one hunter at night and kill them. This may be tricky, as the Hunters will likely be better-armed; try to accumulate a couple good combat cards, and find someone with a weak selection of items. When in doubt, go after Mina; you can kill her with a single bite. You should have a few chances to look at the Hunters' hands; be careful if they have enough combat cards to hurt you.

Dracula is extremely powerful at night, but ridiculously weak during the day. This will drive your tactics. Attack at night and escape as a bat (using either Escape as Bat or Fangs) to open up some distance and uncertainty. A common use of  your Wolf Form card is to evade, but always remember you can also use it to attack - if you can use the Wolf Form to make an attack first thing in the evening, you can potentially hound one hunter for a couple turns until you kill him or her.

Dracula must combine guile and aggression to win. I don't think you can pull it off if you're just hiding and trying to mature New Vampires. The process is too slow, and experienced, well-armed hunters are going to catch up with you eventually (against inexperienced hunters, you can win this way though).

Our very early games saw Dracula winning, but then the Hunters went on a long and impressive winning streak. But once Dracula started playing aggressively, especially early, the Hunters have been routinely getting beaten badly again, and haven't quite found the adjustment yet.

Blech.  For starters, I don't like Scotland Yard at all, so I really dislike the "Find Dracula" part of the game as players wander aimlessly around the board.  Granted, there are a lot of ways to catch his trail, so finding him isn't incredibly difficult, but it still puts me off.  Once you actually get to fighting Dracula, the battle system is kind of neat; it reminds me of the Lost World books, where the outcome of a fight depends on the combination of fighting maneuvers that are used.  I also like the events, which add many unexpected twists to the game.  However, other than those two elements which were kind of fun, the game just felt very slow with not a whole lot of action.  For a game about vampire hunting, it sure was a bore.  I'll definitely be sure to avoid this one in the future!  *EDIT* Crap, I got forced into another game already!  It sucked just as bad, if not worse, as the first play.

I would prefer to play Scotland Yard which has similar mechanics but a lot less extra bits. The only fun bit is trying to work out where Dracula is. Rename it the wanderings of Dracula and then it would have an accurate title. For such a long game it comes down to dice rolls in combat as to whether you defeat Dracula or not that is if you find him. 1 Play.

I was looking forward to this game so much. It sounded fantastic on paper. I really want to like it... we just find it dull. Apart from the basic idea of one player being hidden and the others looking for him, the mechanics were generally uninteresting (the combat was overly fiddly, too) and it takes way too long to play.

Nice production values (figures, board, etc) from FFG but the cooperative element didn't strike me as much fun. I liked the special power of each character but the game drags perhaps due to it's unnecessary complexity. Dracula's ability to transform into a bat and relocate is a ridiculous game-breaker. I prefer Nuns on the Run or Garibaldi as they are quicker even if the themes are less exciting.

I'll start with the good.  1) Hunting down Dracula is a hell of a lot of fun.  The Trail mechanic is amazing.  Using the Trail to mature vampires in a particular city is fun as well.  2) Good theme and intense at times.  3) Nice production values.
The Bad: 1) This game feels broken.  Dracula should not have 2 step escape routes without being able to pick up his trail.  You can spend 2 hours pinning him down only to have him escape as a bat or use wolf form and suddenly he's on the other side of the map.  Don't even get me started on that teleporter card, that's just ridiculous.  2) The game is waaay to long. 3) I think the comat system is much too complicated for what it is - which is really just rolling one die a piece and seeing who has a higher number.  4) Even if you do manage to find and fight Dracula more than twice in under three hours, you can't hurt him unless you have the right items - but he has a bunch of cards to remove your items.  I think the cards are unbalanced.   Overall: I am dying for a game that utilizes the Hide and Seek/Trail mechanic that plays in 90 minutes or less, but this game gets bogged down in extraneous messy abilities.

RATING: 9
Really very fun both times I've played this in recent times.  The first time we played it, around 2005 when it (the reprint) came out, the hunters were hopelessly lost and the game dragged on with nobody really enjoying themselves.  More recently, with everyone understanding the rules a bit more thoroughly, it was tremendous fun.  It's important to make hunters aware of the few event cards that can drastically change the game before they come up, but the balance between Draculas trail and the hunters works quite well.

The game is rich with dark themeing, simple mechanics, and fun gameplay.  Dracula and the hunters have different play styles, are forced to make difficult decisions, and have different battle tactics.  The flavor text is amazingly well done and adds to the best part of the game, the theme.  Both sides are balanced and each time you play a new character a different element of fun is added.  Great game, excellent game mechanics, fun "guessing" battle system, fun gameplay, and amazing theme.

On a graph, there are many lulls for the hunters with sudden spikes when they encounter Dracula. For Dracula, I imagine the spikes are much more frequent.

Over all, a good game, but not a great one. Theme, components and immersion really help smooth out the faults.

FoD is a title that my gaming group has a lot of memories with.  Some good and tense, some are long and boring.  I believe that playing Big D in this cat and mouse game is quite thrilling and very rewarding if you can outwit the other four players.  However, it is quite unforgiving in the event that you make a mistake as Dracula.  

In the end, I enjoy FoD.  Yet, I have a few complaints.  One, the time is very unpredictable.  It can be super short or mind numbing long.  I feel after several plays the longer the game goes, the better chances Big D has to win.  Second, I feel FoD is slanted heavily in favor of the hunters.  Dracula has won less then five games.  Of course those players who won, carry that win proudly.  I've yet to win... :( :)

I have only played a handful of times, and only as Dracula. I feel like this game will only get limited usage. It's a bit too long and complex to introduce to most of my friends. It is very difficult to win as Dracula, but I have had a lot of fun trying to out smart the hunters. Unfortunately, the best laid plans are almost always ruined by event cards. I guess the real challenge is how to handle things once Dracula is discovered.

It's an ok game to play once in a while. Otherwise it's a tad repetative. The Dracula player rarely has any real chance of winning the game because the game is stacked in the hunter's favour. Will play if I'm in the mood but I wouldn't buy it myself.

An excellent co-op game where a group players work together as vampire hunters to locate and defeat Dracula.  The role of Dracula is take on by a player who works to secretly move Dracula around Europe, fight the players and create additional vampires.  Some excellent mechanics, beautiful artwork this game is hard to find as it is no longer in print however FF Games continues to list it in is catalogue so it may be available as new sometime in the future, until then look for it on ebay.

Long, luck-prone, full of minutiae and card interactions that lead to corner cases. Still, an amazing game experience that distills the mythos of Dracula into a few hours. Its delightful combat mechanism and topological tension keep you interested and engaged. There are strategic considerations to be had, but mostly this is an experiential and tactical affair. An American style game whose strength does not lie in the minis or on card flavor, but on real gaming mechanisms and tension building. Lovely, a classic.

Attempts to update the original game have sterilized a significant portion of the charm. The VP track and the more granular blood damage to Dracula or less thematic and more "Euro". Also, why is player elimination such an evil? Its thematic and, as an eliminated player, I can still watch and enjoy the game. The fact that the stakes are so high (OK, no pun intended...really) is what makes the original game so tense and enjoyable. This one is inferior in game play, but does have much nicer components in the cards/chits.

A lot of good tension and thinking to be had here. I don't like that Dracula feels "weak" in a lot of ways though. I'm not sure how replayable this one will be, but the first play was definitely fun and tense!

RATING: 9
Best with 3 or 5 players since everyone gets the same number of heroes then (two or one, respectively, plus one Dracula player).
You can play with 2 players, but then the whole discussion / planning part for the heroes doesn't take place - and it is part of the fun, too. Especially for the Dracula player...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Somewhat difficult to rate, this is a thematic game, and is clearly based on rules that are home more in the 80's than the aughts, but ultimately it left me with a feeling of "meh."

Most people are probably familiar with the premise: asymmetrical sides: one player is dracula, the others are hunters. The hunters try to corner dracula and kill him in hand to hand, dracula tries to slink around and leave traps for the players.

Now, about the gameplay though, the problem to me, like many older style games, is that there just isn't very much to do on a given turn. A lot of the game for the non-dracula players seems to be driven by walking or taking trains to European locales, and then drawing some cards, some of which are useful to you, some of which go to the drac player. There are occasional flashes of potential excitement, when drac is spotted for instance, but the player characters seem to move agonizingly slowly and it seemed difficult to get the count in spots where you could actually take it to him in combat. Apparently, that is some of the idea of the game, because dracula, while adequate in combat, isn't any great shakes either.

What seems to be left, after all of that, is a game where most of the time players sit around drawing cards and, occasionally, rolling dice. While the board, the cards, and the character design ooze theme, the actual gameplay on this left me bored. It's not a bad design, but there just isn't enough going on to make it very interesting. Frankly, I would rather play multiple games of Clue: The Great Museum Caper in the same time...it's a more fun game that plays in a fraction of the time. It'll also cost you about 1/3 as much on the secondary market, and it has many more meaningful choices per game than this one while still maintaining the best of the game mechanics that this one has to offer.

ok - not much to do in your turn but still fun. I don't believe there's as much 'theme' as some say, and Dracula has too many ways to escape once/if you get on his trail. Still, it's fun working as a team to track down Drac. Nice board and bits. Probably best with 4.

Next to AH's DUNE, this is my favorite game of all time, a perfect mix of proper Hammer-style gothic horror and a compelling mystery game with ample doses of strategy, suspense, and unpredictability.  FFG's version improves many elements of the gameplay, chiefly by employing a few new mechanics to put a little more pressure on Dracula as well as the hunters- overall, there's a greater sense of urgency and the game isn't able to descend into the 4 hour "where the hell is he" turkey shoots the original version could.  It's much more about tracking Dracula rather than finding him, and as a result it seems like there is a lot more opportunities for the hunters to collude and conspire to even the odds in their favor.  The other new elements, such as allies and the card-based movement all work a charm and the cludgy but endearing tables and charts of the original are rendered obsolete.  Mina is a great 5th hunter and her "questionable past" with Dracula makes the cards affecting bitten hunters almost always useful.  Dracula's special abilities are devious and fun or frustrating depending on which side of the fangs you fall.  The art is top notch, although I do miss the old GW style.  There is literally nothing I don't adore about this game.  I could say that I think the "Sense of Emergency" ability is a little too powerful or that Dracula is almost too easy to find in some situations, or that the Catacombs aren't as useful as it seems like they should be, but I could really care less.  This is a game that I love, it's a theme I love, and it's back in print in a beautiful, well-considered version with thoughtful and respectful revisions that maintain the tone and texture of the original while making it modern and exciting even after nearly 20 years.

Maybe I don't get it but I didn't think it was balanced. I'd like to see Dracula have a chance to fight sucessfully at night at least.

I love the idea of the game. The chase to find the Count. My issue is that for a game of hiding, and running, there are too many ways to discover the train of Dracula.

Plus, there are a lot of dull moments for both sides, with all the excitement in the last 30 minutes of play. The first 90 minutes are... just there.

I really, really want to love this game.  But the hunter event cards are too powerful, so it is near impossible for Dracula to hide and fighting=death for Dracula.

Update from years later: I do enjoy this game a lot. I still think that the event cards are super powerful. But if Dracula is good, and I've seen some great Dracula players, the game works.

Not a bad game but a bit too random for my taste. The deduction part is great although I would prefer that some event cards were less powerful and finding Dracula would depend more on player's skill than playing event cards. Unfortunately, the combat is very unsatisfying. If it was less random I would rate the game 8. As it is, only its appearance (design and quality of components) saves it from being rated 6. The game plays best with 2 or 3. The game is more interesting for Dracula player than for others.

March 14, 2008 -- The first play was a two-player game, with me as Dracula and my girlfriend as the hunter. She felt the game was a bit too long, and we both felt it would be improved with even just one more player. I like the hidden movement mechanics of Dracula, and towards the end of the game, it was really cool watching the hunters close in and corner me in Eastern Europe (they finally killed Dracula in Varna). 7/10

I went into this somewhat begrudgingly, becuase I've some to realize that I just don't like 2 things:
1) cooperative games.
2) card-driven games.
That said, I didn't "not like" it as much as I expected. That ability for players to share all their information with each other is like fresh air after games like Shadows Over Camelot. As is the role of Dracula, where he actually gets some meaningful choices, rather than just pretend he's not the bad guy, like in SoC. So, this was one of the less painful games for me in an intersection of genres that I don't care for. So that's probably like an 8 or 9 for people who like those genres.

Played two 4-player games last night. While they were both learning games, they were still completely engaging. This game would seem to hold a lot of promise (in my group, at least)... an immersive theme, lots of strategic choices. I think this one's going to be a real winner!

UPDATE: This has quickly become another group favorite. It's always interesting, always exciting, always fun to play. While I haven't played it with two, it plays VERY well with 3, 4 and 5 players. It's almost always requested when our group numbers 5 or fewer. Each game plays out differently, the options for players' strategies are quite varied, and the sheer number of events that can occur can swing the game wildly to one or another side's favor. And I've never seen so much as a flicker of boredom cross a single player's face in any of the games we've played... which makes me think Fury Of Dracula will be hitting the table often and for a long time to come!

I waffle on this one. On the one hand, I really like the theme and deduction aspects. On the other hand, combat really seems to come down to the roll of a die too often. I'm all for dice, but only when there are enough of them being rolled to average out the chance of crazy results. A couple of games have come down to a few die rolls, and it's somewhat unsatisfying to arrive at the end of a 2-hour game and lose because you rolled a 3 when you needed a 4.

Never played the original, but man, do I enjoy this one! I bought it on reputation alone, and was a little apprehensive after reading the rules, but was totally overwhelmed once we started playing. Change that to once I opened the box.. the pieces are typical FF high quality, and the game just drips theme from its gameplay to the fantastic artwork, right down to the flavour text on the cards.

I appreciate that the Alpha Gamer can be mitigated by making them Dracula.  I enjoy the theme.  This game is fun to play and because it is cooperative, it can be easy to help new people play.  It's a lot of fun and I think well balanced.

RATING: 5
Well, it's a Scotland Yard in upgrade. The game drenched in theme from Bram Stoker's Dracula, but only the environment, not the story. All characters, and everything here is very Draculaic and great. But when you play, the story doesn't really narrate much. It's still interesting in it's own right. The Dracula loves when the hunters are confused, and the Hunters love when the Dracula's cornered. It's a balanced I guess.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Scotland Yard with battles and Vampires, there is nothing more I could ask for. The gothic design of the game pieces is extremely nice. However, playing Dracula is not too easy, because the hunters are well equipped at the end of the game and chances to win battles decrease.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pretty interesting game, where 4 people are trying to capture one vampire. They are hunting him down on a big map of Europe, while he is hiding and trying to grow up his vampire minions. 
The problem I see here - the fight depends on the die too much.

RATING: 6
i've played this about 4x's now and i think like Shadows over Camelot, it's a lot better when are playing as the traitor, or maybe when the traitor/dracula is a good player.

I think it's a bit dry as a hunter, i've played a complete game without one encouter with the count...and it was very boring...

Teaming up to hunt down Dracula is a ton of fun.  I especially like the Day-Night mechanic, where you're trying to pin him down while he's week, and when night falls, the fear of confronting him slows your steps.  Works well even as a 2 player game.

Update of a classic. My one quibble is with the new movement system. Hunters are provided with far too much information when running across the Count's trail and the limitations on Dracula's movement due to card restrictions are thematic nonsense. My issues with this grow as time goes by.

The game fixes the main problems I have with the original, but the problems with secret movement mean I no longer regard this as a better game.

Its a good game, lots of fun.. Its not a great game and I guess the fun is in the thrill of the chase rather than the battles..  My wife loves it so its mission accomplished from that perspective.

The one thing that I don't like about it is that it drags on.. the hunter can seem to have Dracula cornered and then he wolf forms his way out.  In fact this happened during a monster 4 hour play through and my friends swore to never play it ever again..

Which is a shame.

Could be a great game with a dedicated group of enthusiasts. Would play quicker and the eluding part of the game would really shine.  But I don't have a group that only wants to play FoD.

RATING: 6
Liked it a lot. Unfortunately its ruleset is chock full of minor details you have to really memorize it to play a mean Dracula. So far, the only player who studied the ruleset is able to play Dracula and this is a limit to the game at the moment. A game can become way too long as a side effect for the cards...
EDIT: after leaving the game and playing it again after a few years, I found the fighting part totally wrong. It totally dismisses the game for me, so much I turned down my judge.
It cannot be that after 3 hours of chasing down Dracula you can win or lose the game with a single roll of dice. Game will not be played evermore.

I really wanted to like this game, especially cause I'm a fan of Dracula and Scotland yard but after 4 games (4 people) I discovered there's not much going on during the average 3 hour play. 
Playing as the hunters involves very few choices, move or draw a card basically. Usually ther's a hunter thats never going to be involved for large portions of the game, which means somebody's not having fun.
In fact the only one who's enjoying the game is the Dracula player that in our experience has won every single time with 4 different users.

Great deduction game; thematically strong;  hidden movement offers a special tension during the whole game which is not equalized by other sort of games for me; tension in particular for the Drac player, but also for the hunters; little downtime and good replayability; combat aid is absolutely necessary and should have been provided with the game

Fury of Dracula is a nice game but it has a big problem in that playing Dracula is infinitely more interesting than playing a hunter. This is especially true if you only have one hunter to control.

I really love the theme and overall mechanics of Fury of Dracula.  The hidden movement for Dracula and guesswork plus process of elimination for the hunters makes for a very good time.

RATING: 6
7.5 This is could be the top performer for the coop genre. 

Compared to Shadows over camelot it is more complicated, but also much more rewarding. 
Compared to Descent I would say it is more satisfying for the amount of time spent (ratio). 

The component quality is first rate and there are many game systems. 

I'm not giving it a higher rating becuase of the following: the rules are overcomplicated, though they do provide depth. There are errors in a couple of the big combat cards (see errata), this should have been caught, or covered in an expansion upgrade or fixup pack. The combat system needs a playmat to help players understand flow. The combat system is over designed with something like 166 possible outcomes, making it a hard system to learn -- normally this much choice would be a good thing, but there is a heavy luck element layered overtop the choice array, which marginalizes intentionality too much. 40 + dice would have done fine. 

Play enjoyment definetly improves with experience as you figure out what the rules really mean and are able to play with more intent. I would definetly buy any expansion pack if one came out.

RATING: 8.5
Love love love this game! The fun of being Dracula and sneaking around, leaving traps for the hunts, is unmatched. But the game is equally fun for the hunters, tracking Dracula down, surrounding him, and staking him in the daylight! The cards add plenty of flavor and just the right amount of random chance. 

The only thing that keeps this from being a 10 is that it can take a long time to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A really interesting deduction game of "hunter-and-prey" style with lots of nasty surprises, tension and very special atmosphere. Here one player, tricky Count Dracula acts against all other players who are called The Hunters. Hunters cooperate with each other, discuss their plans and make their guesses, but The Evil always is nearby. It sits at the other side of the table, listens very carefully and secretly makes its insidious move, which will ruin this nice strategy built by the hunters a minute ago.

Usually people who didn't have good experience with this game say, that it relies too much on a dice throw. They say, that Dracula sometimes is easily killed when he has not luck with the dices. That's true, but the dices become that important only when direct conflict with Dracula occurs. And that is something that should be avoided by all means. The game is much more about seeking and hunting then about kicking, shooting and staking.

Flavourful game, great production.
Should be named "Chasing Dracula: The seedind", since the powerful Prince of the night spends most of its time trying to escape from their enemies, while leaving a track of creatures and succubi.

Thousand of cards and rules, several dice roll: here you have a typical FF production (even though this is a remake of an older game).

I can enjoy playing it from time to time, since I am a fan of the novel.

This is an intriguing game that for several reasons (unfamiliarity with the rules, extreme lack of sleep on my part, extreme AP on another player's part) fell rather flat.  I really liked the hidden movement of Dracula - in fact, that was the neatest feature of the game.  Most of the encounters seemed rather weak, and we as the Hunters got so many event cards that we had all the cards in Dracula's Trail except for his actual location visible for most of the game.  We had to quit before we actually finished - my lack of sleep finally catching up with me - so I haven't played a full game yet.  But what I saw left me a little disappointed.  What has the potential to be a great game just doesn't deliver, at least for me.

The design of this game is definitely baroque in its complexity, but it doesn't dampen the enjoyment.  Hunting and fleeing are both roles fraught with uncertainty due to the effects of the Event cards and Encounters.  The only flaw with the game is its length, which runs much longer than advertised.  I've rarely finished in under 4 hours.

Played this new version just 1 time.  We had to quit our game in progress.  We had played for a couple of hours right when Dracula slipped through our grasp.  This was basically a game reset and it was like starting the game all over.  This was too disheartening to continue.  However, this game does a good job of fixing some of the flaws in the original.  The most memorable fix was the new way day/night selection is handled.  You now know going into battle whether it will be fought in daytime or nightime.

RATING: 6
A remake of the very good Games Workshop game of the mid 80's.  Dracula (of the novel, not the movies) romps around Europe on a hidden map, trying to raise a tribe of Vampires, while the (now) four hunter players try to stop ol' toothy.  Early days with the new one, but lots has changed.  Dracula now has a sliding track of the last six locations visited, and vampires are now "matured" when they slide off the track (i.e. they have to survive six turns on the board to count).  There are now four hunters, instead of the original three - the fragile Mina appears.  This makes the board appear very small to Dracula, however his paper trail of encounters has shrunk as well, and can shrink further if he sires a vampire.  Other new rules are Ally cards that help both sides, Catacombs to store encounters that have moved off the track, special power cards for both sides.  Missing rules are the messy blood death/castle Dracula endgame, hunters becoming vampires, and the instant kill with a stake.  Dracula isn't killed instantly with a stake anymore - rather he's worn down.  All these changes appear to help quicken the playing time, ramp up the interaction, and break the rather boring cycle of Newspaper Reports/Evasion of the original game.  I was initially worried by the changes, having logged around 40  games of the 1986 version, but it appears to work while keeping the excellent atmosphere of the original.

RATING: 5
Played this game with high expectations at BGG.con 2014. Results: We had fun but I don't know why this game is so highly regarded, let alone sitting in the top 500. 

For one thing the combat is needlessly complex and paradoxically too simple. If you have all these special cards and abilities, why does it come down to a simple 1v1 toss of a d6? 

For another thing, the game already has a pretty long run time and there are cards that just frustrate everyone. Like letting Dracula jump to any spot on the map. As Dracula, I drew this card and decided against using it. It's basically an "add one hour of gameplay" card! And there are others that strip the players of their hard-won items and so forth. 

As a huge fan of Dracula and gothic horror, I just felt let down after hearing so many good things about Fury. If you aren't sold on the theme, I'd say just go get Whitechapel - it'll save you about 150 bucks and many hours. 

That said, if FFG decides to update and re-release this game, I think there's a big chance for an improvement.

Like an upgraded Scotland Yard, this game has you chasing Dracula, whose moves are secret to the vampire hunters.  This game is really quite a fantastic deductive affair for the hunters, who really need to work together to acheive their goal.  For Dracula, it's usually a tense, exciting fiasco where you question every move and often have to be very creative to extract yourself from sticky situations.  Both sides feel quite satisfied when they win, and hungry for another when they lose.  If you're able to sit through a 2-3 hour game this is definitely one worth checking out.

Excellent integration of the theme, but the game is perhaps a bit long for such a simple design, which is basically move and draw a card.   Good combat system which is similar to Dungeonquest but with dice rolling and a few other colorful elements.   Unlike any other games I own, and I can appreciate it for that.

The new version seems like the way to go, though the old GW Drac will always have a certain nostalgic charm for me especially the art although the new art is much slicker and more professionally executed. The rules seem to be generally improved, most importantly in the new way day and night are handled. Highly recommended

This is a fantastic game that I wish I had a consistent group to play with because this game really shines once people know what they are doing and how to be effective in the game. It doesn't take long to get there but over the years my group has cycled and that also means games cycle a lot.

Combat is decidedly lame.

Too many meaningless movements, though this can be improved with better play from the hunters. Even so, still takes too long for what it is (to catch up to the dracula).

Very nice and tense game, that needs to be played with the right people. It can be frustrating for the hunters at some point. Combat system is, imo, its weak spot (long and sometimes tedious)

This seems to be a hidden movement game done right. No damn book keeping.

Very similar to Scotland Yard, more advance rules. Similar atmosphere to Arkham Horror and Betrayal at House on the Hill.

Wonder about balance issues. Dracula has powerful cards. He is tough to beat. Would not mind playing it again. Just not sure if it would be something I would buy for myself. A little boring. It a good game, but not for every group. Not my kind of game.

RATING: 4
Based on one play. I found this fun at the outset but increasingly tedious. Limited player interaction made for serious downtime issues. Even when we knew where Dracula had gone, it took us 4-5 turns to catch up with him (he had magically teleported across the continent!). Combat was a less-fun version of rock-paper-scissors (plus dice). Not balanced, but needlessly complicated, random and frustrating. After four hours, it didn't matter who won, we all just wanted it to end.

Superb!  Oh man, such a great game.  This was one of the first expensive board games I ever bought myself (griping at Dad to buy me Axis & Allies 15 years ago doesn't count).  The theme is great, I love the asymmetry of the setup, and the rules generally work really well together.  A few kludgy and unclear cards keep this from being flawless, but overall I wish I had time to play this more often.

Adore this game - we have had so many evenings of immersive and tense gameplay - trying to run Dracula down only for him to escape to sea or to the east or down to Italy - who knows?

I think this game was introduced to me before I was ready to play something so complex.  I have bitter memories of our Dracula springing powers that I didn't recall him having just as we would get close to capturing; my partner and I were simply unable to keep up with all the rules.  If anything, it taught me the important of lesson of making sure your audience is ready for the game you wish to teach.

One of my favorites. I like what Fantasy Flight has done with the game, for the most part. The one thing I am still iffy on is the visible trail that dracula leaves on the game board. With the older version, it seemed to me that Drac was always slipping away, with the visual clues right at hand, it feels that Drac is under much more pressure to elude.

Have only played once. Loved the look of the game and the gameplay reminds me of Letters from Whitechapel with loads of chrome and flavour on top of it. And it works. The only thing I didn't like was a card that allowed Dracula to move to another side of the board when you have worked hard to corner him. I think I'd play without it. because it practically resets the came when it can be way too late. Aside from that, this will be in my collection sooner or later. I just know it :)

The major detractor is a very dull combat/item system.  The fact that it's best with 5 is also bothersome because I never want to contol more than one hunter.  I do like the whole multiple people vs one aspect of it and the trail mechanic is fantastic, but I rarely enjoy playing this one unless I get to play as Dracula.  I personally wouldn't suggest this one but it frequently gets requested in my gaming group, so it may be worth looking into.

RATING: 8
Probably the best Dracula-themed game out there - it has everything for fans of classic Vampire novels...and more. The "Scotland Yard" mechanic is a bit ruined by random events though - the hunters might have ensnared ol' Drac only to have him vanish to ANY space on the board. But regarding theme and feel this can not be beaten.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played the game and had good reviews from friends. And found it interesting to start with - but as we kept tracking down Dracula (we were constantly on his tail) we found it was nearly impossible to actually catch him - no way to really get ahead - and then when you finally get him, you lose all your items and events and get killed? Then it takes ages to get back and pick up items on the way... It looks good and the start plays well but all fights come down to the diceroll. In our game we lost, but with 6 health, we could have killed Dracula - all down to the final 4 dice rolls all missing so we died instead of him. Everyone agreed it was a bit of an anticlimax!

Decision-making is similar to what you get in Scotland Yard. The richness in decision-making from the deduction-aspect of the game gives this a lot more legs compared to, say, Descent, which is just kill, kill, kill. However, FoD takes what's good about SY and overloads it with stuff that doesn't fit together. For example, the combat system is just tedious and can be a total waste of time, with dice-rolling back-and-forth for no results.

Loooong but very engaging. Great components. We've only played 2 player, and if you're the one playing all 4 hunters it's a bit of a pain keeping track of every card held by every character.

De este juego viene mi nickname. Fue el primer juego que jugué con algunos amigos, una noche memorable. Jugamos disfrazados, yo de Dracula y los demás de cazadores... Por eso tiene un 10. Me estudié las reglas durante muchos días, no entendía nada (es un juego con muchas reglas para alguien que empieza sin ayuda de nadie)... era el 2008. Cuantos recuerdos...
Empecé así a conocer este mundillo, que peró retomé solo después de 4 años. Solo por eso tiene un 10, no por las mecánicas del juego en sí.

Excellent coop game, with lots of theme... Easy to get into it, and many different ways to win for both the Hunters and Dracula. It's fun to see the Hunters discussing to figure out where Dracula is. Not so much downtime due to the fact that you always are busy with other Hunters to track down Dracula, and Dracula is planning during the Hunters turn his next move. The first play will be hard to get in to it, but the second and further on you will love the game and want to play another time and then you realise that it is past over Midnight in the real world.

Whitechapel pretty much fired this game from my collection. While there are some admirable aspects to it (I quite like the way cards are drawn in a push-your-luck manner) and the theme is rendered quite well, there's too much useless hidden movement and deduction due to too many cards that reveal Dracula's whereabouts. 

If Whitechapel didn't exist, I'd make a variant to remove most if not all of those cards and force the hunters to expend Resolve to reveal a location card. As it is, the board is just too small to hide for very long, and the way location cards are revealed removes way too much of the deduction element for me. It's not uncommon for most of Dracula's movements to be revealed or easily deduced from other revealed cards. I found it frustrating to make a clever move only to have the hunters play a card to have me reveal myself. Why play a deduction game then?

Otherwise, I find the game reasonably balanced and the combat doesn't bother me like it bothers some (hey, combat is iffy; proceed at your own risk). But if I want to play a deduction game and match wits, I'd much prefer Whitechapel.

This atmospheric murdery deduction game is best played by candlelight when a storm takes out the electricity.

Dracula's trail of map location cards is well implemented and is one of my favorite game mechanics.  The card driven combat system, on the other hand, seems overwrought, repetitive, tedious, and unnecessarily time-consuming.  Because combat is so "swingy," even sound strategies often end unpredictably and abruptly which can make the conclusion unsatisfying.  Nevertheless, the game of cat and mouse leading up to that conclusion is always a good time. 

In my experience, this game is heavily weighted in favor of Dracula and the hunters have a very slim chance of winning unless Dracula is assigned some form of handicap.

neat scotland yard variant, more player interaction, but also the inclusion of dice - which actually works with the theme, as it adds tension to the outcome of encounters that isn't present in scotland yard.

RATING: 8
Be prepared for a long play for the first game, though the speed of play improves with familiarity with the cards, and there are a lot in FoD.  In fact, it really helps to have at least two people who know the game, one to play dracula and the other to play one of the hunters and coach the other hunters.

Also, this game seems to bog down and become mundane for the hunters until they find Dracula's trail.  But when they do, it becomes a tense cat and mouse experience of evasion and deduction.

Overall, this is a great game, very immersive and atmospheric, and especially fun for all as the hunters do finally close in on the count.

Based on 3 plays:
+ Theme and graphical design are well executed
+ Night-cards allow unexpected tactics for Dracula
- "Sense of Emergency" works as a reset button. What an anti-climax!
- Battle is essentially rock, paper, scissors, but I think they should have done a better job on it. Stalemate battles are not interesting.
- One cannot easily distinguish grey miniatures from sitting distance. I painted a set of figures for my friend.

RATING: 8
The single most thematic board game I have ever played. It simulates the main concept of Bram Stoker's novel perfectly: a dark core of hidden evil which manifests infrequently and indirectly. This game could be considered a dungeon crawler, where Europe is the dungeon, cities are rooms and Dracula's traps are the encounters. The difference is that the dungeon master in somewhere on the map, both as prey and boss monster. The production is what you would expect from FFG, gothic eye-candy. But the gameplay is marred by another thing I came to expect from FFG: a clunky card-driven combat system. It is counterintuitive and slows the already long game a lot, diminishing the goodwill of potential players. The game begs for a streamlined combat system, maybe with specialized dice. It would subtract one hour from expected play time and bring this game to a 10 on my list.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played 1 time with 3 players. A rating for 4 may seem a bit harsh, and even I admit that it is surprisingly low. I don't feel that it should be a 4, but let me a bit more. The Good: it has nice components, lots of really neat ideas in the mechanics (Dracula's trail, combat system, encounter chips with smaller battles), and great theme. The Bad: it is really long, and the end seems sort of anti-climactic. If Scotland Yard didn't exist, I might not have minded so much, but Scotland Yard provides the tension of the hunt without all the slow and frustrating parts (the search for a lost trail, the Evasion card). I like the extra mechanics in FoD, but don't feel they add enough enjoyment to the game to make it worth a 3 hour investment. I like the game, but would prefer to play 1 game of Scotland Yard followed by two other games, than the 1 game of FoD that the same block of time would provide. Which means I don't want to play it often. Which means it must be a 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
This Scotland Yard on steroids.  Interesting combat--not similar to anything I've played.  I wouldn't want to play with less than 5.  

This isn't listed as a co-op but to me when there are 5 players, it is.  True it is 1 player (Dracula) againt the rest instead of players against the game, but the opponents of Dracula work together.  If you are playing a 2-player version, there of course it would not be co-op.

One thing I have read often in the comments is that for a lot of games, the theme seems pasted on.  If there is a game where the theme is blended perfectly with the mechanics and the play of the game, this is certainly it.  The growing frustration with which the hunters must scurry around is tangible; the ephemerous omnipotence of the Count soon transforms into a delicate form of sacrifice to nudge forward; the scope and travel through Europe ressembles a wicked treasure hunt against time.  Great great game.  The options are plentiful for the Count but he must be careful not to come out in the sun to often.  Fight seldom and never in the day against a well-stocked hunter.  The call of the sea can be alluring but be warned that Storms do happen and sometimes in the worst of times.  Exquisite suspense.

RATING: 9
Strong theme and easy to learn, with a high amount of interactivity (among the hunters, anyway) and a great sense of drama and narrative. Works well as a long 2-player game, if the Hunter player doesn't mind keeping track of 4 different hands of cards. Still, naturally, the more the merrier. In 4-player games, we've started putting the 4th Hunter (usually Van Helsing) under joint control of all the players, which seems easier than sticking one player with two. (Actually, this is a great game for two couples to play.)

The variety of event cards, item cards and encounters makes the replay value quite high.  The amount of detail and flavor in the cards and encounters really heighten the game's atmosphere, the same way that the little details in a book or movie make it more believable.

This is a pretty fiddly game, especially in combat. Still, it's easy to grasp for newer gamers, especially in contrast to Arkham Horror, Battlestar Galactica and some of FFG's other narrative-driven games. Just put them on the Hunter team, give them Seward or Van Helsing, and they'll be in good shape.

I love this game because of the theme and how well the play ties to it. They are well coupled, which may be a turn off for some people, who just aren't into this theme.  For me, Bram Stoker's novel is a classic, so it's a hot game for me, but just above luke warm for the rest of the game group.

Another reason I don't get to play it enough is the length, which somewhat varies with the card and chit draws.  Our group always plays a little slow; nonetheless we can easily see four hours with this.  Allow time, but have a filler ready in case it runs short!

Unbelievably awesome. Moreso than any other game I own, this game sucks you in. The atmosphere and experience are so engrossing that my enjoyment is probably the same whether I win or lose. It took 4 or 5 playings of this game to get to the point where I can appreciate it, but now I adore it. The only reason this game is not a 10 is because of the combat system. It's not horrid, but it's definitely the weakest point of the game.

I guess that a ranking of a game like this depends completely of the side from where the vote is made… I only have played this one being the Count, so my rate is based on a biased experience of the game.  Even though, I can assure this: carrying the Count around the ancient Europe is one of the funniest things you can do in a game. Why? Because Dracula’s movement is done in secret, using brilliant mechanics, perfidious tricks and unscrupulous powers that can be used to confuse the mind of all the hunters… Doing well his job, the player who drives the Count could drive his seekers, step by step, to an exhaustive sensation of lost and doom… (!)

Sok körülményes apró szabály, pláne ahhoz képest, hogy alapjaiban milyen pofonegyszerű lenne a játékmenet. Számomra hosszú játékidő.

A maradékban van csak valami bonyodalom csata, ami azért 3-4 órában kicsit uncsivá tud válni.
Kéne vele még gyorsan játszani egyet addig, amíg nem felejtjük el a szabályokat.

RATING: 7
A cat and mouse game where Dracula must hide from the rest of the players and sometimes attack one of them to get points. In the meantime, he leaves along the way some of his followers to make things harder for the hunters. These ones must do teamwork based on deduction to know where Dracula can be, to attack and kill him. 

Lots of cards, reactions, unpredicatable twists, Ameritrash-like. Life points, weapons, combats... 

This game can be tense but on the other hand some people may find it boring in case hunters don't find Dracula. I've always played Dracula and enjoyed all the games. Hunters in my games usually have liked it too. 

Game can be long, though, 3 hours or more...

Rules issues prevalent (easy to get into a position where no legal moves are available).

Combat very rock, paper, scissors; combat outcome often determined by the initial cards the players hold.

Core mechanics when searching the board for Dracula are great (for both sides) but the combat holds it back.

Would like to play it again some time but difficult to justify it above other games.

Received in trade 03/21/06


Will do a session report on this, but had a disappointing first play.  I had a blast...as Dracula.  Hunters indicated they were bored, even though they were hot on my trail at game's end and actually won after a long chase.  Game took 4 hours, longer han expected.

Rating is an average...as Drac, I give it a 7 with potential.  Theirs would be more like a 5.  I will give this another go as a hunter next time to see if the criticisms hold up.


UPDATE:  You know what?  Screw it.  The ratings system at BGG doesn't say "How willing is your group to play this?" but how *I* feel about the game.  I would have played it again right away if I could have.

If my turn as a hunter turns out badly, then I'll re-evaluate.  But playing Dracula is the most fun I've had playing a board game in recent memory.  Up from 6 to 8.

RATING: 7.5
Great theme, you really feel like you're hunting this ageless threat. THe mechanics are nice, especially the hidden progression and the monsters Dracula leaves behind. I think the combat system is a little fiddly, slows the game down and actually breaks the tension a little bit, so that's a weakish point, but the overall experience is great, not too complex and not too long, so it's feasible to bring in new players (especially thanks to the coop aspect). Definitely a good game.

RATING: 8
This is a great 5 player game. On the cuteness meter it would be a 10, but as an old wargamer I'd prefer the sides to be a bit more asymmetrical. Perhaps, the Count could have been given a + 1 DRM at Midnight and the hunter's a + 1 DRM at High Noon. The game is also unbalanced, but that's not usually the game breaker you would think because which side should win isn't consistent. Namely, the game lasts a maximum of 6 "days", if it goes 5 or 6 days the Count is toast, if it goes 2 or 3 days he has a great chance to win. An experienced and clever Count can win by using all his powers as often as possible, using dark call early to maximize his powerful encounters, attacking Mina and being devious. For example, he could force the occasional hunter toward his hidden location, or use wolf form to change directions or he could stay at sea at night to give a new vampire about to mature a fighting chance if discovered. His possibilities are endless, but he has to use them all to win. 
  What can spoil the game is the untimely appearance of the "Evasion" card. Every once in a while this card will show up just as all four hunters have cornered the Count. Once he teleports, the hunters are dead. They have no idea where he is, it's near the end of the game and even if they can figure out where he's gone it will take them forever to get there. And even then he's had more than enough time to bolt from there anyway. 

All in all, an entertaining game most of the time.

A very enjoyable, thematic game. Though it is definately misnamed. it should be the Flight of Dracula. I never played the original so I cant compare but there is no fury to dracula in this game. quite a tense struggle for dracula to stay out of trouble with the hunters. Playing as dracula definately has a "whole world out to get me" feel to it. Though I did win once as dracula by taking mina out in a major battle.

Fun game, good teamwork atmosphere.  Nice cards and the board is very nice to look at. 

I think it's more fun to play as a hunter than Dracula because of the co-operative aspect.  However, it's a hell of a challenge to play as Dracula and actually last long enough to win.  It's quite satisfying to win as Dracula and get out of tight jams with clever evasion tactics. 

I feel like a dumbass because I've now messed up twice while playing as Dracula by making an (accidental) illegal move.

[b][i]Fury of Dracula[/i][/b] is a deduction game set 8 years after Bram Stoker's story, but with the same characters. Thematic gameplay is effected by the story and fantastic components, particularly the game board. This game is strategical. Finding and cornering Dracula requires planning--Dracula is a slippery beast. It's exciting for both sides to have the investigators think they're closing in on Dracula only to discover he's slipped their net. Moments such as this make a fun and memorable game.

Some of the abilities seem overly powerful and so I'd recommend exploring a few of the variants listed in the Files page after you've tried the base game a few times. The box says 2--5 players, but I think it shines with 2 or, best of all, 3.

Another game that I wish I can play more of, I have never manage four people to get a full team and it takes a real boardgame geek to control two characters or more in any game, so this doesn't get played as much as I like.  It is a good game with a fog-of-war that keeps the hunters guessing, its fun to be the vampire eluding the hunters and causing frustration in your fellow man.  The board is beautiful and the game mechanics really work.  Recommended if you and your friends like the theme.

If it wasn't for the theme the game wouldn't even be worth mentioning. But when you play it you feel as you were chasing Dracula in real.

The components are a nice update from the original game, but I don't think it is any better.  The FF rules are typically nice looking but not easy to use as a reference while playing the game.  There are some changes to how the game plays, but really, I don't see any improvement.  If you own the original, you don't need the update I think.  If you don't have the original this game is worth checking out.  Like the original, this game can drag.  The original is more tense on the whole.

RATING: 5.5
A thematic remake of Scotland Yard.  Using four hunters you track Dracula across Europe trying to kill him before he survives long enough to raise new mininions or kills enough hunters.  Unlike Scotland Yard, Fury adds in additional luck elements such as event cards that can be good or bad, as well as item cards for hunters to use.  In Scotland Yard you just have to find the bad guy, in Fury of Dracula you have to find and kill him before being killed. This game just has a bit too much "chrome" for me.  It focuses a little bit too much about telling a story than being the deduction game that is its heart.  If you have people who are into the Dracula theme and like detective games then this would be a good choice, but for more pure Euro players then Scotland Yard is a better pick.

As long as the person playing Dracula does not spend the game simply running away from the Hunters and makes an effort ot be agressive as well as evasive, the game is excellent. Otherwise it can become a little tiresome. Not at all fun with two players - needs at least 3 (ideally 5) to be worth playing.

More complex that other hidden identity games like Scotland Yard or Letters from Whitechaple, this game contains a LOT OF GAME. There is so much going on. Aside from being a busy affair, it drips the Dracula theme like blood from a fang.
Someone gets the lucky task of playing the infamous Count from Bram Stoker's fiction, and sneaks around Europe trying to start a new race of super, sexy vampires or possibly the next generation of salon hair stylist. The rest of the players take on the role of adversaries called "hunters" and/or "Lunch" who find clues to the spawn of Satan's whereabouts and ultimately encounter Dracula or his minions in bloody combat. It will take a few play-throughs to get the grasp of the rules and mechanics, but once you're past that, this game is a real nail-biter of tension as every choice leads you closer to victory or defeat.
If you love Gothic games, and you're planning on throwing a killer game-themed Halloween party, try to track it down. If nothing else, set it up on your living room table and watch people drool as they pass by.

Only played once, fell in love with it.
Smart design as if there is a bias in favour of Dracula or the Hunters, you can always give advantage to one them.
So expert players may play alongside newbies and the outcome will never be certain.

The game develops in a crescendo as the Dracula player advances in his morbid goals.
A must for anyone who likes the genre.

*** UPDATE ***
I have nearly 6-7 games under my belt now as Dracula (hope to play as a Hunter soon), I lost only once but every time victories were more difficult to achieve. In my last game I lost with Dracula killed in Rome's dusk. What an epic game it has been! Dirty tricks were the rule on both sides... this is a wonderful, devilish piece of a game.

*** UPDATE ***
Now I have 20 or so games under my belt. The game's still a refreshing experience!

*** UPDATE ***
Ok I've played this game A LOT, maybe too much. Some things don't come into place: combat for instance is a little too random for me - even if weapon choices really affect combat, but you need to have the game to study it, most people don't have it and cannot bother to read the strategy guides. VERY STEEP learning curve! You end up never having skilled adversaries especially if the Dracula player is YOU.
I'll give it a "9" now.

*** UPDATE ***
I got tired of this game. For some reason no matter if I win or lose I feel empty and bare after this game.
I feel tired and in a bad mood, not satisfied as I should be after a fun session.
For instance: "In the Shadow of the Emperor" I play quite often but after play I'm amused and happy of the experience I had. Not for FoD.
I'll give it a "7" which is a great deal away from the "9" I gave it at first.

If I had a regular group of "heavy" gamers to play this with (plus a babysitter for our 19 month old), I think it would be one of my favorites.  However, most of the time, it's just me and my wife.  While it is playable and fun with two, the person controlling 4 hunters is a bit overwhelmed with all of the equipment to keep track of.  There are LOTS of cardboard bits and several different types of cards, so the game is very fiddly.  

I really really want to like this game because I LOVE the secret movement and Dracula hunting aspect of the game.  It's so exciting to stumble across Dracula's trail and deal with whatever traps he has left for you.  However, the combination of needy toddler, 2 players most of the time, and relative depth of the game (tried it once with friends but they didn't like it much) brings me to rate this 6.5.  

I really want to like this game, but if we do not find another couple of "heavy" gamers soon, it is going to be traded or sold to make room for others.

A really fun 1 vs. Many deduction game. The theme is fantastic and I love the ability to use event cards and special items/abilities in a deduction game - it really helps to make things a little less predictable and more exciting. I also really like the way you can manipulate Dracula's trail with cardplay in order to prevent encounters from maturing (or if you're Dracula, clear your trail in order to effectively disappear).

RATING: 7
Fun game - one against many is a nice change from other games.  The theme of the game is used with good effect.

While you can play with any number of hunter players (1-4); Dracula will have the hardest time against all 4 as playing multiple hunters makes it more difficult to remember all of the spots you have been.

In some ways, this game is almost like an RPG with Dracula as the GM.  Given a smart group of hunters, I think Dracula has some long odds, but maybe it is more about making a challenge for the hunters, rather than 'winning'.

Not perfect, as the game is bit long if Dracula goes the distance.  I can see the hunters start to get bored when Dracula is doing well.  There is also alot of luck; while the event card luck can be managed, the combat dice luck can be a problem.

rating is '8' as dracula, '7' as a hunter.

RATING: 2.5
What a horrible mess! Fiddly and extremely random trash. Get the deductive gameplay from "Scotland Yard" and render it useless with dice rolls, a confusing combat system and ridiculously powerful cards (with a lot of text, too). Build your equipment across several turns and Dracula plays a card that forces you to discard everything. Corner Dracula and he plays another card to teleport away. Boring and frustrating. The only qualities are the theme, which is implemented well, and the card artwork. The plastic miniatures would be better if they were not all gray.

I have both and have played the original 1987 game lots of times. This we think is an improvement on it. Must be good!

The tension is incredible when the group pins Dracula down...will he escape? Same for Dracula. When he is close to winning it's a real tense moment to keep away from the hunters. 

Well worth it.

One of my tri-factor hidden movement games. For me FoD is best 3-5 players. I happy as Dracula or a Hunter and love the meta between everyone. I've yet to have a boring game and each one seems to bring a new situation and enjoyment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Good game of cat-and-mouse. Best with 3 or more. Very thematic. There are times when FoD can be a boring game but mostly it's very suspensful. 

After another frustrating play, I lowered my rating by .5 points. The game is a lot about the dice. The winner is the person who rolls the best. 

Edit: Another anti-climactic game causes me to lower the rating. There are too many opportunities for frustrating plays.

For me this is more a 2- or 3-player-game, as it doesn't hold enough activity for more.
My expectation of the play experience was not exactly met (I wanted "search" and I got "chase"), but I do like the game and will definitely play it some more.
A good "number-filler" game when you happen to end up with 8 or 9 people on your gaming night as it is scalable from 2-5 players.

Gave it as a gift to a gaming buddy who really loves the game. It's now in better hands, and I can still play when I want to :-)

RATING: 8.5
It is the theme that does it.  I get wrapped in atomsphere.  Like, battlecry, if I can "feel" emotion (ie. I get scared or excited) then I tend to raise the rating.  The mechinic are ok, but I am not after a "balanced" game.  This game gets the blood going.....  A big game of hide and seek with a haunting impact.

The first game I played of it, I was privately ashamed of my woosey style of play.  I was too scared to take on the big guy and I was the strongest out of the characters.  Hit and Run.

The second lesson I learned is to make sure you "clean" up his trail.  You don't want a vampire to mature.

Lots of fiddly bits, too much of the fantasy flight touch perhaps.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This rating is after one game, and it stays where the preliminary rating was. The game has the potential to go even higher if the hunters manage to find Dracula easier - at the time being, there appear to be tons and tons of options for Dracula for slipping away, while the hunters are somewhat limited in their chase.

Particularly the start of the game indeed had this slow start issue that some reviews pointed out: The hunters stumbled around a bit, gathering weapons and waiting for Dracula to show up, and he just didn't.

Of course this might all change when the hunters (aka my wife) have some more experience, and maybe we got a rule or two wrong as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun game that is heavy with theme. The four hunters from Bram Stoker's novel pursue Dracula across Europe, hoping to destroy him once and for all. 

Gameplay is quick and each turn passes swiftly. At the same time, there are decisions to be made and you may need to use some logic and guesswork to pinpoint Dracula's location. 

As time goes by, you really start to feel the pressure build to the climax. Will Dracula infest all of Europe? Or will the courageous heroes vanquish him and his cursed spawn? Only you can decide!

This game generates a vivid story that explores Dracula’s complexity. He is a predator who feeds off humans and who can command terrifying power. But he is also completely dependent on and vulnerable to humanity. He is weak during the day. To spawn new vampires, he needs to plant them somewhere difficult to find, where they lie completely vulnerable. As hunters track the spawn, Dracula is often faced with the choice of making himself bait so as to distract the hunters. He needs to lure the hunters away from the spawn, but at the same time he needs to watch out that he doesn’t get killed. Sometimes Dracula can weary of running, and decide to take a stand and bring the story to its decisive moment. Sometimes the only way for his bride to mature is for him to run. 

The hunters fight the clock to catch Dracula and his spawn. They can wield great powers that limit what Dracula can do, that make certain options too costly for Dracula to pursue. They can find him out by tracking but also with the help of allies and rumours. But he can be anywhere, and sometimes when he is about to be caught, he slips away. Sometimes when he is nowhere to be found, he is revealed. When hunters close in, they must move as fast as they can before Dracula escapes, but they must also uncover any sleeping brides waiting to mature into vampires. When hunters are weak, they can team up and become formidable, but this limits their ability to search new places. 

***

What a fantastic game. I like pressing my luck with Dracula: circling close to lay traps, tempting hunters to keep chasing me instead of resting, attacking at nightfall.

I completely disagree wtih complaints that this game is complex. The rules are VERY simple and straightforward. 

Extremely vivid atmosphere. Games can be very tense.

This is a fun "one against many" game. After playing a few times, most of the time as Dracula, I still have fun.

Dracula is very week at day, specially if hunters have lots of weapons. For that reason I thought the only strategy for him was to run all the time. But sometimes it is helpful to actually attack hunters, specially at night.

I do not like that the trail can be found very easy. With only 1 card revealed, hunters have lots of information.

It is hard for Dracula to win, but it can be done.

The only problem - and major complaint I have with this game - is that you've got to know the deck well to enjoy it.
This could have been circumvented by a page of strategy/tactic hints.
I like it, but now that most of my fellow players have been discouraged, I will not play it often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A refreshing coop game, where 4 players try to track down and kill Dracula.  The Dracula player has a deck of cards which s/he uses to move secretly about the board, while at the same time setting up encounters/traps for the other players.  Dracula's objective is to "mature" vampires and stay alive long enough to accumulate 6 Vampire points.  Everyone else tries to prevent this from happening.

The move/action sequence plays really fast, and there is no down time unless there is combat.  Once combat starts, it can be somewhat tedious if you don't have the right item(s), so it may be best to run to fight another day.  The combat system is "blow-by-blow", which makes it last a little longer, but it's entertaining to watch, initially anyways.

If you like "Mr. X" or "Scotland Yard" type games, this one comes highly recommended.

My copy did have one unfortunate problem; the counter sheet was not punched thoroughly, thus most of the encounter tokens where damaged when we tried to punch them out.  We even tried using an xacto, but that didn't help.  :(

I wrote to FFG and they promptly sent me a replacement flat!  Excellent customer service!!

Own and have played both versions.  After several plays and reflection, I think I prefer the Fantasy Flight edition.  The balance between hunters and Dracula seems better and there's more conflict to keep the game interesting.  We like to add atmosphere with organ music, candles, and a thunderstorm, if we can arrange one.  Best played with the full compliment of players; four hunters are too much for one person to handle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game is incredible beautiful & the most thematic game i've ever had.. but it has a problem. The age shows.. meaning the gameplay is somewhat outdated.
Because: it's not dificult to find dracula.. it would've been one of the most fun parts, but there are so many event cards that simple tell you where he is.. so instead of hunting him down, you simply have to trot after him & make sure he didn't drop any vampires while stacking up tons of weapons to finally attack & slay him.

That alone takes a lot of time, time both parties have to invest.. and the other thing is, half of the other event cards are cards that either do or cancel effects from the opponent.. so you constantly play cards that reverse each other.. feels like your Sisyphos.
All of that results in games that are incredibly long (we're talking 5-6 hours) and more often than not, come down to lucky die-rolls.
Tried to fix the game with house rules but i gave up.

___________________________
Love the theme, the 1 vs. many. the hide & seek, the fights in between, the traps dracula lays, the fact that in this rather long game there is no player elemination.. love the game.

Hm.. i have to say it's getting a bit samey recently.. there is a pretty clear strategy dracula & the hunters have to follow. Maybe i should try playing one of the hunters for a change. Droped from 9 to 8. But still a very good game.

Unusual deduction/combat game with many possibilities. Unlike anything I've ever played. Fighting is thematic, almost cinematic, but that can actually get tiresome after awhile. Game usually drags on too long.

Addenda: Each time I play this game, my rating goes down another point. Too long and frustrating what with the "Dracula Wins" card (Evasion). That card exists, apparently, only to keep Hunters from drawing event cards -- but they need to draw events to have a hope of countering it. It wouldn't be so bad if Dracula won instantly, but the teleport across Europe means the Hunters have to continue trying to hopelessly hunt him down for an hour more of painful, pointless boredom.

I've had to delete all "teleport" text from my game to make it enjoyable. Changing the Evasion card by deleting the middle sentence makes this game truly an enjoyable experience. Short and sweet, not too long and frustrating!

No Teleportation without Representation!

(05/14/2011) Comment based on one play.

Horror Theme, which I can't stand: check
Cooperative Nature, which is annoying: check
Game Length, which is dreadfully long: check
Components, with lots of fiddly bits: check

Conclusion: Don't even bother asking me to play this. Once was enough.

Update (12/20/2015): If I want this kind of hunting/evasion experience, I'd rather play [thing=59959][/thing]. IMHO, it is a much cleaner, leaner, superior experience.

RATING: 2
(copy and pasted from my comment on 3rd edition, as the differences between all the editions do not impact the core issues I have with this game)

You could not design a game less for me than this one if you tried to. I think the biggest problem for me is that I do not find the core puzzle of deducing where Dracula could be engaging at all. Perhaps if it was contained within a game that was not seemingly designed to last forever, it might hold my interest longer, but as it is, it seems that skillful and/or lucky play by Dracula results in a game where *nothing happens* for hours. For at least 2 of the 3 times I've played this, we've called the game at the 3 hour mark when it was clear that we had at least 1-2 more hours remaining.

I do have to give this game credit for something though. It's the perfect illustration to me that what constitutes good game design is ultimately a subjective thing, as lots of people, including friends of mine, clearly love to play this game and it's unlikely they are all pretending to like it just to mess with me. :-D
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
Only played this twice.  Looks very promising, but I don't think I've quite got the hang of the strategy yet.  Seems a bit lopsided in favor of the bloodsucker, but maybe that's just lack of experience showing (I played as Dracula both times and seemed to do quite well against the hunters).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A wonderfully themed game of cat and mouse...  where the mice are stalking the cat!  It comes in on the long side, but this can be mitigated if players take their turns in a snappy manner, especially Dracula.  Highly recommended for patient players who are into the milieu.  Others may find it too ponderous.

RATING: 7
Good deduction game with great theme.  I find myself more and more leaning towards Amerithrash games, as they are much more fun to play.  Initially, I was afraid that FoD will be entertaining only for the Dracula player, but fortunately the Hunters also have a great time.  It is just a different experience and an advantage of this game.  It is as if you got two games in one, which is a bonus.

My greatest concern was the play time.  The game is quite long ( 2 hours), but the time flies, especially when the Hunters are on the Dracula's trail and keep close behind.  You can feel the tension!  The only negative feeling you (Hunters) get is when Dracula escapes a long-woven net and you have to start over.  It may be depressing!

1.09.2007 - painted the figures.  Finally, I do not confuse them on the board!

23.01.2008 - Traded for BattleLore+Call to Arms.  Could not miss such an opportunity.  I still like Fury of Dracula though.

I've only played this one once, as Dracula. I think the two-player nature of this game was over-hyped, at least with my wife and I. She found it a bit slow and thought it was somewhat of a crapshoot to find Dracula. 

I think it would have been more fun with a group instead of with just two players. I'm willing to give it another try, as there was a lot going on that I liked.

I've been told the game I played was atypical but it was still horrendous enough to scare me away from another anytime in the near future.  The game was so bloated on 'A-ha' mechanics that locating and holding onto anything worthwhile as a Hunter was ultimately pointless.  Finding Dracula was tedious, boring, and irritating and once you finally found him, combat was annoying as all Hell.  The effects chart was cool but straight die rolls for success?!  Are you kidding me?!  Every moment was pain interrupted periodically by a Hunter proclaiming "Hey, we finally got something useful to speed this thing along toward an end!" and Dracula retorting "No cancel that event.  I get to control all of you on your next turn and you must discard your best weapon.  By the way, I'm also going to sea for the next eight turns to drag this horrible game on forever."  Yeah, awesome game...

RATING: 8
Really enjoy this one.  Relish the opportunity to play again - especially good at Halloween.  Great 1 player versus multiple players game (although I found it does work having a two-player team up to play the Count).

Would seem to have a high replay factor.  Can't tell yet if the game is slightly tilted in Dracula's favor - there seems to be a lot of really evil things he can do.

The box claims the game takes 3 hours.  I've not had any game of this come in under 3 hours.  The long game was 6 hours with experienced players.  For me, the time feels like its flying.  For others, I know they begin to feel the grind at times.

One knock - in every game, there's usually one vampire hunter who spends the entire game in the exact wrong location.  The game is often not as fun for that player.

It's distinctly a Fantasy Flight game, with tons of little fiddly bits that make it a hair more complex than it needs to be. It's also distinctly a game that a group needs to build its evening around--with a skilled Dracula player, the game takes every bit of the 3-hour expected playtime, and you need a group prepared for that investment. It's very pretty and atmospheric, the design is quite solid, and the hidden movement, cat-and-mouse dynamic is a fun mechanic no other game I've played has really replicated. Combat is not great, though; the newer edition does that a little better, and I suggest house-ruling to streamline it.

Ideal Players: 5

Description: Four players take on the parts of hunters, while the fifth plays Dracula. This game is similar to Scotland Yard, but with a very well integrated theme from the book by Bram Stoker.

Pro: Theme and mechanics fit perfectly. Exciting game of deduction. Dracula's powers and event cards keep the game interesting. Each game tells a story.

Con: Players have to play for the story. Playing to min/max the mechanics isn't as fun for everyone involved. Combat is a little weird and simplistic.

I found this game difficult and didn't really enjoy chasing dracula around the board, having no idea where he was. As everyone else in the group seemed to enjoy it more (especially my husband) I feel maybe I just don't like that type of hidden 'chase' mechanic. We will probably end up with in the collection because my husband loves it.

We have modified the rules to only give Dracula one vampire on his track at a time, ever. It has made a significant difference in the game.

Owned SINCE 2012
I play this game with my family (wife and kids 7- 11 years old) and we like it. It does a great job capturing the feel and theme of hunting Dracula in old Europe. This game is definitively a deduction game first, and fighting game second; which is perfect, and just what I wanted. I would love to rate this 9, but the fighting mechanic seems a little ruff, and takes some getting use to.   
  UPDATE- After more plays the fighting mechanics do flow better, but something else, something easier, probably could of been used instead. I noticed that some games are very suspenseful and tense, with everything hanging on a single move or roll of the dice. Those are games that deserve a "10" rating. Other games are boring, and those can be rated a "5". I think this is because players have a lot of choices, and depending on what they do it can lead to a great, close game or a game where there is little action or a clear winner from the beginning. I am glad I have this game, maybe a little overpriced for what it does, but it fills a unique gaming experience and does it well. I can not see any other deduction game being better. We just played another great game yesterday (before this edit), one where everything depended on a single battle and everyone was watching. Even people who had not played were in suspense because of the situation.. Yeah, when this game is good it is just great.

Not what I expected.  A good game for sure, but can Dracula win this?  I mean the events are just nasty for him.

Update:  Played again, and dracula got owned yet again.  Not sure it's winable as Dracula.  The experience is good though, so I'll leave it at 6.5...otherwise, it would be 5.0

Update - ok, Dracula can win, but it takes a very good Dracula player.  The experience is fun all around though, so bumping this up to 7

The plan was to meet friends at a weekend in South Bend to play this one, but I couldn't wait until Geek Weekend and bought this one early.  I haven't regretted it since then.  

Smart gamers makes this game a challenge.  Some games Dracula can never flee the hunters (unless the overpowered move anywhere card is played).  In other games though, Dracula moved right between three hunters and they still missed him somehow.

I originally thought that this game would be too fantastic for me; on the contrary, having played a few games, I much prefer the more in-depth theme of FoD to the dryness of Letters from Whitechapel.

Once I used to like it more.
  Right now I can see the downsides more clearly: downtime, repetitive and not-so-interesting decisions, many features of the game not used at all (or sporadically), too long playing time compared to the merits of the game.
Generally - too little game in the game: you make your tiny move and wait for others to perform theirs - which takes too much time.  It shouldn't (because others make tiny moves too), but it does.

Otherwise it's quite decent game.

Sold.

RATING: 7.5
This is a great change from Euro-gaming which I have done so much of lately. The theme is so well implimented and production values are pretty good too except for the cards which could have been thicker. 

[u]Pros:[/u] Strong theme, very unique, intriguing, fun, nice bits, scales 2 to 5(see comments below however), some tension, neat mechanics  

[u]Cons:[/u] Slightly long, can be slightly mechanical at times when either chasing Drac or playing Drac and just running away, slightly lower strategic level of play (its there but more for Drac than the hunters IMO), downtime with more than 3 players

[u]Summary:[/u] Overall a great game and very welcomed addition to my collection. After playing with 5 people I can tell you that to enjoy this you need 5 VERY PATIENT people, 4 would not be too great either, too much downtime. Best with either 2 or 3 people total IMO and NOT a gamers game or for anyone on a strict Euro diet.

I'm hesitant to rate after only one game as we did a lot of fumbling around with the rule book, with caused a lot of down time.  Rating could go up with more plays.

Had a 2nd play and my experience was even worse.  ROlled X's on rail movement 3 or 4 times in a row.   Finally met Dracula in combat and lost 7 consecutive rounds, and that was with Dracula not getting a +1 bonus.   We were hot on his heals from turn 2 and had multiple combats yet never did a point of damage.  Very frustrating.

update: My rating is falling, it just seems that this game is just too long for what it offers.  Things start to get repetitive after 2 hours.

After 4 plays I can see that I really like the game.  It isn't the best game ever like I was originally thinking it would be but it is still a good game.  Sometimes it can go on quite long.  It is quite fun trying to hunt down dracula but it can be rather frustrating after spending an hour to find him to have him slip through your fingers for another hour or so.

February 2011

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2011)

It has a huge manual and, thus far, I have been unable to play as Dracula. Still I like the game but I prefer to play it with 3 players, 4 tops. More than that and the down time can be an issue.

Dracula is extremely powerful at night, but ridiculously weak during the day so during the day Dracula has to hide and the hunters need to deduce his whereabouts, at night it is the hunters who need to thread carefully as Dracula can unleash a set of powerful attacks, nonetheless, I find the game relies heavily on the ability of the Dracula player to evade the hunters, if they can´t catch him Dracula has won.

Fury of Dracula has a strong theme and it is pretty easy to learn, the play time hoovers around the 3 hour mark. I really enjoy the game but it is a game I would like to play once a month, more than that and the game can lose its appeal.

Current Rating: 7.5

It´s been a long time since I last played Fury of Dracula (second edition). I have changed a lot during these years, I no longer enjoy Ameritrash games the way I used to, so I’m downgrading the game´s rating. It is way too slow for my liking.

I want to play as Dracula but I’m not sure if I’m going to have the opportunity as I already bought the third edition of the game. I still don´t know what are the changes between editions. My desire to play the game remains low.

Fury 2006 preserves the atmosphere and tight game play of the Games Workshop version while increasing the interaction between Dracula and the Hunters and ratcheting up the deductive aspects of the game.

A game that can be played over and over without a predetermined "sequence of events" emerging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is a very fun game that is fun for both hunters and Dracula. There is considerable strategic depth and the game is high on theme. It's very easy to "get into it" once you start playing and are hoping to keep running or sneak up on those pesky hunters or are hoping to stake Dracula to the wall.

It does have a steep learning curve but once you play through it a little, it seems to have an intuitive set of rules.

I recommend this one highly.

Edit: I've dropped the score by half a point because even though I regularly suggest it, it is rarely chosen for play even though I highly recommend it.

This appears an instant classic. Oozing with theme, FoD succeeds amazingly well in where Arkham Horror was found wanting, namely teamwork, and is a lot more robust than Betrayal at House on the Hill. The search for Dracula is exciting for both the Count and the Hunters, and while the combat system is dominated by dice a bit, it does require advance planning on both sides. All in all, this is one of my best game buys.

FoD has to be one of the best cat and mouse games I've yet to play. Despite negative comments posted on the geek, I find this game superbly balanced, and the play incredibly addictive.

Oozes theme, and it's a good one too. I prefer to go without Dracula's Evasion card, as I didn't want to drag the game out longer than 2 hours or so. Getting encounters to actually mature can be tricky. Highly enjoyable game...think Scotland Yard with lots more chrome. 

I love the Day/Night aspect, which by turns gives Dracula incentive to lay low when he's weak or pounce on a Hunter at night when he gets his additional combat cards.

I wish I could rate this higher. My wife who doesn't like many boardgames liked this one. Initially it is difficult and not very exciting trying to find Dracula who is hidden, but keeps moving. During this time you collect cards to give you weapons or abilities. Once Dracula is found you fight him to the death, but he may escape. You use the cards along with a random element from the dice. Once Dracula is found, he is kind of weak against multiple players. I would play it again, but just for the wife.

I have had a lot of fun with this game in the past. The combat system is very clever, I love it. I enjoyed the game as a unique and thematic experience. However, these days I find it lacking in several key areas, and that keeps it from being played. 

The main issue is inconsistent tension. The hunters don't know how close they are to finding Dracula. For them there is a lot of somewhat boring casting of the net which hopefully results in pinpointing Dracula. The experience of the Dracula player is great, it's very tense to watch the hunters plan out their moves.

The game is also quite long for what it offers strategically. For hidden movement I'd rather break out Scotland Yard.

Acceptable, but fiddly.  Everything feels like it takes just a bit too long to resolve.  The confrontations between the Hunters and Dracula seemed to lack dramatic tension - in one game, they beat him down handily and, in the other, he fled without a care.  The narrative structure is not quite organic and feels forced by the cards.

RATING: 7
This is Scotland Yard enhanced with battle rules based on biased rock-paper-scissors. This game succeeds at evoking the atmosphere of hunting Dracula though it can be a bit on the long side making it more difficult for Dracula to hit the table. The Dracula player should be an experienced player and it certainly is much more fun if more players know the game and can lead smoothly through the game. But this is the case for almost every Fantasy Flight big box game.

Turn after turn where you can't do a thing.
A game that takes forever, but is decided by dice.

'Find the bad guy' game with an appropriate theme. Has nice Rock/Paper/Scissors element to battling. Makes for a fun and suspenseful interaction. Really boring game if Dracula runs around the whole game or abuses the water zones. Bat and mist escape cards are way overpowered. Minions in East Europe are far too powerful. Great, engaging game if Dracula fights, otherwise could take [b]several hours for a boring and frustrating defeat.[/b]

Solid game that does a good job selling its theme and features novel and clever mechanics.  The graphic presentation is inconsistent, representing a bit of a hodge-podge of styles, although the board is excellent.  Takes a long time to play but this gives ample time for several cycles of the cat-and-mouse chase to unfold.  Event cards have wildly varying effects and having the right card at the right time can be game-deciding.

Not a particularly bad game. Was a Christmas present that my husband spent ages tracking down. The miniatures are adorable. The game, unfortunately, just isn't all that good.

This is a great game. The teamwork and deduction elements work very well, and there's enough room for doubt about the best course of action for the hunters that it doesn't just degenerate into one person ordering the others around.

Scotland Yard with too many fiddly extra mechanics piled high on top of it, but it gets some nostalgia points via the old Games Workshop edition.

Fell far short of my expectations.  Too long, and Drac is too easy to locate due to the event cards, making the deductive hunt often superfluous.  [i]Great[/i] theme and atmosphere, though.  Perhaps something to only play once each year around Halloween.  I may have to seek the original, which I understand emphasizes the hunt over combat, a game-halting rock-paper-scissors affair.

RATING: 8.5
WOW!  Grasping this game on your first play is a chore.  FoD itself isn't overly complicated, but there such a large meta-game to learn since there are many special abilities to understand on item and event cards. FoD is an excellent blend of theme, deduction, cooperation, light RPG, and direct confrontation; additionally the production values of the FF version were top notch.  And since it's assymetrical, if you ever get bored, you can play the other side to spice it up.  Dracula is constantly on the move from one city to the next.  This is simulated by him pulling a card from a site deck and placing it face down on a track in front of him (along with one of his minions). As you move your Hunters across the board, hoping to land on a city which is in Dracula's face down track so you can uncover the card and begin deducting where he is, you gather items and event cards to help you cope with Dracula.  Be wary, as Dracula isn't the only creature out for you, you'll have to deal with his minions if you uncover his trail...and sometimes it's more important to deal with them as it is Dracula because if the minion is a vampire and left to mature too long (Dracula's trail is only so long, and eventually the cards start falling off the end of the track), Dracula gets big points (2 of the 6 needed).  But the weapon items that hurt the minions may not necessarily hurt Dracula;  Have you balanced your character well enough to handle the task?  If you're not prepared, and Dracula takes your hunter out, 2 more points for him (but don't worry, your hunter isn't permanently dead, just reset).  Not to mention, every round moves to time of day marker, 3 of which are day and 3 night.  Once a day night cycle is complete, Dracula gets a point.  Guess who's stronger at night?  That's right, Dracula.  How desparate are you to fight him then?  Is it down to the wire?  Have you prepared your hunters for the task and coordinated well enough with your partner(s)?  

Due to it's many characteristics and depth, I think I will be interested in this game for some time to come...rating likely to go up.


The main detractor of this game is the randomness of the die rolls.  I plan on implementing a system similar to Knizia's Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation using only cards.  Check the Variants section of the Forum: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/106224

Finally!  I have heard of this game for many years, and was pleased to finally get to play it, albeit the revised 2nd edition.  I really enjoyed the game.  We played just before Halloween, so it was a well suited game to our moment in time.

I can see the bones of Scotland Yard underneath the flesh of this game.  I'm not a big "search" game fan.  But if I were to own one, I would probably prefer Scotland Yard.  But Fury of Dracula is fun, and has a nice attachment to theme.

It may be a bit overblown for what it is.  But I would play again!

Very thematic, semi-cooperative deduction/search game where players take on the roles of Hunters trying to catch up with and destroy Dracula (who is controlled by another player) as he moves secretly around Europe.  It's well-designed, well-balanced, and gameplay flows smoothly.  While it can run a little long, I find that it generates a constant mood of excited tension throughout the entire chase.

Good game, Nice theme.  Only problem may be that it just takes to long to play this game to completion.  For me, this type of game (a variation of what I call a "Character Building Game") overstays its welcome after about two hours.  Good enough to play at least once or twice a year.  A Halloween tradition.

I always play Dracula and the hunters always kill me, though it usually takes them 2.5+ hours to do so. I must confess that I like the hidden movement game mechanic.  Watching the hunter's try to deduce where I am or my next move is fun.  I like Dracula's powers of evasion and the special abilities of the hunters.  However, I do not like the combat mechanism.  Combat reminds me of 'rock paper scissors', which I find disappointing.  Am I alone in this?

It is a really good game. It can be very challenging and has tons of theme. Very good components.
So why just a 7.5? It´s because it really depends on a good dracula player and it is possible that one or more players miss all the action, simply because they´re in the wrong part of europe. 
It is a well designed game. Just sometimes hard to enjoy for some.

Some games are all about the theme and this is one of them. The immersion is great, keeping in mind that you know in advance that being Dracula is all about hiding and not biting and killing. Personally, I find it ok, as the seek & destroy Dracula is more from the new books and films: in the old ones, it was a perverse and sneaky creature that wrecked evil everywhere he go.

So, what does this offer? Mainly, theme and fun, but also the deduction mechanism is particularly well implemented. All in all, this is an excellent game for rolegamers, fans of the ameritrash thing and fans of gothic literature (did I mention that the theme in this one is great?). Also, the components are top notch.

You always play with four hunters and, obviously, one Dracula. This seems like a great setup for five players, but that's not how this game rolls. Playing as Dracula is always fun and challenging, no matter the number of players. But hunters? In every game I've played there has always been at least one hunter pawn who hasn't been involved in the game at all. If you have less players than hunter pieces, the less useful pawn can be left aside, with players agreeing in what to do with it, while each player gets its own hunter to focus on. But if hunter piece is controlled by an individual player, well, said lonesome hunter isn't going to have much fun. With two players the issue is the total opposite: whoever is playing the four hunters suffers an information overdose. Not boring, but not optimal.

One more thing: if all the hunters are new to the game, make sure to warn them about the advantages of spamming the event deck or, most likely, they won't know where Dracula is most of the time and will get bored (oh, and mentioning that one event is a "Scotty, teleport Dracula" is also important to avoid unexpected frustration).

I tried this game without knowing what to expect and found it superb.  The theme is excellent (our first game ended in a climactic battle at Castle Dracula) and I loved the deduction gameplay as we trailed Dracula across Europe.  It can drag with slow players or a Dracula who does not think about his or her move while the hunters move.  Also, once the hunters find Dracula the ending can seem a bit anti-climactic.  A couple of rolls for battles with stakes and Dracula's dead.  Still our game was very close and exciting and I will play this anytime.

Nice deduction game with excellent theme and ok components. Might be a bit crowded with 5 players, but works fine with 2 and especially with 3. Game can run a tad long, though. Would rate it an 8 if it were shorter - say around 2 - 2.5 hours. Now, if everyone is concentrating on the game, it can take 4-5 hours easily and that's too long for almost any game.

I just purchased this game. I had played it once a couple years go and remember really liking it. I am so glad I decided to get it.

I played it twice yesterday as a five player and a two player. The five player was a three very experienced players, one peron who has played bg's for a few months and a brand new player. I was Dracula and one by the skin of my teeth.

The second game was just me and a new player. I won as the hunters.

I thinks it's a great game! The combat mechanics are a bit week and so is Dracula but those are minor to the thematic element it brings and it is always a challenge and a lot of fun. It plays very well for a longer game and I highly recommend it!

From what i've read: Typical Fantasy Flight game. Lot's of flavor but very little game. Move peon. Draw event. Move peon. Roll die. Move. Roll....... 

from a review:

"Another thing that irks me about Fury of Dracula is combat/event cards. All too often I have played games in which the Dracula player was playing an extremely smart, well thought out game that was obliterated because the Hunter’s got lucky die rolls or drew all the right event cards. This, again, works both ways.

These reasons are why I call Fury of Dracula my groups “cult classic”. Just like Lucio Fulci films, the game has its flaws. If you take it too seriously you’ll end up with a few players that had a great time and a few that end the night pissed off and discouraged. But, like Fulci films, if you play the game with the right amount of players (3-4) and you all have the right mindset, Fury of Dracula can be a great time for all. As long as these conditions are met, I recommend this game wholeheartedly."

RATING: N/A
In this game of Gothic adventure, one player takes the role of Dracula while up to four others attempt to stop him by controlling Vampire hunters from the famous Bram Stoker novel.

Dracula has returned, and is determined to control all of Europe by creating an undead empire of Vampires. Dracula uses a deck of location cards to secretly travel through Europe, leaving a trail of encounters and events for the hunters that chase him.

Meanwhile, the hunters attempt to track and destroy Dracula using the limited information available to them - a task easier said than done when their prey has the power to change forms into a wolf or bat, and can even melt away into the mist when confronted.

Better deduction game then Letters of White chapel and Scotland yard in my opinion as there is a better theme, and player interaction (attacking).

[2007.Apr.12] Best played with 3 players, the quality of the Fantasy Flight Games reprint is exquisite. The deduction element of this game is quite fun, and keeps players thoroughly engaged especially while they plan their next moves (to either corner Dracula as the Hunters, or to get away as Dracula). Unfortunately for the game, all planning devolves into rolling well (or poorly) during combat. That said, the game is worth playing--perhaps not weekly--but definitely worth playing.

Played 3 times, 2p, 3p, and 5p.  This game was more fun than I expected.  More fun with more players, and it seemed like the game went faster, too, though this may've been an illusion.  This game suffers from it's oppresively complex rulebook.  The players started getting very antsy during rules explanation; the rating would be at least half a point higher with more streamlined rules, or better presentation.  I enjoyed it as a semi-co-operative game.

Dracula based "Scotland Yard".  Not very well balanced (never seen Dracula live with 4 players), tedious to run, very limited strategy, don't like it at all.

RATING: 8
This game is awesome. The "everybody teems up against 1 player" concept is also an interesting feature. Many mechanics, like the trail left by dracula, are unique and interesting. The problems I see with this game is maybe the lack of replay value. I would love to have different play modes and game objectives(Still, the game is open enough to make our own modes). I just found it stupid that dracula only needs to wander around and survive until turn X to win. I would have loved for example a chase from england to transylvania like in the original story.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a fun, well done game.  It's difficult and stressful to be dracula or the investigators.  Dracula seems especially hard since it's not too difficult to guess where he will be and get to him at the time of the day when his traps don't work.  But Dracula can also win by just hanging on.  Nice artwork and atmospheric art.  I probably won't play it that much since it's a little long, but it's a very solid game.

RATING: 7
A very good semi co-operative with some nifty little changes from it's former game of same name (see my comments on originally published game).  This revised edition improves the original significantly that I now enjoy this one more.   However, especially with experienced players, I believe the advantage in the game with the rules "as written" seems to unfairly favor The Hunters too much, so I'd advise at least both of the following changes:  (a) limit or completely Resolve (the later is more preferable), and (b) victory for Dracula is 5 vampire points and not 6.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fascinating deduction game that also involves the use of cards for fight encounters and events.  The instructions could have been a bit more clear though on whether Dracula counts as an encouter or not.  Good game for 2-5 people.  I'm becoming convinced that this game is tough for Dracula to win as the hunters seem to hound Dracula like crazy once they find his trail.  It might be key for Dracula to take out a hunter or two early in the game if he is able to get in position to do so.  Be prepared to spend 3 hours or so playing this game, particularly on your first play.  Record as Dracula:  3-3

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Thematic, semi-cooperative, deduction/search game. Players play either Dracula or one of four Hunters. Dracula tries to hide at day times, attack at nights, gain power with each night-day turn and with each successfully placed vampire. The Hunters, on the other hand, try to find, catch and destroy Dracula. The twist is that Dracula moves secretly around Europe.
The game is fun, very thematic and also luck driven - some event cards are very powerful, but the luck seems to balance out evenly. It's a good experience game.

If you like Scotland Yard and Dracula, you should love this game. Unfortunately, the slightly anticlimactic fighting system (actually, the really fucked up and outright silly fighting system) takes away most of the tension and the cinematic qualities of the overall good production. Each time we play this, I come back here and rate it even lower.

RATING: 7.5
This is a cool game. I love the theme and find the hidden player/chase mechanic to be quite unique. It's fun to work with your partners to deduce where Dracula is going, and how to race against the clock to defeat him.  

Biggest detractor with this game however is the length and downtime.  I've never played a single game of this where it didn't feel like it dragged on way too long. Also, meaningful decisions can be far and few between, particularly if your avatar is too far from the action--so this adds a bit of monotony to the game.

There's a lot to like about FoD. It's fun, it's exciting, and the cooperation works well. But this is definitely a game from the 80s. It lasts way too long, with very little to distinguish any part of it from another. There's a lot of curlicues and chrome that add to the rules burden without really benefiting the game. Some of the random events are just brutal, such as the one that basically restarts the game. Our game only came to an end when it did because Dracula made an ill-advised attack in the daytime, allowing the hunters to dogpile on him. If he hadn't, we could still be playing it. And while it's fun and exciting, it's not THAT much so.

The combat system in this game made me and my group grew some bad feelings toward the whole game. I find it somewhat interesting and I will try it again (and maybe a third time) but definitely the combat system discourages me to play it again. I dunno if it was just bad luck or a lack of strategy or just because it was the first game but we finished the game when the 5 new vampire arrived at a new day and Dracula was still at 14 blood... and I never used any special power! 

Definitive Rating: 9

The tension adds up A LOT to the game, but it seems that if the cards are right the Hunters have a HUGE advantage over Dracula sometimes

I purchased this based on some interest within the game group but we have yet to get it on the table there. 

We did have a lengthy game - with one player with no experience. As Dracula, I felt compelled to open fights (and reveal location) just to reduce the frustration level on the part of the Hunters.

I like asymmetric games such as this one and others such as Friedrich.

When I get more play in will adjust the rating.

A real nice and intriguing game. A very good work of re-design, like Britannia and Warrior Knights; the new release of Fury of Dracula go to fix all the problem in the original version with some real new ideas (the mechanic of the movement of Dracula is brilliant). Since the game is almost cooperative (Dracula against all the other players) it is good also for new players and people not too much used in games. I really like this title.

One of my favorite AT titles.  Good fun and balance as either Dracula or as a Hunter.  There are so many little details I love in this game.  The location deck is inspired.  Drawing events from the bottom to hide card backs is great (and even having events from both factions in the same deck is great).  The train die is fun.  The combat system is fantastic: you get a wonderfully realistic narrative since successful attacks change their effects based not only on what the attack was but also what the opponent's attempted attack was.  I'm always down for a game of Fury, on either side of the board.

This has gotten 2 plays so far and I would definately like to see it come to the gaming table again.  The first game was 2 player and 4 hunters seems a bit much for one person to keep track of....especially the first time through!  Second play was with 4 and this seemed much better.  Dracula won both games and seems to be a bit stronger than the hunters so far.  Some players didn't get a chance to fight and were a little disappointed with this.  It seems gameplay can be a bit uneven and I think a 3 player game may be the sweet spot for this one.  I've played Dracula both games but would love to play a hunter next time around.

Rules issues prevalent (easy to get into a position where no legal moves are available).

Combat very rock, paper, scissors; combat outcome often determined by the initial cards the players hold.

Core mechanics when searching the board for Dracula are great (for both sides) but the combat holds it back.

Would like to play it again some time but difficult to justify it above other games.

A steroid-boosted Scotland Yard. Might be worth just sticking with Scotland Yard especially when considering the following:
Plays a little longer than I think my students might like. 
Doesn't lend itself well to 2 players unless the non-dracula is very good at manageing multiple characters.
Game definitely takes the minimum 2 hours (and can run to 3).

Fun with more people. 

Pro/Con: a lot of fun for dracula. Mediocre for others. Overstays it's welcome.

A 6 so far. I have to say that I'm a bit disapointed after the first few games. There has never been a constant game flow or tension. A lot of rules with a lot of exceptions. And a lot of encounters and cards with different effects on the basic rules. As a Euro Gamer I would have loved more streamlined rules. And I have to play the Dracula character all the time when nobody else is completely familiar with the rules. All in all this game needs a lot of test games (maybe 3 to 4) untill all players have got the rules and cards and encounters. Not really recommended for Euro Gamers. A game can easily exceed 4 hours of playing time. Others last only for 45 minutes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A fun game of deduction and hunting dracula around Europe, that works really well up until you catch up with him and it's a die roll to see who wins or loses. Various weapon cards etc, don't in any way effect the basic "roll higher to win" combat mechanic. This is stupid. I don't know why they bothered with a combat system at all. Why not just say you have to catch Drac x number of times, since it's the tracking him down that's the game. The combat is just pointless extra rules.

I'm not sure why I didn't like this more than Scotland Yard, it's thematic, it has nice components, and battles. Perhaps it's the nature of the cards that just give too much power to Dracula for my taste, or the fact that the game drags so much. It was quite painful.

[Played 22 times]

"Debugged" version of the original (no more player elimination, more balanced cards, new movement rules for Dracula raising interaction and deduction, Dracula must play an encounter every turn).
Luck is still very important (dice and cards), but a bit less than before.
Atmosphere has been preserved.
Cooperation (with more than two players) and a bit of deduction embellish the game.
Probably better with fewer players (brisker pace).
It still has its flaws (FFG rushed development shows once more).

Playing with all experienced players makes the game both shorter and more interesting (even if it feels biased towards the Hunters, the hints given in the rulebook and some house rules should help).

Some components (character sheets, box insert, lack of a cards/tiles holder) are disappointing given the price tag.

RATING: N/A
In this game of Gothic adventure, one player takes the role of Dracula while up to four others attempt to stop him by controlling Vampire hunters from the famous Bram Stoker novel.
Dracula has returned, and is determined to control all of Europe by creating an undead empire of Vampires. Dracula uses a deck of location cards to secretly travel through Europe, leaving a trail of encounters and events for the hunters that chase him.
Meanwhile, the hunters attempt to track and destroy Dracula using the limited information available to them - a task easier said than done when their prey has the power to change forms into a wolf or bat, and can even melt away into the mist when confronted.
To save Europe and rid the world of Dracula's foul plague, the hunters must destroy Dracula before he earns enough victory points to win the game... will they have enough wit and bravery to defeat the dark count?

"Dripping with theme" as they say. Scotland Yard-like mechanic has Dracula making hidden movements across a map of Europe while a team of hunters go after him, arming up with items and helpful event cards as they do. One of my favorites. Sometimes, controlling a single hunter doesn't give a player quite enough to do IMO.

Very fun, thematic game.  Has a lot of flavor, very suspenseful during the hunt.  Most of the theme makes a good deal of sense when linked with the mechanics.  The hidden item, event, and movement is great.

BUT....the fighting sucks.  Like....really, really sucks.  If Dracula is caught during the daytime, game over.  Played it as Dracula and dealt 2 damage during a single battle while losing 15 health and losing the game.  How is that balanced?

I really hope FF reprints this game, but it clearly needs a revision.

Solid 6 all the same.

Did not care for this at all.  I played with people who were exerienced in the game so I thought it would go smoothly, but not so.  We played for about 3 hours because we had to keep looking up fiddly little rules.  I was extremely bored thoughout the game, wishing I was playing something else.

After about 3 hours we simple quit before the game ended because everyone was bored.  This might be just a bad experience for me, thus I rate it a 3 rather than a 2 according to BGG's rating scale.

Previous comments: After a couple of plays, we're learning that this is a good game. Cooperative against Dracula. Different abilites, "power ups" and clever deduction. The game weaves a good story as you hunt down the evil Drac! (Or avoid the relentless hunters!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
2.9 I've changed my mind on this game. I didnt like it in the first couple of games. There is a big rules overhead to playing the game, particularly if you are playing Dracula. There's a lot to get the hang of - the cards, the weapons, the fight system itself. The game will reward you the more you play.

You must sit down and read the rules before you start, and not try and quick start the game (like I did with some friends).

The pieces are nice quality. A dracula 'screen' would have been a nice addition - I have to play Dracula from inside the lid to stop people seeing my cards.

Its worth reading the quick start guide and rules addendums from BGG before you start playing as well, as they cover a number of the major points of confusion.

The game can get bogged down in analysis paralysis (but at least the team can talk to each other), and I've never had a short game of Dracula - it can take 4 or so hours.

I think if you enjoy the cerebral experience of the cat and mouse chase, you will like this game. There's not really another game like it (apart from Scotland Yard or Letters from Whitechapel).

Bought on ebay, imported in from Australia. Later replaced with a second copy when the first got beer flooded by Matt G.

Chit pull, partnerships, point to point movement, secret unit deployment, variable player powers.

Might get replaced with Specter Ops.

A great Scotland Yard, hide-and-seek w/ combat-style game. The taste of playing as Dracula is very different from the taste of playing as the hunters.

Its only drawback is that, when Dracula and the hunters play well against each other, Dracula is not able of getting extra vampires and also the Hunters are not able to win fast. The game can, in this case, last for about 4 hours.

I was playing Dracula when it happened, and I lost in the 5th day. I had to use my powers to evade the hunters in daylight and wasn't able to strike them at night. As I used my powers, I grew weaker and weaker, and I couldn't use good combat moves at night because the Hunters had played Sister Agatha and I was short of blood.

RATING: 10
Fury of Dracula is a near perfect game in my opinion. It is tense and exciting, simple to teach yet deep in game play, both tactical and strategic and is one of the most thematic games you can play. It is equally challenging for both the hunters and Dracula and the game play is varied enough to warrant many repeated playings. The game flows like a great horror story with each turn like another chapter in a late-night page turner that you can't put down.

I ALWAYS am enthusiastic to play this and will seldom turn down a game.

Well-balanced and fun.  Great One vs. All game!

Some fiddly rules, as is the case with many FFG games.  Still, once you get into it, it moves pretty quickly.

I highly recommend this game to those who like easy mechanics with good theme. There's something with FoD that should be in every classical boardgame. Great art and minis. The quality of the cards is outstanding, too.

Nice adaptation of the original classic, our group is  not the best when it comes to co-op games...seems we would rather all lose than let anyone else win! This one works better than most because of the common foe.

It's more fun to play than Scotland Yard (it feels about the same, but there are more options and the game is a bit more balanced).
As a rough comparison, 'Fury of Dracula' compares to 'Scotland Yard' as 'Mystery of the Abbey' compares to 'Clue'.

You liked "Scotland yard"? This one is better, but you need to play with 5 players to have a good game. A  /- 20 years old game which has been enhanced. Curiously, both side use to think it's role is too difficult.

A fantastic game, good rules (especially Dracula's hidden movement!).
Board is beautiful, and game pieces are good quality too.

This game takes a long time to play, I would say about 3 hours. I've played this several times, and with heaps of different people and 3-3:30 hours is normal.

One of my favorites so far!

I used to love Scotland Yard, so I was excited to see this game come to the table.  It is, perhaps, a bit too complicated for it's own good, but the evocative atmosphere and tense game play more than make up for it.  Grade: A

RATING: 9
Reminded me a lot of Clue: The Great Museum Caper but deeper and with much better flavor. It seems to drag a bit with either new players or AP prone ones though. Can be played rather quickly with a smaller group of people who know what they are doing. I think 3 is optimal here.

Gra fajna, ale trzeba wprowadzić zasady mocno utrudniające grę Draculi. W innym przypadku Dracula jest de facto nieuchwytny i bardzo łatwo nim wygrać.

RATING: 9.5
Fury of Dracula is an investment, plain and simple. You could, I suppose, pick this off the shelf one evening (e.g. Halloween) and give it a go the same night. But, I would argue that it is important for someone in the group to have either played the game before, or at the very least, have someone who has a solid grasp of the rules. Because the rules in this game are complex, perhaps overly-complex. I understand that the designer might have found that certain rule exceptions were necessary after feedback from play testing. I'm sure they all serve to balance the game properly. Though, despite that hard work, I find that this game, without any modifications and all players being equal, favors Dracula quite a bit. Nevertheless, my wife and I spent the better part of 3 hours getting through the 30 page rulebook. Even after a close read, and relatively quick play (considering it was our first game, of course), our first game took over 5 hours! The Hunters ended up defeating Dracula in the small hours of the final day. This first game was fun, but it was WAY TOO LONG! There's just not enough game here, in my opinion, to take more than 4 hours, let alone 5. In our second game, we made some fairly basic modifications to shorten the game. We also kept balance in mind. If we simply shortened the game and did nothing else, Dracula would have a significant advantage. So, we made a couple of other tweaks as well. Our second game took only 2 hours, with quick play. I wanted to share our house rules with those who simply can't set aside a whole afternoon or evening to play this game. 

Changes: 
-Place the vampire marker on the "2" space of the vampire track. (This is the most basic way to shorten the game).
-Remove 5 blood points from Dracula's play sheet. He should start with 10 instead of 15. 
-Reduce the Godalming's health by 4, Helsing's by 3, and reduce Harker and Seward by 2.  
-After the first day, hunters receive 2 resolve per day rather than 1. 

*Keep in mind that we wanted to make the fewest amount of changes necessary in order to: 
1.shorten the game 
2. maintain balance 
3.In the case of the hunters, hopefully improve their odds of winning, though only slightly. 

I'm sure that hundreds of people have bought or traded for Fury of Dracula and have never completed a game. Beyond that, I'm sure that many have looked at the rulebook in awe and have never even attempted a playthrough. Some gamers simply don't have a a whole afternoon to play a game, and if they do, they only do once or twice a year. Shortening the game to 2 hours makes it much more feasible to get to the table, and much more enjoyable for the hunters, in my opinion. I'm sharing this information, not because I think the designer got it wrong, but because I want as many people as possible to enjoy this game. We absolutely love it, and I hope others that are hesitant to pull it off the shelf, realize that this is a game that can be played in a reasonable amount of time. More importantly, Fury of Dracula is an amazing experience!

Update 8/30/15:

Finally got the chance to play this with 3. It's much less housekeeping at this number. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The two other players felt a little powerless at times, since they couldn't seem to catch up to me until the end of the game. But, I still think it's tremendous. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Sometimes takes a while to get going, can play long and the combat is a needlessly complicated 'rock, paper, scissors', but when the hunters get Dracula's scent, the tension and nervousness ratchet right up.

Ultimately didn't hit the table enough due to long play time and uneven game experience. Also the combat, which was  bollocks. Sold.

RATING: 7
Well this game rocks. Well, at least it looks like it rocks. I haven't played it. However I've watched several different groups of friends play it over the years (including the GW version) They all seem to have a hoot. I did enjoy Scotland Yard and FoD seems like SY with teeth. 

The wife doesn't dig the Vampire theme. Hey, thats why we have kids right? Don't look at me like that! I'm kidding. kinda...

RATING: 7
Played one 3-player game. Worked very well with that number, with very little downtime between turns. However, our game was long, about 3,5 hours, not only because it was our first game but because of very few vampires. It was tense, fun and well-designed, and I´ll be happy to play again. Playing time could be an issue, though.

Best with 5 says BGG poll.

This game is OK.  Barely. I've knocked off points because it's a little long and it's too challenging for Dracula, but aside from this, I did appreciate the suspense and the team work for the vampire hunters.  Ultimately for me, however, the lack of balance means this rarely hits the table.

Better than expected. It's essentially a heavily chromed version of Scotland Yard. My only concern that I could see the game dragging a bit if the hunters are having a poor game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The ratings for this game keeps climbing. My (2) play sessions turns out otherwise. The game plays about three hours. Basically, because Dracula is weak, he must run. And run, he is good at. For first two hours, the hunters cannot get Dracula. It all comes down to the final showdown at the third hour where all it took is one or two combat to kill Dracula. This is incidentally the game that creates the most groans and cheers. Groans because the game doesn't end, cheers because the game finally ends.

Update: 6 » 4. Sold.

I am still not convinced how to rank this game. The theme and overall climate are great. However I don't like the games that have no play time precisely defined. Dracula's action "Teleportation" can signifficantly extend play time and make the searchers bored.

This game revolves around 1-4 players chasing down another player.  The card mechanic for hidden player movement is an improvement on other games of this type, however, most of the item, combat, and encounter cards are just chrome and greatly slow the game.  I'd rather the game move faster.  The game really shines with a good Dracula player.

Excellent game when you've got a good Dracula behind the wheel, and a team with some intelligence. This game includes bluffing, deduction, logic, combat, cooperative AND competitive play, variable player powers, and great theme that lasts throughout the game! A bit of a time commitment, and can be disappointing if the person playing Dracula is having an "off" night or fellow teammates just aren't into it.

Its a thematic deduction.. no.. cooperative.. no confrontational no.. all of those game. Never played the original, but FFG seems to have done well with this one. Best 2-3, although more is alright. Just a touch long for what it is, but definitely a keeper for occasional play when the mood strikes the group.

A sterile and entirely un-engaging pastime akin to getting your friends together to solve Su Doku puzzles for two hours. There is very little player interaction, the card draws swing the decision tree to make every turn an excruciatingly repetitive re-evaluation exercise. I genuinely believe this is not a game by the definition BGG gives. It's a two player puzzle with one player mixing up the pieces smugly.

Really good cooperative game with a twist.  Being Dracula is not as easy as it sounds against a bunch of coordinating players.  As it is though, there are some formidable cards and if Dracula can't get some of them, I think he is doomed.  with 4 players against him anyway.  I would need a couple more games to acertain this idea, but my intuition rarely let me down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The cat and mouse aspect of this game really shines. Even when you know where Dracula is (the game gives the hunters plenty of tools to help with this) he's still wiley enough to make the hunt interesting.  This is a good one for those who like cooperative games.

Not any better than the first edition. Takes ages (if ever) to get your own particular piece anywhere near Dracula, so there's a lot of very slow wandering, and then Dracula can slip away with the play of a card or chit. The art of the first edition is move evocative.  Edit: raised rating when played with 2 or possibly 3 people, more interesting for all players that way. With 5 players is a 3.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A little too complicated to jump right into, but not too difficult once you know what you are doing.  Imagine Scotland Yard but with different powers for each investigator, and Mr. X has undead minions hiding on the board.  And once you find Mr. X you have to stab him in the heart repeatedly.

RATING: 9
Comment after a single play. Game lasted a little long (6 hours!) But it was incredibly tense right up to the very end. 

Houserules for next game: 1 blood loss for sea is automatic. Time still moves when Dracula is at sea. The hunters' sea ally makes Dracula lose 1 extra blood when he first goes into sea.

Night: Dracula can lose 1 blood to reroll a dice in combat

Castle Dracula: While here, you must stay until the end of the game. Dracula instantly heals up to 6 total blood (if he was under).
You gain 1 blood each turn and can place an encounter instead of a movement card. Castle Dracula can get multiple encounters on it (only 1 new vampire). Cards and encounters still shift off the trail each turn.

Event Setup - 1 Evasion and 1 Hypnosis are shuffled into the last half of the deck.

This is our LONG game, when we have a whole afternoon or a Saturday to kill and want to game.  I really enjoy this one, but it can be anti-climactic.  Best game was where we had Dracula trapped in his castle from both sides and was stalking up to him, hoping he wouldn't use his hidden power to get away. Can be a little fiddly, be careful when teaching to new players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This might be a good game, but it wasn't exhibited in my first. I like the Coop part, I like the chase and the deduction, even the combat is OK. The length and player downtime is a little much, and I like long games. Long games with long downtime is not a good combo. That said, if everybody knows how to play and can play fairly quickly, then I could see this raise a few bars. As of now, 6.5. This rating is after one play. It is important to note that my first game of Shadows Over Camelot was a long slog of boringness. Subsequent plays made me raise the rating to a 7 or so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After ~7 plays.  I am an abstract games player. I like to be able to list all the rules without taking a breath, so I normally wouldn't be caught dead with a game like this.  The rules wash over you unceasingly, and so do the chance events.  Nonetheless, this monstrosity has actually earned some respect from me, after only a couple of games.  So far, I like being Dracula much more than I like being one or more hunters, since dracula seems to have more opportunity for making clever moves.  Also, being all the hunters in a two player game is very fiddly because every hunter has his own hand of cards and you have to keep track of all of them.  I suspect that the rating for this will go up with more plays, as long as I don't get too annoyed with battle mechanism.  I'm probably more schizophrenic about this game than any other: there are things about it that I find toweringly awesome and things I detest.  It's the only game I've played that makes me want to read the book on which it is based.

La Furia de Drácula... Menos mal que no me lo compré hace 4 años por E-bay. Un día, comprando minis por E-bay, vi que un tio vendía la versión antigua de Games Workshop por 30 euros y me llamó la atención el juego. Busqué información en la web de la BGG y estuve a muy poco de comprárselo. Al final me echaé atrás porque me dió la sensación de que era muy dependiente del idioma (inglés). Aún así me quedé con la mosca detrás de la oreja (a mi la temática de vampiros clásicos me encanta). 2 años más tarde, buscando noticas para una revista de juegos me entero que FFG lo iba a reeditar, al igual que estaba haciendo con el Arkham Horror de Chaosium. Fue entonces cuando el sector de los juegos de mesa en España empezó a despegar como ahora. Edge y Devir sacaban casi bimensualmente algún juego traducido y pensé que quizá tocara la campana. Y al final ha tocado... Y todo esto viene a que menos mal que no me lo pillé en su momento en inglés porque, en efecto, el juego tiene muchas cartas con textos bastante extensos... más de lo que me pensaba. Y el juego no es sencillo. Para nada.

Vamos a necesitar una media hora para explicaros todas las reglas, más o menos como en el Arkham Horror. Además, también requiere que los jugadores se vayan leyendo detenidamente sus cartas durante el juego, porque hay algunas con efectos y textos extensos.... Pero el juego tiene una pinta estupenda. Creo que retrata muy bien la atmósfera del vampiro. Los jugadores tienen que compenetrarse muy bien entre sí para acabar con el jugador que lleva a Drácula y eso, es más dificil de lo que en un principio pueda parecer. Además visualmente el juego es una preciosidad. El tablero, que muestra un mapa de la Europa de finales del siglo XIX es bonito de cojones. Viene con unas minis, pero, aunque no están mal, son de plástico y vienen algo dobladas.

Puntos fuertes: al igual que el Arkham Horror, es un juego muy rejugable porque hay una gran cantidad y variedad de cartas que hace difícil que una partida sea igual que la otra. Las estrategias son muchas y el factor colaborativo es determinante. También es importante la persona que desempeña el papel de Drácula, ya que debe manejar bien las habilidades y poderes del vampiro para no caer facilmente en la trampa de los otros jugadores. Eso determinará si la partida dura 2 horas o 3. Casi ná.

Lecturas recomendadas:
"Drácula", de Bram Stoker. Para quien no se la haya leído se lo recomiendo encarecidamente. No es solo la NOVELA de vampiros por excelencia y fuente de toda inspiración, sino que su estilo narrativo es muy original (sobre todo teniendo en cuenta la fecha en que se escribió) ya que algunos capítulos funcionan perfectamente siendo simplemente las cartas y correspondencia que mantienen los protagonistas con sus particulares puntos de vista en la trama.

"La historiadora", de Elizabeth Kostova. Este tochazo de libro tuve oportunidad de leerlo hace 1 año. Aunque ha sido un best seller, a mí personalmente no me convenció. La trama tarda muchísimo en arrancar y muchos pasajes están extremadamente forzados. Pero aún así, es una interesante novela que narra la investigación durante años de una familia por descubrir y matar de una vez por todas a Drácula en plena Guerra Fría.

Potentially great hide and seek game... ...but it fails miserably with random cards and with it's combat system which is dull rock&paper&scissors with dice!

Played with 4 - 1 Dracula and 3 hunters (one person playing 2 hunters).  Wow, we really struggled with this initial play.  We were constantly looking at the rulebook for little niggling questions...but after 1 play I am pretty confident that the next time I play, things will go very smoothly.  I would suggest if no one has played, that you either find someone to teach it to you, or to go through the game yourself...it is the only way to learn it.  I plan on reading through the rules (& errata & FAQ) one more time...and also to study the combat cards.  We played by basically playing cards randomly, which was alright for now, but we would like to have some strategy behind it next game.  I recommend downloading some of the files from the file section (hit the "hot" button and you'll see all the best stuff).  In particular, the player screen and wooden cubes are an ABSOLUTE MUST!!!

RATING: 6.5
After a lot of trying with a lot of different people, it turns out that this game is most fun for the Dracula player. I would recommend it only for groups of three people (one Dracula, two ppl two hunters each), not two (too overwhelming for the player leading four hunters), not five (too little to do with only one hunter).

During play, the tension gets high when the hunters sniff out the Draculas possible location and start homing in on him, but it really drops for the hunters (dragging the gaming enthusiasm with it) when the Dracula is lost again... This alternation of high and low fun periods can be a mood spoiler.

Fury of Dracula is a solid game with bleeding great components.

Played once, as Dracula.  This is an amazingly well-themed game wherein one to four players team up as "hunters" who are scouring Europe to find (and kill) Dracula, who is always played by a single player.  This is, at its heart, a deduction game - Dracula moves in secret, but leaves a trail behind.  Anytime a hunter come across Dracula's trail, Dracula reveals that he was there (and how many turns ago he was there).  There's a ton of cards that can come into play, and these all add a delicious element of rnadomness that turns the game into an adventure: both Dracula and the Hunters must use lots of logic to figure out where to go (Dracula must figure out where the Hunters are likely to go, and the Hunters must figure out Dracula's likely moves).  Then, once the parties meet, battles ensue.

Printout out player aids is ESSENTIAL for this game.  Printing out the inverse-map for Dracula is key (as is building a shield for Dracula and giving Dracula colored cubes to track his past and present locations).  Also key is to print out the giant tables of the results of all possible battle combinations - this grid looks imposing at first, but is key to choosing well in a battle.  Also helpful are turn-summaries.

This game is LONG - it took an hour or more for rules, and at least four hours to play.  But those four hours were extremely fun-filled hours - Dracula (me) was having a great time (even when I was almost dead), and the four Hunters were also having a great time.  Helping mitigate the length is that the hunters are nearly constantly involved in logical deducation, in which all the players must work together to figure out the logic trees (so you're never waiting for someone else's turn).  And, after every move a new piece of information about Dracula's trail is revealed, starting the logic all over again.  

If you've got the right group, this is an insanely fun game.  I loved it.

RATING: 6
In Fury of Dracula, one player plays the role of the nefarious monster while four others play the hunters chasing him across Europe. Dracula moves secretly with his set of cards which is placed down turn after turn, leaving nasty traps and surprises for hunters who follow. Hunters must deduce and try to find Dracula and ultimately try and kill him.

This game is a fun deduction game that has players guessing where Dracula is on a map.  Both the hunters and Dracula have their own set of cards that they can play at certain times. Although the game play itself is simple the details of the game is quite complex. There are lots of rules and exceptions on when certain actions can be taken; certain cards can be played, the various effects of different actions, special abilities, etc… It can be quite over-whelming for a first time player. However, if you’re up for the challenge you’ll find Fury of Dracula to be an intense game of cat-and-mouse.

RATING: 7
The comparison with Scotland Yard is inevitable but this game has a lot more going on. I liked it but you do need to have sufficient time set aside to play it. If I want something lighter and reasonably quick I'd pick Scotland Yard but if I had the time I'd pick this one first.

The hunters all have special abilities which seem to suggest certain roles, Van Helsing can survive more bites so should fight Dracula, Lord Godalming is tough when taking on minions so should clean those out to stop them maturing, Mina can get cards and swap them. However all of that is not easy to engine when you've got no idea of where Drac is and little idea of where he's been. It's like the designers came up with these roles for the characters without thinking how the characters were going to implement those roles.

I'm starting to think this may fall into the 'good game I'll never get to play' category.

RATING: 9
A fun game with interesting dynamics.  Never played Scotland Yard nor did I play the original Games Workshop edition of this title, but like most Fantasy Flight releases this is a super high quality game experience.  I've played both sides now, Dracula and hunters, and I especially like the Drac role, listening to your friends trying to sort out where you are, sneaking around the map, watching the close calls, knowing more than anyone else about the detail of the game at any given time.  Highly recommended, even if you're not a huge fan of the book and the characters.

RATING: 4
I guess I'll need to give it one more try to decide. I felt like it dragged, and that the whole thing was an exercise in guessing. Spent almost six turns traveling by ocean trying to catch Dracula, and thus took no actions, gained no items, had no encounters. When I did land I rolled a big, fat X on the train dice and lost my turn. Seven turns is too long for a player to take no meaningful actions. And the worst part was, when I finally caught up to Dracula, the player played some stupid event card that allowed him to teleport all the way to the other side of the map again, and it would take me at least another seven turns to be back in the action.

RATING: 7.75
Our first (and thusfar only) play of the game appears to be atypical; Dracula was found almost immediately and escaped conflict with a lucky "evasion" card that began the hunters' long and uneventful odyssey to find him again.  Dracula ran around the board, avoiding detection thanks to some luck (good on his part, bad on the hunters').  There was also a lot less combat than we expected in our sole play.  At the game's conclusion, it was clear that the Dracula player had more fun than did the hunters.  Second play was very similar - game seems to favor Dracula, who seems to have many tools at his disposal to avoid an encounter.  We've yet to be able to engage Dracula in combat, for which he has many ways of escaping, too...Third play saw Dracula cornered, enaged in combat and slain.  Strategic play of event cards by the hunters sealed his doom.

For Powerful Dracular. I use a House Rule.

When Dracular's Action Phase. Dracular see the event's card like hunter.
If it's bat marked Event Cards, Dracular player declare Odd or Even.
And by the number of dice Dracular can get a event Card.

Then the game became more interesting.
Before this game, My favorite one was 'Puerto Rico'. But now favorite one is this.

fun hidden movement game of cat and mouse with dracula and some hunters. from what i've seen so far, i had expected more conflict to occur with dracula (or perhaps i was just that good at sneaking around growing my army.. ha.. yeah right..). it was still fun, the couple fights with dracula that did occur were great; and it's up to the hunters to figure out where dracula is based on his hidden movements.

looking forward to playing more of this

Dracula vs. the vampire hunters. So far four vampire-hunter victories to zero for Dracula. Incredibly tense (especially when the hunters are closing in on you as Dracula).

RATING: 6
A fairly good game of cat and mouse, Fury of Dracula can be a lot of fun at times, other games it just sucks.

I love the theme and its an exciting idea, its just that the game encourages Dracula to be less fury and more a little sissy running for all his life.

This is because combat comes down to the roll of a D6, and with a bad couple of rolls Dracula can be killed outright in under a minute. This encourages a cowardly style of play in which Dracula should avoid fighting at all costs, something which just seems to go against the overall theme and if done successfully can draw out the game for longer then its worth.

Shame because otherwise I really feel this is something I could have sunk my teeth into. Sadly the more I play it the less I like it.

Fury of Dracula 3rd Edition has several improvements and is vastly better then this version- I'd get it over 2nd edition any day!

Progressive rating: 10-9-8-7-6.

I'm really surprised how fun this game was, but I think I need to play it with a hardcore group and see if it has legs.

If I'm playing Dracula, it's a 9.

A fun game of cat and mouse, except that the mouse wants to suck your blood! Very nice components (the map is beautiful). Maybe a bit random for some people's tastes due to the initiative die rolling and rock/paper/scissors combat mechanism but this game is all about the theme, which really shines through with the Scotland Yard mechanics. Getting to the finish can sometimes feel like a drag, particularly for the hunters who lose Drac's trail, but its a tense game of deduction and risk taking for the most part.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Essentially FoD is a more complex version of Scotland Yard. Well that isn't fair but the premise is the same. This game almost drowns in theme and for that reason alone it is a must for lovers of the genre. It loses some points though because of the poorly written rules that require Errata to solve, making the overall experience less than it should have been. Once these changes become second nature, you are left with an excellent deduction game filled with varied encounters slightly luck based combat. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like the hidden movement mechanic & the theme. The Dracula feels a bit overpowered (and is more fun to play than the hunters), at least for our group. Longish & bit fiddly, but I enjoy it when it hits the table, there's something very immersive about it.

[June 12, 2008]  I have now played 5 games of FoD. Rating goes down to 8. The game can take too long, with periods of inactivity. Each individual hunter has too little to do. There are a lot of turns that s player just rolls for train gets X and then has to wait for quite some time before playing again. However, having said that, I find myself intrigued with the challenge of the game and I am looking forward to my next game. I still thing that this is best played with 3 players. 

[May 8, 2008] Rating goes up to 9. This time I was much more prepared for this game. I had actually read the rules and was more familiar with the game. It was a 3 player game. We lost as the hunter but I did enjoy the game. I think that my appreciation of the game will increase even more with additional plays. The game is full of theme. Almost every rules serves the Dracula theme and not too many euro-style mechanisms have been used. My only complaints so far is that when the hunters lose the trail of the Dracula the level of excitement drops significantly.

[January 17, 2008] I was bored to death by this one during my first playing. But it had to do with my own expectations. I guess if I had learned the rules before playing I would have enjoyed it more. It also didn't help that our Dracula was a very good player and the only one who knew the rules. We didn't have a chance. However, I think I have missed something and I will give it another try, this time after having learned the rules.

I WANT to like this game so much... The components are spectacular, the theme is simply oozing out of the box.  Unfortunately, I've found the game to be nearly impossible and frustrating.  This is the only game I can think of that I lost on purpose just to get the damn thing over with.  

Not to say it isn't fun, but when you play Dracula you are so impotent.  You can't do anything.  The hunters aren't afraid of you at all, not even at night.  I've found it impossible to stay hidden when Dracula.  Then, they just chase you around and you hope they don't catch you because if they do, you're dead.

I've always been dracula, so I don't know how it is to be a hunter.

Why is dracula so weak?

Great game.  It takes a bit of time to play (I would say no less than two hours), but the game is worth it.  The person playing Dracula should be the most experienced, as there are quite a few rules pertaining to his actions; however, it is well worth figuring out and playing.  The concept is just like the previous Scotland Yard game, but adding the gothic theme in old Europe really makes it sing.

Up to four players try to find another player controlling Dracula who is secretly moving around in Europe. However, the hunters can stumble on Dracula's trail, or use special event cards to find his exact location. The hunters must kill Dracula in combat to win. There is a night and day aspect as well, where Dracula is stronger at night. Dracula's movement over Europe is tracked with cards on a sliding 7 card track, which means Dracula cannot visit a city twice within 7 turns. Special event cards allow Dracula or the hunters to break rules of the game or gain special advantages. 

It's an okay thematic update to Scotland Yard, but it plays longer, around two and half to three hours. Fun to play to experience the theme, especially if you have read the novels and are familiar with the characters.

RATING: N/A
Looks great, made by Fantasy Flight, good reviews; only problem is that I already have Scotland Yard and like it a lot which has the disadvantage of not being as deep or as long but also has the advantage of being not as deep or as long. Focusing on just the catching and finding makes the game quick, purely skill based (except starting location) and streamlined. I'm worried that by adding this RP game on top of something like Scotland Yard, it may drag it out too much and de emphasize the finding too much. Though it still overall looks great and if I saw a great deal on it, I would buy it.



UPDATE:
Ninja and Scotland yard work well for me for hidden movement. I think I'll just get letters from white chapel since you can play it two player

RATING: 7
Great Cooperative game.  Really good group strategy and player interaction.  If you are a newbie to this game (like me) then you will probably want to toss this in the garbage the first game since combat is really convoluted at first appears to be rock/paper/scissors.  You will either have needed to study the cards intently/memorized before hand or have 20 plays under your belt.  Download the combat chart in the files section and use this as an aid during the first few games.  With this chart it make the ENTIRE game a great strategy game not just the non-combat portions.

RATING: 6
Very nice components and a strong attention to theme, but still lacking a truly strong feel of danger or horror for the heroes.  A little bit "swingy" in that fortunes for one side or the other can change very rapidly.  While this can be a good thing, it can also be frustrating and lead to players feeling like they haven't accomplished much.  I recommend playing with a full complement of 5 players, hopefully at least half of whom have played the game before.

RATING: 7
Pros:  more action packed and faster than the original.  Dracula is more like Houdini - constantly trying to get out of the latest bind

Cons:  still takes a good while to play.  Closer to three hours (once all players are comfortable!) than two.

It's a good cat/mouse game. It works well in 2P but it's more fun at 5P. Dracula player won't do much in his turn but playing hunters is great, setting up the ambush to catch Dracula. The combat system is very nice, with good flow. The learning could be a bit tricky but it's a simple game, with few replayability.

I've played once but it seems like it takes Scotland Yard and introduces Paper/Scissors/Rock into the mix. Tracking down Dracula is great but the fight mechanism completely falls flat. In our game Mina managed to bust Dracula for about 12 points at night but a fully healthy Van Helsing ended up caught with bad die rolls and while fighting Dracula during the day (who only had 1 blood left) ended up defeated and giving the Count the game. This is badly broken both ways.

Chasing Dracula across Europe is great fun. Being chased by the hunters is even more fun!

Scotland Yard with vampires, done up with beautiful FFG chrome and lotsa bits.  What's not to love?

Well, assuming competent players on all sides, the outta-box game is nearly impossible for Dracula to win.  Everything weighs for the Hunters.  Daytime combat is absolutely predictable.  Still very fun, but also fatalistic.  I can also see this game working well with a parent vs. a bunch of 10-year-olds, teaching them basic deduction skills and whatnot, as long as the parent is Drac at first.

That said, a few rules tweaks help clear up lingering issues and FFG gives suggestions on how to even things out... even if, for some reason, the Hunters feel outgunned and outnumbered.  (My favorite variant is FFG's Republic of Rome-style variant, where only one Hunter can emerge victorious.)

Maybe our game was unusual, but this seems pretty dull. For the first part, you're blindly wandering around Europe hoping that you just stumble upon Drac's trail. This is dull. If you do encounter his trail, you might actually get to do battle or something. In our game, there was one battle with Dracula and he was killed. Seemed pretty anti-climactic. I wouldn't avoid the game, but I'm not going to seek to play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
Deduction game that pits 4 players (Hunters) against another player (Dracula). It has some other mechanics, but the best part is the deduction of Dracula's moving path, as well as Dracula bluffing and dodging skills.

The theme is really well integrated. All the cards reflect some aspect of the novel and it really puts you in the skins of the characters.

The components and graphic aspect is very nice (a bit "old style", reflecting the gothic nature of the story). I like the map, but I would have preferred it to be a bit bigger (even if I don't like unnecesarily big maps).

Maybe the game is too lucky, not only in the combat (Rock, Paper, Scissors + dice), but also in the event cards. There are some ones that are very powerful and can be game changing depending in the moment you get them.

RATING: 6.5
The best thing about this game, for me, is the theme. The gameplay works to add to the theme and the whole game feels like a story of trying to hunt down Vlad Dracul and destroy his minions. Very well done in those aspects. I would rate this game higher if I were a fan of co-operative play. That being said, I will play it if it suggested and often have a good time doing so.

RATING: 6
Fantasy Flight's version of Scotland Yard. Lots of cancelling cards that cancelled your previous cancellation card. I'll have to try this a bit more too see whether there's anything more to it. The combat system is quite original, though.

Anyhow, contrary to most FFG big box games, there's a manageable number of components and component types in the box, and very few exceptions or small details among the rules.

This is a fun game, but a frustrating one as well. Random elements dominate deduction, which is something I do not like (you are constantly drawing cards and rolling dice). However, one is not without control. Unfortunately decision making is not as agonising as I would like. The game is also longer than it merits. This would be a great game if it only played in an hour or so. Now you chace Dracula for an hour or two only to see he escapes. Then you chace some more. For how long are you willing to chace? I chace few times a year.

I like this game a lot. It is a Scotland Yard with a strong setting and a feeling of chasing Dracula. 
However, it looks more like The Flee of Dracula rather than its fury. Moreover, players tend to be objects' accumulators.

That's what you would get by crossing Scotland Yard with Arkham Horror. Awesome game! FoD has been on my monitor since about the birth of Christ, but had too many doubts about its quality, and the friends was totally indifferent about the game. Can't even remember having ever discussed the game outside the internet. Well, that's too bad, because in order to make it short: I Love Fury of Dracula !!!

Four hours flew by, I almost missed the last train, although unfortunately, we still couldn't get the game finished. But anyway, great game! ... At least if you have the time for it and if you think it's more fun to kill the old Count and his minions, rather than to catch Mister X or Jack the Ripper. Unlike Scotland Yard and Whitechapel, Fury of Dracula is a cat-and-mouse game where the roles can change suddenly. Sometimes, it isn't quite clear who's actually the mouse and who's the cat. The tension, the atmosphere - it all seems just right! Possibly an effect of its semi-cooperative nature?  I like teams games a lot, you see. I've briefly considered, but in a rush I can't think of a team game that I did not like. Malefiz, Scotland Yard, Descent, Battlestar Galactica ... even Canasta that I still enjoy playing with the family ,

One thing is certain: Fury of Dracula will come onto my shelf, though probably as the current 3rd edition, first of all because 2nd is hard to get, and second, because of some improvements the 3rd edition is said to have according to my trusted geekbuddies.

Will depend on the group, but this game can be an excellent exercise in deduction between friends.  Regardless the theme is executed brilliantly.

RATING: N/A
What can I say about Fury of Dracula? Well every time we play someone always says "man this is a long game!" But...then they request to play it again and again! We usually play with 2-players playing Dracula. This happens mostly because we always have 1 too many players and because a 2-player team playing Dracula allows more people to learn how to play the dark role (one can be an experienced player and one can be a newbie)! 

A well designed epic search for Dracula...he's crafty and sneaky and gets away easily! He can be weak...surprisingly...in battle! So Drac does far better if he remains hidden!

There was a lot of discussion on Fury on BoardGameGeek when it was first released. I was starting to look at co-operative or semi-coop and it looked good.

It has been a 'steady' game for us, making it to the table every 6-8 weeks.

Dripping with theme. It plays very well, though needs an experienced player to take on the lead role. We also find it good when we have a newcomer (can easily slot into the hunter team and picked up the game) or when someone if coming a little late (we can start and they can take over their character partway through)

We play 5 handed - or 6 handed with the 'Dracula's Minion' option off BGG.

3/2010 - updated rating from 8.25 to 9. Gets better with every playing, even after 5 years. In constant demand in the gaming group. The subtlety and variations (ie replayability) shine through over time.

Although it's really a 2-player game, where one of the players just happens to be broken up amongst 4 human beings, this is maybe my second-least-hated iteration of this idea (my least-hated currently being Mansions of Madness). Playing Dracula is pretty fun! Too bad it comes at the cost of everyone else being sort of bored.

The upgraded version still sees Dracula moving secretly, being chased between the cities of Europe by three detectives. It's a harder deduction than Scotland Yard by allowing only three detectives, and made harder by allowing Dracula to stay still and, if he moves, to offer no clues. If you do land on him, you have to defeat him in combat to win. And if you don't kill Dracula, allow him to escape with no clues as to which direction. Oh, and if Dracula reaches a port, he can travel via sea to any other port, leaving no clues as to where, meaning you have to start all over again. A pretty frustrating par for the course. It just seemed too much like wandering in the dark, not much deductive work, and then succumb to the luck of the events and the combat. Bearable if you're entranced by the theme. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The theme has been adapted brilliantly, second only to the war of the ring! I like the game system, a more sophisticated system than Scotland Yard's, but also more random elements that can drag things down a bit. In the whole a fantastic game though, great fun and interactivity! Should just play in slightly less time to my mind. And also!! Must be played with 5 players! It still works with 4 but less then this is not so fun anymore, and it's best playing with a clever Dracula player!

After giving the third edition a go, I am pleased to own the second version instead. The length of the game has not been significantly improved. I prefer the components of the second edition (specially Drac's encounter tiles are nicer), has got more space around the board for the players, and the combat system never really bothered me much. Also, a big deal is that the Hunters seem to be able to initiate a fight only at night whereas Dracula only at day, to me this is a big deal since it will make Dracula's attempt to fight the hunters less likely than in the second edition where it might be risked in an attempt to win the game by the Dracula player... it's the same game, and the differences are not significant and some of them actually make the game more fiddly (train booking, encounter cards, etc.)

- The rule book is not so super. Great design, yes, but somewhat clumsy. It's difficult to find specific details when you need to check.

Lots of interaction, lots of subtleties and lots of fun. Some may be turned off but events that can change significant things all of a sudden, such as revealing Dracula's current location or allowing Dracula to move to any space on the board, but it keeps everyone in the game and provides a sense of surprise, so not a deal breaker in my opinion.

Un gioco appassionante, con atmosfera, ambientazione e veste grafica di altissimo livello. L'esperienza di gioco è appagante, sia per i Cacciatori che deducono, si organizzano e si aiutano che per Dracula, che gode quando i primi sono totalmente fuori strada e se la fa sotto quando gli sono a un tiro di schioppo. Mai vista così tanta immedesimazione col proprio personaggio da parte di persone a digiuno di boardgame e giochi di ruolo. Un bel cooperativo estremamente calato nell'ambientazione, con un paio di difetti: si passa l'80% del gioco a stanare il Vampiro in una divertente gara di deduzione, ma il duello - uno dei pilastri del gioco - è assolutamente dimenticabile; inoltre, l'enormità di eccezioni, carte evento e casi particolari spezzetta alcune fasi del gioco e obbliga chi non gioca frequentemente a giocare con le regole a portata di mano. Rimane un bel gioco, che purtroppo non può essere proposto spesso a causa della lunga durata di una partita (e un setup molto lungo).

I really want to like this game more, and my score could go up with further plays, but as much as this game is drenched in awesome theme and mechanics, in the end it was four of us futzing around for 2 hours accomplishing nothing.

A game that is probably great with the right group. I thought it was ok. I felt that some of the concepts in this game were better implemented in Middle Earth Quest.

A good choice of game for a thematic October.

RATING: 6
Last play of this was thoroughly disappointing - the event cards handed Dracula to the hunters from the second turn. The most interesting part of the game, trying to deduce Dracula's location, was all but eliminated, leaving only an uninteresting attempt to catch up to Dracula and win the combat dice rolls. Hopefully this was an aberrant game, as I want to like this one. Maybe one more play before I really try to trade it off.

I like this far than the rest of my group.  I think it is simply because I have the willingness to learn a more complex rule set and the patience to play a longer game.  

Sadly I traded this away...  I may re-acquire it again in the future as I really loved the game myself.

Surprised this one is rated so highly. This cooperative, deduction game has lots of theme and appears to be very fun for the Dracula player. For the Hunters, it's basically just wander around the board, picking cards and doing nothing if you can't find Dracula. I've only played the hunters so far, and it was a bit boring. I'll probably like it better if I play as Dracula some time. 

If I'm going to play a me versus the monsters game, I strongly prefer Last Night on Earth.

Who can play?  Strategy game for 2-5 players.

After playing the original release many times, I had to try this newly tweaked version.  All of the changes made were an improvement in my opinion (but not my fellow players).  FFG has ressurected this game for me.  It's now a game of deduction and chase much more than a game of random event cards.  Still, Dracula gets killed every game so far - same as before.

RATING: 6
An odd game.  Scotland Yard with fighting and additional victory conditions.  Have only played as a hunter, and the game has a tremendous ebb and flow to it.  Some rounds are really fun - when you're hot on Dracula's trail, when you have a tremendous amount of weapons and are ready to kick butt, etc.  Other rounds, when you have a general idea where Dracula is but aren't exactly on his trail, when you have all the cards you need, etc., are really boring, and recall fruitless rounds of Talisman, when you draw useless cards and your character is kind of tough, but not tough enough to try to win.

That is, the game is really fun or tense about 2/3 of the time, but the other 1/3 is kind of boring.  If it were always like the fun/tense 2/3, I'd give the game a 9, because it's really fun, even when Dracula is kicking your ass at midnight in London.

UPDATE:  Man, this game brings out the worst in me. The power of the cards are too all over the place, leading to some frustrating plays.  Also, the combat is a glorified "who can roll higher" thing, which isn't all that great.  I have to knock it down a notch.

RATING: 7
Game is fine and has it's flavour. It's fun to play it time to time, but not too often.
The biggest disadventage is combat system, which is very, very random.
Pros:
- Hiding as Dracula and fooling the hunters is really fun, there are many opportunities to do so;
- Game builds real cooperation between hunters.

i was a little underwhelmed when i finally played this.  a Scotland Yard-style deduction game with a good chunk o' chrome.  we spent a good bit of un-fun time trying to track down Dracula.  it got a lot better after we found him, but it still didn't quite deliver on the flavor i had been led to believe was here.  still, a fun time i would repeat.

Excellent theme.  I really like this game but controlling all four of the hunters in a two player game was too much for me.

A game overflowing with theme. Hunting through Europe or being the hunted is exciting. The game can get a little slow for a solo Hunter if they are away from the action or Dracula is being very sneaky.

Take Scotland yard and turn it into a lite RPG, put combat to it, and add lots of flavor to it, and you might think of this game. Lots of visual flair and press-your-luck card flipping. Relies a bit too much on chance. But it's quite a good game nevertheless.

RATING: 7.5
Chase/Hidden path game (Scotland Yard style) game.  The pressure on Dracula to take off is great, and the hunters are well prepared to fight him. There are a couple cards that can make a huge change in the game when they pop-up. The amount of items on the game area make the game look a lot more complex than it actually is. Combat is relatively streamlined, and paper-rock-scissors like.

A good game of deduction and hidden movement. Typically good production from Fantasy Flight, with nice art and components. I do find that some of the cards and abilities, particularly ones that allow players to warp across the board, do take away from that "cat and mouse" aspect of the game. I love that Drac becomes more powerful at night as well. Excellent, simple combat system too.

RATING: 8
Best played with five players, one player plays Dracula and secretly moves around a map of Europe, leaving a trail (and traps), whilst the other players take on four other characters from the novel, attemting to track down the count and lay him to rest once and for all. Strangely enough, although the count can be killed, none of the puny mortals can be killed off completely, but that's a minor complaint. It's a very atmospheric game, and lots of fun for fans of gothic, brooding horror, rather than out and out monster buffy vampire slaying.

I've played the living daylights out of this game.  The best part is playing Dracula, as a hunter the game is okay.  Playing with AP people really drags this one out. Combat with Dracula seems to be a little too random, and Dracula seems a little too weak. Still a group favorite.

RATING: 6
Reminds me of Scotland Yard mixed with Runebound to create a FFG type of game.  Too long for what it is, I think if they removed a couple of the less necessary rules the game would flow better and be much more enjoyable.  As it is, 3 hours is too long to play a hunt down game like this one.  There's a lot of accounting to keep track of, I would recommend only playing with the full compliment of players, as then it feels a little more like a co-operative game.

OWN: 2ND & 3RD EDITIONS

Original comments based on 2nd Edition...

Great integration of theme and plenty of depth. Very clever cards allow for hidden movement of Dracula and clues are gradually revealed to the hunters.

Plays well with only 2 players, although the hunters can be quite an effort for one person (managing all the cards and abilities effectively enough to keep up with Dracula).

If only the game could run a little shorter (maybe with more experience). Scotland Yard makes for a much lighter & quicker alternative, but Garibaldi: La Trafila gets my vote over either - it plays almost as quickly as Scotland Yard with much of the depth of FoD.

WARNING: Rules are lengthier than needed, and poorly organised.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Horrible experience playing this game.  Slow, tedious and frustrating.  The combat system is idiotic.  Managed to corner Dracula, during the day, and through a series of lucky rolls he slaughtered two fully equipped hunters.

Never ever going to play this again.

RATING: 7
One of the best cooprative games there is. Minor balance problems, perhaps.

EDIT: Rating down from 7 --> 9. Too much hidden information in the form of the attack's weaknesses. The game should include a table showing the both the adverse and positive effect versus other cards. Some attacks are nearly invinsible while other are relatively useless.

First play with 4: because of my intolerance of 90 min plus playing time, I tried to shave the time off this session by discarding Mina, and allowing Drac only 4vp to win. Sure enough by 90 mins the desire to play waned, mainly I think due to non active Hunters reduced to spectators: you really need to want an experience (rather than a maths/mental workout Eurogames provide) to tolerate the thumb twiddling. This is more so when combat occurs. From this session I strongly believe this is probably best as a 3 player with the two alternating hunter turns so the non active player can be occupied. The game is an improvement in terms of production and the logic problem of where's Drac is mechanically well done and engages the players (again the dominant hunter giving directions may sour the search, another reason to play with less).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
A game full of gaming elements I highly dislike: Mostly cooperative, lots of chaos and random elements, lots of cards with text on them, stupid Dracula theme with bites and blood, and very long to prolong the suffering. Some people like this kind of games, not me. Furthermore, calling this a deduction game is a misrepresentation.

FOD was a dud as far as I'm concerned. I'm surprised considering I loved Scotland Yard and I played it only several years ago. I don't mind the cat and mouse chase, that's part of the fun (usually). However, combat leaves a lot to be desired. There is no drama just a bunch of stupid dice rolling and cards that leave you with a frustrated feeling. It's hard to spend four hours on a game, most of it just moving around a board to finally corner Dracula (by sheer luck on top of it because we had one card that allowed it) and then storm him with three out of four hunters only to get your ass handed to you. I play board games for three reasons off the top of my head. Number one for fun. Number two for the social aspect. Number three for a challenge. Fun factor was in the negatives, social time is there in most games, this one too, challenge was so so. This won't be getting another play from me.

This game would be much better if two things changed.  One, it needs to be shorter, it takes entirely too long to play this game.  However, the game itself is interesting enough that I would overlook that if only...

The combat system needs to suck less.  I'm fine with dice rolling.  What I'm not fine with is ludicrously random dice rolls.  Rolling a single D6 against another is just dumb.  There are ways to do dice rolling so that it doesn't depend so heavily on luck.  Arkham Horror rolls multiple dice for hits, Risk rolls multiple dice and matches up highest rolls.

This would be a great game if only the combat wasn't so flawed.  I would be hard-pressed to play this game again without some variant which changed combat.  Perhaps rolling two dice and taking the average.

Bleheheh!

After more than two years of hype, I FINALLY paid more than retail for a used copy of the game and we FINALLY played it on Halloween Night. The wait was worth it. Dracula was staked once early on, then led the hunters on a wild chase through Great Britain, escaped via sea, and drew Dr. Seward into a 20-ROUND night combat before being vanquished by a crucifix. As the morning sun vanquished the terrible night, Dracula's final words rang out: "This needs to hit the table again soon."

Juego realmente divertido y muy bien ambientado en la novela de Drácula de Bram Stocker. El juego es una caza de Drácula por toda Europa donde el jugador de Drácula debe evitar se capturado para ganar la partida.

Love this game. Finally got around playing it. Only downside is that it does not work to well with 2 players or 4 (downtime), so you really need to have 3 players or 5. You cannot solo it as well. Other than that. Amazing.

EDIT: The combat system is interesting on first sight but not varied enough to make it truly exciting with only a handful of cards available in the game at all. The same system would be great within a framework of mabye a hundred cards. Also, make sure to play this with Ameritrasher, all others will find the game boring.

I love the cat-and-mouse aspect of this game.  I love that drac is SOMEWHERE on that board, you just don't know where.  I love the asymmetric strategies that hunters and drac have to use.  The game "looks" great, and the theme is top notch (it even made me want to read the novel!).  I would try to get as many players as possible.  While it can be played by two players, the hunter player has quite a bit of work managing all four characters (and their events, items, movement, etc).  Also, combat is relatively infrequent, so if you're looking for a combat-oriented game this isn't it.  Although I don't like that combat is based on a single die roll, I do like the roll that the combat cards play in creating a realistic atmosphere.

RATING: 3
Pros:
1. The Chase - Hunting down Dracula is a blast. Wandering around Europe and stumbling upon Dracula's trail, then trying to work out where he must be is by far the best part of this game.
2. Risky Decisions - During the chase portion of the game, you have to decide do I get items or do I move. It's risky to try and supply at night because you may help dracula. I enjoyed the drama this little, but important decision added to the game.

Cons:
1. Battle System - This is likely the worst battle system I've ever played in a game. Flip a card, check if icons match. Majority of the time, the icons do not match. So, there's a lot of flipping, with nothing happening. Boring.
2. Items - You make risky decisions to potentially add items to use in battle. Then, you use the item once in a battle, the icons usually don't match, then it's discarded. It's hard to see why you should ever bother collecting items. 
3. Dracula Powerful in Battle - Dracula's battle cards are very powerful. Making the battle system infuriating. Not only is random chance that you'll do damage, you're also dealing with ridiculously powerful cards.
4. Length of the game - The game is just generally too long. It's a 2.5 to 3 hour game. The fun portion of the game which is the chase only takes up about an hour. The last 2 hours is just fighting dracula, you lose, he moves, you move to the next city he must be at, you fight, you lose, he move..... rinse and repeat. No drama, nothing to really change it up.

Summary: This game needs a third edition where the emphasis is put on the chase. Or they need some way to make the battles more interesting. The battle portion of the game is boring and repetitive. There's a minimal chance I will ever play this game again.

This should NOT be recommended for newer gamers.

Shockingly unbalanced gameplay, and the overpowering event cards make a mockery of what (IMO) should be a deduction, thief/hunter game. If 3 hours of cat and mouse, decided by "who has the right event card" is your idea of fun, then you'll like this game.

It's the kind of game where if you had the time and patience to invest in playing it enough, it would reward you with better gameplay, and the theme is very nice. [i]My rating of 4 is targetted to the first plays.[/i] Afterwards, I could see it rising to as much as 7.

I'm pretty sure the player who plays Dracula will usually have fun, but the combat system really sucks (no pun intended), and the scoring system is even worse.  So, Dracula created ONE new vampire, lived through 12 turns, and some thug with a pistol killed one of the vampire hunters (see "combat system really sucks" above), therefore Dracula WINS -- when there were only TWO encounters (neither with Dracula himself) during the WHOLE three-hour game?  And people think this game is fun??  It has potential, but I think I'll pass.  (As for the comments like "great components" and "fantastic minis!": HUH?  The little pieces of grey plastic didn't impress me; I don't see the appeal, folks.) Second play: one encounter in the whole two-hour game and Drac dies, the combat system still sucks, and the game is still not much fun. Lowered the rating from 4 to 3.5.

Fury's ratings keep rising with repeat playing.But when I first played, gameplay was slow and repetative with too many event and item cards thrown around. Not enough for the hunters to do except bide their time sorting through the items deck for decent weapons. With four players I just wanted Dracula to be caught and have that stake plunged into his heart as play clicked well over the 90 min mark - and I was Dracula! 

Then I played three players (players controlled two hunters each), and it was far better, even with the odd lull in play. Lots to do, there's always one hunter close to Dracula and the event cards gives each game a different spin. It's even better playing as Dracula! Tense, and dripping with theme.

I'd almost refuse to play this with three - four hunter players, but it's a great three player game (two players may mean too much for the hunter to handle), especially if everyone plays fast and knows the rules.

A friend compared this game to Letters from Whitechapel. I played it and found it a little slow with less action than I expected in a 4 hour game. The player for Dracula was cautious and skilled… chasing our tail most of the game. The sea zones make Dracula's escape too much of a game reset for my tastes. As noted by reviewers, plylay balance may favor Dracula and certainly aides experienced players in combat. I found myself wishing to plan outside of Dracula's earshot.

Four players team to hunt down one on a great looking board of Europe. New players will want to play the hunters but after a time or two, most of the fun is in playing Dracula. The game can lag at times but the end is usually fast and furious.

A liquid gold board game.  So good that it's got me confused enough to label it 'liquid gold'.  The thrill of the chase (note - the chase, not the hunt) is one of the finest PvP moments in any game.

UPDATE:  The above is still true, but I'm lowering the score to 8 in light of the effect that 'Twilight Struggle' has had on me.

Superb production quality. The Dracula theme is integrated very well into the game. The strategy element is reduced by the luck of the event cards, but this does add to the game's fun factor. Overall, an excellent game of "cat and mouse" with planning and deduction. Works best with 3 players (and, maybe, without the Evasion and Hypnosis cards). Since it can easily drag to 3+ hours, it could be a 10 if the game had a shorter playing time.

Comes with a big somewhat complicated rulebook. Once you understand the movement and combat mechanics the game actually moves fairly fast. Seems to be fairly balanced. Dracula player has a lot options and should be played by a more patient advanced gamer.

RATING: 6
This is the 2006 version, an improvement over the 1987 original. An excellent game for those who are into theme. Not my favorite because I'm not into cooperatives, and because the combat (while thematic) is lame: it's rock-paper-scissors, often resulting in an unsatisfactory stalemate.

This is a game that I feel is underrated by BGG.  It is fun, strategic, and very strong in theme.  It's only flaws are a less than perfect rulebook and it's length of play.  If you have the time (3 to 4+ hours) and the patience to hit the faqs and forums the first few times you play, then you are in for a tense game of cat and mouse.

RATING: 7
Few games dig as deep into their themes as this one. If you appreciated Coppola's "Dracula" movie from the early 90's and, like me, fantasized about becoming part of Van Helsing's clique through the maddening chase for the infamous Count, this game is definitely for you. It looks decidedly complex, with all the different card sets and a host of colorful counters, but once you play through a few turns, it'll seem a lot easier and simpler than at first it seemed. That, alas, may be its Achilles' heel. Fury of Dracula, at its core, is a very sophisticated-looking game of Scotland Yard: a bunch of players try to move coordinatedly across a cool-looking board depicting cities of Europe, in order to flush Dracula (secretly moved around by one player) out of his hiding place -- whatever that may be. Granted, there are many perils to face aside from the maddening Train die, but they should come out more often -- zombies, vampires, human minions, even bats appear much less frequently than expected. And when they do, they mostly spit out a delaying special effect, then vanish. Where's the blood and guts? Where's the fighting glory? Worse yet, when you actually go head to head against an opponent, the fighting mechanic ends up being somewhat repetitive. Once you figure out the Item cards, it becomes a little predictable too. All in all, this game takes a few more hours to play than a game of this weight class should -- but boy, what a ride! Like I said, it's beautiful and any horror fan cannot go without at least one play. Lack of strong replayability is precisely what I fear the most. I will definitely research that with borrowed copies, instead of purchasing my own.

Excellent game. Not too difficult to understand for gamers, although there are many rules and subrules. The basic game is easy enough, but a lot depends on Dracula's skills to stay hidden and the hunters' skill to find and destroy him. May be a tad long (definitely more than the 2 hours suggested), but well worth the time. We had quite a good time out of trying to nail Dracula to a stake...
I now believe I prefer this coop game, even more than Shadows. It is at the same time more individualized and more coop. Also, the Evil is sitting right in front of you, which makes more concrete the need to speak half thoughts and rally together to defeat him/her.

This game is great. The hunters against the hunted mechanic works for me very well. The game is very thematic and find myself getting wrapped up in hunting Dracula. The game gets frusterating when things aren't going your way, but nobody said that it was easy to be a Dracula hunter or Dracula himself. Everything about this game just works for me and there is rarely a time when I won't play it. I'm in love with this game.

RATING: 6
A decent update of the original game.  Dracula has become much easier to find but much harder to defeat.  Some sense of mystery and drama is lost since the hunters almost always know where Dracula is.  I think the new edition actually goes too far in its quest for "balance", introducing a bunch of fiddly mechanisms and special rules at the expense of theme and gameplay.  It comes off feeling somewhat artificial and most of the new mechanisms up the complexity and length while chipping significantly away at the theme.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.15
One player controls Dracula, the other players the four hunters. Dracula must evade capture for six days, less if he can leave a trail of newly sired vampires behind him, the hunters must close in and kill him.
Dracula is moved secretly using location cards, the Hunters must pick up his trail and close in. But beware the game swings between Night and Day and in the Night Dracula can turn the tables with the hunters becoming the hunted.
Fury of Dracula is of course based on an old game, no not the original Fury of Dracula some twenty years ago, the classic Scotland Yard, in which team of detectives try to find the secretive Mr X on a map of London. Fury of Dracula is Scotland Yard with bells and whistles. 
So the game rests or falls on the basic premise of picking up clues about Dracula's (Mr X) hidden movement. In this the game surpasses the original. The use of cards to leave a trail is genuinely clever. But do all the other elements in the game overwhelm that central concept?
A little bit. Some of them, such as the rather involved combat mechanism to resolve an encounter seem convoluted (especially since there 20+ cards in the game required just to resolve a fairly straightforward paper-scissor-stones element of it). Likewise, characters are constantly cycling item and event cards throughout the game without apparently achieving anything. 
Some of the changes from the original (bites, vampires, weapons, etc) are thematically needed, some (such as Dracula being able to turn the tables at night) Scotland Yard actually needed to prevent the game becoming scripted, but a lot of what is here feels like hammers to crack nuts.
Had the designers made a simpler game they would probably have made a better game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.1
One of our first cooperative games, this is light hearted fun.  Would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a quick coop game. (Did I really say quick , OMG! what was I thinking, having got several co-op games under my belt, this can in the wrong hands feel anything but quick and is not a true coop game as someone is always Dracula).
Having played this game on and off for a couple of years, I would say that the games can become a bit repetitive, but don't let this deter you from a very well designed and balanced game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I'm very surprised how highly rated the game is.  At first it seemed pretty good, although the odds seemed a little stacked against Dracula at first, and the fighting mechanic depends far more on dice rolls than strategy.  However, when I got into it, I began to see how the game balance worked out, and I saw the appeal of the game...to the human players.

The bottom line: it's no fun to play as Dracula.  You have very few choices, it's a long time between your turns, and for a dark monster, you seem to run away and get 'staked' a lot.  

I really wish the designers of the game found a way to automate the part of Dracula, like in Arkham Horror with the dark elder gods.  With this, someone's left doing almost nothing, and when it is their turn, they're in a constant state of retreat.  That's far from what I'd call fun.

It's not a short game (most FFG games aren't, I suppose,) but it's very fun. Lots of tension and theme in this one. It can get a little luck-heavy, but I think that actually works in favor: it encourages trying aggressive/desperate moves. Key, though, is that while luck is there, it doesn't override the advantages the different sides have during night/day.

Very similar game to the original.  My comments for that one still apply here:

[i]Nice theme - feels like a hunt for Dracula especially when the hunters close in on the trail. Can be a bit slow at start - but the hunters need to work together (don't forget that it is a cooperative game for the hunters). There might be some downtime, waiting, possible runs of bad luck (can't get a train to move, stuck in fog, storm etc).[/i]

It is the game length that takes down the rating a notch between "usually willing to play" and "play when in the right mood (and have time).

Good hide-and-seek game with several drawbacks.
-2 points for anti-climatic final showdown, where all your hiding (or seeking) ends by mindless dice rolling mayhem.
Hint for beginner Dracula: your main goal is to hide and watch the players defeat, not the direct confrontation.

Update. Lowered the initial rating after dull and lengthly game where hunters made all correct decisions, but Dracula simply had better luck with cards and dice. After 4 hrs of the play we were exhausted beyond measure.

15-06-2014. Upgraded rating back to 7. Had a discussion with one of the players in the infamous game I downrated Fury for. Reminiscing, I would like to play it again. I do like the game, and the bad taste of the previous game has faded.

18-02-2014. Played this game for the second time today. I liked it when I played it first a year ago and quite liked it (would rate 7). This time it completely fell flat (2).  

I like the mechanics, but in our case the randomness of the card meant we swarmed Dracula because of many hypnosis cards. We did not play with a common houserule, so this game for sure needs to be played more in order to cement my opinion of it more strongly.

For now, a cautious 6.

Got to play this game on Halloween and I really love the "hunt down Dracula" theme. Hunting a thinking human rather than a computer controlled character or a random dice roll character is awesome. They make decisions just like every other player and suffer for the bad ones. I would definitely play this again. The 3 hour game didn't feel like that at all. In fact I think it ended sooner than it should have.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I really like the way Dracula's hidden movement is done, and how he places Encounters for the Hunters to meet when they come upon his path.  But that's about all I like.  The Hunters' actions, beyond movement, are often pointless - a lot of switching out items when they hit their max limit - and we particularly dislike combat - I was expecting something more like the rock-paper-scissor dynamics of Yomi, trying to second guess what card the opponent is going to play, but usually you just alternate between your 2 best cards, hoping to roll better. I don't like the die rolling at all in this case.  The theme is pretty well portrayed, but the clunky gameplay just prevents it from engrossing me, unlike for example Pandemic where the theme is more minimal but the mechanics are so elegant that at least I am able to really feel the theme when I'm playing it.  I still need to try Letters from Whitechapel - I hope it's much better.

Update: Letters from Whitechapel is much better.  Simpler mechanics, turns go faster. The way the detectives try to unearth Jack's path is more interesting than running into Dracula's encounters.

Have mostly played with just 2 players. Fairly complex game, not very easy to learn. But once you have a good grasp, it gets more enjoyable with every play. The theme is great and the mechanics seem well developed and suited to this game. Gameplay is fast with only 2 players with little downtime. The way the momentum can shift multiple times in this game adds a great deal of excitement. My wife was new to gaming and not a fan of complicated games, but loved playing this almost from the beginning.

RATING: 7
I enjoy this game, but nobody else in my group does.  Probably because i always win as Dracula, and I usually play dracula since I know the rules the best.  The one time I didn't play Dracula, we hunted down the evil vampire in a few quick turns and quickly destroyed him.  I think that ruined it for one of the guys in my gaming group.  We haven't played it since, but I really enjoyed this game.

It's a gun game of cat and mouse, but the thing is sometimes the cat is stronger (during the day), othertimes the mouse turns into a freakishly powerful being and is much more powerful (Dracula during the night).  I love the game concept of hide-and-go-seek, strategy of what monsters to lay where and where to run, the rock paper scissor like figthing mechanism, the changing of power with the coming and going of daylight, and more.  It's a shame my group doesn't like this game more.  I recommend it.

First impressions: I've been very interested in hidden movement games and this is the first I've played. I enjoyed the game thoroughly as Dracula. It was tense running from the hunters when they were close, then preparing to strike back when they weren't. I feel a keen narrative building up through the game. I was able to ignore the slow time progression suggested by the day/night track and to imagine instead a moon phase track on it.

Want to try the hunter side and see what that's like. Considering a buying decision.

A little bit heavy, too much rules, but, we are talking about a great ameritrash here! The game flows tense, and players was getting crazy on thinking about where the Dracula went and how he could reach that point haha (Yes, I played Dracula).

Dracula must beat some hunters and mature some new vampires to win while hunters must hunt and kill Dracula. The scheme of event cards, rest and combat are great. The hunters clearly have some advantage in getting some item all the time, the most events are for hunters and they always use that resolve track stuff.

Nice to play with some good friends (:

This is just about the best thematic experience available besides Battlestar Galactica. It's got such a great balance between solid intuitive mechanics and pervasive theme. The Gothic horror atmosphere is very real, and there is a tension between wanting to find Dracula, and not wanting to have to fight him. The balance is surprisingly sharp. Dracula is harder to play well, but when he's used properly, he dictates the entire flow and feel of the game. There's a lot of randomness associated with the combat, but I really like the feel, and it makes everyone think twice before engaging. One of the best games out there.

Played this game once, and absolutely LOVED it. Then it sat on the shelf for a few months, and I saw the writing on the wall...it was never going to get played due to its length. So I traded it away. It was the one regret I made while trading. I have been thinking about it for about a year now, how I really want to play it again, but it's out of print, and then I saw a copy sitting at my FLGS, and it just kind of gnawed at me. Eventually I caved and bought it! Now I'm itching to play again!!!

A game where theme drips out of every pore! Everything helps to make the atmosphere even more tense and dark: the wondergul miniatures, the outstanding map of Europe on the gameboard, all the items, cards, dice ... all components fit together in a harmonical way. The game itself is absolutely exciting with the Dracula player being the hunted in most cases. Hard decisions have to be made and Van Helsing and his friends really have to plan together if they will prevail over the lord of darkness. This is an absolutely gorgeous game ... it just deserves to hit the table more often!

The original version of this was my first boardgame.  The new version is very sexy, plays great with the soundtrack to Coppola's Dracula playing in the background. Its a bit fiddly, especially with the hunters' cards.

RATING: 8
A fun semi-cooperative game, reminiscent of Scotland Yard, with a system for what to do when you actually get the bad-guy.

Works great with two players, and though it can be frustrating, there's enough tactics there to make the game skill, rather than luck, based.

Unimpressed. You could play the game smart and still be screwed by the dice. Cards that Dracula plays to force others to discard are just plain frustrating - especially after working on acquiring them over several turns - yes i get what this mechanic is trying to do, but comparing to the other cooperative vampire game I know (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), this one is a drag. Plays quite long. It helps if you get into theme.

RATING: 7
Very nice game in the same vein as [i]Scotland Yard[/i] and [i]Clue: The Great Museum Caper[/i], in which the Dracula player mainly tries to stay undercover to achieve his objectives of spreading vampires and death all over Europe, and the Hunters look forward to find him and destroy him before it is too late.  Dracula is stronger at night, so there is also a very interesting timing aspect, a kind of cat and mouse game, because obviously Van Helsing and his mates will prefer to ambush him during the day and will work in that direction, if possible.

Great co-op/competitive fun. About 1 hour long if Dracula plays aggresively. If Drac is evasive and whittles the Hunters down (basically, playing smart) it's less fun for the majority and a much longer (2-4 hours) game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a relatively easy game to master in terms of rules. It's also great fun to try to work out Dracula's location, close in on him and try to kill him before he can use his powers to evade the Hunters. The game ultimately depends on the skill of the Dracula player and the luck of the Hunters, both in terms of which cards they draw and which cities they travel to. Let me repeat: this game is fun and it's very thematic! While initially a little complicated, combat is fun too. The damage suffered by the losing combatant depends entirely on what both combatants tried to do during the fight, bringing an element of prediction to the game.

If you get easily frustrated at random card draws allowing Dracula to escape at the last second, I don't think this game is for you. And it can be frustrating if you finally managed to corner Dracula just for him to teleport to the other side of Europe.

So I only played once, but when a game plays this poorly even once, its got something fundamentally wrong with it.  We played for 4 hours before we gave up on it.  One of our players never even got to roll for combat once in that 4 hour span.  Its just too easy for Dracula to escape and drag the game on and on.  You can have him completely cornered, only to have him use a power to skate right past you.  Or you can be tracking him closely for hours only to have an event card put him anywhere on the board erasing all of your work.

I love cooperative games, and Fury of Dracula really brings people together in an exciting way. One person plays as Dracula, and the others (up to 4) play as vampire hunters, chasing Dracula across Europe. 

At first, it seems like the hunters have no chance of winning, but we've found that you have to be really devious to win as Dracula. 

This is one of our favorites for its stealth-based strategy and its ability to turn one person into a villain for the evening.

RATING: 7
Rating based on an incomplete play. The rules, and my 1.5 hours playing it, suggest this is an excellent deduction game, but the game seems to bog down in terms of understanding the unnecessarily complex combat system. It's a shame the rules aren't a little simpler, because there's a really good game in the deduction and cooperation involved. As it is, I do not feel confident getting people to play this game, since it has so much fluff around the meat.

=============

Middle-Earth Quest streamlined things a lot, and its combat system glitters when compared to FoD. But will try this again now that I'm more into Ameritrash.

- There is one part of the game about finding dracula/not being found. And then there is the fighting part... and it's not balanced on purpose because by night Dracula is MUCH stronger. I'm not sure those two parts fits well togheter. NEED MORE GAMES to check that

Based on creativity Bram Stoker's Irish author of "Dracula" this board game is nice opportunity to spending time with people who like beautiful games and interesting rules. Even my wife who doesn't like any board game (poor me) sometimes she's break her dislike. Very pretty components and board. And small miniatures are so cute so they make "Fury of Dracula" so unique game in my collection. I also remember 1st edition of this game published in Poland by "Sfera" publishing. Was called "Wampire" and rules were pretty similar, but as you can imagine components were so bad. I think that edition of Polish "Fury of Dracula" was illegal but I can be wrong.

I really wanted to like this game a lot more than I did.  I have been a big fan of Scotland Yard for a really long time.  This seemed like an interesting take on that game.  In actuality, it dragged a lot when we played.  While we won as the detectives, it didn't seem like we did all that much.  It certainly wasn't very fulfilling and was even less fun.  I was so disappointed.  [06/28/2009]

It has been a looooong time since I played it last.
What really drove me away from the game was my bad luck at dice chucking (like you wouldn't believe!) and long play time.
As my collection filled shelves, people wanted to play more than one game on an evening. Just how the life goes...
Hopefully the third edition will mitigate some of those hindrances.

Rating for first game. Willing to play again but not soon. 

The good news is that it's less clutter than recent FFG releases (both rules and graphic), bad news is: drags. I'm not sure deduction aspect really works as actually it's only part of the solution. Even if you know where Dracula is, getting there in time is a pain. Probably more fun if Dracula would play more aggressively than it did with my first and only game, then again Dracula did win - so aggressive play should be supported yb the rules (and isn't). Would also probably be more fun if we read all the text out loud. 

Second game: all you need is a good atmosphere. Then it works-.

[3 plays, 5 player and 4 player games] Atmospheric and challenging collaborative game. In this genre, I like this better than Shadows Over Camelot. I'm eager to play this at least several more times in the next year. In my second playing I was fortunate to get to play Dracula and learn the game from that perspective. I did a pretty decent job "hosting" the game for the hunters. They lucked onto my trail extremely early with the newspaper report, but I was able to push into a fight with Mina Harker, kill her, elude them for a minute, fight and damage Van Helsing, mature a vampire, and then slip out to sea and run out the clock. I very much enjoyed the experience. I fully expect this will be fun as a 2 player game as well.

I may have even further comments when I have more experience, but for now I'll sum up by saying this is a beautifully produced and clever game.

Most recent play 8-30-10 with Michael, Brian P, Brian R, and Joel.

RATING: 7.5
I'm a big fan and owner of the original. I'm sorely tempted to pick this one up but have been rather disappointed by FFG releases of late (lots of bits and flash but no soul). This one has good heritage so it may come out well.

Then again, FFG didn't do so well with Arkham Horror so who knows?

UPDATE:

I caved and bought the new edition. Verdict? The game stays true to the original and has some well developed features. I like the new night/day conditions. I like the addition of Mina Harker for 5 players. The package is well made and looks handsome.

What did I not like? Well, I'm not a fan of the huge amount of cards the Dracula player has to deal with. I like the old screen (easier to manage. If a Dracula player cheats, that's just sad). I also imagined that the redevelopment would shave playtime but it's actually as long or potentially longer than the original. This is probably owing to the fixed Dracula victory conditions of getting 6 vampire points.

All in all, I would say that the new developments amount to a 10% improvement over the original and isn't really worth the upgrade for the owners of the original.

I have a weak spot for GW classics, so had to get Fury of Dracula of course. In theory FoD is a exciting Dracula hunt across Europe. The calculation & deduction mechanics promise a tight and thrilling experience.. but due to some powerful cards the game can take a really long time and for me at least it becomes just tedious. Now this worked just fine in the 80's I'm sure. These days we know that a game like this can be designed so that it doesn't drag on forever. Darn, the theme is nice and everything..

This game is very similar to Scotland Yard in its deductive logic.  But instead of relying on a mechanism to help figure out the location of the elusive Dracula, you must make good use of events.  This adds a bit of luck that can slightly tilt things one way or the other in what seems like a closely matched game.

Works really well to build tension, a good blend of search (eg Scotland Yard) and player interaction.  I just wish it was an hour shorter - we typically take 3+ hours, and that's a LONG time.  At 2 hours, it would be an 8 at least.

RATING: 4
Here is another game I would like to be completely ga-ga over, but cannot. Production and theme are both very nice, and we all enjoyed the cat and mouse game of trying to pin down Dracula. The event cards, encounters, movement, and deduction aspects of the game are all fun and well executed. Combat is a morass though. Tedious, time-consuming, and full of checking for modifiers, etc. The game also suffers from being unnecessarily complex for the experience it provides, and too long. We played for three hours, at which point Dracula had two of the needed six points to win (the Hunters were able to diminish a strong early lead on Drac's part), and Dracula was at full strength. Especially frustrating for the Hunters: they had worked to get Dracula right where they wanted him, and he used an Evasion card which allowed him to "teleport" anywhere in Europe. So at nearly three hours, the game basically started over again. Argh! We could have played another good group game three times over by this point. This made playing the game feel pointless.

The rules, while being accurate, are not concise. Part of this can be explained by all the fiddly elements of the game which have to be explained: the day-night counter has to be moved at the beginning of Dracula's turn, and moving to Dawn causes the Vampire track and the Hunter's Resolve track to each increase by one and any Hunter can redeem a Resolve Point to do one of such and such actions, and during combat any Hunter can play a card to modify combat but only at the beginning of combat but only the combating Hunter can play cards affecting combat once combat begins and some encounters can be "matured" to provide extra bonuses for Dracula once they move off his Trail Track but only certain encounters, and Dracula has to play blood points to do certain actions, and so on and so forth. Even with all this, the rules were a bit frustrating. Reading through them, there is a lot of: "...which leads to combat - see page XX for a description of combat." If you are reading the rules trying to get a feel for the sequence of play, this constant "go look at page such and such" is a pain. All of this complexity is for a purpose: Fury of Dracula tries to faithfully recreate the environment of Stoker's Dracula, albeit ten years later. So it makes sense, for example, that you cannot travel as fast by train in Eastern Europe, as the transit system there was less developed during the period. Unfortunately, the complexity introduced by this kind of accuracy detracted from the game for our group.

Combat is accomplished by a combination of dice rolling and card playing, and not only dragged on for too long, but created very little tension. It is no surprise to see people inventing all sorts of combat variants. A system like that used in Lord of the Rings: the Confrontation, would have been really excellent here. Too bad.

Cons: - you may need to have the immortality of the undead to last through a game
      - a lot of complexity for what it delivers
      - combat not fun
      - unbalanced by a few cards
Pros: - dripping with theme - it really does feel like a hunt for Dracula
      - the combination of guessing and calculating to discover Dracula's location
      - beautiful production

To be fair, this is not a board game emerging from the European school of design, where complex strategies emerge from a simple set of rules. It's a big, messy American affair. The original came out in the mid-80s, preceding many of the favorite games on the Geek. I had hoped that this iteration would take advantage of recent developments in design, but it didn't seem to. I desperately want to love this game, but I feel as if I'd have to rework many aspects to get it to play in about 90-120 minutes: new combat system, revision of event card deck, reduction of fiddly simulation elements, and so on. Bottom line is we can have a lot more fun in three hours with other games. I'd like to see FoD get further plays, but I'm going to have to do a lot of convincing to make that happen.

I love the theme, I love the mechanics, I love the components and I love the feel of gameplay. 
Probably the best adventure game I own and one I always use for non-gamers when I want to show off to newcomers. 
It does require an experienced Dracula to make the game truly shine. One good thing about it is that since it is so immersive, the players needn't even invest much in roleplaying the hell out of it. Merely saying "I'll take the train to Paris, meet me later in Genova" sort of does the trick.

RATING: 9
Like most 1vAll games, the experience depends on the Dracula player. If he isn't tricky enough to present a constant feeling of challenge, then the hunters will get bored.

And even then the experience can be possibly lopsided. But when it works just right (which seems more often than not with competent play), this is a long, epic game that creates some great stories and feels pretty good to play, despite feeling a little underdeveloped by modern standards. The rules are so simple and intuitive and the concept and teamwork is enjoyable to the point where I'd almost call this a great gateway game, if it weren't for the length being off-putting to most non-gamers.

I really like the way both sides feel boht powerful and frustrating to the other. It really helps to create the atmosphere and encourage fear in both sides. Classic super villian vs hero thing going on, with each side one-upping each other all the time... but falling constantly one step short of actually defeating their opponent. 

As the hunters, you can know exactly where Dracula is, only to be crushed a moment later when he orchestrates a roadblock to cut off your pursuit, head low in his horse and carriage while you struggle with the obstacle. Or as Dracula, you can set up the perfect series of decoys for the Hunters, but the train delay works in their favor, your Minions fail you, and you end up face to face with a would-be-victim wielding a stake. Moments like these create a compelling narrative that directs your attention away from the fact that you're hardly doing anything on your turn, and that that's been going on for 3 hours.

[b]Player Counts[/b]: You may think this might work better with fewer players, maybe even 2 since there is less downtime and more for each individual hunter to handle, but increased fiddliness (managing separate hands) and lack of discussion  -- this game depends on a verbally active table, both for the benefit of Dracula overhearing discussion and for the spirit of teamwork among the hunters makes more players better I thikn.

RATING: 8
I'm big on theme, and since this game just drips with atmosophere, I had a good feeling about it.  I was unsure if my gaming group would like it or not.

I brought it to the table and it turns out we all had a blast.  Yes the game is unbalanced and has some problems, but the adventure and challenge and sheer fun of it all overcomes those issues for me and my group.  The biggest design flaw that we encountered was the random flucuation of power based on cards and encounters; Dracula could draw the vampire spawn encounter at the beginning and lay it down on his second turn.  He could also potentially receive at any time the card that lets him teleport anywhere - his new location isn't really the problem so much as his old encounters he left, if he was undiscovered.

Regardless, we did enjoy Fury of Dracula, and if the game's concept and theme appeals to you enough, then you probably will too.

I really enjoy playing as Dracula and the tension this game creates. There's a certain urgency for the players to figure out where you are. The only problem is that if the Dracula player is especially good at remaining undetected it makes it pretty boring for the other players who are essentially just moving their characters around and collecting event and item cards. I guess I need to play it more to develop new strategies and maybe even attempt to play more offensively as Dracula to mix things up a little.

RATING: 6
Rating based on two plays. This is an interesting game that balances on an edge. At times, it seems too easy for Dracula, then once you catch his trail it seems too hard from him. Then he escapes and later the tables turn... again and again. Very fun. For a Hunter, there's a fine line between dead meat and a tank, but at least it's easy to collect items. I'll play it again. Our second play took twice as long and ended with Dracula (myself) voluntarily not using my Escape card in daylight to fight the weakest Hunter and end the misery. I think I'll drop the rating a point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Definitely needs some house rules and tweaking to be fun (for sure ditch/fix the card that lets Dracula move anywhere on the board for free -- it can be a bit of a game ruiner). A lot of the game design seems a bit lazy. But, I do love the secret movement / tracking aspect of the game.

RATING: 7
Assessment after a few plays:  The theme is absolutely spot-on, but I had no sense of excitement or tension while playing, and it seemed to just die at the end.  Like...oh, it's over.  I should also say that I had been looking forward to playing this for a LONG time, so maybe my reaction is due to unrealistic expectations.  There are some too-powerful cards in both the hunters' and Dracula's decks.

Basically, Scotland Yard taken to fiddly excess with a glut of situational modifiers.  Perhaps it will be more fun once I'm not constantly referring the obtusely organized ruleset.

This game would rate higher if the rules weren't written in such a sloppy way.  A person has to EXPECT rules arguments every time because of numerous unclear areas.  Great game, miserable rulebook.

Хорошая кооперативная игра, где играешь не против доски, а против игрока. Исполнение от ФФГ (в локализации Смарта и с моей покраской) мне нравится. В течении игры будут погони, отчаянные схватки и неожиданные (часто неприятные для игрока) сюрпризы. Хотя в правилах постоянно говорится о том, что Дракула может жульничать, однако этим больше грешат Охотнички :)  - "разом їх багато, їх не подолати". Графу остается лишь гордо вскинуть голову и со словами: "Пусть вас орда, а я один, мне все равно - я паладин :)" обнажить клыки и ринуться в бой.
Есть своего рода дисбаланс, но это регулируется рядом официально приводимых в конце правил опций.
Исполнение и локализация - 5+, игра - 5- (+0.5 за атмосф-ть, -0.5 за корп-ный сеттинг, -0.5 просто субъективно).

I'll start with what I like. Fury of Dracula is engrossing. The rules make sense in context. Each character is and feels unique. Also, there's a sense of urgency as Dracula gets ever closer to victory. But here's what I dislike: Fury feels clunkier than Scotland Yard. Movement happens more slowly and combat isn't as decisive as you'd expect. I'd have preferred a more powerful but more easily discoverable Count. I wish he had more incentives to attack. There's a great game here underneath the decent one.

Really enjoyed it at the beginning, but I've lost interest with each play.  It's very difficult for Dracula to do much, so it becomes a cat and mouse game where Dracula just runs runs runs.

RATING: 7
It's enjoyable, but has flaws. In 5 or so games, we've only beaten Dracula once and in that game the player who was Dracula made a pretty objectively bad move. We had the most fun when Dracula tries to sound like Dracula from film. The combat system was a bit confusing at times, with some interactions we weren't sure how to resolve. Overall though, I would play it again.

RATING: 7
Great game we used to play a lot. Deducing where Dracula is, trying to catch him, worrying about "if I catch him, or he was here, I may be in trouble, do I go for it or rather wait?". The situation where you almost get him, but you leave a small gap in your net and he gets away, that is interesting and can be sometimes frustrating. But it has a very engaging gameplay, the pieces get you into the theme even more and you feel like in a horror game. Really great work. The only thing that made us stop playing it so much, there were not enough players who would be good as a Dracula, so we had just 2 people, who played him. Thus it kind of got old. But if you don't mind someone being the Dracula, this is a great horror themed deduction game.

It can be quite long, that is probably the negative I have for this game. To me, it is a very fun game of one (Dracula) vs. the group (the Hunters), I like tracing Dracula's steps, this feeling of "He's there, we almost got him, wait, where did he sneak to now?" is quite priceless. The character of Dracula is very powerful but he is up against 4 others (ideally you play this with the full 5 players). I am a bit disappointed with the dice combat, you do attack with cards but which card eventually conquers is decided by dice. The game trumps though with its strong, engaging thematic experience, it has tension, nice components round the picture, overall lots of fun.

This is the FFG version.  Interesting deduction mechanic; trying to pen Dracula in while not trying to take him on while it is dark.   I am not sure how balanced it is and I don’t really like the combat mechanic as it seemed overly complex for how simple It really is.  I would play it again to see if my opinion changes but I am not sure. It will.

FFG's botched re-design of the old GW classic, Fury of Dracula, a brilliant game which I have played literally hundreds of times, and one of my few 10s. My buddy and I played the new one 4 times before returning to the original, which we both agree is far superior.

Where did FFG go wrong? For one thing they took an elegant, map-based movement system, and replaced it with an abstract card-based system that is so awkward and contrived that it requires special rules and work-arounds for Dracula to do something as simple as reverse his course. For another, they took a clean, exciting combat system, and made it slower and more complex, but no more interesting.

I honestly can't find one positive thing to say about the re-design. The original was a far better game - I won't waste another minute playing this one.

I recently started a game of Fury of Dracula (actually the third edition).  I've played many games since I last played Fury of Dracula and feel that is worse than I thought it was on reflection.  I used to rate it a 6 and have downgraded it to a 5, because while I might play it now, I would only do so with great reluctance.  

The game is overly long.  In either the new or the old version it is fiddly with unsatisfying combat.  I find that instead of it building tension, it tends to build frustration for both Dracula and the Hunters.  I don't know why this has become a classic and why it has lasted.  There are certainly many games that were better than it where the original design dates back as far that now languish in obscurity and that do not get these deluxe reprints.

I'll tell you why Dracula is furious - BECAUSE MINA KEEPS KILLING HIM!!  That, and the hunters keep finding me, I mean HIM, on THE FIRST GAME TURN, including one game where he was discovered even BEFORE he had even had a chance to make his FIRST MOVE.  And yet I keep wanting to come back for more.  Despite the rather excessive length of the game, my wife and I have found it makes for a very enjoyable evening (or two) of gaming.  Our first game was decidedly one-sided as Dracula was discovered and defeated in a few short turns, but he learned a few things from that one and the second game was a four hour nail-biter which quite literally could not have been any closer (the very last die roll of the very last turn decided the winner, with Mina, of course, coming out on top).  [Edit: Mina killed me yet AGAIN, and once again the game came down to the very last roll of the dice!]  It might have been nice if the game was a little more stream-lined and quicker to play through (see the "excessive game length" comment above), but I imagine to do that would mean taking away some of its depth.  So if you have the patience to sit through an hour of rules explanations for new players, ten minutes of set-up time, and two to four hours of playing time, you might just find it to be worth your while.  (If not, then give "Scotland Yard" a try.)  In my opinion, it does a great job combining the exciting cat-and-mouse elements of "Scotland Yard" with a rather unique combat system, to produce a game of hiding, seeking, running, chasing, booby-trapping (that sounds exciting!), collecting, and fighting that is fun for both sides.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4.5/5  Total: 9/10

This game has both good and bad points in my opinion.  The theme is great, and it is well incorporated into the game.  The bits are top notch and very practical.  The rules are also pretty easy to understand.  Early in the game it is fun as the hunters try to find dracula's trail.  Once the trail is found and extrapolated to Dracula's current position then the game gets somewhat drier.  I say this because once Dracula's position is determined, it's very difficult for him to get points via maturing encounters.  That's assuming he even has the encounters to mature for points.  Thus you have to resort to combat against the hunters and try to kill them as the only good source of points.  The combat, while simple, quickly becomes very repetetive as combatants keep playing the same 2 cards again and again b/c they offer the optimal possible outcomes.  Granted, I have only played this game once, but it left me with just a so-so feeling.  I am willing to try it again though.

RATING: 3
Looks pretty, but suffers from the FFG "too much extra fluff" problem.  Sometimes simplicity is better, esp in a game like this.  I find the game just drags if your can't find Dracula right away... once you do it's a pretty slick operation of cat and mouse.  Kind of like Scotland Yard, only a little more frustrating.

I am really starting to think Co-op games aren't my thing.  Great components, theme, and idea, but I just didn't have all that much fun chasing Dracula around.  The game mechanics didn't really interest me, and I didn't have much fun making decisions.  Most of the stuff I did seemed pretty obvious.  Certain Dracula cards seem ridiculously powerful (evasion, the point of entry one where the hunter loses all their stuff).  Has the potential to be dramatic and exciting, but can also drag on boringly.  I suppose I tend to play board games to outthink other players, and video games for dramatic experiences in game form.  It doesn't have to be as cut and dried as that, but so far it has been.  Rating based mostly on desire to play again.

This game just bored me through the bulk of its overlong running time, until a relatively quick bit of dice-rolling combat finished off Dracula. Honestly, if I'd just taken a three-hour nap then played a quick game of Yahtzee, I think the graph of my excitement levels would have looked pretty much the same.

Game steeped in theme.  Game play is slightly dull and too long.  Very little combat or action.  The Hunters play a guessing game which can get frustrating.  Playing Dracula is definitely more fun.

[Several plays] It is fun to hunt and deduce where Dracula was hiding or going.  It struck me as being along the same lines as Scotland Yard only better and more exciting.  Sure it does have some completely random things, but really I don't think its goal is to be a hardcore strategy game, so that was to be expected.  The rules are a bit more complicated than they need to be, and that the game can take a rather long time.  I reduced my rating by .5.  It is a game I have to be in the right mood to play.  It is not a game that hits the table on a regular basis, but when am in the mood for it, it can be a pretty fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[FFG 06 edition] {Vampire; deduction, cooperative, secret-unit, angel-vs-devil; optimal 5p} FoD is a very thematic game. It has the elements that I like - deduction and cooperative.  However, the learning curve is quite long; it may need 1 whole game for everyone, esp. Dracula, to understand the functions of the cards, items and encounter markers. It's not easy to explain the rules clearly unless you are an experienced game host.

It is a game that is very dependent on the players. If the players are conservative and narrow-minded, it can become quite boring.

The down time can be strong with slow players. A minor problem is that resolution of a fight can take long.

The components are nicely made. They are very effective and informative. However, some tokens are too small, which has to be handled carefully.

Rating based on one 4-hour game. I immediately wanted to play again. What a fun game with a well-integrated theme. Combat is a bit clunky, but the "cat-and-mouse" game is excellent.

Played twice now.  The deduction portions of the game are neat, and things like the mixed Event deck are very unique and interesting.  However, the game itself feels a bit dry and plodding in many ways, and the combat system just -fails- in my opinion.  Absolutely boring dice-modified rock scissors paper that seems to too heavily encourage Dracula to just Escape(Mist) as much as possible.  Maybe I'm missing some subtleties of it, but I've never been a fan of RPS mechanics, either.  I'd play it now and then, but it's nothing I'd want to own.  I think maybe I should just try Scotland Yard, since that is the part of the game I like best.

This game lasts far too long for what it is - a chase game. Scotland Yard or Garibaldi does the same thing but in 60-90 minutes.

I have fond memories of the original version from the 1980's and seem to remember that took about 90 minutes, which is about right.

The fight sequences are very luck orientated and last far too long. We gave the win to the Dracula player after 2 and a half hours, with Dracula having lost only 1 blood point. I have to add he lost only one dice roll out of maybe a dozen. We had him pinned but he escaped as a man each time.

This is kind like Scottland Yard with random events, fighting, and a lot of theme.  It's quite good but it's much too long for my tastes.  I did enjoy it though.  One thing that bothered me was Dracula's ability to easily escape by taking to the water.  Granted he loses health when he does that but he also stops the clock (prolonging the game) and he's impossible to trace when he goes to sea.  That leaves players scrambling to pick up his trail as soon as he makes landfall again.  It also seems subject to wide swings of luck.  Incidentally, the game is quite true to the characters and events that are found in the original book.

Fun game that, so far, appears to me underdeveloped with major flaws.  I prefer the hide-and-seek portion (a brilliant design, somewhat defeated by the inclusion of 5 newspaper event cards) to the combat portion (seriously?  That's the best you've got for battles after hours spent prepping for them?)

After a few plays, I like it as a unique experience and no doubt it's quite fun with the right group, but so is... well... nearly everything.  I still find the search the most fun portion of the game.

A game of logic and deduction... and then Dracula tries to bite you while you stab him with a stake. Fun, thematic, and engaging!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The theme is well-conveyed by the gameplay. 1-4 players are hunting Dracula across Europe, and a lot of exciting things can occur. No bean counting or wool trading going on here.

The meat of the game is solid, but missing some refinements that would dramatically improve it. Strategies are opaque and so the game can be frustrating for new players. For example, finding a sneaky Dracula can be quite difficult at first. 

Explaining combat card strategies beyond "roll high" to new players (when to use a gun, or Dodge, or when Dracula should bite) is also tricky. There is real strategic potential for combat, but it is explained nowhere in the rules and it is not obvious at all: like playing rock, paper scissors without initially knowing which beats which.

Long game, too.

In conclusion, this is a great game with players of near-equal skill levels. But if you're like me and don't have a regular group, this will not be a game you pull out much despite the juicy theme.

Nice concept; the one-vs-many gameplay is strongly reminiscent of Scotland Yard. Unfortunately, the combat system is pure chance, making the game very "swingy" - sometimes the hunters win very quickly; other times, the game drags on for hours (I think the record is somewhere in the vicinity of five hours.)

Overall, I wouldn't say no outright to playing it, but it's not one that I'm in any particular hurry to play again.

Dropped from 8 to 7 after three plays. I almost always have a blast when I'm playing FoD, no matter which side I'm on. However, the beginning of the game, where the hunters are just wandering around does drag and frustrate quite a bit. Initially, the lag was not so bad because I was getting a feel for the game, but now that I know what to do, I'm not so keen. Still, an AT classic.

Great, tense game, although can be pretty long. Trying to escape as Dracula or hunt Dracula is a great Meta-game, the combat and everything is well done. Don't know how to make it shorter, but the turns do flow very quickly, which makes it go pretty fast.

Scotland Yard, but with a more interesting (combat) finish.

I think it shows its age in some of the mechanics, but it isn't a bad game.

Update: the last game was a bit of a snorefest and I think we called it early to play something else. The tension isn't guaranteed, especially if Dracula is found early and never fully escapes.

Down from 7.3 to 6.3.

RATING: 6.5
About an hour too long, and for the hunters, quite boring throughout.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A game with a strong theme. The fun of bring the hunter lies in figuring out and cornering Dracula, while the thrill for playing the role of Dracule lies in trying to outsmart the group of hunters breathing down its neck! Unfortunately, the fight mechanism is a big let-down and a boring affair which constitutes a big flaw to the game. It is what makes the game less satisfying than what it ought to be.

*The only game in my initial list of 9 games that still attracts me and tempts me to play after three years. So I am revising the rating upwards for its staying power with me.:)*

RATING: 7
If you remember "Scotland Yard" from childhood, add the Dracula theme, rules for combat between the "hunters" and Dracula and his minions, and generally a bit more complex game play, and you have "Fury of Dracula". As with most FFG titles, this one comes with nice artwork and just looks beautiful on the table.

RATING: 7
This game was much better than I thought it would be.  It's suprisingly fun, and tactical.  It was only one play, but I had pretty much written this one off due to theme.  I'm glad I was talked into giving it a try.  I need a few more plays of it.

RATING: 9
Difficult game to explain and could definitely use some player aids to hand out to explain some of the various items (like Dracula encounters, etc.)  However every game we have played generated significant amounts of discussion and was talked about for quite a while afterwards.  It can be quite a challenge viewed from either side.  For its length, heaviness of theme, and overall fun I rank this at the top of my echelon.

Played once.  Great fun, as it combines deductive gaming with strategic gaming.  The way Dracula moves is fantastic, and the use of powers with a good Dracula player can make it very difficult for the hunters.  The one versus all approach makes it an easy game to fit in when your group size isn't static as well.

"I have crossed oceans of time to find you." This one is a solid win, looking forward to playing Dracula and then my rating may go up. For the sake of being lame this one is "Fangtastic", don't make the "mist-stake" of passing this by. 

Addendum: So I've played with Dracula now and I thoroughly enjoyed the hidden movement, the trap laying, the trickery far more then playing hunters, granted I got killed quickly. It's actually pretty challenging it seems. From the hunter side the game is highly entertaining, from the Dracula side there's alot of careful strategy. Truly a great game, abit long but great none the less. 

Addendum: After many more plays I've decided this title is one of my favorites, rating is rising .5 just from the games shear addictive (albeit long) gameplay.

I began by introducing this to friends, two at a time, the ones that I figured would take to it easily - and it took off.  While the game tilts towards the hunters, it's very thematic, the hunt is fun, and the game as a whole is very worthwhile.  The next time there's five players at Game Night, there is no doubt that this game is hitting the table.

Revised September 2009 - I played this at BGG.con last year, twice, and it was really enjoyable.  In particular, we were playing this, then the raffle ticket drawings happened, and we ran off, and then ran back to finish it because we just couldn't bear to quit the game, after we all lost the prizes.

This was a tough game to rate, since so much depends on the narrative that gets produced by playing the game.  It was quite fun and funny, and yet I can see where running long enough to wear out its welcome is a problem.  Also, a string of strange luck with the event cards or the dice can leave a player or two feeling pretty helpless for long stretches of time.  Like for more than an hour.  I would rate it higher just for the experience, but the length and some of the gameplay downgraded it for me.

Fury of Dracula is a thorough rework of the classic Scotland Yard.  Unlike Scotland Yard, there are dull spots where 3 or more moves may pass with no clues whatsoever.  At least the searchers can gather items and prepare for combat.  This is good but LONG, and determined searchers must prepare for a cat-and-mouse slog.

Nice game, but felt like 2-3 hours of fun packed in 4-5 hours of play, ie a bit slow for what you get. Also, the 'evade' card is just plain no-fun frustration--the "not a clue" phase is the least enjoyable part of the game.

I have more fun playing this than pretty much any other board game.  There's a great ebb-and-flow as Dracula manages to slip through the Hunters' fingers just as it looks like he's finished.  Very thematic and, in my experience, lots of fun for both gamers and non-gamers.

I also have a soft spot for it since it was the game that convinced me to dive head first into this hobby.

UPDATE: But now I prefer [i]Letters from Whitechapel[/i].  It's more direct.

Played once so far and was pleasantly surprised, this wasn't as tedious as I had expected it to be.  Myself and the other hunter killed Dracula after about 2.5 hours but it could easily have gone on for another couple of hours if Dracula had slipped past us.  That would be far too long for me so I'm hesitant about playing again.

A lot of fun.  I loved it.  The theme plus mechanic of semi-coop plus chase really appeals to me.  So much so that I can even (almost) overlook all the cards and stuff.

RATING: 6.5
I've played it once, and it wasn't the greatest experience. I was among the hunters. There were two of us, so I should have felt like I was doing a lot of things. But everything felt very slow-paced. I wanted to be able to move around and search more. I think it requires too much build up of your strength to fight Dracula. I'd like that to be a quicker part of the strategy, and have it focus more on the hunt. I also don't like feeling like we're wandering aimlessly, which can happen for a while, long game if the Dracula player is good. In the end, I prefer the experience Letters from Whitechapel offers over this one.

NOTE: The incredibly high prices for this make me wish I'd held onto it a few months longer. :)

I always look forward to an opportunity to play this game. While I think it's a bit imbalanced toward Dracula, I still find it fun to play on either side of the hunt.

Rating: 9.5.  There isn't much that keeps me from giving it that final "10" point.  I think I have to chalk it up to game length.  But I'm big on theme-mechanics binding, and narrative in games, and this has buckets of both.  Years after first playing it, and several of these newfangled co-op games later, I just love this game.  [19-5-2011]

Letter Grade: B+.  There are other games that use a cat-and-mouse approach to game design.  Fury of Dracula, however, unites this style of gameplay with a host of clever mechanics; a well-designed map that rewards clever play (for Dracula) and careful teamwork (for hunters); and theme, theme, theme.  Minus marks for game time, lots of rules, and slightly-too-complicated combat mechanic (see comments below).  If you can negotiate these things, or are used to rules-complex AT games, or you like the theme, or you enjoy the hunt (or being hunted)--you're sure to find something to enjoy in FoD.  [08-05-09]

First game took about as long as one would expect.  It was good, though playing as Dracula I worried the hunters weren't quite having the fun I was.  Because I was having an absolute blast.  Even though I sucked.  No pun intended.  03-13-09: Discovered today that this works well with 2.  I'm not much of a person, generally, for deduction in a game.  This game works for me because it feels more like a hunt, more like following clues and drawing the net closed--or it feels more like slipping through narrow cracks and masterminding your escape.  How do you get back on Dracula's trail when he slips through your fingers?  Where will he disembark?  Or how do you cleverly position your traps for the hunters?  Where can you bury your vampire that it will escape their notice until it's too late?

I want to like this and play it more. Maybe I just need to find some other fans to play it. I do fear that it might be a lot more fun to be Dracula, though (as I have been in my two plays). Maybe it's just not as fun being a hunter. A lot of little fiddly rules make it hard to remember how to play, too, unless it's getting played a lot. It's probably not a keeper, which is sad.

This is a game that does not fit my tastes.  I don't particularly care for co-op's, the horror theme does nothing to excite me, I don't like games that last over 2 hours, and I really don't care to roleplay.  The deduction aspect is ok, but only for the first hour.  If it was Sherlock Holmes finding a crook in an hour, I'd be lukewarm to it.  So for what its worth, this is my rating.     The amount of tough decisions per minute is very very low.  I really feel you NEED to be into the theme, or this will fall flat.

RATING: 5
Fury of Dracula isn't something I was seeking out.  I had a vague idea of what it was and it didn't really sound that exciting to me.  So what do I think after playing?

The Good:  I enjoyed the team aspect of it, and working together to hunt down one player.  Sometimes I don't enjoy cooperative games as there isn't a real sense of competition when you're just battling a game state, but playing against Dracula avoids that issue.  I also enjoyed the Scotland Yard aspect of the game, deducing where Dracula might be and logically narrowing down his position.

The Bad:  Length!  The game is just too long, and it could have gone a lot longer.   Randomness!  There's just too much wonky going on.  At one point Dracula just teleported out of our search net... which ended up not being too bad for us, but could have doubled the game length.  There are just too many cards that can swing the game too much.  I don't want to invest as much time as this game requires only to have a lucky card draw determine the course of the rest of the game.

Things I could do without: the fighting system seems a little unnecessarily  complex.  And the game seems set up so that it requires multiple encounters with Dracula for the hunters to win.  I would have preferred some simpler combat system with a single big fight.  Or maybe just doing away with the fight altogether.  

Overall, I enjoyed our play, and I'm glad I played it, but it's not something I'd look to play again.  There are a lot of other games I'd rather play instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good game that I don't enjoy as much as I should, given it is thematic, has a nice feel to the hunt and a surprisingly small set of rules. And why is like this? Mainly because the game blocks the hunter players to develop a real strategy, because:

a) You can never know what Dracula might have put in a city - the tokens, once used, return to the pile and can be taken again, later on, so the hunters are unable to take things into consideration, like: "He has used the rats, the saboteur and the fog two times, therefore...". No, nothing of this sort. I agree that the vampires that can maturate should return to the pool if found and destroyed, but until all the tokens are used (somehow), I think it would serve the gameplay better if they didn't return to the pool;

b) It is all on the dice. No matter how great the hunt was, nor how well Dracula has used his powers and servants to hide and escape, but once a hunter and Dracula are in the same place, all came to the dice. Roll poorly and you will lose, get bitten, die or Dracula will escape, no matter how great your hand is. The combat could be so much better, but inspite being somewhat novel (with its many relations between the cards used and its effects), I found it to be lackluster and disappointing - considering all the movement strategy that the game requires previous to the encounter.

The overall experience wasn't bad, mind you, after all I plyed with friends, with gret table talk cursing the devious ways of Dracula and his minions and the game does has an amazing feel of a hunt against time, chasing down a cunning enemy.

It just could have been better - probably and 8 or 8.5 if the combat system wasn't so much dice dependent.

In this game of Gothic adventure, one player takes the role of Dracula while up to four others attempt to stop him by controlling Vampire hunters from the famous Bram Stoker novel.

Dracula has returned, and is determined to control all of Europe by creating an undead empire of Vampires. Dracula uses a deck of location cards to secretly travel through Europe, leaving a trail of encounters and events for the hunters that chase him.

Meanwhile, the hunters attempt to track and destroy Dracula using the limited information available to them - a task easier said than done when their prey has the power to change forms into a wolf or bat, and can even melt away into the mist when confronted.

To save Europe and rid the world of Dracula's foul plague, the hunters must destroy Dracula before he earns enough victory points to win the game... will they have enough wit and bravery to defeat the dark count?

Un gran juego. Orgánico, sesudo y con distintas mecánicas y un buen cuidado aspecto gráfico. De mis preferidos. Nunca digo que no a una partida. Aunque no es un juego para todas las semanas, sino que es más bien un gran reserva.

RATING: 5
Unbalanced. Too reliant on knowledge of the deck and gimmicky card combos. Too many fiddly bits to keep track of that ultimately don't really add much to gameplay. 

I do like the tension of one side drawing cards and inadvertently powering their opponent, but that's about the only mechanic that I think this game implements well.

If you want a hidden movement game where the focus is on hidden movement, play Letters from Whitechapel. This is best thought of as an Ameritrash Adventure Game that happens to feature hidden movement as a mechanic.

RATING: 4
The game consists of tracking and deduction across a map of Europe. Player turns are short and can planned ahead, except for the Drac player. This game really needs five to play, or at least a group willing to marshall four characters against the fifth, Dracula. It all comes down to coordination. If the hunters are highly coordinated and willing to give up personal gaming interests then the only real hope for the Dracula player is to pull stunts like the Dublin Gambit (read threads on bgg). If the players are a bunch of self interested morons then Dracula will run around the board amidst the chaos. This feels a bit like an old game bridging the modern era. Fury of Dracula is not for casual or unfocussed gamer groups and it is seriously limited by the need for a specific player count.

Fantasy Flight Version.  Check out Ghost Chase for an earlier implementation of Drac's movement system.  I find the gray miniature hunters hard to distinguish. What's with Dracula's victims getting fixed up good as new in the hospital??  What the heck happened to the "Fury" of Dracula?  Seems more like the "Nuisance" of Dracula.  Aside from that little rule change I do like the game a lot.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If you must own a deduction game, this should be it. It just feels great to work together with other players to find the location of Dracula, and the fact that encounters/fights can be unexpected and VERY dangerous makes it a lot more thrilling than most of its kin. The large amount of event cards and encounter chits also ensures each game plays differently. One of its best qualities, is that gameplay feels quite balanced for this kind of game, and the balance does not change with the number of players. In addition, turns are very short and the quality of its components is well above average (with great artwork). Just keep in mind that one game can take quite some time to play (and learn), and that the game requires a Dracula player who is willing to play less competitely if the hunters get more fun out of it that way. Otherwise, the amount of fun and suspense in this game might be a bit too dice-dependent.

The same basic idea of Scotland Yard, with a whole hell of a lot of flavorful but somewhat random *stuff* thrown in.  Certainly more interesting, but I'm not yet sure it's better.  Rating subject to change- playing a second game a bit faster would work wonders in terms of keeping this above a 7.

Rating after one play. I will give it a second chance. However, it seems to be a dragged out deduction game with combat being a dice roll to see if you get to go to the paper/rock/scissors result. We spent three hours finding Dracula and then finally tracking him into a corner. After four rounds of combat, Dracula had only suffered three wounds (out of 15). Then out of nowhere an event card is flipped that allowed the good Count to teleport to any city on the board. I was none too pleased. I'll have to see if another go doesn't sooth my nerves on this one but if it doesn't, two plays might just be my limit.

If this lost the dice and had the card battle system of Middle-Earth Quest it'd be one of my favourite games ever. As it stands though 90mins of great play as Dracula can frequently be shot to pieces by one unfortunate fight. Still pretty great regardless.

Very nice cat-and-mouse game.  Very tense if you're the Dracula player.  Can be boring for Hunters unless someone really keeps the game moving.  The Dracula player has a lot to keep track of - so he/she needs to be a Gamer.  Lots of thematic elements and immersion - especially if Dracula plays aggresively!!

Biggest downside to this game is that it takes too long - especially with new players.  Fastest game I've played (after 4 plays) has been just short of 2.5 hours, but each game has had new players and that time includes the rules explanation.  Shave 30-60 minutes off the play time and you'd have one hell of an intense game.

A lot of fun if you've got the time and are in the mood for a slow, simmering, tense, and teasing game.

Pretty game, but terribly misnamed.  "Plodding behind Dracula," would have been better, or maybe, "Chasing Drac's Droppings."  The only fury in this game is when the players realize they've been playing for four hours, but missed a rule somewhere in the labyrinth that is the rule book that has invalidated the whole darn game.

I stepped in for another hunter in the middle of a game, which is my only experience with this.

I was surprised how much like [gameid=438] it seemed.  I don't know that it's much of anything special, but I would certainly try playing a full game to find out.

Luca Iennaco say.

"Debugged" version of the original (no more player elimination, more balanced cards, new movement rules for Dracula raising interaction and deduction, Dracula must play an encounter every turn).
Luck is still very important (dice and cards), but a bit less than before.
Atmosphere has been preserved.
Cooperation (with more than two players) and a bit of deduction embellish the game.
Very good with 2 or 3 players.
Average game lenght for us: 150 minutes.
Playing with all experienced players makes the game both shorter and more interesting (even if I think that it is biased towards the Hunters, it's quick and easy to regulate it with the hints given in the rulebook).
Some components (character sheets, box insert, lack of a cards/tiles holder) are disappointing given the price tag.

***Update (after 12 games): I've helped Dracula a bit, removing one copy of "Hypnosis", "Good Luck" and "Surprising Return", plus doubling the cost of "Resolve bonuses". The game feels better balanced now.***

Very well designed and attractive game features some unique and very interesting gameplay elements. Cards can get a bit confusing, however. 
 This game has one flaw, in my opinion, and that is the lack of a sense of accomplishment for the hunters. Without the right cards to help, the searching seems very haphazard and every time Drac heads out to sea it feels like the game starts over for the hunters. Still a lot of fun, though.

RATING: 8.5
Nice cat-and-mouse game.  The hidden movement mechanic is brilliant. I feel that it's a bit more fun playing Dracula, but as the hunters there is a bit more tension and excitement as you tighten the noose on old Drac.  Great game.

One of my all time favourites - great theme. I liked the old version, but i love this new one. The game can be a little slow at first especially with newbies and it helps to know what cards are in the deck, but once the net closes the game becomes tense and more dynamic. For me, i don't mind that Dracula has a hard time, i enjoy the challenge and there is enough variation to keep me going. This new version is a definite improvement on the old game.

This was better than I expected to be, but it still ran longer than I would have liked.  I think playing the game with a full complement of players who know the rules would speed things along, though.  It captures the theme of the book well, and has a decent risk-reward management system.  I also enjoyed the rock-paper-scissors aspect of the combat, but then again, I will always favor games that resolve battles in ways other than "roll higher than x."  I would play again, given enough time and players.

1 play: 5 players (as hunter)

RATING: 7
An excellent bluffing and deduction game, Fury of Dracula does a great job of keeping things tense and exciting. What makes it so good is that the heroes must not only find Dracula, but kill him as well. This raises the stakes (that's right, I said it!) considerably over other more typical cat and mouse games, like Scotland Yard or Mr. Jack. The heroes are forced to coordinate and plan their efforts to both locate Dracula and then attack him at the moment he is most vulnerable.

Using cards to track Dracula's trail is ingenious, although it does require a good bit of concentration from the Dracula player. He must remember what locations are in his trail and in what order they were visited. Failure to do so can easily give away Dracula's position and swing the game to the heroes. Combat is a bit wonky, but it gets the job done and is easy to figure out once you have been through it once or twice. Dracula's traps can be a little confusing as well, (particularly because they are also in Dracula's trail, and thus have to be committed to memory as well) and their effects can be pretty rules intensive. Thankfully, the rules for all of the traps are printed on the back cover of the rulebook and are easy to access.

Fury of Dracula beautifully depicts the characters and atmosphere of Bram Stoker's novel. It is decidedly more fun (as well as more work!) for the Dracula player, but if the investigators can get along and work together, there is also a lot of fun to be had for them as well. Like Arkham Horror, the game is even better if the group drops in some light role-playing to add to the ambiance. At any rate, it's a nice change of pace from the usual competitive gaming and a welcome addition to any gameday!

Very nice components, and a fine thematic experience. I wish there was a full-page play aid for each side, as the rulebook is pretty awful (I wish they used an alea approach, with sidebar summaries/details). I'm also not sold on the card acquisition rate for the good guys: it's just overwhelming, and devalues both the cards and the core gameplay. Unless, I guess, the cardplay is the core, but that doesn't seem right.

I love this game. Set aside a chunk of time and have some fun...there's nothing more statisfying than "hunting" another player (er...Dracula, I mean) and staking him/her after a 2 hour game. Conversely, it's an absolute rush to slip past a tightening noose of hunters and leave naught but a minion behind!

This is a great game.  FFG has done a wonderful job of updating this classic with new-age rules so that it plays faster and has a greater deal of strategy.

RATING: 5
Fairly light game with a decent "narrative."  The hunters are usually just a few steps behind, with Dracula having to be fairly sneaky and avoid getting trapped.  Higher learning curve for Dracula, need to understand all the combat cards and have some idea what events the hunters have access to.  Combat is fairly random, but there is some strategy and choices available.  This is not a problem considering the "heaviness" of this game.  

After a few plays, this is on my trade list... People just aren't having fun with this one.  Might be my group, or the soul-crushing downtime with few choices for the hunters.

Overall I like this game much better than Scotland Yard (to which they are compared).  I've played Dracula more than the hunters, and find that play is much more unforgiving for Dracula since the four hunters are working as a team.  That being said playing Dracula is still very fun because it puts the player in a very adversarial role where it's me versus all of you, which comes up in games frequently, but at lease with Fury you know from the onset that folks are teaming up to get you.

Only played 1 1/2 times. We are Vampire theme fans and the game has this in abundance. Never got comfortable with the mechanics and the game dragged on partly due to the fact that we socialize while we game and are not always 100% focused.

UPDATE: The Dracula player typically has the most fun and usually wins. The hunters usually need an early lucky break to close in on him.  The combat system is clunky.  This is a memorable game for us and will always be in the collection.

RATING: 7.5
Since all the players alway go up against me, I love having a game that lets them gang up within the normal flow of the game.
This game greater weakness is the length, if Dracula plays too sneaky and gets lucky, managing to avoid all the hunters attempts to catch him, the game is just going to be a neverending and boring experience; Dracula has to be aggressive from time to time and push his luck a little bit.

My nephew loves this game. I do too. Its fun played with two, but more players add to the fun. Everyone wants to be Dracula. His hidden card factor is fun. Finding him and battling it out is equally as fun. The game can be intense. There are many challenges.

I like Fury of Dracula, the cat and mouse game aspect of it.  However, I really want to try this from the Dracula side, trying to outwit the players and take over Europe.

One of the FFG games I don't get much enjoyment from.
While the card trail is nifty, the Combat fell flat for me. 

Only play with someone who makes a good Dracula.
Then it's passable.

Gone is the deduction of the previous version - this is a race game, not a lurk-and-find.  Plotting replaced by manic scampering.  Sherlock Holmes the Movie vs. the books.

This was the first "geeky" game I ever played. Back in the 80s, a friend of mine had the old version, and one summer we played it to death! The newer version is streamlined and more "modern" but loses none of the atmosphere of the original.

It's a great game if you enjoy one-against-many games, and the way Dracula's movement is hidden from the other players (but they can get clues or pick up his trail and track him down) is quite wonderful.

Some elements of the game are better than the original and some are undoubtedly worse: the combat in particular seemed unnecessarily complex. Overall no net gain (or maybe slightly worse, because it's a new version and should be an improvement).

Played this twice with the family. We had great fun, and it is a good cooperative play for the hunters, and fun for dracula to listen in on the musings on his whereabouts. Both times dracula lost, but it was pretty close. And the two draculas spent long time afterwards discussing how they could have won.

(Trade Interest: medium) plays somewhat like the original, but i like the hidden path system a little better.  one thing that's a little hard to keep track of is which cities are in the path.  but i've found that you can solve that by just always looking through the location deck when a player enters a city.  that way you won't give anything away.

on the other: tipical for FFG lots of unclear rules. Long game and whole game can end without any fight with Dracula - is it really what Dracula have to do all the game - flee and run?

"I am Dracula and I welcome you to my house. I must apologize for not being here to greet you personally, but I trust you've found everything you needed."

Beats the original GW edition by a few wolf whiskers.

[b]"I want you to bring me, before nightfall, a set of postmortem knives."[/b]

1. Superior art to the original (though I miss the charm of the GW edition).
2. Hugely better overall experience, mainly through the trail that Dracula creates in his wake. The Hunters are nearly always hot on the vampire's heels.
3. Allies for both sides. These are great: the Brides of Dracula and Sister Agatha spring to mind.
4. The Hunters cannot be killed off, their "death" only hastens Dracula's victory.
5. Accomodates 5 players, rather than the previous 4 players of the original.
6. Dracula has more strategic and tactical options than before.
7. Quality components. However I do not like the tokens that track day/night and resolve - swapped out immediately for gems.
8. Thematic experience game, resplendent with all the corny/great, vampire/Dracula lore you could wish for.
9. This version tracks Dracula's victory much more clearly than before. Originally, it was often the case whereby the game ended suddenly with Dracula declaring "I've won!" and the Hunters might not have known how far advanced his devilish plans were - this is not the case here now.
10. Good sized board - not too big or small. Easier to track the East-west divide than previously.

[b]Walpurgis Nacht:[/b]

1. Playing as Dracula can be stressful (the ever-present fear of cocking up the game by incompetent secret play).
2. The game is slightly fiddly.
3. Tactic cards are certainly not intuitive, confusing all who gazed upon them until a few combats had been experienced.
4. Long winded rules - took me 90 mins to download into my brain.
5. Minions instead of gypsies (so as not to offend the "Nation" of gypsy-folk, doubtless).
6. Playing Dracula well is more difficult than the GW edition.
7. Some of the card titles I liked are no longer present.
8. Castle Dracula is a teeny bit weak for my taste, but this is no biggie.
9. Scales lazily - by that I mean, all the Hunter characters must be included in every game. But this was a fault/wrinkle of the original as well.
10. Can play long - 2+ hours.
11. Some ambiguousness in the rules, mainly around combat and backtracking. Some situations were not quickly resolved - we had to ponder the ramifications of each interpretation of the rules - either way it could have gone in each case could have cost the game for one side or the other.
12. Requires some checking of what encounters and items do during the game. This will become less of a nuisance as more games are enjoyed.

Awaiting another play before reducing or increasing my rating.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Probably one of the better "all versus one" type of games I've played.  A good palate cleanser from the traitor mechanic cooperative titles like Shadows Over Camelot and BSG.  I enjoy the deduction aspect and unlike Pandemic, I feel that as long as you can think logically, you always have a way to contribute and thus it's harder for any one person to dominate the decisions.

The downside to Fury of Dracula is of course its length, which could probably be mitigated by reducing the number of VP required to win, or by increasing the points gained.  The other is that the combat is very difficult to grasp in the beginning, especially when and how a card is discarded after use.  Lastly, similar to the trapping of all GM'ed games, the experience is largely dependent on the person controlling dracula.  Taking too much risk may result in an unsatisfying session; being too cautious will most likely drag on the game for too long.  Therefore, he must make choices that will continuouslly let the hunters feel like they are indeed involved in a hunt rather than wandering around aimlessly.  So in that sense I think FoD probably won't stand up to repeated plays back to back.

Boring, boring, boring, boring! I have played this game twice now, and the excitement at the table has been exactly zero on both occasions. I was with players who are great fans of the game, so they were enthusiastic about playing it, insisting that it is a good game. However the game feels like stumbling around in the dark, drawing cards occasionally. Every once in a while, you may be lucky enough to fight something with the confusing, unthematic, unwieldy card combat system! Then the game will end uneventfully, Dracula having escaped sheerly by virtue of the fact that all of his information is hidden, so there's no way to find him in most situations, except by drawing a lucky card. I see potential in this theme, but the game is dry, long, and too obscure in the information players have to make their decisions to make it much more than an arbitrary stab in the dark.

Fury of Dracula is pretty good. The theme is fitting and the board is great. My only complaint is Dracula seems to be handicaped while fighting the hunters. Dracula's agents seem to be better at fighting the hunters then old Drac himself.I can understand this if it was during the day but at night this appears to be true also. His best option is run day/night, one bad luck of rolls and its over for him.

Another one of my favorite games!  I love the game concepts introduced in this game!  The game play is exciting and complex and everything is dripping with theme! [pun intended]  

The game components are top-notch!  Everything from the miniatures, character sheets, board, chits and dice are high-quality and will last many years to come.  I would recommend putting the cards in sleeves though to prevent wear.

The artwork featured on the components is absolutely stunning!  It plays up the theme as a game of this type should.

Overall, this is an outstanding game!

After 1 Play: Much ado about nothing.  There are plenty of little mechanisms designed to make things interesting, but they are all for naught if you aren't the character(s) that actually corners Dracula.  Everyone tends to spread out, so when someone finally does find the big baddie, they get to fight while the other players try to cross the whole of Europe to join the fight, which is probably over by the time they get there.  If a five-player game is fun for two players and utterly boring for three, I'm gonna call that a failure.

This is a really fun game that has grown on me. The only problem is that it is really difficult to win as Dracula until you`ve played a few times.

UPDATE: Ok, my friend and I both got better at playing as Dracula. A lot better. It's now an uphill battle for the hunters every game. Matched plays are best for this game if you are playing 2-player.

What a great game!  Theme is awesome, but of course, only if your into horror.  I play this game with my wife and son, and they kill me (Dracula) most of the time.  FoD is really hard on the nerves if your a Dracula player, but that in no way subtracts from the fun.  Combat system is a little strange, but doable.  As usual from FFG, the components are beyond reproach, and give a great feeling of Victorian horror.  A must-play at Halloween!

Definitely one of the best co-op games I've played; theme-rich and involves a lot of different game mechanics. I feel that as Dracula you're simply giving away too many hints about your current location. Long. (7.5 after one play)

RATING: 8
1/02/14 -- This game is really fun with one caveat:  Dracula has to play more like a Dungeon Master than in competition with the Hunters.  How fun the game is is so dependent on the Dracula player keeping the players engaged, mainly by playing aggressively, laying a lot of nearby booby traps and only going to sea for special circumstances.  There is also invariably one hunter who is stuck on the wrong side of the board.  Dracula should do whatever he/she can to get that player into the game.  Because of these things, Dracula obviously needs to be played by experienced players (if possible).  Played this way, FoD is definitely a 9--an experience not to be missed.  With a competitive Dracula, the game's fun will fluctuate between a 9 and a 6 (a competitive Dracula can still lead to a fun game, but maybe only half the time).

---

12/16/08 -- Games of Fury of Dracula can run hot or cold.  Player experience, both with the hunters and with Dracula, plays a huge role the game’s energy.  The biggest bit of advice I have is for Dracula to avoid going to sea except in the most dire of circumstances.  It is almost never as good an idea as it might at first appear and also kills the game’s momentum.  Also, playing as a hunter against a Dracula player of inferior skill is usually pretty boring/unexciting.  I'm reducing my rating from an 8 to a 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An excellent pursuit game. It roughly similar to Scotland Yard in that it features asymmetrical teams and hidden movement, but it's also quite different. There's a lot more interaction with Dracula leaving traps for the heroes and the heroes trying to capture and kill Dracula.

I quite enjoyed my first game of this and plan to play again in the near future.

After another play, I'm lowering my rating. This game isn't as fun as the Hunters since your options are basically move, draw cards, roll dice occasionally. The biggest problem seemed to be that there are very few ways for the hunters to actually catch Dracula, so once they catch his trail the game enters into a very long and drawn out process of them chasing him and easily killing any new Vampires while getting just enough cards to keep on the trail and keep Dracula from moving the game towards its end.

Basically, this game would be a lot better if it resolved quicker.

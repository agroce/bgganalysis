Take Carcassonne, add several restrictions on where tiles can be placed and make the meeples mobile. Score every turn, and allow the purchase of end-game points with the score. Polish it up and you've got a gorgeous game, which is what Monastery is.

Up to the usual high standard of the Ragnar's gamer's games.  Offbeat theme.  Don't be put off by the inclusion of letters/words.  They only serve an abstract function, differentiating the target tiles.  Some scope for stuffing your opponents by buying the tiles they need.  Layout is reminiscent of Carcassonne, but game play more complicated, with monks arriving, working and praying and several 'little' rules.  Minor frustration when holding only brown tiles, which couldn't be placed next to the grey tiles on the table, but there are rules to cope with this.

I really want to like this game - the theme, the little monk pieces and the artwork are all great - just... collecting letters??? The mechanics are great, game seems balanced - it just didn't grab me and say "Play me!"

very long carcassone with only an illusion of less tile-drawing luck. once you get good tiles in a good moment it's obvious how to use them. if you've gotten nothing in an important moment it's obvious there's nothing to do. and yet the game takes FOREVER to finish.

I'm a bit disappointed after the fantastic Canal Mania. Some ideas are good in the game, but the the way the "testament points" are given did not make me jump of joy. After a few turns, the quite difficult rules made a lot clear, but the game came also a bit boring. Too long too much of the same. I'm not very enthousiast to play it some more.

Well, they may look like kinda big Carcassonne tiles and you do have to place your monks on them to score but this is a very different game with a quite unique feel to it, and all the better for it, though there's also a bit of a steep learning curve as a result.  Looking forward to playing again.

There's a game here, but I'm not sure it's anything to get too excited about.  With the very few tile draws that you get, the luck of the tile draw seemed to play a big part in the game.  There is little room for clever play, and the decisions always seemed fairly obvious.  While there is opportunity for nasty play, it usually costs you just as many points as you would deny the other player while the other players are happy that you're boning the other player at your expense, so it's usually more worthwhile to just get points for yourself.  I dunno, it all just seemed a little ho-hum and maybe just a little underdeveloped with some overly contrived rules.  The rules are also fairly poorly structured, making a pretty simple game seem complicated at first blush.

Strategy based Carcasonne!  This game gives you plenty to think about on your turn.  Which tile to place, where to place it, where to move your monks, make your monks pray or work?  My only concerns are that with 4 players it runs a little long.  Also, it might be a little too tight.  It's hard for a player to make much room between himself and the other players.  Makes for a close game, but if the game is that close between all players, are there really any meaningful decisions?  Just 1 play...really need to play again.

Finally played again years later.  I still like this game!  But I seem to be in the minority.

RATING: 6
Players run a team of monks around a monastery, building, working and devoutly praying to earn work points, spent on their section of illuminated manuscript.  Quirky game, where players take turns playing Carcassonne like tiles out to be constructed in an ever expanding monastery, and moving their monks around to do monky, worky things.  Doing tasks earn you points which can be spent on recruiting more monks, or purchasing letters (i.e. A, B, C) off a public mat and placing them on your own personal section of the Lord's Prayer, or on another players flip side up and effectively sabotaging their work (knocked the ink pot over ... sorry).  Weird game that seems to almost work, but appears to be a pass or two shy through the development process.  Almost like the love child of Blue Moon City (player cooperation in building tiles) and Carcassonne (laying tiles), but weaker than both of those two excellent titles.  A rating of 6 is almost too generous, but it's a very interesting game - just not sure it's worth the effort to penetrate to opaque rules to the heart of the game.

This is actually a tough little game!  There's a LOT to think about, although it doesn't seem so at first glance.  It will take a couple of tries to play this one well--very subtle.  Wrestling with the rules (odd organization) doesn't help.  

It may look like Carcassonne, but it sure ain't Carcassonne!

RATING: 8
A fun game with various different elements; although it is described as a tile laying game this doesn't have the same feel as, say, Carcassonne, which is all about laying tiles; the movement of your monks and the buying of tiles and/or more monks is equally if not more important.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Some interesting design aspects on tile laying, but the rule book is terrible and confusing (with fiddly exceptions) and I am thankful my (used) copy included print outs from Ragnar's website of a sample game explanation, a FAQ and strategy notes (Go find this as it's really neccessary!) 

This is much more complex than say Caracassonne or Cacao. and although thematic, perhaps because of the initial tile draw or the few decisions, seemed to offer less tough choices and therefore I can see how this game - sadly - has been forgotten.

If you like tile games and can get through the rules, then there's a game here, but there is luck and although thematic, though not all that strategically or tactically deep.

"Prison Cell - When a new abbot is elected he can imprison a monk here (who is set praying but doesn't score points). This tile is pretty powerful, you should be cautious when playing it as it can effectively ruin a players game. Do not drop it if you're struggling for monks and there's a vindictive player who might become the abbot."

Need to play this again before I can rate it fairly.  My early impression is that it is heavily inspired by Carcassonne.  The theme is amusing, but at this point it's not clear to me whether or not the various gameplay tweaks will lead to something more interesting than the Carcassonne series.  Time will tell.

Excellent components, a well-produced game.

1 play 3p.  A little hard to get into - rules didn't flow as well as say Canal Mania did, and coming as it did after Tinner's Trail on the night it suffered a bit in the comparison.  Beautiful pieces, and the theme driving the game works well.  We may have been unlucky in that all of us had brown pieces to start so the building stuttered for a bit, but the game did pick up pace towards the end.  I would like to try again now I have the game more sorted.

RATING: 6
An overlong tile-layer (it's much closer to 2 hours than 1) with the kind of open scoring that will appeal to analysis paralysis freaks. The rules are fussy and sometimes unclear and there's some luck of the draw in the tiles you get, especially early on when you tend to build your own buildings. Bottom line is that this just isn't enough fun for the running time, if flagella were included with an expansion it wouldn't be much more painful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
In this tile-laying game, players expand the monastery with new buildings and move their monks around to construct these, or alternatively pray or work. All these actions earn the player points, which are used to purchase letters (VP) and/or more monks. At the end of the game, points for letters (plus a few other things) are added, and the value of unplayed tiles is subtracted to find each player's final score.

At first glance, Monastery is a very interesting game. While it looks a lot like Carcassonne, it plays much more like Blue Moon City, with one notable difference obviously being that the tiles are pre-placed in BMC. In both games, however, workers are placed on unconstructed tiles to flip these (=points), and this may be a collaborative effort. Also, the purchase of VPs with these points is found in both games, and both games even feature a mechanism where VPs become more and more expensive the later you buy them.

My first impression is positive. I am not sure whether Monastery is as, well, *balanced* as a game like BMC, but it obviously has a lot of depth and variability. Many different tiles, including some with special, unique effects can be found. Rules are present to make direct player interaction attractive (cooperating on constructions, purchasing worthless letters for your opponents, adding extra points to tiles as an incentive to other players to participate in their construction, and much more). The game is quite fiddly and had this been published by one of the big German companies, a lot of little rules would probably have been axed. As it is, I am grateful for their inclusion, for while it makes the game's learning curve a little steeper, it also makes it a much richer experience.

Time will tell how the game holds up. I look forward to trying it again.

One 2-player game so far.  It was actually pretty good as a 2-player.  However, it should get even better with the 3rd and 4th players.

The game does owe something to Carcassonne in looks.  But there is a lot more to consider, and some tiles are unlikely to be constructed solely with your own monks.  That opens up the possibilitiy of temporary alliances and "puss" plays.  Then there is the whole scalping of letters...

Upon reading the rules, I was unsure if there was much here.  After my test-run with one opponent, I think this is a game with some verve.  The theme is an oddball, as I think the negative play is potentially considerale.

Watch out game club!

UPDATE - Over a year of ownership, and just 2 games played.  I like this game, but for some reason can never get it to the table.  So I have just traded it for An den Ufern des Nils.

The rulebook is a complete Nightmare. It is more a list of random jottings and seems to rely on someone having played it before and the rules are just a list of reminders. I read the rules twice, making notes before explaining the game to others, and when asked questions it took ages to find the relevant bit under the rules - a prime one being - placing of dual purpose tiles - Was it under Tile Placement? No! It was at the end of the rules like an after thought. Reading these rules was like reading an act of Parliament after 4 years and everyone else had input their own amendments - uncohesive and a need to re-read several sections before clarrifying a particular rule query. A good game - very badly let down buy a badly laid out rules booklet - Come back the old Avalon Hill all is forgiven.

After each play of this game, I keep feeling there should be something more there that never seems to show up..ever!  Talk about frustrating - I've since decided it was best just to trade it out to someone else who might find it more interesting and maybe figure out what feels to be missing.  There are some interesting things going on with a mix of Carc tile laying, meeple movement to earn points and move around to construct buildings or pray in order to purchase letters.  There are restrictions in laying tiles as well as some bonus tiles which let you take additional actions. The rules are a mess, no question about that, and I'm still not certain all the rules were correctly followed in my games as the rule set is atrocious.

[b]Rating after one play.[/b]
Reminds me a little of Cracassonne, but only because it has a similar layout and the tiles are square.  The components are well-made, and the monks are certainly both comical and functional in what they do.  Other than that it's a completely unique game.  The rules are a nightmare, but after a lot of discussion we weeded out what we needed to do, and found an actual game hidden in the mish-mash of poorly worded explanations.  
That one experience was interesting, and after we all had the sequence of play down, we found it to be a very good game.  Afterwards we discovered things we had missed that would have made scoring more points easier, but all agree the game needs another play.
I'll keep the rating where it is for now, and see how I feel after the next visit.

After 3 plays with 2 I can only state that this game is still a lot harder than it seems. 

Although the looks resemble Carcassone, gameplay has nothing to do with it, and it's certainly no family game. One "stupid" mistake can cost you the game.

But I think it probably needs to be played with 3 or 4 to live the full experience.

Still on the fence.  Some really neat mechanisms, but some things feel the same.  I had HORRIBLE luck in my tile draw, and didn't think I had a chance, but perhaps this was a fluke.  We did not play with building special abilities, so that could add some more flair.

A rather simple tile placement game. There's a nice balance between cooperation (building) and blocking (praying, giving letters to other players, the prison), but somehow the game feels not quite developed enough.

The rulebook is very poorly structured and makes the game sound very complicated. The rules actually [i]are[/i] needlessly complex compared to what the game has to offer, but still the moves seem quite obvious very often. There's also a high luck-of-the-draw factor. The game is also too long with four players.

Quite pricey, considering the gameplay weight and number of components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A step up for Ragnar Brothers component quality. This is a light to middleweight Euro, with some unusual looking concepts, but essentially it's a movement and point optimisation game. The game does try to encourage players to cooperate or bribe each other, but certainly in a three player game there seems little need and players are better off pursuing their own strategies - especially as the game is so balanced that a point or two will decide the outcome. 

This may be better with four, and the unique effect tiles may liven the game up depending on what is drawn from the bag.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A peculiar twist on Carcassonne that definitely benefits from a full player count. Horribly-written rules make teaching a pain, but once you're stuck in and you've learned the special tiles it's relatively painless. I'm not sure it's a game of deep strategy, but it is a pleasant pastime when you're all played out on more conventional titles.

A tile placement game, where you use your monks to collect points - then use those points to obtain scripture. After the first play there are a lot of "small" rules that we kept overlooking - for example no brown work tiles next to grey study tiles. Our oversight in no way detracted from the game itself, although I'm keen to play again properly ASAP. Enjoyable.

I could do with a more plays of this.  Only played it once and didn't really know what I was doing for the first half of the game (despite managing to win it somehow).  Looks like it's got potential though and my rating could well go up.

Only played it once. The rules were kind of confusing sometime. Still I feel giving it a second change, 'cause we could more out of the game.

Seemingly flawed. If you begin by drawing tiles you can't score with, you miss out on getting an extra meeple on the board. And you're then a piece behind turn after turn for a long time. I just don't understand the design. Then for the rest of the game, you put out a tile and move all your meeples onto it to score as much as can. This encourages everyone to gradually move further and further away. Hanging around and trying to leech off someone else's tiles seems low-payoff - most times an opponent won't play a tile that gives you that opportunity, and if they're forced to, you're not getting the lion's share of the points anyway. WIth everyone diverging, it then comes down to who draws great scoring tiles. A game that hits the loser and discourages interaction - not exactly my sweet spot.

RATING: 3
Components and production are good and the theme is interesting but the gameplay is disjointed and suffers from several old-school flaws e.g. runaway leader, players accidentally playing themselves out of the game. Special building powers seem to be a side-show versus the main thrust of the game. I suspect that the game will play better with a group that plays it a lot but I will not be persisting with it when there are so many better games to play.

A fun twist on tile laying games.  It is a bit confusing for the first game, but once you get the rules down it is fun.  I think it is best with four players.  With three it was hard to get help building the building.

Good game, so-so quality components, abysmal rules. Seriously, rules do not have to be written this poorly. I almost gave up on trying to play this. Forcing my way through the rules, however, yielded an okay game underneath.

I think it does a great job with the theme and typically I'll rank games higher who have themes I enjoy.  In terms of pure game play this one will take a little more play to figure out just where it should fall in rank

Majdnem 9-est kapott a játék, egyedül a játék végi pontozás furcsa nekem. A betűk vásárlása szerintem az egyik legzseniálisabb ötlet amivel eddig találkoztam, a carcassonne rendszer összemixelése a lost valley rendszerével is nagyon jól működött. A lapok húzása egy jelentős szerencsefaktor a játékba, akár nagyon rosszul is kijöhet, ezen lehet kéne egy kicsit finomítani. Végig izgultam és a nehéz döntések jól megmozgatták a szürkeállományomat.

Some novel ideas in this one; too bad they didn't work a bit better.  I like the concept of developing tiles after they are placed and that only some tiles apply in some phases of the game.  I think that the tile draws control so much of your points and they are too random.  Auctioning the tiles would have been better or perhaps getting all the tiles for a day and creating three piles to use might have mitigated that lack of control.  Also, the scoring is pretty lame: since all you're going after is the letters, the game ends in a group hug.  Ultimately, the game is a bit too long for what it is.

I'm not able to rate it yet. I had that strange "I'm sure I'm doing something wrong" feeling. Everything seemed so awkward. I have to clarify some rules and play it again with more players just to confirm, or not, this first impression.

Hmm, not an easy game to play for the first time. Tactics galore. Lovely theme. Would like to play again. Not one for my home group and Swiggers seemed underwhelmed. This game would really benefit from a player aid. I think that the steep learning curve is going to put  off too many players. Definitely not a 2 player game as co-operative building becomews redundant.

I was not impressed as the starting player, when I found myself behind the other players after the first turn and with a worse 'secret door' tile allocated to me. I felt I was constantly trying to play catch up. In the end I finished 3rd of the 4 players, I never felt in contention for anything other than trying not to finish last. The concept is sound and the game play is okay, it's nicely themed and produced. I guess I need a few more tries to ascertain whether starting first was just a bit of bad luck on the tile picks or whether there is a problem.

Was looking for a game alone this theme and we tend to like tile playing in general for light game play. The rule book was pretty much a useless mess and the first try with a group of 4 was something of a slogging failure. The second time around went MUCH smoother but we are still a bit of the fence with it. Added frustration: one the the player screens is already torn along it's perforated edge. Updated: I was finally able to get a full 4p game in and, ok, it was a fine game and there really are all these great elements to it but you look at it and think "Wow, this should be great but it just isn’t". Something just feels a little busted about this game. Highlight: putting monks on their knees

Carcassonne enhanced? Which means: You place tiles and score them with meeples, but there is so much more because you MOVE the meeples. Much potential for analysis paralysis, rules more complicated than necessary - a different organizaion would be easier to get.

I didn't hate it, but I'm not sure if my desire to play again is just because I somehow kept missing very obvious bits of key game strategy.  There were a lot of unique elements that I actually liked, but I felt like luck of the tile draw and the importance of going first (and relative difficulty in setting that up) could really screw people over.

I want to like this, but it really could use another round of development. Given the tile placement rules, the draws are way too random. The endgame seems problematic - in our game, it devolved into churning the blessings.

Very high on my 2008 priority list.
Update:  After doing a lot of research on this game, I've decided that it's not for me.  At least, I'm not willing to take the risk on it.  I'd love to give it a try sometime, though, if I ever get the chance.

One play. Some decent ideas, but overall a game that just fell flat for me.  I think we took longer trying to learn the rules than we did actually playing.  The luck of the tile draw seems to be too much of a factor as well.

Ragnar Brothers; Monastery is a tile laying game in which players construct different parts of a medieval monastery. The work is done by the monks of a player. The monks may move from tile to tile and in addition to building work they can also study, toil or pray. In the ‘icon’ game monks can also make use of the special properties of some of the tiles. The tiles vary in value ranging from 1 point field and path tiles to 5 point Chapter House and Library. The higher the value of tile the more monks are needed to build it. Players can build independently, but often they are required to work collaboratively. The game spreads over two days of monastic life, with turns being allocated as time for study and toil or for services in the abbey. At each service a new abbot is elected and apart from going first in the turn the abbot also has some significant powers. In order to win the game players must collect the letters of the abbey’s motto ‘Libera Nos Quaesumus Ab Omnibus Malis Amen’. The letters become progressively more expensive and players must decide whether to buy letters or recruit extra monks. Points at game end are also awarded for the ‘blessings’ which players can collect throughout the game.

I just had to have this for the meeples but there's a good Euro game in the box as well.  It's like laying Carcassonne tiles for a purpose.  The rules could be better written.  There's a good turn example on the Ragnar website and a good sequence example in one of the exel files here on BGG.

A fiddly, non-intuitive game that just doesn't feel complete.  Like one of the other commenters mentioned - I felt like I dominated from start to finish, and lost by 5 points.  In this case, fiddly means that there are a lot of little rules that are a pain to pay attention to that I'm not sure add much to the game.

Okay game.  Lots of nice mechanics stuck together, particularly the field building, farming and town movement.  Luck dependent and frustrating, but somehow fun.

Some great ideas here and potentially very cut throat euro game despite the welcoming visuals. Would like to play it again though there seem like so many more games of this type that are more enjoyable.

Similar in mechanics to Glen More, with arguably more theme. The range of different routes to victory remind me of Stone Age or Ninjato. It's a brief game, with very tight economics so it is hard to get much done. But it is a lot of fun. There is the opportunity to pimp the game with wooden resources which I always enjoy. It's a good solo game too.

Traded away for an almost complete copy of Heroquest with expansions. Walnut Grove just wasn't seeing any play.

RATING: 6
Although this has some amount of interest to it and is easy enough, the moves felt very prescribed to me - and so pretty much tension free. It is brutal in forcing you to feed your workers - especially near the end game - but this just furthers the demand of the game dictating your moves. All in all an average game and I much prefer something like Glen Moore for same weight and similar enough duration.

Walnut Grove plays fast and fits into the filler category. Does everything you'd expect from a filler, i.e., doesn't provoke any negative feelings but on the other hand you forget the game the moment it's off the table.

In other words, Walnut Grove is OK.

This game is Okay, bordering on Good. Not Great. Decent, fairly light, highly randomized (random tile draws, random improvement/laborer placement, random year disks, random coin values). Solitaire simultaneous play. Puzzle-esque. The feeding/heating requirements in the winter season can be onerous.

It's very much a struggle against the seasons, which I'm not sure I'm in love with. The action selection on the board in the fall provides only the very faintest whiff of player interaction, and I really prefer much more than what's on offer here. There's got to be something better out there for a quick, 40-minute 2p. 

Traded for 1960 (ZMan 2e)

Walnut Grove is a light game with a nice touch of theme. Its strenght is its short playing time even with 4 players. I have to admit though that there might be too much of a similarity between games, because there seems to be not much strategic options. The year discs pretty much dictate what you gonna do the whole year and there is no space for any further decisions. Anyway a nice filler game.

Wow, kind of a brutal game, but I get that it's supposed to be that way.  There's way too few options/turns and it leads to AP.  Seems like the precursor to a better game, using the same mechanics.

Really neat little Euro where "going to town" is a Rondel action mechanic. The other big thing is drawing and matching up ranch tiles on your player board where you assign workers to get resources. 

Walnut Grove is hard! People need food and wood for the winter asap! You really feel like you're struggling on the frontier.

RATING: 4
A light efficiency game that just struck me as bland. The only interesting element is that worker upkeep is so expensive that it's by no means certain that three workers are better than two.  Beyond that, the best choices when placing workers or when shopping in town all felt pretty obvious.  Player interaction boils down to denying an opponent access to a building by getting there first.

Artwork isn't memorable one way or the other, production quality is fine.

RATING: 7.5
Fun and quick-playing game, a mash-up of Carcassonne, worker-placement, rondel, and resource managements. A lot of work goes into feeding and heating, i.e. keeping your head above water, and (based on my first play) scoring over and above that can take some effort! Packs a lot into a short play, would like to play again.

As a friend of mine likes to say about games sometimes, this is a perfectly functional game.  Unfortunately it's not a compliment.  The game does what it's supposed to do, and does it well.  It's just not much fun.  Every round seems like a chore - do enough to survive and then do one action.  Woo hoo!  And then if you get someone in the group who doesn't pre-think their options, the game can drag.  Our first game took two hours as one of the players took a ridiculously long time to make decisions.  Also there's a really nasty issue with the first turn and four players.  Being the fourth player can, as we discovered, set you almost a full turn behind the others because you're likely to have to take a no-op.  This happened to me.  Fortunately I was able to recover from that but that doesn't mean it's not an issue.

This is a worthy, interesting game that really wants to make things tough on you when you play it.  You end up wanting to play it again so that you can, at least, avoid the punishment tiles the next time you play!  I am interested in playing again.

Having played it a second time, avoiding the punishment tiles, and winning.  Do I want to play it again?  Meh.  March 2012.

A light and faster agricola with some tiles like carcassone. The rules are simple, mechanic are well made, and the city is an intresting concept a lot less abstract than "possible actions". 

The game plays decently solo, too. 
May lack some replayability even with the random setup that adds freshness to each game.

RATING: 8.5
Great hybrid of a tile and worker placement game, with elegant mechanics and a fun seasonal system for action resolution. Thematically it does give that feel of Midwest settlers, struggling to survive the harsh winters, and the 'Neighborly Help' tiles reinforce this. Also like the movement around town, where you pay 'tithes' and 'taxes' passing near the Church and Town Hall. A simple game to teach, and a fun one to play, even comes with a solo rule where you're simply trying to hit a VP target. A quality light/medium Euro that will remain in our collection.

RATING: 8
A game of homesteads in the oooool' west. This has the "feed your family" elements of Agricola, combined with the "tile laying" element of Carcassonne.  It's heavier than the later and much easier to set up and explain than the former.  The third element to the game is the giant rondel style board players use to purchase improvements and laborers for their hometead.

Look, you have to know what your getting here.  It's not exactly the "wildest ride in the wilderness": It's low on player interaction and it's not the sort of old west game with gun fights and cattle rustlers.  There's little to no intentional screwage (at least in my early games).

What you do get is a tight economic/building game that is fast to play.  The tile laying delivers lots of satsifying decisions and fun spacial element and there's definitely that feeling of being just a bit short of having everythign you'd really need.

It packs a satisfying punch in a short playtime and worth a look if you like light-medium weight Euros.

I bought Walnut Grove because it was presented as "Carcassone meets Agricola". This is very far from reality, but the game is one to be enjoyed nonetheless...
The theme (little house on the prairie) is not very tight either.
Having said that, I must admit that the game is surprisingly fast-paced, with only 8 turns and just one action per turn (three of the four seasons are quite solitaryish puzzles), but has some depth and a bunch of meaningful decisions.
I wonder if it can stand many repeated plays, however its first showings are encouraging enough to explore it...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Initial Impression: This game melds the worker placement, tile laying, and rondel mechanisms together into a tight VP salad. Player interaction is indirect. The game doesn't feel very thematic to me. The game feels short, is quick-playing, and there's definite tension in the decision making.

Can be played in 30-45 minutes once you know the game. Great little puzzle game and a quasi-filler. There is enough randomness in the tile draw to make every game different and challenging. It took me four games before I scored at least 25 points.

[i]Posted: 2/15/12, Rated: 8[/i]

By the time you're reading this comment, you've undoubtedly seen previous reviewers say that [i]Walnut Grove[/i] is "[i][thing=31260]Agricola[/thing][/i]-lite meets [i][thing=822]Carcassonne[/thing][/i]."  I can understand that sentiment.  [person=11507]Klemens Franz[/person] has a very distinctive, pleasing style that is seen in most (all?) of [company=234]Lookout Games'[/company] titles.  Plus, you're playing the role of a farmer, so there is that connection as well.

As for the similarity to [i][thing=822]Carcassonne[/thing][/i]: you draw tiles randomly from a bag.  I know, I know: there is also a worker placement element that hearkens back to the meeples in [i][thing=822]Carc[/thing][/i], but here your workers only stay on their tiles for a season.  The method of building out your player board feels more like [i][thing=27173]Vikings[/thing][/i] to me, or if I get into the wayback machine, like a micro version of [i][thing=4099]Keythedral[/thing][/i].  I can't begrudge commentators from making the more ubiquitous connection.

With all of the obligatory name drops out of the way, how does [i]Walnut Grove[/i] play?  Objectively speaking, it feels scripted.  The game boils down to your ability to exploit available bonuses, and the luck of the tile draw.  Let me be more specific.  In the Spring you draw tiles from the bag.  Most of the time, you will only add one to your board.  Each tile depicts two or three different terrain types.  If you are fortunate enough to draw compatible pieces -- especially early on in the game -- then you will have an advantage in gathering resources.  Knowing this is important can and should influence your decision about which tiles to keep.

Worker placement happens in the summer.  You place your pawns on the contiguous regions which you want to harvest.  One type of resource will offer a bonus if harvested this round, and thus presents you with the second scripted influence: If at all possible, you want to harvest that resource and receive its bonus.  There's a similar bonus available in the Fall, but it's not as compulsory as the Summer bonus unless you're taking that specific town action.

The town is a rondel-like path lined with buildings which can be activated.  This is the one opportunity for players to interact with each other as they vie for individual spaces.  Pick your favorite game for an analogy of this mechanic: [i][thing=18602]Caylus[/thing][/i], [i][thing=35677]Le Havre[/thing][/i], more recently [i][thing=50750]Belfort[/thing][/i], etc.  You only have one pawn to place during this season, and competition can be fierce.  Winter brings an attrition mechanism to cull resources from the game, and then you start over with Spring.  Wash, rinse, and repeat for a total of eight rounds.

By the way, the one town option which offers a bonus in the Fall is selling your goods for coins.  You can earn an extra coin if you sell the type of good depicted on the round marker.  Coins are drawn at random from a bag, and have victory point values from 0 to 2.  It's like the worst part of [i][thing=30869]Thebes[/thing][/i], only not quite so bad because the amount of effort required to draw from the bag is much, much less.  In fact, there's a potential churn element to coins: they can be used as "wild" resources in certain situations, allowing you to get rid of the copper coins (value: 0) and keep more valuable resources to use later.

With all of that said, [i]Walnut Grove[/i] sounds like a pretty dry offering, right?  Here's the thing: it simply [i]works[/i].  It has that one intangible element of [i]fun.[/i]  It is really a resource management game, where the acquisition of resources is easy to understand.  The random tile draw adds uncertainty and anxiety, but usually offers enough options to get by.  The game moves briskly, and a four-player game can be concluded in 30-45 minutes.  It feels meaty without being overly thinky, and it has an attractive appearance.  I'm definitely looking forward to teaching this game to others.

RATING: 7.5
First Play: Rules are short but unclear in places. For the record, coins can be used as food and wood to burn.

I don't like the randomness of the coin draw and the fact that on your last turn you could sell three goods and draw 3 gold for 6 points. Just unnecessary randomness for me.

This aside, what a cracking little filler of a game. 45 mins to an hour and plenty to think about and do. Little if any oportunity for screwage but not a bad thing. Very impressed and look forward to second game.

Post script after 4th play. The lottery of the points for gold is game breaking. In our last game one player drew six gold whilst another drew only one in the whole game despite selling the same number of goods. The variant needs to grant one point per coin.

Another 3 player game with myself, Brian and Sander. Sander dominated filling all 3 of his improvement spaces which gave him another 14 VP at the end of the game. This is another example of a simple to explain but fairly heavy euro. There is really a lot to do in this game and you don't have much time to do it all. Tile placement is so key to being able to get goods. And all of this brain burning goodness happens in a tight, 8 round, 45 minute game.

It's aight... The game plays fairly quickly and seems tight and tense, but it also seems like it could get a bit stale after a few plays.

You have a hodgepodge of mechanics; tile placement, worker placement, resource management and a pseudo Agricola feed your workers thing going on. 

On my first play, just when I was starting to get my engine going it was over. It plays quick!

Not a game I had really heard much about nor was I planning to play.  I quite enjoyed it with the tile-laying, manage resources, grow your people considerations.  Not an amazing game, but definitely good.

Second play wasn't as good, but still decent.  I know there were some theming issues, but the others I was playing with had more issues with them than me.  I still think this is a decent, light, quick game, but I'll definitely need another play or two before I can know if it's worth keeping.

It's worth keeping for us as a 2 player game.  It plays very fast and provides some interesting decisions throughout, but nothing overwhelming.

RATING: 10
This is a fantastic stream lined Euro. Most of the phases are done simultaneously, so the game is fast. One of the true gems in my collection. I'm always on the lookout for short deep games and this is one.

The Rule book could have been better. Don't forget: the Neighborly Help tiles can only be used to pay for things you MUST do like feeding and heating workers or paying city hall and the church. The other important rule is that coins can be used as a wild recourse for ANYTHING (except for selling resources at the stores).

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I have been wanting to explore more from this designer since I am a huge fan of Eclipse, and this was my first played game of his other than Eclipse.  Wasn't really sure if I was going to be a fan of this, since I am usually not into the spacial tile placement games, but this one was fun.  The tile draw is pretty random, and players can get totally screwed over, but this one plays pretty quickly, so it didn't really bother me.  It seemed to offer a bunch of tough choices, but I am not sure how much longevity it has.  Keeping it for now, and would like to play it more, but I'm curious too see how I feel about this one in a year or 2.

Wow.  This is a cool game.  It's a cube pusher, that is certain.  It's also very quick.  With two, on our second and third game, it took us 30 minutes.  

It's a resourse gathering/spending type of game that has tile placement (which is tough).  Lots of tough choices in a game that, for me, was satisfying.  Felt like a bigger game but in a short time frame. It's tight as you have eight rounds.  Every round counts.  Can't wait to try with three.

Very decent blending of elements from Agricola, Le Havre and Carcassonne. Plays quickly even with four players - much can be done simultaneously, and there are enough interesting decisions along the way to keep your interest for the time it takes. This could be a great social/family game for all ages and serve as a fine gateway to worker placement games in general. A player could easily transition from this to any of a number of such games: Agricola, Le Havre, even Caylus possibly...

To say that this is to Worker Placement games what Ticket To Ride is to Railroad games might be a little strong but certainly what Railways of the World is to Rail games. And that's not a criticism exactly but don't expect a lot of strategic depth here - good fun though!

Provisional rating, likely to drop if I play it again!

Typical multiplayer solo efficency/worker placement/tile placement game.

Theme is so pasted on you can smell the glue - and the interaction is limited to the worker placement bit, but the implementation is such that you have to fiddle with turn order to avoid being inavertantly blocked from the action you wanted.

Overall was bored playing it - and no desire to ever play it again, but I'm no fan of this type of game. I really should trust my instincts and avoid them completely.

Not sure if we played this wrong, but I greatly disliked how your options became fewer as the game progressed until in the final rounds there was nothing at all to do except cash in a few resources.

After 2 solo plays and 1 group play with non-gamers, it seems pretty dissatisfying.  The tile mechanic just doesn't seem to work out that well, or be that intuitive for non-gamers.  The choices in town don't really feel like choices - it's generally easy to see what the best available move is.  The interaction, that comes from where people are in town, doesn't seem that much like purposeful interaction - I don't see people trying to intentionally block others very often, or the ability to make sacrifices to get some place first - more often than not, you're just sort of dealing with the board.

RATING: 6
I enjoyed this game much more than I expected to.  I had waffled for a year before I got it and I'm glad I finally did.

It's a medium/medium-light game that plays in about an hour (less for 2).  It's got a lot going on and every turn is critical.  The tile placement is a nice touch along with the feeding crisis and the fact that you have 8 "actions" in the entire game.  Definitely a game I hope to play as a filler for a long time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Walnut Grove is an interesting amalgam of tile laying on an individual board and a common center board of actions in rondel form.  It is built to be harsh, requiring a significant number of your actions each round just to keep your workers fed and warm, and big penalties if you fail to do so.  Getting anything done after that is almost a bonus.

The game injects some replayability with the season "disks", which are cardboard circles that have the food and heat requirements for the season, and also dictates how many tiles are drawn/kept.  There are 4 "A" and 4 "B" disks, and they are shuffled up, with the As on top and then the Bs.  While it does a good job of preventing scripted play, it also has the possibility of randomly making the game either more or less generous depending on the order they come out.  Now, you can argue that everyone suffers equally from this when the game is extra harsh, but that is not necessarily fun for everyone.  

Each turn players draw some number of tiles and get to keep some of them - usually this allows one to discard the "worst" tile, but in our experience it was rare to draw the tile you really needed.  We found that the game demanded a large amount of spatial skill to orient current tiles optimally and plan for future tiles without knowing what was coming.  The tile draw is a huge random element, and can definitely drive the game.  If you're drawing things that do not help your plans while your opponent gets what they want, it can be a long game.  

The central rondel offers actions that let you purchase and exchange goods, and buy tiles that reduce maintenance costs and generate end game points.  The action spaces are limited, and there is a race to get what you want.  Like the rest of the game, it feels tight, and it's easy to be screwed out of what you really needed by what seems like bad luck.  Of course, your position on the rondel, and therefore your turn order, is based on what you did last turn, so it's not luck at all, just your inability to predict what you will need.  OTOH, the game is deliberately tactical and works hard to obscure the information you would need for long range planning, so when this happens, it feels like bad luck even if it's not.  

If that weren't enough, there is a resource management aspect to the game because you have limited storage for the stuff you're harvesting from your farm.  Most of the time, this doesn't matter, except when you get a nice big harvest and can't keep it all.  

Overall, I liked it but my wife did not - it was too harsh for her.  I found it satisfying when things started to click and I could see how to make some headway.  However, there is a fair amount of randomness in the tile draw, and I think the game does ask players to plan for the long game without the information necessary to do so.  This was easily the most frustrating part of the game for me.

Gift from Secret Santa 2011!!! A very awesome game with a ton of difficult choices to be made! I love expanding your personal farm and placing your workers! The fall is tough because you only get 1 action per year! And then the dreaded winter! All-in-all a great great game!

A really decent 60 minute game with only 8 actions...yet has shades of Carcassonne (tile laying to form enclosed areas) meeting Agricola (harvesting, feeding, heating, building the best ranch/farm).

A good, simple but challenging little Euro. Agricola-lite meets Carcassone meets Glen More. Having only one town action per autumn phase is really tough, though, and you really scrape by throughout the game. I wish there were more barns/cabins available, because it's hard enough to feed/heat each winter without the added restriction. It also doesn't make sense thematically (of course, nothing about the theme makes sense anyway: why do blue people only eat blue food?). 

Tile placement can really make the difference between doing well and doing poorly throughout the game. Unfortunately, that also means lucky draws are really going to benefit some players more than others, especially people who get valuable resources (like wood!) early on. It's not as punishing as Agricola, however, and I like that you can "pay back" your most recent begging card.

I dig it!  Walnut Grove is a bit of an engine building game, which I tend to love, in which you build up your farm throughout the game.  You'll add more land, workers, and structures throughout the game, increasing your capacity to produce and store money and goods.

Game play is very quick and straight forward.  Each round is composed of 4 seasons:

1) Spring: Add a tile or two to your farm.
2) Summer: Send your workers out to harvest from your tiles.
3) Fall: Take an action in town.  You might sell some good at the market, hire a new worker, gain a favor which will score you points at the end of the game, etc.
4) Winter: Feed and heat your workers.

Play 8 rounds of that and tally up the scores based on various elements of your farm.

Overall, just a cool little game with some meat to it.  Good stuff!

Interesting worker placement game wirh a very limited amount actions available each game. The tile-laying aspect is intereting, but the game lacks "something special".

A cross between Agricola and Carcassonne?! Jesus, no way! This game reminds me of absolutely nothing about the two other (great) games. It's not often I use the "meh" word, but that is a word which describes this game the best I think. I think its biggest strength is the quick play time as there isn't really a lot of meat.

Walnut Grove is simpler than I expected. I had heard loose comparisons to Agricola, and I didn't really have any enthusiasm to play. However, a first play was very enjoyable, and there's a nice rhythm of lay tiles, place workers to get resources, spend stuff, and feed.

I could even see my wife enjoying this. Not sure how it holds up over repeat play, but it strikes me as a solid game so far.

Components: Lots of great detail on the tiles and board. Good texture to the components. Solid wood.

Experience: Tight worker placement game where my people are constantly starving, like in Agricola or Stone Age. In this game, it pays to specialize, because there just isn't enough time to do it all. I like how the random tile draw helps push me toward a certain farm configuration, which I must then struggle to support.

Walnut Grove has straight forward rules with just a couple icons you need to keep in mind while playing.
The theme should help get it on the table with family members.  But once they realize it does not official license content just hope that they like the game play.
It has a good number of mechanics for a low weight game, I think it is likely to get replay.
I only had two concerns.  
It is fairly long.  Eight rounds seems like a lot for this game.
It also was pretty luck based with respect to what coins you draw from the bag.  So players just need to know going in that it is not a game where you will win on gameplay alone.

Farming
Tile Placement
Worker PlacementA light mashup between Carcassonne and Agricola. The goal of the game is to develop your own ranch. The better the ranch, the more points you will score at the end of the game. Players can improve their ranch during the game by adding new land tiles to it, hiring more workers, building improvements, etc  The game play is divided into eight years, and each year is divided into Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter phases. During Spring, players add land tiles to their ranch. During Summer, players place their workers to gather resources from the fields. When Autumn comes, all players get to visit the city. Finally, during the Winter phase, players need to feed their workers and heat their homes.

RATING: 6
Quite abstract and disconnected from the theme, but decent game nevertheless. Cubes seem rather loose, and actions rather tight. In fact, most of the actions on the board I wasn't even able to take. The game was over so quickly, and I didn't really feel like I had enough interesting decisions. I think it's a great, light family game though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Disappointed in this one. The tile-laying aspect is very limited (only 9 tiles throughout the game) and since the tiles don't need to match sides, the built areas end up looking visually awkward.

Then, in the town area, you are also severely limited. You will get to take exactly 8 actions over the course of the game. If another player happens to take your most beneficial action space, you will definitely have to settle for something less worthwhile. If this happens a couple times, and you can't reciprocate, you're probably out of the game.

Lastly, the random point swing in the game means chance will decide a lot of games. (The VP coins have random values of 0, 1 and 2. It's good to try to have 4-6 of these at the end of the game. If two equal players collected 6 coins, one of them could end up with 12 points while the other could have as few as none at all. In a game where an average score might be around 30, having a random point swing of up to 12 points seems odd.)

Another small complaint is that the setup time is pretty high for such a short game.

I really wanted to like this one more. (So did my wife.)

This can be a punishing game, depending on the luck of the draw.  In fact, that is my major quibble with the game - that there is far too high a degree of luck for a game that requires as much thinking and look-ahead as this does.  The difference between drawing a bronze and a gold coin can swing the game.  However, I really like a lot of the mechanisms in it, so I'm willing to forgive a lot.  I love the tile placement aspect and the worker placement, as well as the tough decisions about coins and cubes and firewood.  All that is great.  Just wish there was less luck.

A quick, light worker placement game. Considering how quick and light it is...the themeing is decent...cool board.  There is a medium degree of luck in pulling tiles and VP gold/silver/copper chits. But there is enough there to keep you coming back for another play.  It's a struggle to keep your head above water w/this one.  I'm eager to play again to see if I can explore how to do better (even though I did win due to some lucky chit pulls).

RATING: 7
Players are farmers, working the land, and trying to turn a profit over eight years.  Each turn is a year, represented by a tile that is flipped over, revealing events that will occur that year.  The year is divided into four seasons.  Spring sees players expand their land, Carcassonne style, by adding a tile to their holdings.  Summer sees farmers deployed to the land to earn fish, wood, grain and sheep (cubes).  Autumn sees the players mooch around the town, taking one action (buy buildings, hiring a farmer), obtain cubes, sell cubes, etc).  Finally winter sees players feeding their farmers and heating their homes.  At the end of the game players earn points for money, fenced farms, buildings and special end of game bonuses.  Snappy little game, offering a lot of meat in a 45 minute playing time.  Feels like an Agricola-angst filled farming experience, by the designer of Eclipse - and it's a better game than both of them!

Short and quick.   Blend of Carcassone and Agricola?  Well, only sorta.   Workers have to eat food which matches their color, and people in town march around clockwise and pay tolls when crossing certain spaces.   There is some luck of the draw in the terrain tiles and coin tokens which helps keep the game light.   Overall, there are a lot of weird abstractions that don't help the game much, but I think if played quickly (say 30 mins) it's probably fine.   Can be a bit frustrating as resources and coins are very tight.

Essen Copy.

Haven't play it yet but did look at the components and rulebook. I've read it and it's only 4 pages long!

Base on the explanation, seems like my kind of game. There's a bit of tile laying mechanics there with a bit of management where you need to get resources, go to the town to do many kind of actions; like to improve your player board, then you need to feed workers based on its colour; blue pawn eats blue cube, and then you need to keep your workers warm.

Can be played solo with no change of rule if I'm not mistaken. Yup, definitely my kind of game.

Straight to my buy list.

To me, Walnut Grove took all the tediousness of Agricola and Carc and put it into a light game. The feeding of workers is tedious, not suspenseful. The tile placement was uninspiring. Plain scoring. The artwork and production values (offset tiles) is below average. A swing and a miss by Lookout.

This is a light but tight tile placement, worker placement, efficiency puzzle fitted nicely into the theme of Little House on the Prairie. It was described as a combination of Agricola and Carcassonne which should've driven me away because both those games are very high on my 'MEH' list. However, I really, really love this game!!! I feel Walnut Grove is much tighter than Agricola and the tile placement provides more direction than Carcassonne in that I know if I don't generate enough wood my workers will freeze so I'll try to get as big a forest as I can etc. vs “Oh I got a tile with a road on it...hmmm...where do I put it?” If I compare it to another tile placement/worker placement game - Keyflower – I like this one much much better. Walnut Grove is short and feels short, Keyflower is short and feels looong so it overstays its welcome. In both those games you feel like you've just gotten your engine going and its over. If you think any of those 3 games are the bees knees, then this is probably not the game for you. This is one of the few games with a 'personal village' area that I like. On the whole I prefer central board action. I think the aspect of worker placement I like in this (it's my least favourite game mechanism) is that you are placing workers to generate your own resources and so somebody who likes to play the 'denial strategy' will not go very far. There is competition in the town for spots but you always feel like there is something you can do, and not enough time to do everything you want anyway.

Lots of good things about this one - highly replayable due to loads of random setup (randomly distributed player farms whether blue or yellow workers come out, random draw of the worker pawns available for hire in the town, and where they are placed on the board - the Saloon, Hotel, and Lodge require different resources to hire people, random draw of the buildings, which varies the number of available houses and barns, random draw of end game bonus tiles etc.), has that comforting feeling of a classic euro so if you like the 'feeling' of games like Santa Cruz, Finca, Seeland etc. then this would also be in that same vein, plays excellent with 2, plays only over 8 rounds so it's very quick, good components and a short and clear rulebook. However, the way some of the rules are phrased could've been clearer. I'd say there are only a couple of negatives - the game can feel restrictive (you are required to provide food and heating for your workers, pay taxes, and in addition you have minimal storage space), bonus coins can make the game swingy and the highly randomised nature of pretty much everything in the game which gives it its replayability also leads to a feeling of...well...randomness :)

An enjoyably relaxing game. Bit of a puzzle aspect and some resource management with a tight VP scoring system. You place tiles to create areas you can harvest for resources (more of same tile produces more of that resource) and then you have to feed your people and heat their homes a la Agricola. You get one (and only one) action per turn to do something.

One play in the halls at Essen.  Not helped by poor advice from demo/explainer that meant poor first turn or three.  Fairly unforgiving system.  Priority is to ensure you have enough food/fuel for the winter - and set those bits aside in summer.  Demo/explainer couldn't understand why I did this before doing my summer move.  Felt like the Agricola mechanism (which I'm not a great lover of) trying to be expanded into a game that was "more multiplayer" rather than the "multiplayer solitaire" of Agricola.  Rating reflects that whilst the game is probably OK, there will almost certainly be something better on offer for me.

Little House on the Prairie meets Carcasonne with a rondel. The actions on the rondel are at a high level of granularity, so each turn matters - a lot, and maybe too much. The only significant player interaction comes from opponents taking a spot you wanted on the rondel, and taking tiles on a few of the action spots before you can grab them. There are many ways to score points, and I like the spatial element that the Carcassonne style tiles bring into play as you add them to your own player board to help generate resources and get points for end-of-game scoring based on how many walled areas you build.

Elég egyszerű szabályokkal bír a játékidő se túl hosszú, de mégis van agyalni való. Nekem való játék. :)
Két játék után mégis volt némi ellenérzésem. Nem szeretem annyira a krízismenedzselést, amikor a játék nem a nagyratörő építkezésről szól, hanem az életben maradás határán táncolásról. Némileg ide kapcsolódik, hogy szeretem, hogy ha aránylag sok pont van egy játék végén, mert úgy jobban ki tudnak jönni a különbségek.
Ezt a két apró "hibát" leszámítva azért tetszik. Kíváncsi vagyok milyen többen, mert eddig csak kettesben sikerült kipróbálni. Kicsit félek, hogy a sok kiszorítás miatt négyen káoszos lesz.

Három kétszemélyes játék után még mindig izgalmasnak találom, talán egyre jobban tetszik. Bár úgy érzem, hogy a kezdés kicsit túl nagy előnyt jelent benne.

This game is quite fun actually. For what it is, it's another one of these deceptively simple looking games with a lot of puzzlement to work out on your choices. My first game was solo, but I can see where if there were more players in the game, it would add yet another layer of complexity to the choices you have to make. Now the neat thing about this game is it plays for 8 rounds (which have 4 seasons). With more players there won't be as much down time because on most of those seasons everyone plays simultaneously. The only one they don't is when moving about the town, and that's where it gets really tricky. Who moves where can change the dynamics quite a bit, and you'd find yourself rethinking what your move will be next. Great game! I have to get some real players to join me at some point.

I like this farm-and-survive game, sort of a poor man's Agricola. Tough decisions all over, and takes work but not impossible, so rarely does someone fall out of the game.

I have mixed feelings about Walnut Grove after 4 complete solo plays. I love the theme, and many elements of the game reflect the theme fairly well. I like puzzle games, and this one is definitely puzzle-like. I'm always on the lookout for games that play well solo, and this one does. The good-quality components also look nice on the table. 

However, the game feels like it's over just as it is getting started. This anticlimax frustrates me. I also feel too limited by taking only one action in town during the fall. 

The English rules are a bit too brief. I spent more time researching my questions than I spent playing the game. Thanks to BGG for being a reliable source of info!

Update: After another play with my husband, I decided to move this game out of my owned collection. It's a fine game, but it's not what we are looking for.

Welcome to Walnut Grove is a solid design, albeit not a revolutionary one - but that isn't important. Touko Tahkokallio and Paul Laane have designed a very cute tile laying/worker placement game. It has simple mechanisms, a quick play time, and all the stress and difficult decisions you would expect when you hear "you have to feed your workers". I normally prefer heavier games, but Welcome to Walnut Grove has proven to make up for its lightness with its charm. So far I'm loving it :)

I played once in June and rated it a 7 after that play.  In a lot of ways it's standard Euro fare.  Plus, it has that 'punishing' effect to the game that's not too bad.  I'll play this one and enjoy it, but it's just not a stand out.

Played this with my wife. The game has interesting mechanics around tile and main worker placement. Lots of tough choices between taking penalties or avoiding them. The rule book is pretty terrible had to resort to checking bgg for clarifications (one for which the designer changed his mind about a rule). Overall we enjoyed the game and would like to play it again soon!

RATING: 5
Tile placement, worker placement, and a sort of humongous rondel as a board with different powers to select.  These different mechanics actually mesh together very well, and the game is fairly simple but gives you several very different sets of options each turn.  Overall it works together very well but also isn't very fun in my opinion.  It didn't have much of a soul.  

There is essentially no player interaction, except that you can block another player from getting a spot on the board.  I don't have a problem with solitaire style efficiency games, but this one doesn't really have enough meat on its bones to be interesting in that genre. 

Add to that little gripe the fact that you can really screw yourself by not getting enough food or wood, and I don't think the game works well as a casual or family style game.  

In my opinion this is just another light euro that doesn't really bring anything new to the table.

"Agricola Lite" really isn't too bad of a description. Plays really quickly and is nice with 2. Not a huge amount of things to do in the game but it flows well. Much of your turns if you have a lot of workers will be "place person to feed themselves."

Starting @ 6.75 based on a 1st 2-player game.

This felt kind of clunky for the first few turns, but the pace began to pick up by the end of the game, but not in time to please my wife (even though she won, as she often does when we get a game in).

As this was a hopeful game for her (Little House theme), it was a bit disappointing, but the next game will flow more easily I'm sure.

Hopefully this will come up a bit for both of us.

Very nice, straightforward little economic game with a short play time.  It manages to fit a lot of game into a small package.  I like the scramble for resources and the subtle inclusion of a bunch of little mechanisms like the tile puzzle, the rondel, and the storage issues in a way that doesn't interfere with the flow of the game.

RATING: 7
Like a mix of Carcassonne, Puerto Rico and Agricola.  You place a tile (match the edges like Carcassonne), then place workers to generate resources from tile regions (like Puerto Rico), then take actions that allow you to increase your number of workers, improve your "farm", generate revenue, etc (as in most worker placement games)... and don't forget providing food and heat for your workers (as in Agricola).  While it has elements from each of these games, I don't feel like it would replace any of them; simply "more of the same."

RATING: 7
A gateway worker placement with some interesting things about it, and one major drawback.  You have your own farm which each turn expands by drawing tiles and choosing one to add to the farm (expand quarries, forest, wheat, herds or ocean).  Place workers on areas to gain resources.  Go to town to gain buildings, free supplies, new workers or money.  Spend food & wood for winter.  Do this 8 times.
It is simple, easy to understand, with little interaction except in town.  A sound game and good gateway.  Here is the problem.  It really grinds you for surviving winter by sucking up huge amounts of resources in the form of food & wood.  You waste a lot of workers to fulfil this need, making it kind of pointless hoop jumping (which is a mechanic I really hate).  I need to play this a bit to try different strategies to see if I can avoid the hoops.

Simple.  Don't get extra workers & enclose fields fast!

RATING: 9
A speedier version of a typical plodding cube-laden Euro. 3/4 of the game phases are taken simultaneously, and it incorporates tile laying and resource production. The theme is somewhat mismatched, I never feel like Pa Engalls on the prairie. But I do feel like Pa Engalls trapped in some alien science experiment which I actually prefer.

July 2015:

Played this three times quickly.  Play went very fast with most things occurring simultaneously.  Was still conflict in the worker placement part (and felt like you were fighting the game itself during much of the time).

It was very promising how much the random terrain tile draws could influence your game.  Otherwise I didn't feel like there was enough variety from game to game.

Really, I liked this one a lot.

RATING: 9
Very, very impressed with this one.  Really is my kind of game.

This is a very tight and challenging engine building game, which will sometimes beat you down with upkeep and leave you scratching your head, but runs along at such a great pace and rhythm that you just want to keep playing more and more turns.  With experiences players I can see this being played in 30-40 minutes which is a fantastic acheivement given the depth of possibilities.

This and Glass Road are up there with my favourite engine building games.

RATING: 6
LOLWUT?  The carcassonne style mechanism is really neat, and the worker placement is OK, but the "town" is absurd.  It takes more than a year to walk around town?  Why do I have to pay to cross the street?  Why do I have a BARN that can get full with only 4 coins in it?  Stupid, stupid stupid.  There is some potential here, and I'd be willing to play it again.  Tempted to build a whole new "town" board to replace the one in the game.  It does play quickly, since it's only 8 rounds, but it's hard to get anything productive done.

Walnut Grove is an engaging but quick game that should take around 45 minutes.  The tile-laying presents some pleasant problems to confront, as the tension exists between creating large sectors for efficient farming and fencing in areas for VPs.

The similarities to Agricola are mostly in the upkeeps - it can be painful to have to come up with all that fuel and food with only a single turn's worth of production.

I'm curious to try with 2.

Wow did this game just stink.  Right from the get go I had a sour taste in my mouth but thought maybe it would redeem itself a few rounds in.  Nope.

Basically the only thing I didn't mind as much as I thought was the randomness, which there's A LOT of.  But it's just dumb, take 2 turns and if that because you need to hoard your crap just to feed your people and depending when you go you will likely get screwed out of anything worth anything.  I was last from the get go and just fell further behind.  The feeding is so painful in this game it wasn't fun at all.

One thing I loved, picking the right moment or spot to go and pass knowing you just screwed everyone else over.  I enjoyed that more than the actual game, so yea...

Walnut Grove is a combination of an extended rondel/action selection mechanism, tile-laying and Agricola. Players draw tiles, use the rondel once on each of their 8 turns and finally have to feed their workers. The best part about Walnut Grove is the true decision whether it's worth it to get additional workers.
As a whole, it's an odd bird. While it has enough choices to induce AP into gamers, it has enough randomness to render deep thinking useless when probability turns against you. Our game suffered from 90 minutes duration including game explanation and discussion on a few rules which actually turned out to be explained wrong. Played to conclusion in a light way within the stated 45 minutes, I could see this being an enjoyable game in the vein of the thematically comparable Oregon although not as great.

The two big strengths to the game are the theme (I much prefer Little House on the Prairie to, say, a fantasy theme) and the quick play time. The decisions are interesting and it can often be quite tricky to feed/heat all your people while trying to earn points.

The big problem with the game that prevents it from achieving greatness is that there's really no player interaction aside from the town phase, so it feels completely solitaire.

I loved this on the first couple of plays, rating it a 8 and expecting it to climb higher.  However, after a few more plays, there are several issues with the game which spoiled some of the fun for me:

1.  I feel like there is a big 1st/2nd player advantage (by selecting the house).
2.  I feel frustrated by the random tile draw.  You set up your tiles for a "good draw" but I feel like 90% of the time you don't get what you need.  (I play with a variant that allow you to keep a tile from turn to turn, this helps in your planning, but still feels like that you don't get what you need 75% of the time).  Drawing tiles and getting the one you need is part of the fun of the game.  You don't want it to be too easy because that kills the tension.  But the reality is that it is "Age of Steam" tight--something I did not expect from a family game.
3.  There is too much luck in the coin draws.  I think the proposed variant of paying 0/1/1/2 (or maybe 0/1/2/2) will fix this problem.  At first I didn't think this was a big problem, but probably 50% or more of my games have been determined by lucky coin draws.

With the two fixes, I would rate this game a 8.  With the game as written, I would rate it a 6.

One of those nice games where getting extra workers is a decision, instead of being automatically a good thing.

Fairly brutal game, very unforgiving.  Turn order matters a lot, sometimes you need to be going later so somebody clears out.  Sometimes you need to be going earlier to grab a spot before somebody else.

Plays relatively quickly.  No stupid cards with text.  I'm not sure why we don't play this game more often.  Really seems like my type of game.

This is not an intense game and player interaction is minimal though does occur in the town phase, especially with more players but this is more of an obstructive nature than anything else. I have enjoyed every game and liken it more to slow amble in a sleepy forest than a sprint/marathon in a city. It has an economic element, initially the game can be very tight and a keen balance of essential income whilst expanding is important. Unlike a number of similar economic games it plays in about 30 minutes. Although not hard hitting I like this game and I advise all to give it a try.

This is strongly reminiscent of Homesteader gameplay wise, with auction replaced with what is effectively a worker placement rondel.  There's a Carcassonne style mini-game which makes it smell like Castle of Burgundy but that's really superficial.  It's fairly fun but getting punished for not feeding & heating (like Agricola) your people every turn could displease some people.  It plays reasonably fast and it probably better with 4.  There are various path to victory and the balance feels very solid.  On the downside, it will probably get old quite fast since the structure forces lots of choices on the play (you have to build a good forest for wood).  I don't think I would have heard about this game if it wasn't from the designers of Eclipse, but it works and its a nice alternative to Homesteader.

After one play, this has moved up to a must have.  I really enjoyed the slight Carc aspect to arranging tiles, the variety of ways to score points and paths to victory, the mix of worker placement, production, feeding and keeping your peeps warm.  As well, the game plays fairly quickly.  Of course, fail to provide for your peeps and you will be losing points although there is a nice aspect of being able to pay off these debts as long as you don't acquire another one first.  

After repeat plays, while I still enjoy this one, it has grown a bit stale on me.  I'm not certain there is much more to explore and I've so far found it relatively easy to do well each game.

This is an awesome game! It is similar to Agricola but much more condensed. Faster, simpler, and not as many objectives. This does affect the replay-ability of the game but not that much due to the randomness of the tile draws and the different objectives for each game. Overall, I love that each person can take their turn at the same time and it is also a fun game to teach because it is not a confrontational game. One of my favorites! Definitely want to try it with four players to see how it scales. Only bummer about this one is that it is hard to find...

Based on a single 4 player game.  Summary - great fun in a quick but not very balanced game with large periods of solitaire play.

Our second game, I am sure, will be a much closer affair but I have concerns that the first if you are able to get a gateway improvement card in the early rounds you set yourself up for a very narrow focused strategy but one that puts you in a strong position (top two finish at least).

I actually won our first game of Walnut Grove.  On the rare occasions that I actually win a game (four times in seven years)I immediately start to believe that the game is broken or we played it wrong.  I would be happy to play again but the nature of my victory is such that I wouldn't want to jump to conclusions based on misconceptions or misunderstood rules.

The Little House on the Prairie Worker Placement game! In this game, you go through eight years of expanding your farm/working in the fields, visiting town, and then feeding your people, as you should in any euro game with people. It's definitely a point salad game where you can get points from a variety of things (coins, closed pastures, building houses and sheds, etc), but they all focus around improving your little slice of the prairie while surviving the harsh winter.

I LOVED it! It was thematic, hard to do everything you wanted, and didn't have too many options. The town mechanism was really cool, especially with the spots that you'd have to pay coins to walk over. I really really love the tile placement and production element. This definitely jumped to the top of my wishlist.

Great mix of tile laying, resource conversion, jockeying for position in town, and planning for each season. There's nothing hugely innovative but it all fits very, very well together in this game.
It plays very well with 2 and all the way up to 4.

While it's not quite the predescribed Carcassonne + Agricola there are some design and game play cue derived directly from those games. Overall it's very light, fast, easy to get into, and quite competitive. Even when the tiles are "not in your favor" you can utilize the abundance of a resource you don't need in other ways. Turn order is also surprisingly important adding some significant tension to an otherwise solitaire game.

This game is very light, quick game.  It has elements similar to Ora et Labora since it has a worker placement element and territory element that affects scoring.  But there are very few actions in this game.  It is a well produced game but the game is very tight and very low scoring where each move is quite important.  I like the game, but it does seem that there are so few moves that the game ends too quickly at 8 turns.

Rating based on first 3 plays. THIS IS A GREAT GAME!!! It totally deserves a higher rating and will be my go to light/middle weight introduction EURO from now on. Its tight and rewards economic discipline. The tile laying aspect gives just enough randomness but doesnt feel like you lose for bad pulls because you choose where to put it, and the few upgrades used provides variety for repeat games. OVERALL SUPERB! Will probably go up especially as I expect my lovely wife to actually play this with me.

Way too tight for me.  Feels like you're scraping by and still end up poor at the end.  Random factors may start you off very badly and you can't recover.  You never get a fun engine running.  You just build a very very inadequate engine, then the game ends.  It is quite short though, so if you had a couple of sucky years to start and couldn't feed your people well, you can try again.

UPDATE:  I keep trying this and I keep wanting to like it (my wife likes it and I love playing with her) but man, it's just too tight.  Seems that the outcome of the game is dependent on who lucked out the most and pulled out a better land tile for themselves or better coins.  The scores are close enough that the difference is often exactly what the person drew out of the coin bag, which is a total crap shoot.  On a game like this I want to build an engine, try a strategy, see how it works, "play" with the toy, per se.  But this is JUST scraping by and hoping to provide for your people round after round.

I appreciate that the phases of each turn are simple and the game is designed to play quickly.  After my first few plays, it doesn't seem to move quite as fast as I would have expected since resources are very tight so there's a lot of planning and calculating to make sure you will have enough of the right resources to pay your costs and end of year upkeep.  The multi-player aspect initially didn't seem to offer significant interaction, but after a few plays I see that there are so few turns and so few bonus tiles that blocking a player's desired spot in town or buying the tile they wanted can really change the game.  However, it still feels a bit like multi-player solitaire where each is working on optimizing their own area, which isn't necessarily bad.  Overall, a very enjoyable light/middle-weight resource management game that I'm looking forward to more plays of.

[u]09-Feb-2013[/u]: I haven't gotten into this game yet, and I'm afraid I may not for quite some time.  Just too many other options in my collection that I also haven't delved into enough.  I did like what I saw though.  Several forums have mentioned Carcassonne as a cousin to this one, and that is what first grabbed my attention.  However, I would liken this more to Agricola than to Carc.  By far.  It is a lighter relative to Agricola in the fact you collect resources with your workers during your turn, and then must feed and shelter them at the end of the turn.

There are tiles you must place into your own play area each turn, but that is the extent of its comparison to Carcassonne.  The tiles you place will determine which resources and how many of each one you can collect.  Placing a worker on a water area that is two tiles large means you collect two fish.

There is also a central board where everyone has one worker who can buy/sell items (for VP or money) and to recruit additional workers.

As I said, I think this is more along the lines of Agricola Lite and seems like it has a similar feel but in a shorter play time.  You'll most likely want to do more than you are able each turn and that is its appeal.

[u]28-Feb-2013[/u]: It's a sad day...I have gotten rid of my very first game.  I was afraid that this very solid game just wasn't going to get the play time it deserved.  I think it's now found a happier home though.

RATING: 6
An interesting mash up of work-placement, tile-placement, and Agricola style-production and feeding. Ultimately I found it disappointing. Tile draws to add to your personal play areas are really just luck of the draw. You need to be very tactical because players can foil your plans easily by moving into the places you want to move to in the worker placement phase. Additionally, I just found the feeding of workers to be annoying. It's a cute looking, quick playing game with a lot of competition but for the reasons above it just did not work for me.

definitely in the 'gateway games' discussion, but i do not find this as interesting as some of those in my 'gateway games' division (namely, the things that add a few more building block mechanics such as vegas showdown, fresco and maybe manila or hollywoodblockbuster).   i find the treadmill of each turn a potential turn-off for a game designed as a gateway game.   

that said, the game functions fine.  the tile playing is interesting and the way the town works allows for some direct competition via blocking especially at the 4 player count.   i just do not find the game that interesting.

Grant got this game for next to nothing on the sale rack at Gencon a few years ago, it's okay.

A tight, demanding planning game that awards ruthless efficiency. Probably prefer this w/ 2 or 3 vs. 4 where blocking during the fall phase can get extremely ugly. The swings of the demand tiles seem like they can really swamp your planning or give you a huge unexpected windfall. They seem minor, but in a game where a point or two makes a major difference, that amount of luck can make or break your experience. More exhausting than fun at times.

This is a superb game that I probably rated a point lower than I want to because of the randomness of the points that come out of the bag.  This game is really tough on you.  You're constantly fighting to grow your farm while also making sure that everyone has food and shelter.  It's probably one of the best games that I've experienced that does this and makes you feel like you're on the verge on not being able to get enough resources to survive.

What is interesting about this game is that after reading the rules I thought it would be a very simple game.  After playing it I have realized it IS in fact a very simple game...that keeps you engaged throughout it's entirety, and you can explain it lickity-split.

You place land-form tiles that will produce goods for you mixed with some sort of worker placement game when shopping in town for various bonuses.  

Easy to learn, keep thinking to master.

RATING: 8
"Little House on the Rondel"
Thematically the players are pioneer settlers of the American West, farming, fishing and mining their way to victory. After the first play the game should take less than an hour with four players.

There are 8 turns, each representing a year on the ranch. These are divided into four seasons. In Spring, players draw tiles from a bag and add to their land holdings - edges don't have to match, but it helps if they do. Then farms produce little coloured cubes during Summer. In Autumn, we go to town and take a single action on the rondel; selling cubes, or hiring workers, or buying improvements that score points at the end. During Winter we must feed our workers appropriate food (blue cubes for blue workers, etc) and provide brown cubes for firewood. The township (rondel) is loaded with workers and improvements at the start of the game and these are not replenished - what's there at the start is all the players will have to work with. This can create quite tough competition for the "better" items.

The rulebook is poorly set out. The translation lacks finesse as well, but is reasonably clear. The components are serviceable but not outstanding. There are very minimal colour issues (green vs brown tile areas) but these do not affect play.

On the positive side, most actions are simultaneous so Little Rondel has almost no downtime. Players have interesting decisions about tile placement, where to use their workers, and especially how to use the rondel. A neat game.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I don't have much to say about this one, my buddy Mat taught me the game and we played once. I guess he wasn't that enamored with the game either because he ended up trading it. It was tight, my favorite part of the game was the tile laying portion of building out your land. Overall though the game had a very mechanical feel and didn't capture the theme as well as Agricola. Looking back another average worker placement game.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- A quick, extremely tight worker placement game.
- Tile laying; you are building out your land which will determine which goods you can harvest each round.
- Having to work your way around town without being able to back track forces you to plan multiple moves in advance.
- The random season disc really forces you to think on your feet because you never know what the feeding/heating situation will be.[/i]

RATING: 7
Nice game that comes in a tight little package that provides lots of hard decisions in a decent timeframe (making it a mid-weight Euro). Draw tiles to expand your farm, decide which fields (colors) of the farm you're going to harvest to gain resources, travel around the board to a free spot (turn order is crucial here) where you can convert your resources into victory points or into expanding your capabilities (judgement calls galore here), and then feed your dudes with leftover resources that you better make sure you didn't accidently spend. With only 8 rounds, and hence only 8 actions to buy stuff, it really is tight. I like it for that. Punchy. My main trepidation is that the collateral damage of someone taking the space you want/need in the town has too large an effect on your result given how few turns you get, and that fear drives the rating down a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
"Very clever game where every single point really matters. Can feel tight and punishing (or not so much). Good solo."

What I like:
- Love the theme, and feeding/heating your workers
- clever mechanics that feel simple but very meaty (although in a subtle way)
- Quick to play (worst-case learning 4p game 95 minutes; typically 60 minutes)
- Nice to have a good solo option
- Multiple paths to victory; can win with 0-3 extra workers

What I don't like:
- Can feel like you are not getting much done
- Just enough little rules to make it a bit difficult to teach
- In 4p, town blocking can really hurt
- Can bring on a bit of AP, but not bad
- Some thematic flaws (e.g. coins in barns)

This is a VERY constrained game. Each spring, you place ONE tile (one round you place 2). Each autumn you move ONCE in town, and you typically have 2-4 plausible options. You can only have up to 4 coins at a time unless you buy more storage. There ARE difficult decisions each turn, but only from among very few options. You are constantly battling short-term tactical play with long-term strategic thinking. 

Depending on how you play, resources can be plentiful, or painfully scarce. Winters can feel easy, or hard. 

The only really major luck element is the coin draw, and even that only rarely plays a significant role. You draw enough tiles to mitigate most of the bad luck there.

It feels nothing like Carcassonne. You build your own independent tile farm, and you don't have to match tile edges. Plus you only place 9 tiles all game.

The game is not as light and breezy as I had expected. It can be fairly thinky. It is not a gateway game, but should work well as a next-step game. I think the rules complexity is around 2.3, but the depth is maybe 2.6, so the BGG-voted 2.4 weight is reasonable.

I've been pretty happy with this medium weight Euro from Lookout. It is very tight and moves along at a good pace. I like the mix of tile placement, resource gathering, and action selection as well. It somewhat gives a feel of Carcassonne and Agricola mixed together.

This game has a tight set of rules and you have to make some tough decisions to do what you think is best.  I love the season discs, that change the game conditions each round.  I also love the tile placement/farmer placement at the beginning of each round.  And then you get just one movement on the rondel to pick your action in town.  Very tight, but you have to do the most you can with what little you have to do it with!  That makes for a very good game experience!

I'd agree with those who call this game Agricola Light; it evokes the farming/feeding cycle from Agricola without being nearly as involved.  The tile-laying aspect helped you become more efficient over time; I found this to be enjoyable.  The town track was a little dull, and I wonder if the 3rd and 4th players are at a disadvantage when the "get cubes" spots are taken.  My main concern with this game is that it may become too formulaic; it seems low on the game-to-game variability, as the only real thing that's different are the end-game scoring tiles, which don't end up affecting gameplay that much.

For reasons it does not take Freud to figure out, I relate to games that utterly beat the living crap out of you, only to then ask, "What are you going to do about it?"  Far more straightforward than it might seem from reading forum questions, it is eight years of interconnectedness where you turn around at the end and wonder why you could not do more.  Of course, I would love for there to be more content.... more year discs, more victory goals... to vary subsequent games.  But in the end, this is a singular, one-off gem, like 'In the Year of the Dragon,' where, at the end of it all, it genuinely hurts so good.

This game is tense, maybe too tense. In my 1 play I had the feeling I constantly had to go for damage control (= get food and fire wood) and scoring points (= building up something) is inferior to that. No wow-feeling at all after 1 play.

By one the guys who did Eclipse? Really? Eclipse = far superior in my opinion and has essentially nothing to compare to this game. I suppose both designers didn't work on Eclipse. Enough about that, but this game is a mean game. The game wants you to fail therefore I don't like it. It is quite simple games that want you to fail, I don't enjoy as a rule. It has some cool mechanics- Tile laying and rondel. Money is tight and every $1 matters. There is a bunch of luck for what you pull from the bag but decisions once you do! All in all I liked it enough where I could stand to play again, I just might never choose to. It is one of the [i]better[/i], this game hates you that I have played vs- Archipelago, and Agricola are what come to mind. For me it was meh.

This is a very quick playing farming game for 1-4 players. Most actions are done simultaneously which speeds things along a lot, and there is very little player interaction with 2 players.  The mechanism for collecting the resource cubes is fun where you lay tiles to create chains of production areas and you produce 1 for each tile in the chain when a worker is assigned. I also like trying to properly budget everything so you can eat, heat and pay taxes is tougher than you first realize.

Very pleasant and incredibly fast solo experience. Have played more games that I have logged, but so far never reached the 25 points needed to 'beat the game solo'!

Have finally figured this one out so now score more than 25 points relatively regularly. Still a long way to go to the really high scores, and still a very enjoyable game.

Has some of the aspects of Argicola but with its own flair
This has a tile laying aspect where you build up areas to produce resources, worker placement determines which resources you go after. 
The town segment is where you can build for next turn or go after scoring items.

This seems to be pretty brutal of a game and basically a multi-solo game because there is only one of the four phase that having barring on each others turn.  kind of Agricola-lite meets a more in depth Carcassonne with a little random chaos thrown in.  This game seems really tight and you have to fall into a strategy sooner than later other you might just have nothing at the end, More plays are needed with this one which will likely come as a solo.  

Edit: There are a lot of options for scoring so I can't stress enough that focusing on a strategy early is needed as there are only 8 rounds.  It really has this puzzle feel where you have to decide how much pure resource management and resource stock you need to do or maybe take a different route and concentrate on efficient tile placement thus maximizing you points in that way.  Really like this one and after a round of solo, it has really opened my eyes to the vast amount widely variable strategies possible.  Just a great interesting unique game.

My favorite new game played at EuroQuest.
You have a farm, workers and areas that produce different resources.
Each turn there are 4 seasons and you send you farmer to town to do one action. Sell or buy goods, buy farm improvements or hire more workers.
After you do so, you have to pay upkeep on your workers in the form of food and firewood or ask for help form the neighbors. Help can cost VP's at the end of the game if not returned in resources.
You also expand your farm with tiles each turn, giving you the opportunity through clever placement to increase the amount of resources each worker generates.

It's a little Agricola, a little Carcassonne and a lot of fun.

First solo play was fun but marred by major misruling on the Autumn section.  Only one action per Autumn!?  Now I see how WG has got its reputation as a real ball buster.

Update:  Played a few more times since and enjoying the solitaire experience.  The tile draw brings a certain degree of reply value and it has the benefit of being able to set up, play and tear down within 45 minutes (max).

A cross of Carcassonne and worker placement. Some say this is similar to Agricola, but I don't see that. The first two moves need to be planned carefully if you want to avoid unnecessary early penalties. The Carcassonne part is fairly challenging but fits the theme nicely. Plays quickly and has variance in the fact that the years are in random order in the game.

RATING: 6
Plays fast and is easy to teach, yet it's got some good thinking choices and evaluation. The eight years fly by once you know how to play and experienced players will start to look for more fenced off areas, more ways to squeeze an extra point here and there. Games tend to be close affairs with everyone in the running until the final points are tallied.

There is almost zero player interaction here... well, except for all the blocking and taking building or improvement tiles before your opponent. Okay, it can get a bit crowded in a four player game. Indeed the player starting fourth in a four player game seems to have it a bit hard on the first turn - compensation in the form of a good of their choice might be in order.

It really comes down to making more out of the eight years than your opponents and there are multiple ways to do it.

Games vary mainly through the season tiles appearing in a different order game to game, players subsequently doing different things at different points in the game and not all improvement tiles coming out in any one game. That said, each outing will feel quite similar to the last. For such a short game I don't mind any of that in the slightest.

A good light weight (think half a step up from Carcassonne), gateway game. Enjoyable without being brain burning. The kids (as young as five), found it more enjoyable than they though it would be at first glance - they're also disturbingly quite good at it.

Update: I'm impressed after multiple plays how many different ways there are to approach this. It's very balanced. Going for workers, coins, bonus tiles - all seem viable strategies. Don't whinge about the coin draw if you're fishing in the final couple of turns - yes, it'll be a luck fest whether you pick a 0, 1 or 2. Even my eight year old knows that to ensure you pick the good coins you need to go after them early. Back it up with a coin improvement tile and it's looking good, but still no guarantee of a win.

First play: Dec 22, 2011 w/ Snowden, Ray, John.
Cute little game. At first I feared that not enough stuff would get done in 8 turns, but by the end of the game that didn't bother me at all. What DID kinda bother me was the fact that in the last turn, Snowden, Ray and I each did the same action - sell 3 cubes for 4 coins - and each of us got a different number of points from it:
Ray: 3
Snowden: 5
Seth: 7

I ended up winning by 2 points over Ray. Is that fair?

What would be pretty cool, I think, is if the first coin you got when selling was copper, then next 2 were silver, and the 4th one was Gold. So you always score 0-1/1-2/2-4 points for selling 1/2/3 cubes, and it's not random at all, it depends on whether you collect the correct cubes.

I'd play again, and I wouldn't mind trying the variant mentioned above, but I don't see it being a new favorite.

Update: after thinking about it more I like this gMe more and more. I finally played it again, 3 times in 2 days. We used my variant rule listed above, and everyone agreed it was better that way.

Only a few plays so far but with having Agricola and Stone Age on the shelf I don't see this getting on the table too much. A light version of worker-placement but don't particularly like the tile draw which can pigeon-hole your strategy for the entire game. Probably a better 2 player game than a 3-4 player but I will try it again however this might become E-Bay fodder.

RATING: 5
Solid tile-laying and worker placement game. Luck is quite important, as the tile draw is decisive. Also, drawing the valuable coins helps a lot. Somewhat lacking in depth - but maybe I just am not satisfied by how much it not feels like building a farm. Also, its not as short as it claims to be. 30 minutes is unlikely to happen.
In a way it reminds me of Glen More, but I like Glem More a bit better.

Played 2P with PA at CPG.

BGG calls it a light mashup between Carcassonne and Agricola.  I can easily see that.  I liked the way the game moved - I liked the worker placement aspect and how you need to build your fields up to go work in.  It felt quick and maybe that's because it was only a 2P game, but BGG has it as a 45 minute game.  The time flew by.  Very easy to learn and a lot of fun.

This is a game with great potential but I think it needs a better rule set. The mechanisms are interesting, but the game fails in the amount of resources needed to feed and heat your workers -- with insufficient ability and time to build a resource engine to allow you to get on with the activities that will garner you victory points. Limiting the number of huts and barns is also a design flaw.

Much, much better than the simple rules might suggest. It really all comes together in a nice package; there's tile placement to create your farming areas and then a cool rondel worker-placement portion of the game to really make you think over your decisions. You're managing resources all the time, and the challenge to keep your people taken care of and avoid much neighborly help just makes it that much better. Also, it plays in a pretty short timeframe, so you get all that gaming goodness packed into an hour or so.

The individual player boards were an early warning that Walnut Grove wasn't my kind of game, yet I tried it anyway, thinking that a game advertised as 30-60 minutes couldn't be too painful.  It wasn't.  It condenses the experience of playing a large number of euros into a short playing time.  As a hodgepodge of other, better games, the theme makes less sense the more you think about it.  

Billed as a combination of Agricola and Carcassonne, the game combines tile laying with an optimization engine driven by the need to feed your workers.  On paper, it bears a resemblance to those games.  In practice, tile laying is a solitaire optimization exercise, and interaction is of the "oh, I was going to go there, so I guess I'll go here instead" variety.   Decisions aren't that difficult because the snowball engine gets moving quickly.  The best thing about Walnut Grove is that it's not bad and it's as short as advertised. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is like the perfect candidate for lower-end middle-weight game.  It certainly isn't something I'd call lightweight like Love Letter or No Thanks! but it's hard to call middle weight either compared to the other games I'd put in that category.  But that kind of makes it the perfect game for spinning up with people who have never played it before but want to play a 30-45 minute game without having to wrestle with complicated rules.

The game takes a lot of little game mechanics and integrates them quite well.  Each game is 8 rounds, or years, made up of 4 seasons each and each season is kind of played like a little mini game but each of those mini games contributes to the whole of what you are trying to accomplish.  There is also a disk for each year that slightly variates what you need to do during each season.

In the first season (spring) you draw and keep a certain number of tiles from a bag.  Each tile shows a different landscape type and fences, you are trying to connect like landscape types and fences for better production and points, kind of like a mini Carcassonne.

The summer season is worker placement and production, you send your available workers to different landscapes in your land area and produce based on how many tiles that landscape spans but you have to be careful because you have limited storage space.

Then during the fall there is a central board/rondel where players move to a specific building and take the action for that building.  These can be anything from collecting extra resources to workers to selling resources for points or buying special scoring tiles.

Finally, the winter is the feeding and cleanup phase.  Each of your workers needs to eat and be heated using specific resources that hopefully you acquired in the previous 3 seasons.

Like I said, each a somewhat self-contained and different mini game that affects what you do as a whole.  It's pretty easy to teach, plays at a really good clip, and is very well balanced and designed to integrate all the parts smoothly.  If I had one complaint it is that it might play a little too smoothly.  By that I mean it's hard to completely screw up or do exceptionally well either and that makes for players who progress at about the same pace and with so few points to pass around a lot of scores are going to be very tight and you might end with many tied games.  My first play of this the scores were 22/23/24.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Walnut Grove it's one of those games that are essentially a family game but for gamers. I don't believe in this game for families that are not used to play games in part because the scoring mechanism is clumsy and difused and also because part of the decisions players take are based in expenses and stuff that MUST be done.
About the gameplay there's really nothing interesting or fun to me. The game works and it has good ideas too, I can agree with that, but it's boring and unintersting to play. It lacks theme and joy. I would rather want a game with no real expenses control and only positive and growing feeling.

First play thought ok to good, second play dislike the game

Solitaire formulaic efficiency game. It is quick, but only the autumn action is interactive. Also 8 years are all going to be seen means you are just trying to get timing right.

Absolutely no connection between mechanics and theme - and the hook line that got me interested 'Agricola meets carc' is a million miles wide of the mark - it's nothing like either

plus points are that its quick, three of the seasons can be spent in solitaire contemplation and the minimalist game play is not my cup of tea.

Now Eclipse looks frigging brilliant...

This is a great mix between Carc and Agricola that turns into a sort of puzzle game.  It's really multi-player solitaire with some interaction on the central board, but it's definitely a "do your own thing" kind of game.

Great bits, interesting gameplay, and the right amount of time.  If you're looking for Agricola Express then this is the game you want.

********EDIT***********

After my second game, I'm liking this one more and more.  It's challenging.  The requirements on feeding and heating your dudes is really tough.  It seems like the farmer pieces may be straight up better than the laborers but I'm not sure.

******EDIT***************

Upped this to a 9.  This is a masterful little game.  It's light but there are lots of decisions to be made.  the tile placement aspect is far more important than is first important.  This is a great blend of mechanisms that plays awesome for 2 in 40 minutes.  Good, good stuff.

Described as Agricola meets Carcassonne which I can see, but it seems a little unfair on WG.

Place 1 or 2 tiles, put workers into the fields to collect resources, including a bonus resource, move on the rondel to take an extra action of some sort and then feed and heat your workers. That'd be the outline of the entire game, but it works!

It plays quickly, there are enough decisions to be interesting while light enough to be accessible. You feel like each decision makes a difference to what you do and your final score.

In all, a good, fast little tile laying/ resource collection/ shared rondel game.

Walnut Grove is sort of a strange cross between a worker placement game and a tile laying game.  Although the choices presented in the game are interesting, it had an overall "been done before" feel.  The "draws" (tile and coin) are very random as well, ranging from useless to exceedingly helpful, so that gives a bit of a helpless feeling.  So not bad at all, but not great at any one thing either.

Only one solo play on this game so far, but I bought it for the group and solo possibilities.  It was just not interesting at all.  I'll give it another try or two though, but I could see this as the first game that I sell (haven't been into games terribly long).  I felt like I didn't get anything accomplished in it, thought it was crazy that you don't even get through "town" once, that four coins could fill up a barn, that some coins are worth "0" is silly, and wasn't happy that originally coins didn't even come in the box (had to contact publisher).

Solid worker placement game that fits between Agricola and Stone Age in complexity.  One of the nice aspects of the game is very little downtime between players because a lot of things can be done simultaneously to keep the game moving.  Simple, smooth, quick, and fun.  We plan on playing this a lot.  The only downer I see is that it maxes at 4 players, and I like 5 player games.  This is out of print now.  If you like worker placement family games, pick this up if you can still find it.  I'm really glad I got my copy while still available.  This is an underrated game.

Pretty darn cool game. Things going on here that are subtle and could be easily overlooked in a quick game or two and you might brush this game off. I put it in the Stone Age or Finca level of gaming which in my book is a good thing. Still if you hate those games this might not be for you.

UPDATE: Well this game almost made it to dime status for me and probably will. I will play this one from time to time when I want a quick game for 2 players as it's a great 2 player game. Still it is very samey from game to game and almost feels like you are thrown to a "luck of the draw" on who wins. Every game is within a point or two and if I draw a gold or two (worth 3 points) and you draw only coppers (worth 0 points) then guess who wins? Lowering rating to reflect these feelings.

An enjoyable gateway game with enough challenge to keep us engaged. The randomness of the round disks is great. My gaming partner was initially disappointed that you only got one worker-placement per round but eventually enjoyed the idea.

The production quality and illustrations were fantastic.

Quick western themed Euro.  Did I mention quick?  There is a lot going on here packed into a very fast game.

Very nice. I'd compare to Agricola (some WP drafting, player boards with spatial aspect, same artist, feeding people) and In the Year of the Dragon (can't do much of what you want and the game itself has frequent demands of you). I bought it for the latter comparison and wasn't disappointed. Walnut Grove asks you to pay coins to move around the drafting board, feed picky workers three types of food, and keep them warm with firewood.

To contrast it with ITYOTD: More randomness (setup and during game) and you don't have as much advance notice of what the game will require when. Less interaction because the drafting (which is the only source of interaction) is less constrained and not as large a part of what feeds your personal economic engine. (There are also no majority-style competitions such as with ITYOTD's fireworks or military.) WG is probably less slick/smooth-playing due to moving a lot of cubes around and drawing tiles from bags. But the design strikes me as more polished. (While I think I prefer ITYOTD overall, my first impression of it was that it seemed half-baked. Not so with Walnut Grove.)

Described briefly: You draw a few terrain tiles and pick one to add to your board. These determine how much of what good you can produce, and how many can be stored. Next you put your workers on your tiles to produce five goods (three types of food, firewood, and stone, which is useful mainly for building VP tiles). Then you move a pawn around town, to do such things as: get cubes you may be lacking, convert cubes into coins (necessary periodically to move around town), buy VP buildings or storage space for more goods or workers, recruit new workers. Then you feed your workers (cubes matching their color) and heat them; the amount of food and wood you need is mostly predictable but varies randomly each game year. When you can't pay a cost, you start accumulating tiles that score negative at game end.

Rulebook is very short but leaves some questions unanswered without the BGG forum.

...Upping to an 8 due to how smoothly this plays.

Curiously I find myself taking issue with my entire comparison to ITYOTD. It may be more random than ITYOTD, but 1. setup randomness doesn't really count, 2. there are only eight event tiles, that you could actually memorize, to plan ahead, and 3. there is nothing like the sudden screwage that happens in ITYOTD when the actions are randomly grouped.

Not really seeing "less interactive" or "less smooth" either.

...eh, back down a notch. Starting to feel like the game is shallow and lacking important decisions. And the scoring is coarse and tie-prone. Also finding that it isn't that hard to ensure you can pay what you need.

Solo play highly recommended. Playing time is about 30 min when you are familiar with the rules. Multiplayer needs more time and effort, but the theme is present and playing is fun! Welcome to Walnut Grove and feel the lack of resources!

Despite the description on BGG, I felt this game had nothing to do with Carcassonne, except that you draw tiles out of a bag. I does feel a bit like Agricola (limited actions, the need to feed your workers in winter), coupled with a rondel mechanism. I like the fact that the number of turns is limited to eight, making for a pleasant playing time with four. Also, when moving around the rondel, you will need to be aware of the consequences that it has for turn order next turn. The tile drawing introduces a random factor, but it fits the game fine. An interesting, albeit not very original, worker placement game.

Welcome to Walnut Grove is an odd combination of Carccassone, Loyang combined with lots of cube pushing. It is also quite a solitaire effort in building your own tableau. There is interaction in the form of carrying out town actions, but it is more like action selection with limited slots coupled in a rondel mechanism.
Overall, the game isn't terrible and there are a few interesting choices to make. I found tile laying the most fun aspect of the game. You only get 8 rounds and 9 tiles to expand your region. So, each piece needs to count. The rest of the phases are quite automatic and occurs simultaneously. More so than the solitaire aspect, I found the cube pushing to be annoying. I understand many games come to a point where you buy goods to sell goods as part of a central mechanism, but in Walnut Grove, every year, you need rinse and repeat. So you get goods and in subsequent phases, you ditch them to pay for room and board.  So, lots of constant cube movement. Not quite sure about the longeivity of this game. I am fine playing this moving forward, but likely will put this back on the market.

Don't have much to say other than "meh."  Plays quick, I'll give it that.  It makes whatever complaints I had about Lords of Waterdeep look close to meaningless.  Just not enough player interaction here.  Would still play again, I suppose, but not enthusiastically.  This just feels dry to me and very detached from its theme.

Very fun, mostly multiplayer solitaire that mostly comes down to worker and resource management. Thematic implications are a bit weird, as one would expect from a farming Euro. I just tell people the blue workers are Scandinavian and only accept payment in fish.

Provisional rating, one play with 4.  Didn't really enjoy it, though part of that was my feeling of being screwed early in the game (that feeling proven inaccurate by the final scores 24/24/24/23: I came 3rd on the tiebreak, but I realised afterwards I could have drawn 2 more coins on my final turn so a win had been perfectly feasible).  However I find most worker-placement games frustrating and this was more frustrating than most.

Takes two games I don't much care for, Agricola and Carcassone, and makes a decent game out of them. Fans of those two games are likely to love this quick Euro.

Fairly oppressive worker placement / tile laying game. You add new tiles to your farm which makes fields/water/animals more productive. However, there are seasonal requirements, and winter in particular can be fairly harsh. You have to feed each worker, and provide wood for heating. Each winter has things like "blue workers require double food" and "normal heating +2", which is why it felt oppressive. Some of my turns were simply to put out workers who only earned enough food to eat and wood to heat themselves, thus there was no progressing those turns.

A lighter game that is more of a resource management game than the tile laying/worker placement game I was expecting.  The tension in the game is balancing the cubes you can produce against the cost of producing them.  Easy to explain - good gateway game with a bit of meat on it.

Pioneering in the old American west.  Go around the common town to get upgrades and supplies or hire workers to develop our homestead. Pass townhall and pay $1 in taxes.  The coolest thing is the puzzle of placing ranch tiles and expanding outwards from your personal homestead boards.  Worker placement and tiles.  Random drawn season wheel shows turn order and effects for the year. Gotta feed and house your workers by winter.  Very appropriate comparison of Agricola meets Carcassonne. Very satisfying game play.

このゲームの価値はシンプルさにある。
プレイヤー間の駆け引きは秋のみだが、各ラウンドのたった1回の駆け引きである秋の、自分の行くべき建物にいたる蓄積が実は重要。
最初のタイルや労働者の配置から、いかに完成形を想定し、最終形に至るのか。
地道に農場を広げ、必要な産物をため、建物を建てる計画は、慎重に進めなければならない。

運の要素が強いが、運のアウトプットに対して的確に対処して計画を進めたり、変更できる人が順当に勝つ点ではスキルのゲーム。

ごちゃごちゃしたゲームに勝る。

this is a quick-playing mash-up of Carcasonne with Agricola.  As it is pretty simple, and very quick (30-45 minutes for two players), and good looking, I like it.  Not sure if it would stand up to lasting 2 or more hours, so i will hold out opinions for the greater number of players.

5.5 after 1 play

The game feels overly tight during the initial stages and overly loose during the late stages. With the exception of the Autumn phase, the other seasonal phases are very solitaire in nature and player interaction non-existent. The tile draws during the Spring phase can also be frustrating if one doesn't get any of the land types needed, particularly for feeding and/or heating. Artwork is ok and game component quality is good.

I'm a bit sad to see this leave the collection as it provides a decently thinky  experience in a short space of time. There's some nice tension there too in figuring out how to feed your workers and keep them sheltered, without it feeling overbearing. But my wife doesn't find this interesting enough so it won't get played and has to go.

This is a very cool, strange game that moves at a fast clip.  There's a twinge of disaster management as you think laterally to figure out how to work with the constant stream of table scraps, and maneuver yourself to what you critically need — or some alternate approach to solving your problem.  Three cheers for simultaneous play!

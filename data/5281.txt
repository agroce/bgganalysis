RATING: 6.5
I have raised Octiles from a 5 to a 6.5 after repeated playings.  This is still a rather lite connection game, but it has enough strategy to keep it interesting.

RATING: 7
A very interesting abstract that is mildly reminiscent of [GAMEID=16992] (mostly for the tiles and movement -- not the gameplay).  Necessarily a good amount of player interaction.  Kind of interesting in that the available choices/paths leading to completion diminish as the target spaces are filled.  I like this one and might have to pick up a copy at some point.

This is nice cross between an abstract and a connection game.  It plays out in a fashion that is very much akin to Chinese Checkers.  It can have a real puzzle feel to it.  The beginning of the game and mid sections are the best.  The end has feel much like finishing the board in backgammon.  You want it to be done, but it still takes time to go through the motions - even if you already know the most likely outcome.

Some of the flavor of 1830 and Metro but also has some Chinese Checker feel to it. Lots of fun and easy to pick up. Takes longer to play as contrasted with other games put out by PIN.

RATING: 5
Abstract game. You put a tile with paths painted, move one pawn over the tile you put and give the tile it was before in that possition to the next player. The first to get the other side with all the pawns of his color wins. Maybe Tsuro is inspired in this one.

*update*

After my last play with my parents in wich I almost die of bore, I start to think it's a kids game more than an abstract. So I made a little ratign downgrade.

Essentially Chinese Checkers with some twists thrown in.  The changing paths might make you think you can use some devious forethought and strategy against your opponents, but you'll rarely get to do more than just find a way to move your piece one step closer to the goal.  Only complaint: my big hands keep knocking pieces off their pedestals by accident, since there are no spaces between anything on the board.

Lovely wooden board and pieces.  This genre of games (including, for example, Metro and Tom Tube) is one that I always *think* I'm going to love, but I'm almost always disappointed.  This one is fairly typical for the genre in that I played it once, liked it but didn't love it, and then could never again find an opponent. (Traded away.)

RATING: 7
Fun, though with four players / four pawns each, it feels kind of like a logjam, and the movement options become more "what's available" than "what's best". But when it's not so jammed (earlier in the game, later in the game, and/or with fewer players / pawns), it's a neat path-manipulation game.

RATING: 2
Components: Heavy, wooden tiles with clearly-marked paths, on a thick wooden board. Looks very attractive, and it's fun to swap out the tiles and trace paths.

Could be improved if there were depressions in which the tiles could sit; they tend to slide around a bit. It's also difficult to swap out tiles, especially without disrupting other tiles or the runners.

Experience: With two players, I once thought this was a fun, puzzle-type game of building an efficient network.

With three players, the game is broken. The center of the board gets clogged up with pieces, and we end up being forced to move our pieces to any available space, often backward. There are too many pieces (the rules recommend the full 5 pieces for three players; our board was already jammed up when we each had only 4 pieces in the mix) for too small a space. Seems like a tragedy of the commons: if everyone moves their pieces at once, it jams up; but if one person doesn't, and others do, the one person is at a disadvantage.

Also, it's way too chaotic. I don't know how I thought this was a game of building up efficient networks. Too much can change with the swapping of a single tile, let alone two. There is no planning ahead. And, with three players, no fun. I'll be junking my copy.

I am not into Abstract Strategy game. It's not my favorite mechanic/theme. I find it to be not to my liking compared to other game mechanics. There are better Abstract Strategy games out there than Octiles. Yinsh is a whole lot more to my liking than Octiles for example.

I wouldn't say no to trying other Abstract Strategy games.

It wasn't really interesting for a 2 player abstract.  Wasn't fun either. It's not my kind of game. It didn`t really impress me. 3-4 players could be better. Would need to try it.

It's very doubt full that I would replay this game any time soon to see my opinion changes.

It doesn't really hold my interest. There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time. Why would you spend time playing a bad game when you can play a game which is more worth your time and enjoyment?

I think I have an unauthorised copy ... as I had to download the correct rules from the internet....

Anyway, my wife really likes this. It seems to be about arranging long-routes so that you can move your pawns as far as possible each turn.  Quite fun, light, and quick.  We played this out in the sunshine, on the patio, with a bottle of wine and had some nice gentle fun...

Played 1 time. Too random. Out of the many "maze" games such as Tongiaki, Labyrinth, Metro, Streetcar, etc, this is my least favorite. Nice bits, but no theme, a too-random path distribution, too much luck, too much incidental blocking in the 4-player game leading to even more luck. Feels like a mix between Tongiaki and Chinese checkers.

First game of this today (5-26-2012) with Mr. Billington and I won.  Fun game.  Like a mixture between "Chinese Checkers" and "Amazing Labyrinth".  I only wish the playing area were wider or longer.  Played another game today (6-9-2012) and I won - but turns out that we weren't using a correct rule:  You must move across the tile you just laid on the board.  I think it makes it *more* fun, but Mr. Billington found it more challenging.  Played two games today (6-13-2012), lost a 2-player with Mr. Billington and lost a 3-player with him and his daughter Gayle.  Enjoyed the 3-player more, though it took longer to play.  Glad I bought this game from boardgames.ca (#40 cheaper than Amazon's $75 price, and still $20 cheaper including s&h from Canada to Virginia).  Played another 2-player game today (7-8-2012) with Noelle and I won.  But she definitely learned it quickly enough.

Bought this at Kadon's booth at an art festival.  Have also bought several more copies as gifts.  Kadon's wooden tiles are high quality.  The gameplay of trying to build routes to get your pieces across the board while turning or replacing tiles is great.

RATING: 4
With all of the Metro style puzzle games now available this seems like a weak choice. It would be much faster if the player was given the next octagon earlier to plan the move. As it is there is unnecessary downtime due to poor design. A mitigating factor is the simplicity of the rules - I was able to start my first game after a 15 second explanation.

I'm not a big fan of abstracts, but this one matches good production with not-too-heavy gameplay (partial information helps) to produce something I enjoy.

Fun abstract, great replacement from two-player chinese checkers. First couple of rounds a little random. Once all tiles are revealed, it should be possible to prepare 2-3 rounds ahead, but it is very difficult to visualize past one turn. Doesn't compare with the GIPF project, but still a decent addition to a game cabinet.

Very playable considering the mathematical constraints that went into its design. (Here are the pieces; how are we going to make a game out of it?) Rewarding for those who like having to think ahead a bit. Handicapping your opponent by making him/her play a weak tile can be just as important as a strong offensive move, balance is necessary. Nice components, good value. (Pin edition)

The basic game is an ingenious take on Halma: the constantly morphing board is made of 17 out of 18 different octogonal tiles, the remaining tile replacing one of the tiles on the board at every turn. Pieces move along the paths contained in the tiles to the spaces between them in a (mostly) lively race.

Mostly, but not always: a little source of trouble is that there are not many spaces so that there's always a phase in which players can't choose their moves or must even forfeit their turns. It's important to bring some pieces early to the other side of the board in order to avoid these jams - Octiles rewards the player who doesn't just choose the best move but also focuses on the free spaces on the board leaves open paths for later.

Add a more difficult game and some puzzles and we get a rather flexible set that merges a new approach to an old game with unique formal beauty.

RATING: 8
Favorite maze game. I’ve only played the variant in which in order to win, you must position your pieces so that they are all connected by paths. Strategy takes time to learn since every tile has its own “personality” – some tiles are versatile while others can be totally useless, especially during the endgame.

UPDATE: Dropped this game from a 9 to an 8, and it might drop further. This game is much lighter than I realized. In the Team-Up variant, it seems that long-term planning is almost impossible because of the similarity of the variety of tiles available throughout the game (you basically are looking for one kind of "path", but each tile has four paths, which means that you'll usually find what path you'll need most of the time). 

The standard, Chinese Checkers version of Octiles is much more satisfying but much lighter.

Based on 1 3-player game.  A slightly fun puzzle--there's something satisfying about finding a good twisty path.  But Octiles is supposed to be a game, not a puzzle, and it fails in that respect.  No planning is possible and there's a good amount of wait between turns.  For most of the game, you are in your own little world, not caring about the actions of  your opponents.  That is, until the endgame, in which everyone is waiting to get one final person to home plate, and the game drags as people try and prevent the person to their left from reaching the goal, while being similarly stymied by the person to the right, and the winner ends up being whoever randomly manages to get in a position that nobody can stop.  I understand that there are other variants that I should try.

I am glad I was able to pick this up in a trade.  This is a fun game.  The wood construction is nice as well.  It is a tile laying, path finding game like several others.  The objective is essentially like Chinese Checkers.  I think it works best with 2 but plays up to 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The wooden design and production is great, but functionally the pieces themselves are really disappointing and annoying.  Since you have to orient the switch tile on the board every which way to figure out where the pawns can move to.  Things often get knocked off, or the tiles may shift with their paths pointing in a different direction than they started with.

The gameplay is ok for the most part, except in the end when you know exactly what kind of tile your opponent needs to win, it is possible to deny him those types until you are in the position to finish as well.  I am not entirely fond of rules that can put you in a situation where your options are completely dictated by the other players.  Maybe Octiles will get better with 4, but I don't care to try it again with 2.

RATING: 7
Refreshing, fun game of path-following.  If you let them, people can take too long inspecting possible paths, but it's a game that allows you to feel satisfied with a path, without necessarily having to get the best path for your turn.

A perfect party game. Strangers playing together for the first time will know each other quite well by the time this game is over. Update 01/03/16: After two attempts now to play with three players, I'm going to say the minimum player count on this one is four. Recommended by Jon K.

RATING: 8.3
My first game, and still one of my favourites. 
There's no ceiling -- the same cards can be used to imagine and tell infinite stories.
The ultimate "don't play to win, play to have fun" game. 

I play boardgames to interact with people. Dixit offers a warm and special way of doing that.

(Unless you're playing with the people that deliberately use only references which not everyone knows.)

RATING: 9
This really gives the creative side of your brain a heavy workout! The cards are beautifully detailed, intricate, and open to many interpretations. It's incredible when you've had a card in your hand for several turns without any idea of how you could play it, only to see it become a perfect fit for another player's turn. Likewise when you see another player interpret cards in a different way to you. It requires a certain amount of energy or spark, but I'm yet to play this with a group that hasn't enjoyed it. Sometimes it can take a while for the active player to take their turn, and if this occurs frequently we tend to allow other players to step in and take their turn instead, which keeps the game flowing and doesn't affect the game balance.

A non-complex game with surprising possibilities of depth. Deducing someones 'story' and developing your own masterful clues is harder than innocent looking game would like to suggest.

RATING: 6
Card game version of Barbarossa (Klaus Teuber, 1988) where you have a handful of very unusually drawn (art) cards and you take turns being either the storyteller or one of the other players.  The storyteller tries to be neither too vague nor too specific in describing their card, and the other players select a card from their hand that they feel best matches the description given by the storyteller.  Points are awarded to the storyteller if at least one (but not all!) people guess his card, and by the other players if they guess the storyteller's card AND if other people guess their cards instead.  It's most difficult and least lucrative being the storyteller but this role moves around the table each turn.

The game is infinitely expandable and plays very well as a light humorous filler for large groups.  I can see this going over very well with non-gamers.  Needs at least 3 players and can play up to well as many as you like really but I think officially 7.

Own the [boardgame=55660]Quest[/boardgame], [boardgame=138547]Odyssey[/boardgame], [boardgame=121288]Journey[/boardgame], and [boardgame=145325]Origins[/boardgame] expansions.

Nah, more players isn't better.  I think 5 or 6 is about the sweet spot.  The art for 1 and 2 are great.  Odyssey (3) was not so good but Journey (4, blue box) is very good - and it also makes the Odyssey cards not stand out nearly so badly as it did before.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#FF9933][b]aaj's FAVORITE PARTY GAME[/b][/BGCOLOR][/COLOR]
Dixit is right up there with Sushi Go and Century as one of my favorite ways to introduce people to the hobby. Not only that, it's a boatload of fun with people who already know how to play. This subtle clue-based game is always interesting, and always morphs depending on the people you are playing with. 

The game mechanics are very simple to A2A: one player chooses a hint, all players play a card that they think matches that hint, and then players vote on which card the active player laid down. Extremely simple, loads of fun.

Dixit thrives on the surreal artwork and the beautiful tension of clue-giving. Every time you give a clue, you need to evaluate the people playing with you: the kinds of things they know and appreciate, and the kinds of things they won't know at all. Your job is to give a hint that's good enough that some people will get it, but not so obvious that everyone gets it. But your clue can be anything: a word, a phrase, a sound effect, or even a YouTube video!

Dixit is simply the best game in so many categories. With Odyssey, it's my favorite large-group game, and any version is my favorite party game. The subtle clues required to do well and the group interaction this provokes make Dixit a perfect 10 game for me. Oh, [thing=181304][/thing] is fun, and I enjoy both games, but Dixit balances its remarkable depth with an incredible accessibility that Mysterium just doesn't have. Dixit would definitely make my boardgaming hall of fame.

[thing=92828][/thing] [BGCOLOR=#00cc00][b] 10[/b] [/BGCOLOR] - Odyssey is a fantastic addition to Dixit (it should be the base game by default). The 12-player option is incredible and gives a lot of extra flexibility with different game groups. Plus, the artwork is still amazing, like every expansion.

The rules refer to the current player being a "story teller". I have never played this game where anything longer than a phrase or sentence was used to describe the card being referenced. This is a light filler that is nice for a group when there's simply not enough time for anything more in-depth. It's great for non-gamers as well, and serves as a nice ambassador to the hobby.

One of those games you can easily teach to any one and MOST people like it although we have at least one family member who doesn't like it. It's harder than it looks. I always find it fun. As a clue giver, choose a card from a choice of surreal picture cards in your hand and give a clue - not too obvious so everyone guesses, and not so obscure that no one gets it. The other players contribute a card they think will match your clue. Mix up the cards and the other players guess which card was your card. Sometimes even an obvious clue will win out because the other players have cards that match the clue so perfectly. Fun.

Dreamy card game where you have to use your imagination and to describe strange images subtlely enough for some to be able to guess though neither too obvious where everyone is able to see the link.

I love the artwork and scope for creative thinking. Expansions help to add variety - I have Dixit 2, which is equally great, and blends in nicely.

So far, it's been fantastic with 4-6 players (with non-gamers too), and fun using the two player co-op variant from the BGG threads. I didn't enjoy the three player variant so much (from the rulebook) - choosing two cards to match the storyteller's clue was just too difficult and ended up with too many arbitrary cards in every selection.

An enjoyable and beautiful game, exceedingly easy to explain. As all games of this measure, the crowd greatly determines the level of fun. Still, far more imaginative than other games of this ilk.

Dixit is absolutely gorgeous to look at. And here it is not just for eye candy since the whole game lives around the art. I think this is the biggest achievement of the game. and it shows that the designers have been very ambitious. You could have made the very same game with less inspiring art but the result would have landed far from where it is now.  

Mechanically the game does not offer anything extraordinary. Technically the game is very much like Rappakalja. All the magic comes from your own head, and at least for me Dixit succeeds in doing this. But you have to be careful with who you play. I reckon that Dixit will become a very dull experience with someone blessed with the imagination of a depressed cabbage (or it just might be the most hilarious thing ever).

However, the base game has too few cards because you see all of them in every single game. This becomes a bit repetitive after a while and thus you need to invest in an expansion.

Can't see why everyone raves about this. Because you're only using pictures it's hard to add any humour to this party game. The scoring system seems counter-intuitive (you only have to fool one person to score maximum points?) and there are better party games out there of a similar style. Best played with people you know, it's a good party game, but there are better.

This game was a lot of fun.  Played it for the first time last night.  I knew that I would enjoy it - and I was sure my husband would hate it - but he ended up liking it more than he expected!  It helps that we were playing with friends, and that some of the clues were references to movies he really enjoyed.

Now I'm thinking about making a version of this based on Sci-Fi book and pulp magazine covers, since that is more his style.

Anyway, I'd like to own this game, and since my husband doesn't hate it, it has a better chance of being acquired.

This is a neat party game but it's not as fun(ny) as I was hoping it'd be. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game and really "neat", but when I bust out a party game I'm usually with a bunch of non-gamers (or drunk gamers) who are just looking to have fun and measure that amount of fun by how much laughing is happening. There are plenty of other games out there that register higher on that scale. That said, I do like the game, just not for the situation I bought it for...

RATING: 5.5
The art in this game has a very mystical/tarot sort of feel to it which I imagine to be deliberate as the premise is simply for people to take turns creating a story based on one of six cards in their hand and then mixing it with other players cards (that they each selected based on the story the main player told that round) so that all players but the story teller can bet on which card is the story tellers. Points are scored laughs are had and in general I would prefer this to Apples to Apples as far as party games go. My issue with the game is it is limited by the imagination of the players playing, and often breaks down into humorous but shallow play or fractures between literal and metaphysical leanings of the people playing. Dixie is fine for a few hands at a party which is where I'd bring it as a nice ice breaker for casuals but that's about it IMO.

[4-12] Brilliant party game/filler.  The tiny details in strategy relating to creating a phrase that works but not too clear as well as trying to put another card that captures the other players is a lot of fun.

- The entertainment in this game hinges on people being a little "out there" and ridiculous; With our normal group, this was just a little bland.


Why it's previously-owned:
This game is so dependent on playing with other very creative types.  Most of the people in my group who enjoyed playing party-style games ended up not being so creative when push came to shove.
I traded this away for YINSH.  Our favorite party game still remains Time's Up; we'll always pull that out when we have a crowd.

Beautiful art and nice components for a cute party game. Dixit shows how a game can be extremely simple and still fun. It doesn't offer a lot of laughter, which may be a limit for a party game, but it can bring some good puzzles and a nice social experience.

Unfortunately Dixit has dropped a little for me over time. I used to play it a lot and I really liked it, but game after game I realized that my enjoyment depends terribly on the people around the table. It happened often to see round after round of obvious choices, when players were not creative enough and just said something to get over with their turn. My rating therefore goes from 8 to 6.5. I like it, but I want to play it with the right group.

Rating without the expansions: 6.

The mechanics of this game is very simple, what saves time explaining the rules and makes it a good game for party or for the family, the wonderful illustrations play the majority of this game, the rating is based on the illustrations, because the rules are very poor. Good game to play with your kids or with softcore gamers. Recomended for 5 or 6 players, with 3 players the experience is very poor.

Excellent family game.  The basic mechanism behind the game is something I first came across reading a Martin Gardner article long ago about Sid Sackson's Patterns game.  I loved the idea of the mechanism, but not the implementations I came across previously, and this game really presents it very well.

RATING: 5
This is a neat concept and for a party game I prefer it to Balderdash or Charades or other games it has some sort of mechanical link to. 

Once it expanded beyond 6 players with Odyssey it opened up for me again as it is very accessible to children and partygamers. 

Doesn't suffer inattentive players well but can provide a range of emotions like any good narrative.

Although I was introduced to this game first, I would say that this is a combination of Codenames and Wits & Wagers. This just isn't as interesting since not all the photos are related to the clue. I would MUCH rather play Contact if I was looking for that telepathic in-joke feel.
Pro: Everyone is engaged on every turn, similar to Apples to Apples.

Repetitive if the same set is used by the same group.

RATING: 10
A game that enchants and mesmerizes everybody. the cards art is absolutely gorgeous and the mechanism, or the game dynamics, is incredibly involving, you just don't believe it will work when you first hear the rules explanation, then the game starts and you are hooked.I strogly recommend you buy the base game with one or two expansions because during the first few times you play it is likely you will play several times in a row and feel the need for different cards, perhaps this is the only (minor) problem of the game, if you play it with the same group people will start repeating the "definitions".

One player is the storyteller for the turn and looks at the images on the 6 cards in her hand. From one of these, she makes up a sentence and says it out loud (without showing the card to the other players).

Each other player selects the card in their hands which best matches the sentence and gives the selected card to the storyteller, without showing it to the others.

The storyteller shuffles her card with all the received cards. All pictures are shown face up and every player has to bet upon which picture was the storyteller's.

This is such a fun games, especially play with a close group where you know each other for a while!  (because you have some stories between each other to tell).

RATING: 6
Seemed fine. One person I talked with about it commented that, if you're playing it well and making the answer evenly balanced with the other cards, then basically you're making everything a random guess. So winning is basically random.

That's probably true. But if you're playing games to win, you should probably stick to 2-player games and, more importantly, this isn't the sort of game where you play to win. It's more like Cards Against Humanity where the goal is to have a nice social experience. I don't think it does that in a particularly amazing way, but it's reasonable and friendly to all ages/genders, so that's a pretty good selling point.

Such a great game and very unique. Whenever I explain this one to people their faces go a bit blank and they look like they're thinking "I'm not going to enjoy this" but by the third round everyone gets really into it and usually at the end of a game they ask "Can we play again?"

I'd recommend picking up some of the expansions though as playing with the same people after a while you see some of the same clues popping up and it becomes easier.

Okay, a really, really solid party game that's not quite as arbitrary as something like Apples to Apples. Will play differently with every group and will often be a riot, especially if the presenters and all get into it. Great, great game.

The only pratfall is that it can tend to fall into inside jokes / references too easily. In several groups there have been references to TV shows / books / etc. that only a few of the players have watched.

I found Dixit's surreal art delightful and the game's concept original. The player whose turn it is reveals something about one of their cards.  The other players must then choose cards that best reflect that description.  All then vote on what they think the best matches are. In order to maximise their points the storyteller needs their card to be voted for, but not by too many players. Hence, descriptions tend to the oblique.

Although the artwork is lovely and the concept is original, I just don't find the game play terrifically engaging. For that party game slot this would fill, I prefer something dumber and uproarious-er.

Wonderful game. Works especially well with my wife and family who aren't typical game lovers. However, I tend to be very choosey about who I play it with experienced gamer-wise. It can be a real grind to play with a brace of players piggy-backing each other with references to things you haven't heard of. Be especially careful if it's a group of well-established friends whom you don't know well. You're likely to feel very left out of the loop.

By the way, the artwork is bloody glorious.

The card are is beautiful but I found the clue giving to be difficult and sometimes downright frustrating. I was expecting a light pick up and play party game like Apples to Apples with pictures but it ended up being a lot more thinky and quiet. Less fun than I wanted it to be.

This game is fantastic with the right crowd, and awful with the wrong.  For some reason I still have issues wrapping my mind around the scoring and I have no clue how come!  The art on some of the newer sets is far superior to the older storybook style, and often I'm requested to remove some of the other sets.  Despite the fact that I don't like this game as much as other party and social games, it always hits the table and is always well received so it has a permanent home on my self.

Good light party game.  Because of the artwork you feel like your doing something more substantial than just playing a party game.  Doesn't overstay it's welcome.  Maybe not as creative as I had hoped.  Better with more players.  At the moment we are just mainly doing one word clues.  I'd like to play it with a few more crowds.  
Update: Played with eight - others seem to like it a lot more than me and maybe it is more enjoyable and less chaotic with fewer players.

A nice thoughtful game with very pretty and inspiring artwork. Have played on three occasions, in 3,3 and 6 players. I cannot recommend the game in 3, unless you play w modified rules (it's ok+ then). It's great fun in 6, and perfectly suitable for people who are not gamers. A concern of mine is that after a total of only 6 games, I feel that I've really seen all the cards. While there's an almost unlimited amount of ways to describe a card, most attempts tend to tap central ideas/concepts of a particular design. I start recognizing patterns in the way people reason around a particular card. For me, this somewhat detracts from the fun. That is to say, you may want to consider expansions early on, to promote longevity.

If it is your turn, describe one of your cards with a cryptic sentence. Otherwise pick a card matching whatever wierdness the player who's turn it is say. Then vote! If everyone or no one picks the right card, you score none. If some of the other pick the right card you score. And for the other players score for each player voting for your card. Simple and fun.

Balderdash with art. Beautiful art that fills up the entire of each oversized card. It is in a very surrealistic style and the images can mean many different things to different people.

Decent party game with simple rules and interesting, abstract art. 

Creativity is tested, but often goes unrewarded when the other players don't understand where you are coming from. It also runs into the Apples to Apples problem of just not having a good card to associate with the story.

Replayability is also an issue. For a game that is supposed to amaze you with its art, seeing the same artwork over and over even if there's a different "story" associated with it makes the art much less amazing.

In general, party games fall flat because many resort to a popularity contest to determine who gets the points.  Dixit changes this and is likely the first party game to make my list of good game designs.  The artwork is exceptional and works for so many elements.  Teaching the game is very easy, even to non-gamers.  A definite plus is that both gamers and non can play and both find enjoyment.  If you are shy of party games, this one might shift your mind.

Necesita de tener el momento inspirado pero si ocurre y hay feeling pueden salir partidas de lo más divertidas... yo ultimemente juego mucho con el personaje de Roco Sigfredy... procuro meterle una o dos veces durante la partida...Realmente recomendable. Tiene el defecto de su poca rejugabilidad en una misma sesión... y de que no se puede forzar a la gente a jugarlo poruqe entonces no sale nada bueno. Para no ser de mi estilo de juegos, le reconozco bien hecho.

Dixit is a fantastic game when playing with a large group of players.  With too few the scoring mechanism feels a little broken.  The fact that it is a party game means that scoring is less important, but still.  I prefer this with a full compliment of players.

The game is actually a bit similar to "apples to apples". Players receive a hand of cards (wonderfully illustrated) and try to form phrases based on the illustrations.  You can't be too obvious or too obscure.  It's engaging, challenging and very fun.

Abstract fun.  The group you play with makes a big difference in this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
If I rated after 2 plays it would be much higher. But after several plays some flaws started showing- it can feel repetitive when you get the same old cards and your brain keeps thinking of clues you've already given/heard for that card. Also, there's a weird dynamic between playing the game for fun and playing to win. The game is most fun when you give strange and interesting clues. But if you want to win the best type of clue to give is one that is a specific inside reference that only one other player will recognize. 

Still, this is a fun game, and it's one that has always been a big hit with many different audiences of non-gamers. Definitely a worthwhile game to get.

Ha van egy pár a játékosok közt, akik jobban ismerik egymást, mint a többiek, akkor ők mindig tudnak olyat feladni, amin csak ők nyernek pontot (egymásét mindig kitalálják, másnak gőze sincs)... Ez minusz pont:)

Such a great idea and great cards,with such a poor mechanic.The storyteller can simply frown and put his card down.Chances are that he'll get at least one vote and 3 points.
My Variant:Storyteller has TWO cards he must describe as a story.If all votes fall on those 2 cards,he loses.If any of the 2 cards doesn't get at least 1 vote,he loses.This way he can't just simply say a random thing.

This is a great game.  I love it.  You need creative people and you need to get the expansion.  I hope they release another expansion to keep adding variety to this one.

This game depends on who you are playing with in how it rates.  I got it to play with the in-laws, and it works well a group game.  Still, it is not one I would want to play all the time.  Even owning a couple of the expansions, this game gets kind of stale for me.  FAR FAR FAR better than A2A though.

Sometimes (well, not too often) you want a different, lighter gaming experience. No, I am not the guy who feels these needs... So I tried the game thinking it is absolutely not my cup of tea. And I found a surprisingly enjoyable game, appealing to gamers and non-gamers as well!
This is in great part due to the wonderful art in the (oversized) cards. But, you know, the cards ARE part of the game...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Just easy chilled game that kids, grandma's and whoever can get into. I normally pull this one out at the end of an evening if people still want to play but dont want to shout and scream.

It's kind of like the after dinner mint of board gaming, that's not to say its not exciting and fun though.

It's not the sort of game I would like let alone love but it has kept hitting the table time and time again over the years so it has grown from a 7 to a 9

RATING: 8.1
My go-to game for non-gamers. Seconds to teach, plays well with virtually any group. I've successfully played with our parents in their late 60s, and my 10yo niece. 

Only downsides - slightly confusing (though very pretty) scoring track (the one in Odyssey is better), and the fact that you'll immediately want all the extra expansion cards (just because they're awesome!).

Now this is really a game in which you shouldn't care if you win or lose. This is all about fun and some interesting brain exercises. 

It's very important to keep the game fair and not describing a card in a way you know that only one person by the table will guess.

After 6-7 games I was full and it became harder and harder to make descriptions you didn't make before. I need Dixit 2 to still have fun playing this.

RATING: 7
Apples to Apples with pictures? Well, yes, but I think Dixit allows for greater creativity and a richer experience. Great family/party game, though it can be a little "thinky" with certain players, so it may not be the best choice if you're looking for a raucous party game. There will be laughter and subdued excitement, however, and so it's very versatile; great for couples parties or even for an afternoon with family. With a single set, you'll see the same cards a lot, but they all have different aspects you can focus on, and sometimes considering previous experiences with cards can become part of the strategy. First impressions will sometimes cause people to balk when having to give the clue, but encourage them to hang in there as most people will quickly get the hang of it after a single game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Initial Impression: This party game has an interesting and innovative concept. The artwork is beautiful and provocative and really encourages player interaction. The downside I can see is repeated plays with the same group will become stale quickly. How many different words/phrases/ideas are invoked when you see the same image multiple times?

Base game came with amazing pictures and had good synergy with each other. The addition of Dixit 2 and Odyssey made the pictures feel a little diluted. Still a great party game though and can be played up to 12 or more (in teams)!

RATING: 8
This takes the right group and the right mindset.  But when you have it, it just works.  It is simple to the level of a party game but has a whimsy and pace that isn't typical in a party game.  Excellent for more thoughtful, quiet party-style groups (not necessarily smarter!  But groups that get together and are happy diving into surreal art and getting into other people's minds through a more emphatic than logical way).  I have seen it flop a bit as well, but I personally love it.

Beautiful game! Can't state this enough! Dixit is definitely an essential game for any collection. I often use this at parties where both casual and hardcore gamers are in attendance, brings both together well without giving too much advantage to either side. The base game I have allows for storage of up to 4 expansion. Great forward thinking. And the ability to use these cards with Mysterium gives so much versatility to this game.

This game depends completely on the imagination of all the players, but it only works if everyone thinks more or less the same way. If you have any kind of active imagination, you will never score points because you don't think the way you're supposed to think. Perhaps it's fun as a drinking game or an introductory game for non-gamers?

UPDATE: 8/26/13: I didn't think it was possible to play this game without having a ton of fun, but play with the wrong people and it can happen.  I still love this game, but it is obviously not universally fun.  Why do I hate Apples to Apples? Because the outcome is always nothing more than a last second judgement call and usually as an attempt to make a lame joke.  Dixit doesn't have that flaw. The scoring is well defined and not subject to judgement. Also, the best strategy I have found has nothing to do with how well you know the people you are playing with. One of these "wrong" people tried to play Dixit like Apples to Apples and failed miserably. He tried to zero in on me by picking hints he thought only I would understand.  Of course, Dixit can break a bit if people chose not to put down a card that resembles the hint, but you get more points by guessing it right and fooling others into picking your card.

NEW!
I took this game to a board game night party with some friends.  This was only the second time I played the game and it is every bit as wonderful as the first playthrough.  My first expansion also came today and the cards are just as amazing and weird as those that come with the base game.  Excellent game.  Easy to understand.  Easy to explain.  And the most important part is that anyone who has played it with me so far has loved it.

OLD
I have never played a more fun party game than Dixit.  With the right group of people, this game is a laugh out loud good time.  The rules and process are simple and easy to explain to new players.  It takes some thought to manage any strategy, but it is hands down far better than that piece of crap Apples to Apples that ruined party games for me.  The cards are all so strange and interesting that I would get excited every time I had to draw a new one and I would have a hard time waiting for my turn to be the active player because I have such a good or funny idea for a hint. The art work is top notch.  I want all of the expansions for this.

Bought as a gift for my daughter (so not listed as owned by me) but mentioned here because the inside of the lid was personally illustrated (beautifully) and signed with a message by the artist Marie Cardouat. 

Plays very like the dictionary game where one person selects a card and creates some vague prose to summarise the card, the others pick a card from their hand that is best summed up by the words. Very simple but incredibly engaging.

Very much an after dinner game. Huge replayability value.

Fun party game that makes Apples to Apples completely obsolete. The artwork is fantastic, eye-catching, thought provoking and inspires creativity in a way Apples to Apples just didn't. It allows for some strategy, as you want to deliver a message about your image that some will be able to decipher, but that is not be so obvious that everyone figures it out. Finding a phrase, sound, or song lyric that finds this middle ground between vague and blunt is  the core of what makes the game enjoyable. Plus, hey, bunny shaped player pieces.

I don't want to know where the artist gets his ideas for the pictures.  I don't even want to know what kind of mushrooms he eats before he gets those ideas.

What I want to know is what the animal eats before it takes the dump that those mushrooms grow on, because THAT is what the FDA needs to be most deeply concerned about.

despite its funny sounding name, this game is actually serious business. Dick-zit challenges players to be creative. As you can tell from my reviews, that's a serious problem for me. basically you have to sum up a variety of images in a single pithy word or sound. I can describe most of them in 4 words. 'the fuck is that'

small children will definitely enjoy saying 'dick-zit'. in fact i enjoyed saying that too. my doctor says i have the mind of a child, so i guess he's right. maybe that's why he's a doctor. Small children will also enjoy the fanciful artwork on the cards, inspiring their fertile little minds.

The superb illustrations this game revolves around lift it up to a level where partygames normally do not reside. The illustrations have so much detail and mystery in them that they can provide a lot of inspiration to the players. Even people who are not that creative can play and enjoy this game. I have a worry however that the cards provided are not enough to ensure enough replayability. But that's something only the future will tell.

"Simple" is the first word I think of when I approach this game.  It is just so basic in the mechanism that it gives me that "why didn't someone think of this before" feel.  Of course, this HAS been thought of before in some fashion (particularly Thingamajig.)  But what makes this game so accessible to new players is the awesome artwork.  There is so much you can do as a story-teller with these pictures.  I should note, though, that it seems playing regularly with the same group might cause the game to quickly grow stale.  Since you see every card in the game, you really lose some of that replayability that I would prefer in a party game like this.

Initially I thought I wasn't going to like this game at all.  It seemed too easy to score points, dragged on a little long for what it is, and resulted in unsurprising close scores.  However that was a 4-player game.  Now that I've played with 6 I can say that this is almost the default number of players.  With the added players you have more options and the scoring becomes less of a sure thing.  I'm still not sure if this is a premiere party game, but it is enjoyable for occasional play.

Although I'm not big into the "social" games, this has been a big hit with my group and family. The game is group dependent, but with the right mixture of players the game really shines. It is also great for non-gamers.

Dixit is a party game where players get cards with beautiful(?) art and then one player selects a phrase or sings a song or whatever to describe the card they are playing. The rest of the players then place a card down that they think will match up. Players then see the cards, vote on which one they think was the original storyteller's card and points are scored. However, if everyone or no one selects the storyteller card, the storyteller gets 0 points. So you want to be not so obscure in your hints that everyone guesses your card, but not so vague that no one guesses your card. Plays fairly fast, and the scoring is pretty simple.

Top-notch design, extremely accessible for all ages.

A very good 'ice-breaker' game for groups of new acquaintances. Definitely a good choice for parties much like Jungle Speed!

Can't say enough about the art, very playful and imaginative, makes players almost feel like they are playing through a dream. Illustrations are most certainly a cut above much of the recent market.

The gameplay is so unique compared to most every other game on the market.  It taps into the creative and expressive side of your brain as opposed to the analytical, strategic side.  That is not to say the game is devoid of strategy.  But between the magnificent artwork (my wife to like to hang some of the cards on our walls) and the abstract thought required to play well, typical gamer strategy doesn't enter in to the equation much at all.

This game is fantastic for groups of casual or non-gamers as well, which is always a consideration I have when buying games.

Great for the first several plays, but eventually there's too much meta game going on (such as referring to clues from prior sessions).  Also, the cards get stale pretty quickly, and new players always have a "tell" when they stop to examine cards they haven't seen yet.  Still, it's great fun with kids.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Beautiful art, but the problem is the game just doesn't come together for me. The balance between giving a good clue yet not too good, is simply too hard to do. Meaning you usually end up giving it away or being way too vague as the storyteller. 

Equally, as the guesser, you have no bloody clue if they have been too vague and it is too easy if they have been too obvious.

It's great that you can explain it in a minute though and be played with non-gamers without a problem, that is it's real strength.

Dixit is one of those games you can’t dislike, since it’s as easy to grasp as fun to play: moreover, it’s a great gateway game as it doesn’t feel like a boardgame at all, which on the other hand might scare off casual or non-gamers. (October 2011)

Probably the best party game in existence. Fast, simple, fun, impossibly easy to teach, but with as much depth as the players want. Beautiful in concept and execution.

Don't play it more than about twice in one sitting though - players get used to each other and the cards, and you'll drain their excitement for future plays.

// Dixit is a fun game to play with our family once in a 
while. It's not something we can play with only two, which
is how we play most of our games. This isn't really a 
favorite - for something similar (trying to clue people in
on abstract meanings), Codenames does the job a lot better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great family game. Plays quickly.
Accessible to a wide range of people, from 10 year olds to 99 year olds.

Similar to Apples to Apples, but visual, rather than using cards with definitions.

An expansion would be very helpful since with just 80+ cards you get familiar with the deck.  With more cards there would be greater variation.

Onw caveat - players need to agree not to use "stories" based on a movie/TV show/event that not all players are familiar with, else they are at a disadvantage.

Combines elements of Apples to Apples, Barbarossa, Cluzzle and Attribut.  It is mostly a parlor game that you play for socializing.  Success in the game depends upon whether you are lucky enough to have a card in your hand that resembles the clue given by the "current" player (which is often weird or an inside joke since he doesn't want everyone to guess the card that he is playing).  Slightly better than Apples-to-Apples since it is a little less subjective (everyone votes, not just one player)... and you are not totally out of the round if you don't have a good card... you can still get points by correctly guessing the card that the "current" player contributed to the secret pile of cards.

Apples to apples style, matching words and phrases to a group of player submitted cards, makes for fast play by people of all levels of gaming enthusiasm. Good party game.

20 plays: Prompts creativity in a beautiful way. Official game rules and tokens are poorly designed, and instead of paying by the rules, my daughters and I just make up stories using the cards. But that way of playing is still cool.

What doesn't work well is that the cards are so specific. You can't really just say "Revenge is sweet, said the woman as she walked away from the cliff!"... because that denies that the cliff is made up of negative space or her hair or whatever. I wish the illustrations were more universal and less metaphysically clever --it's hard to craft a story that isn't just literally tied to what you see.

Se reparten seis cartas a cada jugador. En cada turno hay un cuentacuentos que dice una frase que él asocia a una de las cartas. Todos los jugadores escogen una de sus cartas que "peguen" con la frase. Después se descubren todas y cada jugador (excepto el cuenta cuentos) vota, tratando de averiguar qué carta escogió el cuenta cuentos. Si todos aciertan o nadie acierta, todos puntuan dos puntos, menos el cuenta cuentos. Si no, el cuentacuentos y los que acertaron la carta suman tres puntos. Todas las cartas votadas suman además otro punto (excepto la del cuentacuentos). Sencillez extrema. 
Es un juego familiar. El mérito del juego lo dan las ilustraciones, que son preciosas y jugarlo en el grupo adecuado. Para mi gusto es demasiado sencillo y tengo muchas dudas sobre su rejugabilidad. Es como jugar al pictionary con los dibujos ya hechos. No obstante, es un juego que ha tenido mucho exito, y una vez que juegas, es fácil entender por qué. Idóneo para reuniones de no jugones si se quiere una alternativa a los de siempre (tabú, trivial, pictionary, etc).

Party/association game in the vein of Linq, Apples to Apples or Nobody os perfect, but with a distinctive French touch.

Very imaginative artwork (which is also essential for the idea of the game). 

We tried the game with 5 (at least two of them die hard number crunchers) and were surprised how much fun everybody had. Even played twice in a row.

I have played this with my family and they REALLY loved it. They are not really gamers (except for my brother) so they did not care so much about the points. For them, the experience was much more enjoyable. They loved the card art and making up clues. Everyone had moments where the clue they gave went misinterpreted. Major hit! It's the only game my sister asks to play, and cares to play (she is not one who enjoys complex "thinky" games, nor does she really care about winning very much.)

Dixit is a decent party game, but the challenge lies primarily in utilizing a certain type of thinking that isn't really my favorite. It's not strategic; it's one of those games where you need to know how the other players think (or get to know that quickly) in order to play successfully.

So far almost everyone I've played this game with has loved it. The artwork is just so weird and yet works so well with the mechanics of trying to match people's clues.

Being the story teller seemed scary at first but again because the art is so great it's actually much easier than it sounds.

The only complaint I have so far is that an expansion is a must if you ever plan to play more than one game in a night.

Based on one play.

Seems to be a decent, lighter, "party" game. Quite dependent on crowd dynamics, and whether you know the other players.

It's really like Balderdash except with pictures.

Sometimes you can be made to feel like an outsider if you don't know certain references.

It's quite a change of pace because you use a different part of your brain to play this one compared to other board games.

From the sound of it, this was not something I would at all like.  Boy was I surprised!  It was very fun.  The pictures are great, and there is real room for creative flair in your descriptions.

My only concern is in replayability - once you've seen all the images a few times, will descriptions begin to be stereotyped?  I guess you just have to get sneakier :)

I want to like Dixit. I'm not against party games and I really do enjoy socializing with people, but this game seems to do the opposite.

People use exclusive information to get advantage, some players don't have any imagination at all, and most of the time, the right card is obvious.

It's boring and it's a party game that doesn't do well with social interaction. Maybe I just played with the wrong group of people.

I'll be trying it again sometime. Hopefully things will go smoother.

RATING: 9
Fun partyish game, although I could see that some people could naturally struggle with this one given the subtlety required to do well.

One interesting thing that Jonathan did was to use inside information ("Claire" - TV Lost) to describe a card, and ensure that I got it, but Tim/Dave did not. That's a fantastic strategy, but I'm torn whether that would make for a poor game if it happened every single round, as most players would be just guessing randomly, rather than making clever deductions. This could become particularly problematic if husband/wife were playing. "Hawaii vacation, 1993, near the volcano! Ha ha ha!"

Other concern is that there aren't really that many cards, and replayability could be a bit of a problem. Next time I play in a game with Jonathan & some new people, I could use those phrases that I remember from previous games to give us endless points. So I'm very doubtful that the game has much replayability at all.

Jan 2011:  Rating raised from 8 to 9.   Enjoy this game every time we play.  Dixit 2 improves the options even more.

RATING: 7
I liked this far more than I expected.  (The gorgeous artwork helped, of course.)  The game itself is intriguing too, although I can't see playing it with unimaginative or literal-minded people.  One player described it as "the game Rohrschach should have been", and I completely agree.  It's one of those experiential games where strategy takes a back seat to opening your imagination, but it's the rules and strategy which compel you to do just that.

We spoiled ourselves by getting Journey first, the artwork in that one was not only so much more visually appealing but lent itself to much more open interpretation. Whenever these cards are used it's much clearer which one is the 'correct' one, also the rabbits that fall over are incredibly annoying.  I never would've bothered getting an expansion if this had been our first one, Journey's a major improvement all around.

The game of oblique references. A great party game. Reminiscent of Apples-to-Apples but with an unique twist on the concept. One player chooses a card with an abstract image on it and without revealing it explains that card with a few well chosen words. Other players choose cards from their hands that could also match those words. All cards are mixed and the players try to pick the original image from the added ones. I like that way the rules punish you if you words are too obscure and no-one guesses correctly. Forces you to strike a lovely balance between being too obvious and too cryptic.

A definite improvement on the Apples to Apples genre of party game.

Each round, the lead player secretly selects a card from his hand and gives a clue about it.  Hopefully one that is not too hard, but not too easy either.  Then, every other player secretly plays a card that matches the clue given as best as possible.

Cards are then shuffled and flipped face-up, and players guess which of the cards was the actual card played by the clue giver.  Players are awarded points for guessing correctly, and for playing a card that someone else chose.

Overall, a simple party/social game that allows for some creativity in the clue giving portion.

Very good family game where the beautiful artwork is front and center. The rules are very simple: each player takes a turn choosing a word/phrase/song and everyone must pick a card from their hand that best matches it. The game is easily picked up by everyone so I love that it can be played by anyone and it's also quick enough to keep the interest of children throughout. The biggest strength of the game is obviously the gorgeous illustrations that could take up so many different meanings. Definitely not a thinky game, but a quick game to play with family and friends.

I don't think I'm good enough at abstract thinking for this game... I suck at picking topics. :(

Yes, it definitely feels like visual Apples to Apples.

Our first game was fun. I wonder how much longevity this game has in it... very difficult to tell, I think.

I find it kind of weird that you go through the entire deck every game. I didn't like that I got to see basically every single card our first game... makes me less eager to replay, unlike other card games where I want to keep playing to see all the cards.

The artwork is lovely. I think I want Dixit 2 just to see more pretty pictures!

Definitely need the right group for this (i.e., not people who will pick an entirely random topic so everyone throws out nonsense cards while the storyteller is just betting that, in all likeliness, at least one person will bet on their card.) The cleverer the group, the better, I would think.

Update: Dropping to a 5. I'm not very visual, and I don't like A2A enough to ever really want to play... visual A2A.

Dixit takes the basic mechanics of Balderdash and applies it to surrealistic images created by Marie Cardouat, whose child-like style occasionally belies the ominous content of some of the illustrations.  Players take turns acting as the "storyteller" and attempt to give the others a clue describing one of their cards such that at least one player, but not all, can guess which card belongs to the storyteller, among the cards contributed by all the players.  This game encourages you to think creatively in order to come up with a clue that is not too specific or too abstract.  I have to admit that I was skeptical of this game from the very beginning, despite liking the art and components, but it is a lot of fun!  It is a very "right-brain"-type of game and I feel like it fills a gap in my collection.  Sometimes you can judge a game by it's cover after all!

A 10 for visual appeal, as the cards are truly beautiful, and you can't go wrong with bunny meeples IMO.

It just isn't that much fun as a game though. Maybe I've been playing with the wrong people.

I can see that it WOULD be a great family game, however, both because kids could play on a more-or-less equal footing and because you could bring in family in-jokes, etc.

I am amazed that this is in the BGG top 100. Don't get me wrong. I enjoy the game, but its just glorified apples to apples with really nice artwork and severely limited replayability. Expansions will help, but once you've seen the cards a couple of times, its not really worth playing. Good game, but much better party games out there.

[u]August 2010:[/u] Bought before a 2-week holiday with a large group of friends. While I liked it a lot, and some of my friends liked it too. It kind of fell short for others. The game is very nice but not in a crazy cash n' guns kinda way. This is way more relaxing and calm. Better to play this in the afternoon next to the pool than in the evening. Not very fiesta friendly but very enjoying nonetheless.

RATING: 5.5
I played Dixit Odyssey (with the scoring map and up to 12 players), but in all of my plays cards from Dixit 1, 2 and 3 have been mixed into the game, so I’ve just given the same rating for all of them. I think that the expansions are, unfortunately, essential as the few cards you get in one of the standalone games will quickly get into a rotation. Dixit shines when you don’t see the same cards often so you don’t have the same associations connected to specific cards (sure, you might still do, but with e.g. 300 instead of 100 cards, chances are that you won’t face too many of the same cards, and, furthermore, the other players will have a broader variety of cards of their own to pick from).

Dixit is a great game for kids and families as you really need to be creative and think outside the box! However, I’m not in the target group. I would definitely still play it with family, kids and non-gamers (which is exactly what I’ve done so far), but as a game there isn’t much to it. It’s more like an activity for creative minds, and it’s very good at that; it’s just not a game for me. If playing a “game” that isn’t really a game, I would much rather play Telestrations; it’s not a similar game at all, but Telestrations always make me laugh, it caters the same amount of players and it’s also a partygame/activity.

Main Positives: A great party game!

Fun Factor: High
Complexity: With the exception of the scoring, it's not really that difficult to learn it.
Replayability: Yup! Especially with new cards or with new players who could give new ideas to the table.

Main Frustrations and Caveats:
You have to be both smart about your clues at the same time know who can understand them though this didn't take away the enjoyment of playing the game.

A pretty fantastic party game that kind of makes you get in the heads of the people you play with. There's not a whole lot of "meat" to it, and it's not the kind of party game where you find yourself laughing much if at all. But it's very charming and presents you with some interesting gameplay that's rather unique.

RATING: 7
A good, interesting family game. It can really stretch your imagination. However, the re-playability is limited as you will invariably see the same cards cropping up for the same themes time and again. There are plenty of expansions now available to add extra cards now which should remove this problem.
EDIT - Adding just one additional pack of cards really increases the variety and improves the game. I would definitely recommend picking up at least one if you are going to play Dixit as a regular family game.

What a great way to shut down a night of drinking and heavy-duty gaming with friends.

There is nothing similar to Dixit, this game is unique. It's the best party game I've ever played. Very funny but demanding at the same time.

Best to play with people with wide range of interests.

A cross between "Apples to Apples" and "Balerdash." The artwork is top notch. It's an experience game. Players shouldn't care about winning. Instead people should enjoy trying to be creative and clever. That aspect might not sit well with hard core gamers. I really enjoy it.

My second favorite party game (behind The Resistance).  This game combines the best aspects of both Apples to Apples and Balderdash.  All of the cards are pictures.  The active player gives a brief clue about one of his cards, all other players then try to pick a card that also matches that clue.  All non-active players then vote on which picture belongs to the active player.
The trick is that the active player loses if everyone picks his card OR if no one picks his card.  So the active player can't be to obvious but he also can't be too obtuse.

Lots of fun for a party type game. The rules are so simple getting into the game is a breeze with new players. The deck of art/cards is too small. It takes very few games to realize that an expansion is practically a necessity if you want any continued play value from it. However, the game itself is clever, fun, creative and brings out the most inventive ideas from people. It serves for a lot of lighthearted banter and good group interaction. It is so unlike anything people have played it is always well received.

Dixit, like all storytelling games, lives or dies by the group you're playing with more than its own merits. Be wary of folks that are more being forced to the table, as they'll give you "one word stories" and suffer from big time writers block. There's probably better such games than Dixit, but it's certainly adorable, and the box becoming the board is pretty darn cute. Might be a good option for younger players telling simpler tales.

Good game, especially with a mixed age group of players.  It's simple enough even very young or old will be willing to play.  I don't think it has long lasting appeal and it's not something you'd want to play over and over again.  It's a game best done once or so a year.

Suuper clever game! I love the balance between too much information and too little. The artwork is clever and lends itself well to the core mechanics of the game. I wish the expansions were cheaper because we did start to get a little bored with the cards after many plays. But I get it, I can imagine it's a lot of work to produce so many individual art pieces for one game.

We've worked out a way to even let the 3yo play this.
It goes quite well by just using a set of tokens for the numbers above the cards on the table and modifying scoring. We intend to introduce more advance scoring as we go along. A hit!

After 1 play I think this is pretty good. I think this could get very creative and could probably be optimised quite well for kids. I'm pretty sure we'll buy this for Xmas 2010.

This light card game involves describing a card, but not too well.  The cards have pretty fantasy art.  Each player is dealt a hand of cards.  The active player selects a card and says up to a few words about it.  Then, everyone else selects one of their cards they think fits that description.  The cards are shuffled together then displayed.  Players then indicate which card they think belonged to the active player.  Points are awarded for guessing correctly and for having your card guessed.  Beware of describing your card too well: if everyone guesses it, you will receive no points.

This game is beautiful and engaging with almost anyone.  It really sparks imagination and easy to teach/play.  The challenge after a while comes down to thinking of new clues with the same cards! But the beauty of this game is knowing (or getting to know) your group.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Outstanding all-ages game. Perfect as a party game or a filler game. Fantastic artwork. The artwork truly matters, as it is a primary component of the game. Not just window dressing.

This game is not about how much you know, how strategic you are, or how competitive you are. It is really a test for how creative you can be. If your creative side is strong, you should enjoy the game and do well.

The first player to 30 points is the winner. Players take turns being the active player. Tokens consist of colored wooden bunnies on a scoring track.

The active player secretly selects a card from their hand, and gives a clue that relates to something on the card. All other players then secretly select one card that may also be related to the clue. The cards are shuffled and laid out face up, so it is not possible to know whose cards belong to whom. Then al non-active players vote on which card was played by the active player. The goal of the active player is to get at least one person to guess their card, but not everyone.

If your clue is too obvious, everyone will guess your card, and you get zero points, while everyone else gets points. If your clue is too obscure, nobody will guess your card, you will get zero points and everyone else will score points. If you guess the active player's card, and other people guess your card, you get even more points.

The game plays fairly quickly, and it is a lot of fun trying to come up with excellent clues and enjoying others who do the same when they are the active player.

You may see a runaway leader or a distant player bringing up the rear in scoring, but it usually comes down to 2 or more payers battling to get to 30 points and win the game.

Magical and creative game.  Instant favorite when introducing it to new players.  Seems like it would get old quickly though, if played too often and with the same group of players.  Thus the NEED for expansions.  Time really flies when playing this game.  It's hard to imagine anyone not liking this game (for the first few times at least). It remains to be seen whether this game has longevity though.  I've played it four times with three different game groups in the past three days since getting it.  

Six months and 2 expansions later I'm lowering my rating from a 9 to a 7.  Still a good game, but not quite so magical anymore.  Sigh...

I have a hard time looking upon Dixit as a serious game. It is a unique form of activity, of course, one to engage in with the entire family... but too much implicit knowledge of people's preferences and habits is needed once people get to know each other well. Analogies which in my opinion are also not games in the way I usuall play them are for example cooking shows which subsequently award points for best presentation. Yes, you can award points for this, but how those are arrived at is difficult to put to words. Now in Dixit the process of point awarding is admittedly not that obfuscated, but still it feels odd to me. What [i]is[/i] a genuine problem is that at times you simply don't have a card which matches the story; and that it is also at times impossible to deduce what the hell someone was talking about given the set of open cards. 

The upshot is that I really cannot make myself care about how well I am doing pointwise (although I usually finish in the top-3, believe it or not), and instead just treat every story as a [i]puzzle[/i] which needs solving rather than a [i]competition[/i] I need to do well at. This helps make Dixit palatable... barely. It's that it only hits the table about two times a year that I will participate; more than this is overasking. The rate given reflects this; otherwise you can easily deduct one or two point from it.

Basically Apples to Apples but with pictures and more abstract concepts. I liked this more than I thought I would although it's going to be more fun with 6 people than 3, and more with creative people.

My favourite party game of all time, Dixit truly is a special game. Be it the mechanics, the artwork, or the interaction the game evokes, there is something a little bit magical about this game, which plays so often on shared memories, experiences, culture and interests, ultimately bringing those who play it closer as a group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Kids and non-gamers like this one. The card art is evocative and provides ample visual "hooks" to use when coming up with clues to describe the cards. One drawback is the large cards, which are nice for displaying artistic detail to all players around the table, are also somewhat difficult to keep hidden from other players. And because the game is essentially figuring out who played which cards, seeing someone else's hand destroys a good deal of the fun.

I would describe this game as a mash-up of Apples to Apples and Balderdash.  The current player selects one of his cards, describes it with a "story" and then other players submit their own cards they think match the description.  They are mixed up and players vote.  Points are awarded when your card is chosen.

The slight twist is the storyteller wants to get some, but not all, of the players to vote for his card to put himself in the best position on the scoring track.

Lovely artwork to be sure, and I wouldn't turn down the chance to play again.  But I don't think the gameplay is very original.

Scratches the same party-game itch as Apples to Apples, but there's something like a balanced game in there. It's a very different skillset from most board games - "provide a vague but not too-vague hint" is an exercise in getting into other peoples' heads, not optimizing action points - but for me, quite engaging.

Players with lots of inside jokes / knowledge / experience can make things too opaque for the other players, though.

RATING: 9
Components: Perfectly beautiful cards. The expansions help to ensure the freshness of the quantity. The score track inside the box is clever, but without it the game could have fit inside a much smaller box. This game easily lends itself to being played with more people, so it would be nice if by default the game came with pieces for 8, instead of for 6.

Expanded by Odyssey, the scoretrack is much better, and the voting peg boards are much simpler to use and score. Big improvement.

Experience: Limiting the storyteller to one, terse sentence is a great way to both ensure ambiguity and ease the anxiety of those nervous playing creativity-based games. It is very much like a game version of Chris Van Allsburg's book The Mysteries of Harris Burdick. We end up telling cute little tales, and it's fun trying to determine which of the cards best matches the story or phrase. There are some times when every card seems a perfect match; and times when none of the cards seem to fit.

To make a quick contrast to Apples to Apples; in that game, I often find myself not having any good card to fit with the active description, and so I burn a particularly flat card from my hand just to get rid of it. In Dixit, every card is precious, and can be used in any number of wonderful situations. The cards each have have enough complexity that we find ourselves focusing on different aspects of the cards, and then later discussing why such-and-such card was/wasn't a good fit, and what we think is going on in the picture. Very entertaining.

One potential problem: unlike in Thingamajig or Ostrakon, in Dixit the active player doesn't care how many players pick their card, just so long as they split the group (although every player who picks someone else gives away a free point). So the active player has an incentive to construct some cryptic riddle intended to be understood by just one person at the table, which is less fun.

Will only play if enough of the family asks.  With the limited amount of cards, the hints become repetitive and the game becomes boring.  I feel expansions would only fix this for so long.

This was rarely received well by any of the crowds I played with.  I didn't love it, but I figured it was a good party game.  But, no matter how many times I pulled it out there was always at least one negative reaction from the group.  I never had anyone express interest in playing it again and actually had a couple groups mock it!

I'll suggest this game in a party setting as my go-to light weight party game, especially if people haven't played it before.

SU&SD have good commentary about how this game isn't really replayable. (http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/blog/post/susds-top-25-games-ever-25-21/) It's hard to keep things fresh. I'm glad it's in my collection, but I'll only play it with new people.

A very good party game with beautiful artwork. Not too much luck involved (usually). 
WARNING!!! requires creative and funny people to play with.  

I bought it with the expansion (Dixit 2),couldn't imagine playing Dixit without it.

The biggest minus is 6 player cap, hopefully future expansions will increase it.

Best played with 6 players.

played with all expansions as they do not increase the difficulty etc just give you more cards. 
Thinking of something to describe your card without being too obvious can be tricky and there is an element of luck involved as you don't know what other cards the other players have available to put out that may meet your description

Good party game for light gamers

Punten scoren door een beeld op een kaart te omschrijven waardoor je medespelers wel een idee hebben wat er op jouw kaart staat, maar toch ook weer geen al te goed idee, waardoor ze ook voor de kaart van een andere speler kunnen kiezen. De speler die de kaart omschreef krijgt 3 punten als iemand op zijn kaart stemt, maar niet iedereen. Alle spelers die op de juiste kaart stemmen krijgen ook 3 punten. En alle spelers op wiens kaart verkeerdelijk gestemd werd, krijgen ook 1 punt.

When you've gone through the cards MANY MANY MANY times you really struggle to find new explanations/stories for the cards that the group hasn't heard before. When playing with different people you might come up with new hints but the cards get boring after a while.

Our go-to family game, definitely the most played game in our collection.  It's the one that we bring out when we have a wide age range in players.  Enjoyable and scales well from 3 players up to 6.

I am actually loving the number of expansions that have continually come out for the game as the art is always top-notch.

Pro:
- Unusual game;
- Evrybody is not playing againt each other, at least there is no feel like this;
- playing with small kids could lead to very unexpected results;
- easy to learn.
Cons:
- Not a competetive game;
- You will not manage to play it for more than one hour in a row as the process will be still tha same and nothing changes.
- After two or three plays the cards run out and assotiations start to be linked with previous sessions.  This can be avioded, however, by printing additional pics.

Result:
Could give a try if in right mood and with right company. Gameplay depends very much on the people you will be playing with.

Being the storyteller was dreaded by everyone, at first. The artwork was admired by everyone. Mix of Apples to Apples and Thingamajig feelings during gameplay, only not much humor. Oh wait, now it's funny, too, besides the pseudo-psychological evaluation feeling.

Enjoyable and relatively quick game.  Definitely a beer and pretzel game.  Art work is nice.
I like that you need an imagination to play.  Also like that you're penalized if your clues are too easy/hard.  But also like that you can trick others with the cards you choose to represent the clue the Player gives.

It's amazing how some people just can't grasp the concept of this game, but after a couple of rounds, this is very entertaining. It can't be played very often with the same group without the expansions because the stories start to repeat themselves.

I actually found this pretty ordinary even as a filler.
The cards are nice to look at, the mechanism is very familiar, but the meat just isnt there.
The promise of story telling just doesn't happen with our group. Given the need to create ambiguity, the safest play is to minimise your "story" to one word. This turns it into a rather dull card selection/chance game compared to the creativity in something like balderdash.
Blah.

A very good game - a very good party game at that, and I don't generally even like party games.  But this is a party game with brains. Not to mention the images on cards, they are so wonderful, I would hang them on the wall if they were poster sized. If only there were more of them...

Played twice. Neither a game of luck nor a game of skill -- rather a game of "I know this person better than everybody else does". Don't see the point of this. As a party game, I'd prefer "Nobody's Perfect" or even "Therapy".

RATING: 7
A truly amazing game.  The creativity it invokes is potentially stunning and it's all based on two simple factors: 1) the multi-faceted art of Carduot, which lends itself remarkably well to varying interpretations; and 2) the clever mechanic of trying to get as few players as possible to guess your clue without no one getting it.

I've rated this game an 8 in the past, so why is it now lower?  Firstly, it can get repetitive.  It's common for people to want to play again immediately after the first play.  That second play almost always runs out of steam before the half-way mark and I wish the game would be over.

Secondly, it requires people who enjoy the process of creating these clues.  Non-participants can make it uninteresting.  This can also sap the energy from the game.  It's only fun if players bring a fun attitude with them.

So the rating reflects that the game has delicate play circumstances and can be reduced to boring status.

Good for a few laughs.  But has some flaws.  If you have a common basis for the pictures with some of the players, you can reference things only they understand.  This helps to split the votes and score you points.  But it is the kind of the game that you don't really try to win.  If you go in trying to win this game all serious-like, you should probably be playing something else.

RATING: 4
Party game where players have to guess which is the storyteller's picture.  Played in terms where each turn a player becomes the storyteller.  They select a picture from their hand of cards, and say a sound or phrase relating to that picture.  The other players try to select a picture that best fits the storyteller's phrase.  Cards are collected, shuffled, displayed, then players select what they think the storyteller's card was.  Points are awarded based on picks, with the storyteller wanting someone to pick their card, but not everyone.  Fun game that works to a point (the right sort of game group is mandatory) - very much in the style of Barbarossa and Apples To Apples.  Not sure about longevity - probably needs to be sprinkled around different groups to keep it fresh.  Expansion is a must, I suspect.

This is not the type of game I usually enjoy, but it is pretty fun, interesting, and the pictures are very beautiful and intriguing.  It gets your mind working in a different way than most board games.  My only concern is how much replayability the game will have once you've seen all the pictures a few times. This will probably be one of my go-to games (along with No Thanks) when I need something simple, unintimidating, and easy to teach to non-gamers.  I appreciate that it can accommodate 6 players.

Update: For some reason, I got tired of this quite quickly.  It has no replay value for me now that the novelty wore off.  My partner is still enchanted with it though.

Play a card from your hand and describe it vaguely. Others also play cards from their hands that fit description. Suffle cards and then others try to guess which one is the described one.

Mechanism
Gain points by guessing others descriptions and by placing card that someone picks for a wrong answer. If your description is too easy and all quess it or too hard and none quess it only others get points.

To whom:
Partygame, social, ideas on cards are very multifaceted and good clues are hard to come by. Many clues can be found on many details.

Each player has a hand of cards featuring different pictures.  All of the pictures are beautiful, but bizarre and ambiguous.  One player uses a word, phrase, or sentence to describe one of his pictures, with the intent of describing his picture well enough that some people figure out which is the card in question, but not so well that everyone does.  It seems strange at first, but players rapidly become better at being suitably ambiguous.

Bought it from Craigslist after seeing it on Tabletop. I'm not expecting to enjoy the game very much (or be very good at it) but my wife was really intrigued, and anything that gets her to play games is a plus in my book. I expect we'll play it with family over the upcoming holidays.

[Edit] As you can see by my collection, we enjoyed the game enough to buy nearly every expansion set of cards there is. Some folks like it, others do not (which could probably be said for any game). However, one of the people who found it the most confusing / least enjoyable really liked Mysterium because of the cooperative nature of that game.

This falls right in between Apples To Apples and a Salvador Dali painting.   As such, it's a lot better and more creative than Apples To Apples.  The art is important to the game, and the creativity required is good for kids.  After a couple of plays, however, the cards will certainly get old.  The game plays out quickly and the expansion deck is well overpriced.

Nothing in the 'game-with-pretty-cards' category has come close to matching the simple formula that Dixit hit on (except maybe Muse, gotta check that one out.) I struggle with it, often have trouble coming up with a good clue, but love working out other people's clues.

One expansion in, I'll likely pick up more if this hits the table more often.

There is a genius mechanism found in the popular party game Balderdash, which asks players to try to find the correct answer among several incorrect user submitted answers. This mechanism has been imitated already several times, including this new game. However, Dixit feels completely fresh, thanks in part to its incredible artwork. It's a beautiful game that will no doubt attract even the  most casual of game players.

[b]1.5.11 Update:[/b] I continue to be horrible at this game. Always going too obscure or abstract with my clues for people to grasp. Nevertheless, I still enjoy it.

A casual, creative experience. While the round scoring rewards ambiguity, it also can reward inside references between just two players.

Marie C. did an amazing job with the artworks on the card.

This is a storytelling game, where you're necessarily need to tell a story to describe a card. Enough with just a word or even a sound. Basically, you could tell or do anything to describe anything from your card. Telling too much will be to obvious and that's not what you want to do.

This is probably my limit to a storytelling game as that mechanic really doesn't click with me very well (maybe because I'm not good with stories).

It's a great game, extremely perfect for ice-breakers. Too bad it's only capped at six players. However, playing with more than six is really not a problem, but you will need to make a custom pieces for the voting.

I basically bought the game the next day after my first play. That's how excited I was with the game.

The illustrations on the cards will bring you into another world. Suitable for everybody, even small children. 
It's a narration game, where one player secretly choses one of his cards and will say anything - a word, a sentence, a title of a song, a piece of music, a movie quote.... - and all the other players will pick a card from their hand that could fit what the narrator player has chosen. All the cards chosen will be shuffled, and and the players will vote trying to pick the narrator card. A little gem.

Dixit is an easy game, that makes friend tells a phrase that describes some in a picture. All the others try to put a picture that has the same meaning o are relacionated (all of this in secret, because the magic is to try to guess what's the correct picture). 

Dixit is always different, you can say more than a thousand phrases for each picture, and the game can be adapted according to the friends or people you share the experience. Is a MUST HAVE if you have frequent meetings with friends (non-board game friends love it too).

About the number of players:
You need 5 or 6 friends to play it. With 3 or 4 are good, but the lack of random options gonna affect your experience.

This is a simple but wonderful storytelling game with cards that are work of art. 
This game is great for parties or when you want to play with kids.
Cards are immensely beautiful with a huge amount of details. Sometimes it's just fun to browse through them. 
It works only if there is a lot of players, up to 12 if more convenient voting system is used (like pins in Odyssey).

[b]Edit:[/b] Game does not work (!) with more than 8 players. It kind of dissipates and loses consistency, becoming too random. Sweet spot is 5 or 6 players.

Érdekes játék. 2x játszottam vele, de aranyos, agymozgatós, mármint olyan értelemben, h próbálj a képekből asszociálni, mások asszociációihoz képet társítani. Ismerkedős és ismerős játék. És igazi vidám hangulatú játék, ahol nem a végeredmény a fontos, hanem a játékban mondott-tett dolgok, a nevetés, tetszett. Mondhatni picit le is nyűgözött. Ez is kellemes party és sí játék lehetne. S ha még 1-2-3 emberrel több is tudná játszani...

Another Apples-to-Apples-style party game, this time with pictures.  The biggest flaw of the game is that, unlike Apples-to-Apples, there aren't many cards, so you're guaranteed to run through all of them at least once.  The same group is likely going to make the same associations if you play again, so you either have to wait until you forget all the cards or play with entire different people.

This is one good family game. It's more interesting in higher number of players. You try to give good enough description of your card so that at least someone guesses right, but not good enough so that all guess your card.

People that played more games are probably in advantage, because they would know how some of the cards are usually described.

It takes a bit more time than I like, for what it has to offer.

Fantastic party/Family game.  Select a card from your hand make a noise or quick reference based on the strange art on the cards. Everyone selects one card from their hand that closely resembles that noise or card and hands it to the active player. All cards are displayed and everyone but the active player votes. If everyone guesses the active players card the voters get points the active player gets nothing. If some get it but not everyone the active players and the voters that got it right all get points and the people that voted wrong get none. 

The art on the cards are beautiful and often stunning. Weird pictures with oddities all around make for endless expressions and endless possibilities.  A game my family is constantly voting for.

At first read, this game seemed to be, first and foremost, about coming up with semi-vague clues.  After several plays though, I'm thinking it's more about knowing your opponents, and exploiting what you know about them to target clues at them.  Like most games I love, it's all about knowing the people sitting at the table, and games like that are my jam.

Players draw from a deck of full sized illustrations and decide how they want to express a particular card, before placing it face down. Everyone else picks another card that might fit the same clue and players vote on all the submissions. Extremely fun for everyone who plays, the art is just so lovely to look at in between turns. Dixit Quest fits really well with the original game, but Dixit Journey features a new artist imitating the original style, which can sometimes not quite fit with other cards. Odyssey adds a new scoring track that works much better than the original international version, although the voting pegs aren't any use at all in my opinion.

15-30m, best with 3-6 players. 25+ plays.

I have always been told that I am a man of odd taste.  I will freely admit that I tend to enjoy what some people would consider weird.  Well, the pictures in Dixit are strange but they are beautifully drawn.  So why am I talking about pictures of a game rather than game itself? The pictures are the most integral part of the game.  

Unlike most party games, Dixit serves as a thoughtful/reflective game for creative gamers rather than social distractions such as Say Anything, Apples to Apples, etc.  Each round one person chooses one card in their hand, places it face down on the table and states a word/phrase as a clue to what card they've played.  All other players add one card from their hand facedown that they think matches the word or phrase.  The cards are shuffled and then placed in a line.  Everyone but the 'storyteller' simultaneously and secretly votes on what they think is the storyteller's card.  Points will be awarded based on who picked what cards.

The 'storyteller's' description does not want to be an exact description of what's seen in the picture or too specific a clue about what card it is.  The storyteller also does not want to state a phrase that is completely unrelated to the picture unless it's a clue the storyteller feels only one or two others may understand. The reason being is that if everyone or no one votes on the card that he submitted, he will not score anything and everyone else will score.  The only negative thing to be said about the game is that if you play this game too often the pictures will become familiar and might feel a little stale.

I will leave you with the awesomeness of Dixit:

Which one of the above cards would you think was mine if I had given the above clue?

I can credit Dixit as the entry point for several of my game playing friends and family. Its accessible, silly, familiar, and the expansions keep it constantly growing. But, it never managed to scratch my gaming itch. I liked to play, but I always wanted to play something more thinky. Also, there just isn't enough hand-circulation and certain cards always manage to plague me until the end. I'd always prefer Mysterium to this.

Game play is similar to [i]Apples to Apples[/i] and the scoring resembles [i]Thingamajig[/i] & [i]Cluzzle[/i] in that clues can’t be too accurate or else you won’t score any points. What makes [i]Dixit[/i] superior in this genre is the surreal artwork on the cards that is not only fun to look at but serves a practical purpose by providing a high degree of flexibility when choosing what cards to play.  "[i]Apples to Apples[/i] for adults" is a fitting description.

Dixit
Pros
--The Art!  I owned this game and regifted, but much later after the fact, I regret that I did so simply because of the art in this game.
--Very accessible non-confrontational party game.
--Encourages thinking completely unique from what any other game does.

Cons
--Ends with a whimper.  Every ending of this game has been “Oh, that’s the last round.  I guess I won, huh”. 
--Group-dependent on two criteria………… familiarity with the group can go a long way, and the group must be seeking the specific kind of experience this game offers.
--Not a game that should be played more than, say, once a year, as familiarity with the cards takes away much of the appeal.

Apples to Apples' clear successor. The scoring is nothing totally new, in fact it's not really all that interesting. But that doesn't matter.

[1 play] The art in this game is mesmerizing.  It reminds me a bit of the work of Chris van Allsburg.  The art drew me to the game even though the gameplay sounded like something I might otherwise dismiss.  Finally got to play, and… it was OK.  Everyone was mostly new to the game, and I felt like it had (or potentially had) a level of play we weren't tapping.  Quite often you'd say something that seemed a hair's-breadth from blindingly obvious, and no one would have any idea what you meant.  Really the most successful technique was to make some concrete literary or pop-culture reference, and hope that someone (but not everyone) would connect with it.  But it seemed like the optimal way to play would not be that, but to approach it in a much more intuitive and creative way.  I'm not sure I am cut out for this game.

A brilliant party game. It is truly exceptional with the right group of people. Conversely it can be tarnished by players who take a long time to come up with clues. It can also be a problem when players reference inside jokes with their clues, causing all but a few players to get left behind in points as well as fun. I have Dixit 2 and Odyssey mixed together.

RATING: 10
(Rating including expansions: [thing=145325]Origins[/thing], [thing=92828]Odyssey[/thing], [thing=119657]Dixit 3[/thing], [thing=156189]Daydreams[/thing])

Innovative party game. Easy to learn and fast to play. The only drawback is that there can be a tendency among people that know each other to give hints that outsiders at the table have a hard time to understand, e.g. "your mom's roses..." or "that time at your house when that thing broke".

Even though there are 84 unique cards in the base game and the ending condition is that you run out of cards, you will have seen almost all of them on your first play and most certainly by the second. This doesn't have to be bad necessarily because it forces you to be creative and come up with new and more subtle clues. Still, I think I'll have to get an expansion or two to increase the variety.

Dixit is best with 5 or 6 people. When playing with 4, we normally add a random card from the deck so there are 5 cards to choose from. Don't play this with 3 players, it can't be saved.

[i]Edit:[/i] The game benefits greatly from an expansion! Including one expansion, the rating improved from 9 to 10. I don't know if getting a second expansion is a must though because the box cannot fit more than one expansion inside (unless you get the one with the smaller point track) and I dislike having to the game in multiple boxes.

[i]Edit:[/i] Got Dixit Odyssey as the second expansion. The box is much better and has room for three to four expansions and comes with a new scoring board that also serves as a placeholder for the cards. Technically, you could play up to 12 people, but it's still best with 5 or 6 players. I also dislike the new way to pick your number, so I stuck with the old one. I still recommend getting Dixit Odyssey mainly for the box, the cards and the new scoring board.

An interesting game that sadly lacks in replay ability over time.  Without investing in the expansions and alternate versions of the game to bring in fresh cards, you will soon find that identifying specific cards becomes fairly easy as people often give the same sorts of clues for them each time.  An ok game if you very rarely play it or invest heavily in the add ons for the extra cards.

A sublime party game experience. The artwork is engaging, compelling, and inspiring and helps the game transcend from a run-of-the-mill party game to something more interesting and unique. I've had some great laughs playing this game as well as some moments of very worthwhile deduction. I've also been out of it from the start but still managed to enjoy myself until it was over. 

Moreover, everyone I've ever introduced it to has taken to it. For example, one of my teenage nieces started off with a dubious attitude about it (as teenagers are wont to do) but she ended up loving it. Definitely happy to have in my collection as it more than fills its particular niche; it stands out in it.

A Favorite Dixit Story: The clue was "bad idea" and the card was the snail at the bottom of some winding stairs. Afterwards, I asked my friend how the clue and the card matched up, and he said with great earnestness, "It's a snail thinking about going up some stairs.  That's a bad idea!"

Once you play Dixit you will not want to go back to Apples to Apples.  Has a similar mechanic but with pictures instead of words.  Also Dixit has more game involved with a board and meeples and it requires a more strategy.

If I'm just hanging out and drinking, I generally prefer to do something more active like throw glow in the dark bocci. Or just throw rocks. But, if I'm going to sit down and play a game, I can handle this one because 1) it's relatively easy to push bunnies while drunk and 2) I don't have to read words to play.

Like a visual/imagination-based version of the Dictionary game, this game is simple and plays quickly. It requires that you calibrate the clues you give based on the other players so I find this a highly interactive game, even if the way you engage other players is often nonverbal.

Light party games aren't a genre I'm usually fond of, but this is a great game for people who like: imagination, trippy illustrations, or intuiting the intentions of other players in subtle clues.

This one is certainly not for everyone, and I can see how it may not be loved, and even hated. It is a very right-brain experience, and I guess not really a game in the true sense.  It is the player interactions and clues that make this shine for me, and not so much about winning or doing well. If you play more that a couple of times, get some of the expansions, as additional cards seem to make it feel less same-y.

This game is very popular with all my non-gaming friends. And for gamers, it is perfect for the evening after whole day spent boardgaming. It is very unique and so different from any other game that some of my hardcore boardgaming partners don't like it, they say, it is not actually a game. But I love how different it is - who wants so play the same games, only with different artwork?

A Dixit hatalmas erénye, hogy véleményem szerint (meg az eladott darabok szerint is) több emberrel szerettette meg a társasjátékozást, mint bármely másik játék! Ezt az érdemet pedig nem lehet elvenni tőle! Valóban egyszerű, és élvezetes asszociációs játék! Elsősorban családi, nem pedig partijáték, ezt a címet az Odyssey birtokolja! A Dixit nagy erénye még, hogy tényleg bárhol, bármikor, bárkinél bevethető! Én is bármikor kapható vagyok egy partira; így volt ez régen is, mikor csak egy két játékot ismertem. És van ez most, amikor bővülnek a társasos ismereteim, és a játékaim száma!

Although it has won a lot of awards, I have been sceptical to this game. But I was SO wrong. It's an awesome game, which creates a lot of laughter and interesting discussions.

Fun game that you can teach in 5 minutes.  Impressive how such a simple game can be so entertaining.  The biggest flaw in this game is that it needs more cards.  After a couple plays you have seen all the cards and make the same connections with the artwork if you are playing with the same group.  Or worse...  you are playing with some of the same group so you can give the same clues for your card and you are guaranteed to have at least one person pick it.

Played at BayCon2012.  

If you end up in a game where a player cannot give very good clues and so their card is obvious, this game really suffers.

On the down side (maybe) my boyfriend is more insync with his friend than with me. :(

After more plays this is growing on me a little. Whilst the game still suffers if one player is obvious, there are more descriptive words that you can apply the more you have played, there is a generational gap however as I mainly gaming group consists of us oldies and a group of 18 year old's who occasionally reference cartoons they watched whilst growing up that we oldies have never heard of. The look of confusion on their faces when they explain the clue and you still don't get it is quite amusing :)

My partner's favorite game and one that has never failed to please, no matter who we introduce it to. Easily one of the more interesting and beautiful light games to have come out in the past few years. Worth getting all of the expansions, since we'll be playing it for years to come. The scoring can be a little wonky for many players, so the game benefits from one person who understands it to do the accounting. Play it with the right group of people and it can be genuinely competitive, but otherwise it's just a fun activity, and that's OK.

What I love most about this game (other than the wonderful art!) is the simple rules and their flexibility. "Take this card and say anything you want" is just great for introducing a game to non-gamers.

I can see the game wearing out with repeated plays (in the same group) because there aren't an unlimited number of cards. However this is not enough of an issue for me to drag down the rating.

Update: Having played this quite a lot now, I am suprised to report that replayability is way higher than I thought. As the skill of players increase, hints have to be more subtle. Amazing.
Also, both my non-gaming mother and my non-gaming in-laws have all requested that I bring this game along. They've never done anything like that before!

The cards in this game are among the most beautiful.  It is a pleasure to view these cards whose purpose it is to elicit responses (emotional, thoughtful, inquisitive, imaginative), and indeed they do. It is all about the cards.

The only party game I truly enjoy

Pros
-Gorgeous artwork that invokes creativity
-The artwork makes it hard to guess which person put out which card and which card belongs to which clue
-Can be less dependent on specific cultural references
-I like the freedom the game gives people to just give any clue (can be an action, a phrase, a word etc)

Con
-Somewhat low replayability value within the same group
-Limited number of cards in a single set (you will likely see all cards within 1-3 play through).
-Depending on group, may be dependent on knowledge of pop culture

Dixit est extrêmement simple à apprendre mais il fait place à toute notre créativité. Il s'agit de regarder nos cartes et d'en faire deviner une aux autres joueurs mais attention! Si on est trop précis et que tout le monde vote pour votre carte plutôt que celle d'un autre joueur vous ne faites pas de point. Les autres joueurs peuvent également marquer des points en recevant des votes pour une carte de leur jeu qu'Il soumettent également au vote. Très intéressant comme concept, dans la même lignée que Codenames.

Simply brilliant. I like a lot Marie Cardouat's art.

It does wear off a bit with time, both due to the limited (oh, they're many, but you get used to them after about 20 games) number of cards and due to the sameiness.

Also, better to play it while fresh. Tiredness often kills creativity.

No jogo, um jogador diz uma palavra relacionada a carta que joga, fechada, e todos os outros jogadores deve jogar um carta, fechada, relacionada com a palavra. Em seguida, embaralha-se, vira-se e cada jogador escolhe a carta que acha que é a carta relacionada a palavra dita pelo jogador da vez. A palavra que você diz não pode ser obvia nem pode ser difícil pois, se todos ou nenhum jogador acertarem sua carta, você não ganhará pontos.

Fun party game...with the right group. You need to play with people who can be more imaginative and interesting with their choices.

A lot of the fun is derived from laughing at other's choices and it's interesting to see how your friend's minds work when playing this.

As far as expression games go, this one is a real winner. If that's what your looking for, this might very well be the best game in that segment.

I think I understand why people turns crazy about this game... Yes, it's beautiful, it's innocent, and is so-so-easy and so-so-pretty... moreover, it's fast paced and its playing time is arround 20-30 minutes.
Over those reasons, what I really appreciate on this game are its creativity and fantasy aspects; yeah, I love to construct enigmatic or poetic sentences, adding a drop of malice here and a drop of clown-ness there... But, even then, I could never give this game a rating over 7, 'cause to me it'll always belong to the group of "party games", or "childhood games" (nothing against children and/or parties... Just not an engaging experience for me).

Dixit is a party game. It is, however, not of the rowdy kind. Basically it's an association game where players try to figure out which of a number of images was the one described by the active player who wants people to find him out, but not all of them.

Pretty much all of the game depends on the images which most people seem to be enamoured with but a few also detest. The images probably are the biggest asset of the game but they are also a liability because there aren't that many of them, and unless you play with a different bunch of people all the time I do not expect them to last very long. Once a certain state of hivemind has set in you'll need new cards for the game to stay fresh.

Dixit is certainly no bad candidate for the SdJ award. What it does it does very well, and its visual quality makes it easy to hook non-gamers, too. Myself, I prefer the non-visual approach of Linq that also promises better replayability but I suppose that's mostly because I am not much of a visual person in the first place.

One play has this as an interesting game which should have further plays (30/12/10). UPDATE: after a few games, this is a reasonable trivia game.  Nothing brilliant, but nothing bad, and at least a unique mechanism that seems to pique the interest of non-gamers.  I think it could go stale with many games, but at the current low frequency of plays, It's an ok diversion. Still surprised it got the Spiel des Jahres for 2010 (so rating stays at 7) (4/12/11). UPDATE: With the right people (i.e. they all know each other well), a fun game (Rating 7.849, Jan 17)

Good party game. Appeals to the creative, imaginative side of the players. I think there may be a problem if only part of a game group is familiar with the images (which should start being the case after only a few games). Or maybe if a part of the group know each other a lot better than the others, which could lead them to use otherwise undecipherable private jokes and such. Good sportsmanship will avoid that but it's a little drawback of the game as it is. But the game is still good fun and a nice icebreaker too. Exactly the right thing for the few remaining people after a party ended or for a quick game of something before going to bed. It's quick to learn, quick to play, and everybody usually likes it. Plus the images ae beautiful.

Dixit goes beyond - it does something completely "DIFFERENT" with card / board gaming and I love how it taps into the creative side - but there is strategy! Definitely not a game for everyone, but certainly a great game for me! One sour note: the box really irritates me. It's 300% too large and is awkward enough that it won't hold any expansions. WTF box designers? Really, one of the worst board game boxes designed.

Enjoyed this with 2 other players. You rotate being the story teller while everyone else lays down a card they think best matches the story. Points are scored based on your guesses. Even if you're not the story teller and someone guessed it to be your card, you get a some points for that. You get even more points if you guess the actual card the story teller set down. The nice thing about this game is even though it is player pitted against player, there is no direct attacks but plenty of player interaction.

If you're going to get this, get at least one expansion with it at the same time. You'll get a lot more out of the game with the added variety that it will offer.

I keep thinking of getting rid of this but it goes down so well with my family and various other (non) gamers that I kind of have to keep it.

When guessing from among the pictures, this game feels more like Apples to Apples than Balderdash, which is a negative in my mind. The concept is intriguing, but during the game it all felt frustratingly random. The pictures do lend themselves to numerous interpretations, though, which makes about half the rounds entertaining.

Pros:
- this is maybe the only game I can play with my parents and grand parents and we all enjoy
- the art on the cards is just outstanding
- the game is simple and easy to teach.

Cons:
- I am not a fan of the scoring mechanism. Too feebly and drags you out of the game a little.
- it can suffer from analysis-paralysis.
- to be fair, it is that kind of game where winning does not matter much - so why such a convoluted scoring..

I've played 2 or 3 times at my FLGS' board game night and I really don't care for it. Clue-givers ultimately determine whether the game is fun or not, as the clues can range anywhere from obvious to inside-joke. Rules are mostly straightforward but I find the scoring to be annoying. Ultimately, I dislike any game that heavily favours players who have long-standing friendships/relationships and can simply reference in-jokes during play for an advantage.

This is one of those rare games that are totally original and fuel the imagination of all the players and yet the rules are brutally simple and can be explained in one or two minutes.

Great if you have a nice, creative crowd. Easy to get to the table with non-gamers. Plays fast, and you get some laughs. A keeper, though I think the game needs the expansions to keep it fresh, and it gets pricey quickly.

A good one to bring out for a group of non-gamers, and for more creative types.

Though, I've yet to find the magic, so to speak. It's never quite as good as I wish it could be.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
  The game starts with everyone having a hand of cards with interesting pictures on them.  The "active player" puts places a card face down and describes it briefly.  All of the other players try to choose a card to match that description.  Then the cards are shuffled and the "non-active" players secretly guess which picture was the "active player's."  The goal is to provide a description vague enough to allow multiple interpretations but still allow the players to guess the right card.
  This is a pretty quick party game.  It has never gone over half and hour.  It is extremely easy to teach, but better to play with those you know well.  The more experience a player is the tighter the games become, though this can never really be a competitive game.
  Players who have seen the cards before have a distinct advantage, this is easily remedied with a "practice game."  If a player gets a lead in the beginning of the game, they tend to stay there.  Players left behind, tend to not move much.  Also, this game is pretty terrible with anything less than four players.

I had high hopes for this on when I purchased it.  I really like the description as a story telling game.  This game I like very much and is fun with the kids.   It is more of a guessing game than a story game, but the abstract card art is very pretty.  
I could see that after a few plays with kids you may be able to guess the card the kids are describing if they do not pick up to obscure their descriptions.  None the less the game is good to play and I can see how the expansions would be needed reasonably soon to increase the options.

Very fun game. This game works like Apples to Apples, only we find it to be much more interesting. The cards are all art.  In the game, one person will take a card and come up with a caption to match the art, and the other players each come up with a card that is a lot like the main card. Then the person who made up the caption collects all the cards and puts the cards out, each under one number in 1-6. Then the other players each vote on which one they think the real one is.

Excellent party game for all ages. One player describes the picture on one of his cards, each other player selects one of their cards that may possibly fit the description, all these cards are layed out and the other players try to identify the original card.

DIXIT

Great game for non-gamers or non-serious gamers.  Personally, I found that it moved a little slow, and the scorekeeping is a bit confusing.  But great game none-the-less, everyone I know enjoys it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Quite good in its category. The gameplay is a pleasant experience, the winning isn't so important. The strategy is always the same. As the storyteller you should make up something that a few (one would be the best) players will guess (if all or nobody guesses it's not good, because the storyteller gets no points). When you are not the storyteller, just put a card that best mathes what the storyteller said. The rest (how many points players will get) depends strongly on the cards you get and on guessing of other players.
So it's rather a social experience than a serious game. And you shouldn't play Dixit too often. Otherwise you will soon be fed up.

Muy original y bonito. Creo que se merece los premios que se ha llevado. Un party-game perfecto para 5-6 jugadores. 
Tiene varias pegas a mi parecer: Para 3-4 jugadores pierde gracia y que requiere de home-rules para que tras varias partidas no haya "grupichis" con términos clave para diferenciar las cartas. 
Si vienen amigos no-jugones a casa y lo sacas, triunfas.

the mechanics is not complex, the components are not the best. It doesn't matter at all, because it's Dixit-- the king of the party game. No matter where we go for picnic, this is always in my luggage. Disadvantage? maybe not replayable after players remember all the pictures shown on cards

Fantastic Game! The artwork is beautiful and the game mechanics are simple and fun to play. The scoring can be a little hard to grasp at first but comes easier after a couple plays. My only gripe is that the packing/box is a little over-sized for the contents of the game. EXPANSIONS: Dixit 2.

Bought April 2011. Always good for a laugh (even though my wife and brother-in-law can't help themselves from using obscure 80s cultural references that pretty much guarantee them the win), and the surreal and sometimes frightening illustrations on the gorgeous giant cards are sublime.

A game that you can enjoy equally with children, families, casual and hardcore gamers.

Dixit is kind of like a cross between Apples to Apples (meh) and Thingamajig (woot!), but the target you're trying to match is an image instead of a word.

The fantastical, childlike art is the key to the game's success. It stimulates the imagination, and is sufficiently ambiguous to offer several possible approaches for the sentence clues.

I bought this game for my sister and brother-in-law, and they keep telling me how huge a hit it has been with all their different groups of friends (some of which are avid game players, but not all). Personally, I've only played it once so far. I enjoyed the experience, and would like to play more.

Rating is likely to rise.

[UPDATE] I did bump my rating up a point. Personally, there are a bunch of party games I'd rather play than Dixit (although I do enjoy it). But Dixit has an amazing success rate with all sorts of mixed groups, and it always seems to stimulate interesting conversation.

RATING: 6
I love the simplicity of this game and it's quirky art style.
It's French!  And it shows, but in a good way.

Playing it get's people interested in trying to discern how you think, and how best to connect the images on the cards to shared experiences you've had. It is at once, the best and worst thing about the game. 
If you play with people you don't know, then you can't possibly understand their weird little references, unless they are being totally obvious, which this game punishes. If, however, you play with someone you know very well, then you two will likely dominate the game and leave other players feeling left out. 
It's a great game for the RIGHT GROUP, but otherwise, it may fall flat.
I'd recommend picking up one or two expansions, just so you have more cards. 
After you've seen the one with a living purse, complete with teeth and googly eyes, regurgitating it's contents on the floor in gleeful delight- well, you just can't un-see that. It also doesn't help that the images tend to stick in your mind, and after a few plays, the game can grow stale with the same group playing.

Totalmente recomendado.

Every time I play Dixit it's just a ton of fun. It's pretty, easy to teach and creates hilarious moments. Despite the fact that the game keeps score, winning is completely unimportant to me. I've never had this much fun losing in a board game.

I've played Dixit with various people and it's been a big success every time. Not a game I play often or multiple times in a row. But when I do bring it out I never regret it for a moment.

Sometimes difficult to get the creativity going.  Interesting decisions to be made regarding "good" cards. You might have a card that you were really wanting to use during your turn, but if it could match someone else's description very well, do you play it now and hope other people vote for it?  Or do you keep it until your own turn?

Great game. I'm actually pretty terrible at it, but it seems to inspire pretty much everyone who plays, and it's always interesting to see how your friends' minds work. I suppose it goes down well with most players because it's a particularly social game (it's about second-guessing your friends' imaginations, then seeing if you were right), and it also fires the players' creative sides, which are two itches that many games don't scratch.

There are tons of people who HATE games who will LOVE playing this, and if you bring your thinking caps there's really nothing like a round of Dixit.

If you keep score, don't use the scoring track in the box; poker chips or spare change is much better.  And don't limit yourselves to 6 players--just have everyone use 8-, 10-, 12-, or 20-sided dice to indicate their choices if you have a huge group.

I'll play it when it comes out. Quick, easy game that tends to stay pretty tame for a party game. Beautiful art work that inspires a wide range of reactions from different players. I've played it around six times. Still fun, light game.

I don't like to do this, but Mysterium has knocked dixit down a peg for me.

RATING: 4.5
Really nice cards and a nice idea of associating vague descriptions make a boring game. The huge problem is that the idea is enforced with a terribly simple scoring mechanism that is heavily dependent on the number of players. Another big problem is that the initial impact of the nice game idea turns out to be unbelievably ephemeral. The first couple of rounds of my first game I thought "what a nice idea", but before the end of the first play I was already bored with the way it was executed. This one became "Spiel des Jahres 2010" for the potential of an idea that is just not fleshed out.

Decided to try Dixit after hearing the Party Game Cast rave about it on Dice Tower Showdown. My wife and I stopped in at the Adventurer's Guild in Harrisburg on our anniversary and bought it in 2014. 

We like it and wound up buying a copy for my sister and her family as a gift as well.

As far as party games go, this is fine. I like the way that the scoring system forces the player giving a clue to be not too obvious nor too vague. But it's still a party game and very dependent on the group. With particularly creative people, it can be more interesting. But with most groups, I can't imagine playing this repeatedly. The artworks serves its purpose, but I don't find it very appealing.

after 2 back to back plays. A six rating to me is still a decent rating. It’s a game I feel I’ll enjoy from time to time. However, it’s just not a ‘style’ of game I really enjoy that often. I would, however, recommend any person that really enjoy ‘party style’ games to try this one out. Some have said there aren’t enough cards in it for ‘replay’ value. But, I think the images are interesting enough to have some ‘replay’ in them.

RATING: 10
Ezért szeretem: még a legelső társasjátékok között próbáltam ki és azonnal megfogott (gondolom sok embernél az első játékaik mindig is közel állnak a szívükhöz). Szeretem az asszociációs játékokat és a nyuszibábuk is szimpatikusak voltak. Több órán át játszottunk, mégsem untam meg (ebben szerepe volt játékostársaimnak is). Nem volt kérdés, hogy magunknak is beszerzem. Könnyű tanítani, fiataltól az idősig megmozgatja az emberek fantáziáját. Gyors játékmenet, így akinek nem tetszik, „fájdalom” nélkül ki tud szállni az első játék után. Mind bevezető, mind levezető játéknak ideális. Mindenképpen játszunk több fordulót, mert az elsőben még csikoroghatnak az agyban a „fogaskerekek”.
Kinek ajánlanám: nem tudok olyat mondani, akinek nem ajánlanám. Viszont nem is erőltetném senkire.
A kiegészítőkről: ugyanannak a csapatnak több játék után már nehéz újat mondani, mesélni. Ezen szerencsésen segítenek a kiegészítők, beszerzésük ajánlott. Ha van idő, kedv és kreativitás, saját pakli is készíthető pl.: mesékből gyerekeknek, festményekből, …
Házi szabályok: ha a játék egy adott téma köré épül fel pl.: karácsony, Lovecraft, fantasy, … megnehezíti a játékot, de ugyanennyit javulni is tud a játékélmény, néha sírva röhögés a kényszer szülte megoldásokon. Ugyanez igaz, ha csak énekelni, mutogatni, vagy rajzolni lehet Activity módra.

Yera, Regalo de D.A 2015

Con expansiones. tengo que mirar cuales exactamente. 

Es un juego de deduccion con cartas de dibujo abstracto. hay que adivinar la que ha puesto cada jugador siguiendo una tematica, pero añadiendo una carta propia intentando confundir a los otros jugadores para que elijan la nuestra y no la del jugador que propuso la tematica. 

es un juego ideal para gente muy imaginativa (tal vez hasta demasiado xD) y sobre todo para todo tipo de publico. ideal para jugar con niños. ademas, es muy rejugable. 

Para ciertos tipos de jugadores algo introspectivos y poco dados a la onirica puede ser un juego complicado. lo jugaran pero no lo buscaran con asiduidad y tenderan a quedarse atras en la clasificacion de la partida mas pronto que tarde. 

Un buen detalle del juego es que regula su duracion lo justo para no hacerse excesivamente pesado. 80 cartas para 4 jugadores son 20 rondas y ya queda en el limite de empezar a hacerse demasiado largo. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
As a game, it is a little less robust than Attribute (which in my mind is its closest competitor). Specifically, it can reward a player making an in-joke or reference when they know only one other person is familiar with it. So, very similar, but inferior, to Attribute.

I remember the first time ever I played this it was so much fun. We had good laughs at how people interpret things and the references that some people are aware of and some are not and I learn a few new things from people either it be their personality or new vocabularies. But after you play it a few times it's not as fun but still good to have in collection because its a very easy game to get into and teach a new player. I think the other Dixit has nicer artwork on the cards as well, but that might just be me.

What a beautiful game! The illustrations are wonderful and I really like the gameplay as well. It was described to me as Barbarossa meets Apples to Apples and that's pretty accurate. I'd prefer this to either one of those though. Very accessible and fun. I'm not sure of the replayability, because it would be tempting to use the same clues you have before. In a game where you see every card each game, this seems it could be problematic. Even so, I'm withholding judgement on that aspect for the time being.

A very entertaining and subtle game that offers players rather unusual challenges. The game forces you to think sideways.

Dixit is the penultimate family and friends game of clever deduction and creative response. In other words, this is the game that Apples to Apples wanted to be (or Cards Against Humanity, it's 'older' and cruder sibling) in that there is actually a scoring mechanic that keeps everyone involved the whole way through.

In my opinion, it's accessible enough for usual non-gamers to jump in while also being gamey enough to provide enough incentive for everyone but all-too-serious gamers to play.

Also, the art is beautiful and provides many different possibilities for title-jamming.

Fun as a party game, and it has been popular towards the end of a long gaming night, after finishing the heavier games. You learn the game in a couple of minutes, and it challenges your creativity and imagination - a welcome departure from the heavier economic games and Train games we usually play. You have to play this for the pure fun of it -

I previously rated this game as a 2... but I've changed that decision to a 7. What changed? Mainly the way my group and I were playing it. We tried to game the situation by telling the "story" that would provide the most points.

It kept getting requested, and I then realized that the game is actually about telling the story, that the pure enjoyment comes from telling the story, and the points or who wins does not nearly matter as much.

Once you can tell a cohesive story that's actually a minute long, and you can really role-play it out in a narrative manner like some sort of open reading book club, the game becomes exciting for everyone. Even when I started making really detailed stories though, some people didn't bother and still didn't see the game my way (sucks for them). They continued to make stories that suck.

Dixit. Your mileage may vary on this one, and it ultimately depends on the players, not the game.

I give it a 7, because some players suck at this game.

First play with a bunch of teenagers today, and thi sone worked really well.

While a player not have a terrific card in their hand, they can still take adavntage of a turn by identifying the storyteller's card.

The artwork is nice, if slightly odd, and I really liked the oversize cards.  Bunny scoring markers a bit tipsy, but otherwise high marks on presentation and play.

Starting this at a 7 with potential to rise.

I don't think there is enough to raise this far above other voting games like Faces in terms of gameplay. The card art is wonderful but there is a potential problem with repeated play bringing out similar descriptions. It is quick and streamlined though and a pleasant filler.

Dixit is the go to game when in mixed company and the fact that the rest of the cards from the other expansions are misxed in just adds to the fun. 
Don't overplay the game though, it get's stale when you have to think up a new description for the same card.

PL: Nie rozumiem fenomenu tej gry, jej zasad, i kto decyduje czy skojarzenie było ok, czy nie. Przy dość przejrzystych hasłach, gracze są w stanie bez problemu wybrać moją kartę. Przy mniej oczywistych istnieje szansa, że nie zrozumieją o co mi chodziło. Nie sprawiła mi przyjemności, rozgrzała moje zwoje mózgowe do czerwoności, powodując dymienie z uszu. Raczej nie polecam.

EN: I do not understand the phenomenon of the game, its rules, and who decides whether the association was ok or not. With quite clear associations, players are able to easily point at my card. With less obvious there is a chance that you will not understand what I meant. Playing it was far from pleasuring, it warmed my brain to red coils, causing the smoke from my ears. I would not recommend, and I wish I won't play it again.

After one play I love this game. That said I was shocked that it caused a lot of AP early on. I'd give it a 10 if it wasn't for the AP. the good news is after people play the game a bit they AP less and less. Some players take to it right away though, so each group may vary.

Decent game, despite the distinctly un-original mechanism (Der wahre Walter used the same scoring system 20 years earlier and is infinitely better, of course). The worst part of it is the severe shortage of cards and the ensuing repetition.
Another shortcoming of this game is the strange absence of laughing. There is a lot of wonder and all, but laughter? Rarely. 
That said, the pictures are spectacular and original. Play with many people, please.

Boring people kill this game, causing it to slump and die of ennui.  Only sideways-thinking, risk-taking entertainers need apply.

This is a cool game that I won at Geekway to the West. It plays like a mixture of Apples to Apples and Balderdash; however, the cards have abstract images rather than words or phrases.

This game is really great if you have creative friends. I can see this being a blast, but I wonder if it starts to lose replay value once you've seen the cards a few times.

Played this with a group of essentially strangers and it went over surprisingly well. At first the clues were fairly straightforward but they eventually became more and more intricate. Everyone had a surprising amount of fun with this.

RATING: 6.5
Bought as a family game for Christmas.  Played once and it worked, but I was underwhelmed.  We are big Balderdash fans and it was a bit like playing that but with far fewer opportunities for humour.  It's almost like an attempt to "euroise" balderdash by removing the need for language and writing!  The artwork is nice.

One other personal opinion: I wouldn't waste valuable "geek" gaming time playing this (or Balderdash) simply because I get far too little time to play "proper" games!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1.5
I think it's brilliant that it draws on people's creativity and abstract thinking and there is near to no luck in it which appeals to me personally a lot.  However, I found that playing with people from different cultural backgrounds or even when two individuals in the party know each other very well adds a significant degree of dis- or advantage to it that cannot be undone.

Therefore, I'm very glad and grateful I played this game but do not recommend it to anybody but board game parties that know each other all to a very similar degree - in that particular situation I can see this game to go off (like a house on fire).  In all other situation it has next to no replay value as the outcome is clear before the start (e.g. individuals that know each other and the game well will aways outplay others)!

Nagyszerű parti játék. Egyszerű ötletből, egyszerű játékmenet, mégis megfelelő társasággal nagyon jól tud működni. Ennek a játéknak a lényegét a társaság adja, maga a játék, illetve a kártyák a játékban csak a körítés, amit a társaság tagjainak mondásai, beszólásai töltenek ki. Szóval ha valakinek nem jön be a játék, nem a játék tehet, hanem a megfelelő társaság hiánya. 

Egy idő után persze unalmas, mert ha ugyanazok a kártyák kerülnek elő hajlamos az ember ugyanazt mondani róla. Ezen némileg segítenek az új kártyák.

I own most of the expansion. This is such a creative and family fun game. This game replaces both Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity for me.

As a sucker for themes, I had high hopes for Dixit. 

I can't say I loved it. The cards are beautiful, but they're memorized quickly. Unless you're with a group you know very well, you can't make the references that you want to. 

I'd be interested to know if the game is better with the expansions, but as is I think I'd only whip it out if we needed to mix things up after too many rounds of love letter or Tsuro.

UPDATE: I played Dixit with a friend who asked us each time why we chose the cards we chose. The game was MUCH more enjoyable when each player started explaining their choices in card and in clue. I'd recommend making this a house rule! It's a lot more fun that way.

This game gets played a lot at a party or while drinking.  It's very good for people who want light entertainment without trying to win.  It's easy to kick back, relax, and play a couple hands of Dixit.

There's also the side benefit that if you use the cards right, they will lead to someone getting sidetracked and telling a funny story from their personal life.  So it can be a good way to get to know friends-of-friends better.

A simple communicating game that involves describing a picture with sufficient ambiguity to leave doubt as to which picture from a group is the one referred to.

The art is GORGEOUS and bizarre.  I think it was probably worthwhile for the designer to design the game just so these cards could be published.  So that part is an absolute pleasure.

As for the game itself, it's one of those party games that requires you to figure out what other people are thinking, and I simply have no ability at such games.  It got a little frustrating when I was playing with this and kind of detracted from the art a little.  So I wanted to like it, and whoever is reading this, I think you will.  It's just that the ratings are supposed to measure my experience. (1 play)

A very fun, easy-to-pick-up game that's great for parties for anyone over the age of 5. Definitely pick up expansion cards. The one drawback is if you try to play a few times in a row, you'll start to run out of descriptors for cards you've seen multiple times. If you only pull this out of the closet every holiday or so, it's a great one.

When the kids go to bed, try a "Dirty Dixit" variation and give R-rated descriptions only. Very funny.

A great, great party (or any other time) game.  Has superficial similarities to Apples to Apples, but Dixit replaces the arbitrary nature of A2A with genuine creative skill.  Unique in the type of creative thinking it requires - even though there is no deep strategy, I still feel a great sense of accomplishment from coming up with a particularly good clue.  If I had to nitpick I would say that the scoring mechanism is problematic as it's easy to have a runaway leader, but scoring is almost beside the point in Dixit.  I can see this becoming a go-to party game in the future.

Stale enough that I don't want to play it, I guess. Traded away with all the accoutrements along with a bunch of other stuff for a pile of Warhammer: Invasion cards.

Kinda like Apples to Apples or CAH, but it's with Art instead of words. There's supposed to be storytelling involved but it depends on who you play with and sometimes the clues end up being short, but it's still fun.

The artwork is beautiful and really makes the game.

A relaxing, creative game with artwork that is absolutely gorgeous. Simple and easy to learn, but involves interaction with and interpretation of other players and not a lot of mechanics or strategy beyond that. I actually also find the 3 player variant to be quite interesting and fun, unlike most minimum player variants.

Great family/party game.  I am not much into party games, but this one fits the bill.  Ironically, this might have grown on me more recently after playing Mysterium.  Mysterium is only okay for me.

Poetic, fun, great playability for EVERYBODY. International players can play it together, experienced board game geeks and non-players, younger children and older people. Its a fantastic game I always love to come back to. After many many plays with the same group you need an expension for more cards though. Otherwise your association will stick to some certain cards.

Update: Downgraded after many plays and after playing Mysterium, which is just the better Dixit. More communication, coop, a theme behind the mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
You have to give Dixit credit for inspiring Mysterium. Mysterium, however, is far superior in every measurable way. 

If you operate on the opposite side of the brain as all other players on the table, you will never, ever win this simplistic game, and become frustrated as you attempt to. Mysterium has identified all of Dixit's weaknesses and mitigated them brilliantly. Play it instead.

A wonderful abstract party game where knowing how the other players think is a great advantage.

Dixit is a card game consisting of many surreal illustrated cards. Players take turns being "it". The player who is "it" must choose a mystery card from their hand and describe it. The player may be as descriptive or vague as they wish. All other players secretly submit a card that matches the description as closely as possible. The cards are mixed and voted on. The goal is for the player who is "it" to get some but *not* all of the other players to vote for their card. The goal of all other players is to guess the right card while hoping that the other players guess the one that they submitted (for both will get them points). Then the play continues.

Much of the game's brilliance is in figuring out how to describe the wonderfully complex and surreal cards in such a way that not everyone will be able to guess. It helps to know those that you're playing with and how they think.

I love this game and look forward to getting other Dixit titles. I recommend it for game nights with family or good friends.

I bought this for my wife as she likes stories and creative games. We played 3-4 games with our friends (always in 4 player mode) and had a lot of fun. The trouble is that after couple of rounds, you learn which cards are there in the set and the games get easier the more you play it. Howver, if you buy some expansions or leave enough gap between games, it becomes again new and refreshing. We plan to use the cards in order to create creative stories with our daughter once she grows up a bit. I recommend this as a family game.

Dixit is barely a game, but offers the potential for a fun social experience. The heart of Dixit is the cards, which are attractively illustrated and carefully designed for their purpose. The rules included with Dixit are simple enough for a 6-year-old to understand, but somewhat frustrating for an experienced gamer like myself - when you vote for the storyteller's card then picking randomly will gain you an average of more than one point per turn. However, the official rules can easily be replaced by others of your own devising. The board is superfluous - Dixit should really have been published in a small box with just the cards and scoring markers.

RATING: 2
:thumbsup: fantastic illustrations

The optimal strategy is to either give a targeted inside-reference to a friend, or give a random clue that has nothing to do with the card you play, so that it's impossible for [i]all[/i] of your opponents to choose your card. To counter this, your opponents' best play is to do the same thing, effectively making Dixit completely broken or random. Is this strategy against the "spirit of the game?" I don't care. Any rules implemented to disable this strategy are unenforceable.

The cards in this game could be used for an interesting variant of Codenames: Pictures

The best of the "pick the best answer" party games ... because the answer is in the form of a visual image. A very creative game of pictures, unique from all others. To expand the game you just need more images ... and there are four expansions that have done just that. You don't need them all ... but if you like Dixit as much as everyone I know that has played this game ... I'd recommend the expansions ... and the promos. HIGHLY RECOMMEND:) TOP#2

Dixit is one of my favorite party games. It follows the Apples to Apples mechanic of having a rotating judge that chooses a phrase, sound or concept to get cards in response. The main difference of this game is it's absolute beauty. The art on the Dixit cards are beautiful and inspire creative ideas. This game always gets laughs from my family and gaming group. While this probably my 2nd favorite party game, it definitely sees the table more than any other party game I own.

RATING: 6
Funny to observe two kinds of people: these making simple connections between picture and description and those making non-obvious ones and/or requring knowledge of culture/word juggling abilities :-)

The mechanics resembles Barbarossa to some point (create something not too difficult and not too easy to guess).
All in all - fun and lots of laughter, but I've got some concerns about the replayability...

EDIT: I don't recommend 6-player mode --> too much of accident and luck.

SOLD (serious replayability issue).

RATING: 7
Dixit is a storytelling game about mimicry.  A "storyteller" gives a description about a picture, simultaneously trying to score points themselves while limiting the points other players earn.  The beautiful art and scoring conditions reward players for clever thinking and creative wordplay.  Dixit won't connect with everyone but those that do will never forget it.

I don't know, I love the card art obviously but it seems to me Balderdash, which this is based on, actually allows more a little creativity? (admittedly its been some time since I played BD) That doesn't necessarily make it the better game, but I did feel a little more confined in that regard, maybe it was just me that day though and/or the pictures I got.  

Overall it is basically Balderdash but with cards and a good gateway or family game for sure.

Can't believe this is ranked so much higher than Apples to Apples... which to me is what this game is a lighter version of an already light party game.  The artwork is so bland and generic that it's like reading a horoscope.

In Apples to Apples one really gets insight into your fellow players (assuming if you play like we do in that the persons who turn it is needs to think aloud when deciding which one to pick).

I love this game. It was the first modern board game I bought along with love letters and I don't regret it for a minute. The beauty of this game is its accessibility and the way it changes depending upon who you play it with. (I was totally thrashed by a group of 9 years old and under). The artwork is also absolutely stunning. Over time it begins to lose its novelty and many of the 'stories' begin to get repeated but expansions should help mitigate this. It can become somewhat repetitive if played persistently but the creativity and accessibility of this game makes it one of my go to gateway games and an all time favourite.

Played this game only once at a local gaming group. I really like the idea and how good this game works. Can't wait to play it more, but you need 4 players at least to have fun with this. Which is the only downside of this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A nearly perfect game - my possible only complaints are that the box does have compartments to separate the cards from the voting tokens, that the player pieces aren't more stable and that there aren't more of those beautiful cards.

The mechanics and scoring are so elegantly designed that it makes it nearly impossible to cheat (let people know which card is yours and get 0 points). Playing it multiple times, with the same people, just forces you to be more cryptic each time (maybe a downside for some).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This game is really fun to play with a diverse group of people, or people that don't know each other very well.  If everyone playing is very close they tend to have enough inside jokes/experiences to sway the game.  Still one of our favourite games to play.

AWESOME game. Once upon a time I though I wasn’t a party gamer and I thought all party games sucked (due to Apples to Apples that, incidentally, sucks big time). Enter Dixit to my life and what a game it is. It is perfect for gamers and non gamers, easy to teach, short play time and guaranteed fun.

Dixit is the game that made me a party gamer as well, without it I would have not played Time´s Up, Curses and so many other great games, it opened a new whole world for me. 

Try it and you won’t be disappointed. Great GREAT game.

Dixit was one of the first boardgames I ever played and today, almost 4 years later, I still love the game. I never say no to a game of Dixit and I always enjoy it. When I get around to do my list of favorite party games, I’m pretty sure Dixit will be in the top three.

Gorgeous art with high depth. Every time I play I notice new things on the cards. Fast playtime, easy to teach, lots of fun. Best with 6 players. It is a blast to see why the storyteller chose his card. Love that the game scoring is not subjective, otherwise I would hate the game. Everyone has fun even if they lost the game.

I don’t have anything bad to say about Dixit, perhaps that after a while some patterns begin to emerge so when you have the same card you think/say the same clues. To avoid this:

1. I Bought a lot of expansions (and will continue to buy everything they release for the game).

2. I play with categories (movies, boardgames, books, etc.) that keeps the game fresh.

Bottom line, a GREAT party game that will be always in my game collection. Most friends also like it.

One of 2008´s favorites.

Core mechanic is based on a little-known game called thingamajig where the goal was to get some but not all people to guess your secret word.  Here the goal is to get some but not all players to guess your card based on a clue you provide. The cards are amazingly creative.  Super fun family/party game. Easy to teach. Fun to play. Always different. Expansions continue to add tons of variety.

RATING: 7
Simple game in the Apples to Apples/Balderdash party vein where the players try to deduce/guess which card best matches the lead player's (hopefully) cryptic description. 

Although the strikingly beautiful art (could a game be any more French?) and clever scoring make it one of the best of its type, I suspect the game may become a little stale without regular refreshing of the card deck. Could be a licence to print more cards (and hence money) for the publisher, especially given its multiple prize winning status!

What really needs to be said about this game that other billions of reviews haven't covered already?

Admittedly, when I played this game out at first, I saw that our group struggled a little to grasp the concept that you want to be vague, yet not too abstract that nobody will pick yours. Sometimes we gave a clue so precise that it was way too obvious. But after many plays, we started to get into Dixit-mind, and treated it like a fun party game that it was.

There are moments where you don't even care about points, but just pick a funny card, and come up with funny clue to say to get the laughter. And this moment is when this game shines brightest. 

Yes, it felt like Apples to Apples, Cards against Humanity, or Say Anything, but Dixit's artwork is just unbeat-able. We were all stunned and discussed after we played cards, looking at arts. It constantly made us go, 'wow, look at this...how do you come up with this?'

This is a very solid party game for sure. And that cultivating abstract-mind was fantastic. However, it did take some time to click into that mind-set - and there maybe some people who will be turn off from this kind of game from being shy, or just cannot think of witty jokes. If so, I would shy away from this and go with Apples to Apples where answers are already given.

Dixit consists of a deck of cards featuring some very surreal artwork. Everyone is dealt a hand of six cards. One person starts out as the "storyteller" who picks one card out of their hand and says a sentence related to it. The sentence can be a word or two, a full sentence, a sound, a song line, a movie title - basically anything that can be spoken. Everyone picks a card out of their hand that they think also matches the sentence. The storyteller takes these cards without looking, shuffles them up and lays them out on the table. Players then vote on which card is the storyteller's. The storyteller gets points if some, but not all, players pick his card and other players get points for picking the storyteller's card or by having other players pick their card over the storyteller's. So basically, the sentence needs to be suggestive enough to have some people pick your card, but not all. Good table talk and a bit of creative thinking a good game makes.

Played first with 3 people (not very exciting), then again with 6 people. More people playing is definitely the better option. A charming and very light game with lovely cards. The imaginative nature of the game seems to draw in a lot of people. I brought it to a family reunion, and everyone wanted a chance to play it. Personally I didn't think it was as great as the awards and word of mouth led me to believe it is, but it is still a nice little party game.

A French party game. If that's not enough to get you interested I don't know what will.

Although very few rules, it's quite a tricky game. You have six cards in your hand, all with paintings on them.

One player is the story teller and says a word, phrase or sentence about a picture on one of his cards. The other players also each play a card based on what was said. The story teller does not get points if all or none of the other players guess the story teller's card, but the other players score 2. So the goal is to be vague when giving the description, but not too much. When only some players guess correctly they and the story teller get 3 points. Other players receiving guesses on their cards get 1 point. The art on the cards is very creative and allows for some fun and interesting descriptions.

Like new. 4/5. Really fun, inventive, social interaction game. Great fun and when it hits, it HITS. But it works best in groups where everyone knows eachother about as well as anyone else otherwise it can be gamed a bit easily. But for light, family-friendly fun that's a bit different it's great.

Maybe drinking makes this game better? Or perhaps it's just our uninspired group... In the few times we played it, there were one or two really innovative clues per game - but the majority of the time was spent waiting as people agonized over what would be a proper clue.

One of the best party games I've ever played. The concept is simple and the artwork is beautiful. My only complaints are that some people can get analysis paralysis on their turn (I try to get my players to think of clues when it isn't their turn to speed it up a bit) and the rabbit tokens are kinda hard to track / keep stable on the board. Apart from that, excellent game.

RATING: 7
A very unique game with very enjoyable artwork.  It's fairly similar to games like Apples to Apples, Attribute, Say Anything, but has a creative element similar to Cluzzle where you try to be not too obvious.  I like that you don't have to be really creative, like in Why Did the Chicken?, which I can't play at all, just a little.

This is prone to a little bit of abuse, such as using inside jokes or information that only a select person would know, so playing with spouses might irk some people that don't know what meal a husband and wife ate for their 3rd anniversary.

Also, the limited number of cards mean that you kind of have to keep trying to do different things.  An expansion would be good.  Bring on Dixit 2!

Įdomus žaidimas su labai originalia idėja: reikia pasitelkti savo meninę gyslelę, kad galėtum paaiškinti korteles. Todėl Dixit traukia tokius žaidėjus, kurie visiškai atsisako žaisti kitus žaidimus. Tai tiesiog šaunu.

Whenever any new people come around, Dixit is one to break out.  The rules are pretty simple and the game is more about the social experience of looking at these pictures together and analyzing who chose what.  But don't be fooled, there's a game here.  It's pretty much the perfect balance between being a party game and being a game that competitive people will appreciate.

Similar to the CAH play style but allows a greater range of audience and does not lose its "surprise" factor... however, it is much more fun with a creative bunch of people.

RATING: 7
The art is great, of course, and the game fixes one of the biggest flaws of Beyond Balderdash, that of having to feign ignorance of your own contributions even when the game is going well and people are laughing out loud at each other's spots of weirdness. There are also possible pitfalls and replayability concerns here: notably the game will break down if hints are given that target specific players (by referencing previous games, common experiences or common areas of knowledge). The social payload of Dixit lies in the reveal of the reasoning behind a tricky clue, and it remains to be seen if this can reach the same heights as a truly wacked-out explanation in BB; for now I'll happily play and find out.

I can't think of a more ideal party game than Dixit.  It prompts thoughtful conversation and uproarious laughter in equal parts.  The card are gorgeous, and the game is constructed so that there isn't a conflict between "best winning strategy" and "most fun strategy".

The only negative thing I can think of is that after one game, you've seen all the cards.  Fortunately, there are expansions, and also the illustrations are elaborate enough that the same card can be used in many, many different ways.

You better be good at subtle trickery (something Lindsay seemingly struggles with ;) ) to win at this game as you have to be able to describe a picture well enough for some people to recognize it but bad enough that not everyone will recognize it. If that didn't make any sense just trust us and buy the game. It's easy enough for anyone to pick up right away and a great family game over all. Do note that after playing it enough times you'll want the expansions. Lindsay and I already have most of the cards memorized.

I am not sure how I feel about Dixit.  I thought it would go over very well with the family, but it fell really flat.  Even my wife didn't like it, which surprised me.   

It reminds me a lot of Apples to Apples.  There is more thought and strategy in Dixit than A2A, which you would think would make it better but it makes it less fun.  In other words, I feel like Dixit is a party game trying to mask itself as a strategy game.  If you play A2A, you know it's just a party game and you don't worry about trying to have a strategy you just play to fun (not caring if you win or lose).

Fab, original game. Outstanding artwork too. The only reason it doesn't score higher is that it really matters WHO you play it with. Not everyone is going to enjoy it, as it's easy to get a bit cliquey with your friends and forget that not everyone has the same cultural references. Still, I always enjoy it and love playing it with good friends.

Absolutely enchanting! There are very, very few party games I enjoy or games that are this light, but this is a winner!

This game is simply gorgeous. The art is delightful--whimsical, dream-like, surreal, vibrant, and charmingly amateur (in a good way--it has child-like wonder and expressiveness that really goes well with the simplified figures and forms). They are abstract-ish enough that a good many "stories" could be told based on their imagery.

The scoring is simple here but nicely considered. In similar games (like Apples to Apples, or Loaded Questions), play often degenerates into senselessness when players begin to match the oddest things or make up answers quite unlike what they may normally say to "sabotage" each other. In Dixit, you can neither be too abstract nor too specific; all or no votes for your story, phrase, or word results in 0 points, forcing you to strike a nice balance.

As someone in a creative industry, I really appreciate this game. That said, you need the appropriate people to enjoy this one, people with imagination and adequate articulation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An OK Game. Thought it would be similar to RPing but it's different. I'll bring it out to play since others seem to enjoy it. Still need to find a way behind the scoring mechanism. I'm not really a fan of the idea where people target one player with a specific clue that others won't be able to grasp.

Ez egészen egyszerűen zseniális asszociációs játék. Nagyon átgondolt a mechanikája, és ügyesen ki van egyensúlyozva a túl egyértelmű, vagy az oda nem illő megfogalmazások pontozása. Jó, hogy bármelyik körben szerezhetsz pontot, nem csak akkor, amikor a mesélő vagy, a képek pedig eszméletlenül gondolatébresztőek. 5 fővel nagyon jól működik a játékmenet, mert ennyi lekerülő lappal már össze lehet zavarni egymást, mégsem nyúlik túl hosszúra a játékidő.
Anettet teljesen elvarázsolta a Dixit. :) Találtam variációkat két főre is, van [thread=676496]kooperatív[/thread] is, meg van [thread=523447]versengő[/thread] is. Szkeptikus vagyok, de egy próbát mind a kettő megér. :)

A derivative blend of Balderdash and Apples to Apples, but using pictures rather than words. This actually worked better than I expected it to, but I think replayability is very low. You basically go through all of the pictures every time you play, and even the first time through it can be hard to come up with phrases for them.

This game depends on your play group. The best way to play is to play with witty people and state that clues are only a word or a small group of vague words. With the right group I rate it 9. Otherwise, 7.

This is a mind reading game finding out which one was the card the current player picked. The illustration on each card looks like telling us some sort of mystic and curious stories. It is great fun to see how people interpret the same illustration in different ways but yet sometimes they think the exactly the same thing. This is a great family game that can be played by any one for any occasion.

RATING: 5
Includes the Expansions:
Dixit 2 (Asmodee English edition) (2011)

Dixit is a family game of deduction and surreal imagery. The cards are large and beautifully done, with vibrant colors and fascinatingly evocative paintings on them. Gameplay is more relaxed and slow, because player interaction only takes place in each player's head as they try to figure out which card was played by the storyteller. Keeping score is a bit of a chore, because everyone has a chance to score points on every turn. I hoped it would be a worthy addition to family game night, but I have a major gripe with the gameplay, which seems to depend more upon "insider knowledge" than skillful play. This is a deal-breaker, because shared associations can be played to, completely unbalancing the game. Also, having the score track as a part of the game box is just bad design. This is a card game, after all; I shouldn't have to keep the box on the table while I play. Overall, I had high hopes for it because of the gorgeous art, but Dixit was a disappointment for me.

The comparison of this game to "Apples to Apples" is not appropriate.  In apples to apples, the "storyteller" arbitrarily decides upon a "winner".  In this game, there is no one judge, each player does the best and the score is determined objectively.  That is all the difference in the world.

Dixit is a great party game were the key skills are creativity and deduction. The game is fun, original and extremely easy to teach, so if you want a different party game that requires a reduced number of players this might be it.

Each round a player comes up with a phrase and, secretly, selects one of the beautifully illustrated cards. Then the rest of the players also add a card each, face down, and they are shuffled all together. The objective is to guess which card was picked by the first player. You get points for guessing correctly, and also for each player that you managed to bluff with your card.

I know a lot of people who have tried it and they all enjoyed it, with varying degrees of success (some actively ask to play it, others just do not mind when it hits the table). If you are looking for a party game and this one has caught your eye you should undoubtedly give it a try.

RATING: 8
A fun game in the vein of Apples to Apples or Balderdash, but with pictures. Players take turns picking a word or phrase that fits one of their cards, and then other players play cards they think fit the word or phrase in the hopes of gathering votes for their choice while trying to find the active player's card in the mix. The artwork on the cards is whimsical and fun, and the cards are a nice large size that are great to hold and to view said artwork. The box comes with room to fit three expansions in addition to the original cards, board, and tokens. The score tracking board has more artwork in addition to a brief run-down of scoring as a helpful reminder, with numbers along one side to line up cards for voting. The score tokens are nice wooden bunnies, while the voting tokens are a thick chipboard color-matched to the score tokens. Overall the game is well-designed and replayable, especially once you add in expansion sets for more art options.

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Dixit:[/b][/size]
- I dislike the group consensus mechanic in games
- I think that the game lacks meaningful decisions. The best choice is often obvious so the game is primarily revolved around random card draws. 
- The game can be flawed if outside of the game clues are used. Such clues are akin to texting a player the answer  while the other players fall behind

for seasoned boardgamers Dixit is something of a curiosity - but not in a negative sense. this game requires out-of-the-box thinking, which is excellent, however not every gaming group is suitable for this kind of play. works best with people, who have a lot of common associations. on the downside, there's a limited number of cards, so after several plays, it's hard to come up with new interesting ideas. but artwork is brilliant!

The replayability is fine with the expansions as long as you play with different people. with the same group it can become a little strange in that the clues can be re-used or based on previous games, this is kind of interesting though maybe not what the game should be!

Great game though, and one that can be played with all kinds of people.

Dixit is Apples to Apples made worse. I hate Apples to Apples for its complete arbitrariness; the way players with a mental "link" can throw the game; how turns don't build upon each other, so there's zero strategy. Dixit takes all those bad elements from Apples to Apples and makes it worse by replacing the words with pictures. These are TERRIBLE pictures. They're nice fantasy drawings, but in terms of actually inspiring clues, they're nonstarters. I've played this once with three other people and my spouse and I both found it miserable.

Everyone I've played with enjoys this game, even the occasional "I don't really like boardgames" player.  Easy to start even with those unfamiliar with the game.  Rules of play are simple to understand, although scoring is just slightly tricky for new players to pick up.  All players stay engaged with the game full time, regardless of whose turn it is.  Not much strategy to this one, and there's no backstabbing, or screwing anyone over, even though it's a competitive game.  No one seems to care too much who wins; it's just a fun game.

Like "Apples to Apples with pictures," sure, but it is made more interesting partly because of the scoring - you need your clues to be understood enough for one person to guess your card, but not so easy that everyone guesses your card. The scoring also prevents the descent into complete random absurdity that Apples to Apples devolves into (which may seem surprising given Dixit's Surrealist art, but nonetheless true).  The artwork is great, and often bizarre, and conversation is likely to revolve around some of the interesting cards.

All that said, I've gotten burnt out on the game.

The whimsical imagery really attracts a lot of players, but it can take some players a little while to figure out the right amount of obscurity to use in clues and card choice.  It can take a while to get a six-player game finished, but you can get a lot of extra entertainment discussing the reasoning behind each player's choices.

One player is the storyteller for the turn and looks at the images on the 6 cards in her hand. From one of these, she makes up a sentence and says it out loud (without showing the card to the other players).

Each other player selects the card in their hands which best matches the sentence and gives the selected card to the storyteller, without showing it to the others.

The storyteller shuffles her card with all the received cards. All pictures are shown face up and every player has to bet upon which picture was the storyteller's.

My biggest issue with this game was the scoring track with the oversized rabbits (surreal is good, but this track did not work really well); it works now in the second edition (although it's a bit less surreal now). Otherwise a great and unique game with beautiful strange pics and using very special parts of my brain.
And now that Dixit 2 is coming you can't even say you can learn the cards that easily.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Utilize elaborate riddles; forbid lazy one-word clues!

An excellent mind game with fantastic, surreal art. Very light, but very psychological—you must utilize the correct dose of subtlety, and think like the other players to win.

Not at all similar to most of the other card-voting party games that people compare it to, because those games don't require creativity, subtlety, or . . . well, much of anything. You're just setting down a card with a word on it, hoping that the active player will find it relevant or funny. Dixit often involves getting into the minds of ALL the other players at once, and finding new and innovative ways to interpret the details within the artwork. And while similar-ish games can be quite funny, playing Dixit with a clever group has made me laugh out loud way more often than, say, Apples to Apples has. So even that aspect of other card-voting games often falls short in comparison.

My favorite house rule for Dixit is to prohibit one-word/one-entity clues. Such clues are typically lazy or unimaginative. Obscure and esoteric riddles, stories, analogies, allusions, etc. are infinitely more fun and interesting. And there's a lot more room for a strategy there (more ways to shape your clues so that they're only understood by the people in last place, thus undermining your biggest competition while scoring maximum points). Of course, that's if you're trying to win. The game can also be fun when you're not really trying to win.

I don't enjoy this much, as I feel it doesn't allow as much expression as other games of the type, and that is the only element about it that I enjoy.

The cards are too constricting. I find language games allow much more freedom of expression. Here the art dominates too much. It's an interpretive game rather than an expressive one for the most part, and I don't really care about that.

Love this game, the group decides the level of the game.

More of actual game than "Apples to Apples" but still more of a social activity than a real game.  It's very well though and done, the art is awesome, it's playable at family reunions with literally everyone old and young.  It gets particularly enjoyable if you have a few good storytellers in the game.  It's a poor parallel, but I'd liken it to playing charades without the miming awkwardness.  Dixit is it's own thing, but certainly not a board game in the traditional sense.

Now this is what Apples to Apples should be. A game that plays with your imagination, and involves more than just a word on a card. The illustrations are really one of the best aspects of the game, and finding an interesting line to go with it is most of the fun of the game. Not really my type of game, but if someone wanted to play Dixit I wouldn't want to stab my eyes out with a spoon which is what I feel like when someone suggests we play Apples to Apples.

I like using my imagination. Maybe that's why solo gaming is so fun to me even though some people don't understand the beauty of it. Using my imagination is exactly the reason I like Dixit so much as well. There's not much game to it, but as people say the experience is more important than the game itself. Some people do find it boring though. Great game to play with your partner!

Alle Spieler erhalten Karten mit wunderschönen Illustrationen (meist sehr abstrus). Wer an der Reihe ist legt eine seiner Handkarten in die Mitte und sagt etwas dazu. Alle anderen Spieler legen nun ihrerseits eine in die Mitte, die zum gesagten passt. -> Mischen aufdecken -> alle Spieler raten welche Karte vom aktiven Spieler kommt. Danach gibts Punkte je nachdem wie gut geraten wurde.
Ich hatte mich anfangs "geweigert" das Spiel zu spielen. Nachdem ich aber alle Spiele mindestens einmal mitspielen muss, bevor ich sage, dass es schrott ist, habe ich mich weichklopfen lassen (damals). Heute spiele ich Dixit sehr sehr gerne. Ein tolles Spiel, das die Phantasie anregt und ich habe auch festgestellt, dass ich gar nicht mal so schlecht darin bin die Anderen einzuschätzen (gut, selbst Begriffe ausdenken... aber im einschätzen der anderen...).
An einem Spiel bis 30 Punkte bekommt man aber auch den Kartenstapel des Grundspiels tatsächlich durchgespielt. Wenn man es öfter spielt, sind schon fasst Begriffe zu den einzelnen Karten fest eingebrannt... Da lohnt sich die ein oder andere Erweiterung tatsächlich mal :).

Good to play with creative people and with kids.  Obviously it's a party game, but it's even kind of less cerebral than other party games that I like.  It's really just about figuring out what other people will notice and what they won't.  I do enjoy this game a fair amount, especially because the artwork puts it over the top.  It's super interesting and fun to talk about and whimsically-styled.

The one downside is that, you're trying to be clever, but in this game it doesn't pay to be the most clever.  Actually, if you're too clever, no one will get what you were trying to hint at, and you will get no points that round, and everyone else will give points.  So you really have to dumb down your hints to make sure that some people get it.

But it's still a good game for practicing your people-intelligence.  Sure, that can be a word.

Also, this is my wife's favorite game, so that helps a lot.

This game reminds me of the Eurovision song contest - strange images are put in front of you, a long process of deliberation and then predictably a member who belongs to the largest bloc of voters, in this case families or close friends rather than ex--Soviet or Nordic blocs, wins.

The only upside is that it plays quicker than the Eurovision song contest, is unlikely to bankrupt you or draw attention to your civil rights record.

Despite that I generally don't like party games, this one has great art, a good scoring mechanic, and if not gamed (e.g. my roommate wants only 1 person to choose the right card, so he gives an obscure Pokemon-related clue that he knows only I'll get) the strange art makes for some interesting interpretations. I would recommend getting an expansion though, as otherwise you will basically run through the deck every game. 

EDIT: It seems like it is really difficult to find a group where there isn't at least one person who specifically says something obscure that they know exactly one person knows just to get points. Since there doesn't seem any easy way to counteract this with the given mechanisms, I am dinging this game's rating.

My favorite card is the sad snowman. I actually made it my background for a while. I have a great picture of my dad imitating it after a pitcher of margaritas. That was a fun night.

In this game, everyone has abstract paintings in their hand that you want people to guess. Basically, one person gives a phrase that fits their card, everyone puts in a card that fits the phrase, and then you guess which card was the original phrase giver's card. If everyone or no one gets it, everyone but the phrase giver gets points. Otherwise, everyone that guessed it and the giver get points. You also get points for everyone that guessed yours. It's basically Balderdash for abstract pictures.

A bizarre game. It's odd how everyone is constantly on the look out for the party game that is still a gamer's game. I'm not sure Dixit is quite it yet. There is no real strategy; instead, you are supposed to be sold on the experience of developing and manipulating short stories with pictures. The game can be brilliant or it can fall flat. It depends on the group, and even with a good group, it can depend on the round. The game also goes very quickly, probably too quickly. A game like Dixit needs to be played like Poker to a certain extent, but lacking the length of Poker, the game has no chance to normalize.

Magical at first, but somehow completely non-replayable. After you've seen all the card art a lot of the magic is gone, and the rules don't make for a strong enough game for multiple plays. Instead it starts to drag and feel pointless.

The scoring is a bit odd but drives the entire game; with your clue, you are trying to have an inside reference that only one other player will get. If you know each other, this is electric, if you don't it is a bit dull and random.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun party game.  Best with 5-6 players. Much better than apples to apples.  The scoring gives guessers the incentive to guess correctly and put up the card that matches the clue the best.  The clue giver wants 1 or more to guess it without everyone guessing it.

I can see how it'd get dull if you played with the same bunch of people all the time.  But still, for me, every time I play, it's like being slightly drunk... the feeling is fizzy and giddy.  A rich and wonderful game.  Good pick, SdJ gang.

RATING: 8
There's nothing new mechanically about this game; basically it's just BALDERDASH with pictures. But playing it is an absolutely novel experience. The key is the way that the card art both encourages and seems to resist simpleminded paraphrase. I was worried that some less literary types amongst my gaming buddies might get left behind when it came to describing the pictures with the required subtlety, or guessing from amongst each row of pictures which one best fit a given description. But that didn't end up happening at all - all of our games were amazingly close, and everybody goofed up funnily a few times and had a few startling insights. Few games make you feel that their inventors have tapped into some hitherto ignored aspect of human nature - this one really did for me.

This is basically apples to apples with pictures.  The artwork is very unique.  I do like the scoring better than apples to apples.  I have played this a couple of times and I am not really that enamored with it but it is ok for non-gamers.  Over repeated plays it does need expansions.

Played once.

Fun with the right group.  Lends itself to inside references for competitively-minded individuals.  Highly abstract nature can stymie and frustrate some folks.  Not a good choice when you've only got one regular gaming partner.

Willing to play again, with the right group.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

Only played with people who played this as a 'regular' game, which made it about getting points instead of telling stories. I think this can be a good game, if played with people who are more interested in the stories around the cards than the actual game itself.

RATING: 7
I enjoy this game but it's a creativity game, so it's not always fun unless you play with the right people. 

Pros: The artwork is beautiful.

Cons: It's voting based, which isn't a strong core mechanic (in my opinion). Sometimes you won't have a suitable card to play so you just discard a card.

Some reviewers have suggested that the small number of cards gives thisgame a short life - this is false. As players become more familiar with the cards, it becomes harder to come up with clues that are neither too easy nor too hard. This makes for a game gets genuinely more challenging with time - which I find refreshing.

This game has gorgeous components and artwork, to the extent that I think the publisher could make a tidy profit selling posters of the artwork.

Игра-шедевр. Игра-выход за рамки стереотипов.
Впервые узнав о Диксит, я было подумал, что это будет интересная и незамысловатая семейная игра.
После первой партии я хотел выкинуть ее подальше и забыть.
Потом, силой случая, довелось сыграти в абсолютно незнакомой компании. Это перевернуло мое отношение на диаметрально противоположное.
Эта игра, как и многие, заставляет анализировать. Только не сложившуюся на столе игровую ситуацию, а себя и других людей. Смотришь на картинки и думаешь ЧТО мог загадать ЭТОТ человек? Смотришь на свои карты, а в голове роятся совершенно непредсказуемые мысли.
Если Вы хотите понять насколько хорошо знаете своих друзей или родных - сыграйте с ними в Диксит.

Great game, one that is guaranteed to tickle your imagination and mind in many ways. Best played with a group of creative people, lest it devolve into a game of clues, but a wonderful effort by the creators, from the concept to the art. Not one to pull out with a group of strangers at your local meet up, but a wonderful, time with family and friends. 

Edit: I think this game is quick to be worn out, especially if you play it a lot in succession. I think that it's still pretty good, but it suffers depending on the game group.

RATING: 9.5
A game that is simple, yet can be as deep as you want to make it. Perfect. You can get a lot out of each card, and while 84 cards in the base set is a lot, people will feel like the whole deck gets cycled through too much. So you will want to get an expansion quick. The only way I see people not liking this game is if they really don't care about art, or guessing games, but personally this is such a fun game that changes depending who you are playing with. I think every collection should have a copy. I haven't gotten bored with this game yet.

RATING: 8
Everyone knows Dixit don't they? From a set of about 84 family friendly Dali/Magritte/de Chirico - like picture cards you each have a 6 card hand. Taking turns as the lead player, you associate a phrase with one of the cards in your hand. All other players pick a card that matches the theme from their hand. All cards played blindly in the middle, shuffled and then all non-lead players vote on which card they think the lead player played. Points are won by a couple of different rules on who voted for what, and if you can convince the other players that your card was played by the lead player.

It's a great family game and one of our favourites, but two caveats;

Firstly you have to play the game very different with players from different generations. Like Codenames, for me, the game loses some of its nuances when played with kids. It's still enjoyable but I enjoy the adult game, with more abstract/complex phrases/associations.

Secondly, I was very surprised at how quickly the cards in the base game seemed stale and repetitive. Even the young kids commented on this after a few games "awwww I don't want this one I've had this snake in the basket before", cue changing out the card as everyone now knows what they had. Kids hey! shake But fortunately expansions for Dixit seem to reproduce like tribbles so if you want to buy them you will never be short of options.

It is popular for a reason, great game.

UPDATE

My family loves this game and it is constantly requested. I have only played it with the family so far but would love to try it with just adults to see how different the game play is. I had the same experience with codenames recently and enjoyed the game a lot more when playing with only adults (as a gamer that is, I always enjoy playing games with the family and kids ... I am sure you know what I mean!)

We only have the base game and there have been comments that the same cards always seem to come around. Would love to get another deck of cards for Dixit, Is there one that you would recommend over the others?

Good party game!  Reminds me of Balderdash, but with a storytelling twist.  

We play that the game ends at the end of the round in which someone reaches 30 (so everyone gets the same number of chances to be the storyteller).

I think the lack of more cards hurts the replayability at some point (and yes, I own all 3 Dixit games).  People don't want to see the same cards more than a couple times.

[b]Interesting game. Has a bit of a problem with clues that are tailored to one specific person only, in particular if the same two people do this repeatedly. This can take a lot of the fun out of it.
To prevent established patterns from appearing, one can restrict the clues to one specific topic or area of knowledge that all the players are familiar with. We once played a game in which all clues had to be Star Trek related.
Also, shared knowledge doesn't automatically mean the other person gets your hint, so there is potential for fun/frustrating misunderstandings.[/b]

This is one of the best party games. Easily accessible with any age group. Although it has lots of cards, after a few rounds of play, the cards seem to lose its appeal very quickly.

This game is the version of Apples to Apples that I enjoy. You have to use your imagination, give indirect clues trying not to make it to easy for someone to guess your card but also not to hard. Some of the best art in any game still. Very good party game, I am terrible at it and will lose each time but I am always curious to see how other people's mind work.

Seriously, no. Played once and didn't like it at all. 
Didn't like the naive graphic, the concept, how the game goes. I didn't find any spark of engagement or fun. 
I was going to give it a 5 as it's mostly a personal taste while I can see it can definitely have some audience and plus I see creativity in there, but I go with a 4 cause there are too many party games out there way more interactive and engaging than this.

Throw out Apples to Apples.  This is done right, not just a social 'thing', but actually a social game.  Apples to Apples done right.  Art is fantastic.  Looking forward to the expansion.  The kids really enjoy this.  I am not a party gamer, but I now have one I will actually enjoy at some level.

Moved rating from 7 to 8 in 11/2010.  A great game for me to play with my kids.  I have yet to introduce it to anyone who did not enjoy it.  I personally think the art is some of the best in-game art.  It just works so well within this game's context.

Interesting story-telling card game.  A little like Apples-to-Apples.  Art is beautiful, too.  While creativity is required to play, each round has a definitive "correct" answer, unlike Apples-to-Apples, where the winner is solely at the whim of the active player.  The active player also has to play an interesting balancing act between too-obvious and too-far-out-there when coming up with a clue.

Considering my general dislike of most social games, I'm surprised that I actually enjoyed this. I attribute this to the wonderful, Daliesque artwork that made me want to play certain cards even if they were inappropriate for the clue. The game itself is fairly limited, as sometimes you have no viable clue card and at other times the choice is obvious, so mostly the only real decisions are in guessing which is the right picture.

2nd best game of 2008 and one of my top10 favorites.
Awesome party game that anyone can enjoy. It's bit hard to 'get' as new player, but it's still fun to guess others cards even if your own explanations suck. Actually I'm not that good explainer myself, but I still love trying. The artwork is great, in Dixit and the first expansion at least, others in series are bit worse but still good. Dixit is great game to play with introverted people aswell. It allows you to be creative but never embarasses anyone. You don't have to try too hard to be funny, you can even be all serious and play to fun, but at some point fun will come!

2-Player Comment:
* Dixit can't be played with two. BGG Forums have some decent co-op variants for two, but otherwise it simply isn't a 2p suitable game. With three use this variant: in voting phase add random card (from draw deck) to choices.

An odd game. My family like it, but it is a bit subject to group think. If you share a library of experiences then you'll likely "get" each other's story. I can't play to save my life and I can generally predict who will win based on who is playing - so I don't play and I let the family get on with it. On the plus side, non-gamers can play with minimal teaching; it's practically a gateway game.

This game is rarely boring.  You begin to get to know your opponents pretty well over time, and improve your score while doing so.  It's creative, the art is colourful and inspiring (inspiring what?  well, that's what you'll find out as you play)  I've played this at least 5 times with didn't groups, and several people have decided to go out and buy it.  It's not a hard game to reproduce using your own pictures and voting tokens, keeping track of scores on a piece of paper.  I've used the expansion in that exact way, and it didn't destroy the fun of game whatsoever.  I recommend Balderdash, and Apples to Apples if you're looking for similar game mechanics and fun.

Easy to explain, opens fruitful conversations and situations, you can tinker with the rules easily, for example: you cannot use words to describe your card

Amazing! the inductive nature of Dixit is pure genius, it prizes empathy, intuition, good abstraction skills and of course, your knowledge about persons and things. The paintings are weird and ambiguous but so well done, remarkable how a game with such simple rules can be also very complex. The game can get samey after many plays, however with expansions/more cards Dixit can be a 9 for me.

I play with all my Dixit cards mixed together, so I won't record any plays of expansions to be clear of how many actual times I've played the game.

Storytelling game with a gamer-y twist in the scoring system.  Fun for non-gamers and differently-engaging for gamers as it's more creative/artistic than the typical math-driven game.

I was quite keen to play this game, sadly for me the down-time when it isn't your turn to be the Storyteller is really quite boring, as there's very little strategy that can be planned ahead there's not a lot to be done when you aren't picking a card from your hand or voting on which one you this is the Storyteller's. The game produces some moments of humour as people question why on earth somebody voted for a particular card but all too often I found myself just discarding a card out of my hand for no better reason than that I had something in mind for another card - maybe it was the descriptions we were using but 90% of the time I had nothing even remotely suitable to play as a reasonable alternative to the Storyteller's statement. 
When it is your turn to be Storyteller the game suddenly gets a lot more interesting as it is surprisingly enjoyable trying to decide how to pitch your statement so that (ideally) only one person gets it right, playing on common interests / experiences etc is very enjoyable and there's (bizarrely) a sense of jeopardy. I played with 6 people and was frankly close to dozing off once or twice. I did okay (came second both times) but just couldn't get into the game really.

EDIT: Re-played a couple of times with 4 people and the game is much better.

The sad thing about this is that it's very susceptible to 'dog whistles'. You try and say a sentence a single person will get and nobody else. 

Maybe better in situations where you don't know everybody, or as a good icebreaker, but for a dedicated game group the replay value is low.

Such a sweet game with the right crowd! First played it with two friends, everybody was enamored with the cards and some very memorable, even poetic, moments were had. Immediately bought an expansion and Dixit: Odyssey the next day, because I'm itching to play this with a bigger crowd. Expansions are a must because some of the magic is inevitably lost once you've seen all the cards. Also piqued my interest in Mysterium which seems to have a similar mechanic.

The pictures and artwork in this game are wonderful.  A tad creepy though...

This game manages to blend balderdash and apples to apples by using pictures and sentences.  I was underwhelmed when I read the rules to be honest.

But the game is MUCH better than I thought.  I shouldn't really be surprised because Balderdash is one of my all time favourites.

This would be a fitting addition to the SdJ.  It is a game which would be an absolute hit in schools and family settings and has a broad, universal appeal.

To me, this is very reminiscent of the word game balderdash.  Like many other social games, scoring is really beside the point - it's main use is to provide a natural end to the game.

It's a pretty enjoyable party game featuring wonderfully weird artwork. It's all about imagination and knowing each other. One player plays one of their cards face down and gives a theme, which can be absolutely anything you want, and the other players secretly play a card they think might fit that theme. After the cards are revealed players vote on which they think is the correct one and points are scored accordingly. It works well in a family setting, though with kids it depends on their ability to think abstract.

This game has beautiful artwork, which can be mixed and matched with that from the game Mysterium.

It keeps fresh, and is probably easier to play, if games have chosen themes, eg. "music" or "proverbs only".  

However, I once played a game which the host decided to theme "no words".  The first clue was "wiiii".  Very apt- the game was fun for about 1 round, and plummeted from there.

Dixit is interesting.

Totally did not live up to the hype for me...although the game was played under less than ideal conditions.  This was the boardgame disappointment of the year for me in 2016.

We only had 4-5 players, and it feels like this game would be more engaging if there were 7 or 8 players participating.

We also had lots of distractions on both occasions we played - with people walking away from the table to attend to kids, etc.  

Overall, this was a frustrating experience...

It's remarkably simple and easy to teach, but really fun if you're in a friendly group, or in a group of your friends. The cards are wonderful and expansions just keep adding more.   The cards are also useful for other things (like playing Codenames or using for Fortune Telling or whatever). A must have in any collection IMO.

*June 5, 2013* Risky buy, but paid off! I hosted a boardgame night and knew some of the players would only want to play Boggle, Scattergories, Taboo, and other snooze-worthy games. Risked it, even though I knew I'd be playing Clash of Cultures instead and the others would be playing this on their own.

My wife and 4 other friends played it... and she loved it! This is great news because it puts my games in a more positive context in her mind, as right now she feels extremely negatively about them (not where she minds my playing, just whenever it affects her). She's an artist so loves the art. She basically gave me a free pass to get Dixit Quest. The game looks like fun, I'd be glad to play it (just not overdo it, like The Resistance). 

Every play has Dixit Quest and latest Dixit Odyssey expansion mixed in

Amazingly fun party game -- useful for "coming down" off of a session.  Balderdash with fanciful pictures.  Emphasis on the beautiful artwork.  Not as "heavy" into metagaming as a Balderdash round, but brilliantly illustrated enough to make that not matter.

If anyone comes round and shows even a modicum of interest in my board games, but have only played scrabble, THIS game is the perfect introduction to modern day board games.
The art is surreal. But the game play is beautiful and smooth.

Another decent party game. It's interesting how this gets played with dramatically different clue types in different groups. Needs a couple of expansions to avoid card cycling within a single game

As far as party games go this is a favorite. I don't have to pantomime and I'm not punished for lack of speech or writing skills or lack of knowledge (looking at you "Nobody is perfect"). May suffer a bit from playing it with couples who have spent so much time together that there is an infinite wealth of private knowledge and known phrases.

I think I used up my BGG contingent of the word knowledge... drat...

It's usually pretty funny, plays well in very diverse groups (it is one of those games that you can play with non-gamers),plays rather fast, which is always a pro, and the art is beautiful.

Only downsides: it needs a "large" group( playing it with 3 is not worth it, and it's better with 5 or 6); and the fact that you have to play it with people you know to get the best of it.

RATING: 8
With the right group of people, this game is an absolute riot!  The right group are people more interesting in telling cool stories, and interested in the same types of stories (for me that means crude immature adult humor of course).  But if you had a different sense of humor and played with like minded people, you'd bust up playing this game also.  Or a group of people who wanted to spin tales of fantasy or fairy tales to each other would enjoy this on a more cognitive, or traditionally creative level.

ADVICE: thought the scoring system is great (being balanced and concrete unlike judge scoring games), it's still better to play for the laughs than the score.

Good game. I think it depends on the players so the experience can be subjective. However, I had a great demo of the Dixit at Gencon and the guy demoing the game was SO GOOD at the game that he could whip around the scoring very quickly no matter the group.  So skill is definitely involved, which also worked well for demoing the game to lots of players (thanks, Alex!). I can't wait to try this out with more non-gamer friends.

Dixit is now a must buy for me. I can see this one being very appealing to a variety of groups. I can see hardcore gamers who prefer heavy Euro mechanics not liking it but it really suits social gaming. I really want to use it the youth at the Family Board Game Night that I run at my church.  A lovely gateway game for non-gamers, Dixit will appeal to just about anyone, in no small measure due to the alluring art on the cards.

A fun party game, but suffers if it is played too much with the same people and from some fairly tight restrictions on which number of players work well.

Undoubtedly better with more expansions, but even with the large number of cards provided it still seems a little limited.

Minden szavával egyetértek:

"A képek alapján elsőre dedósnak tűnhet a horrorfaló nagyfiúk számára a Dixit – de ebben az esetben sem szabad pusztán külcsín alapján ítélni. A Dixit szempillantás alatt lett az egyik legkedveltebb és legkeresettebb társas, nem ok nélkül. Egyszerű és nagyszerű! (...)

A Dixit átütő sikere miatt azóta több kiegészítő is megjelent, amik új lapokat tartalmaznak, ezeket szabadon lehet vegyíteni. Egy lapról pedig minden ember más és más dologra asszociálhat, így az újrajátszhatósága garantált. Nagyon szeretem, tipikusan ez is olyan játék, ami szikrát lehel a társaság szociális életébe. Társassal sohasem játszó emberek elé is vittem már: a kezdeti élénk tiltakozás két percig sem tartott, majd félóra elteltével már jöttek a dicsérő mondatok, hogy milyen jó ez a játék."

RATING: 7
An unusual and original game which consists of players, on their turn,describing an aspect of an image on a card in their hand. The other players then put down a card that may, in some way, match the description. All the other players then vote for the card they think the description represents. If everyone, or no one, guesses your card you score no points. So, the trick is to employ an indeterminate description to score points. A good game to play with kids.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The artwork on the cards and box is gorgeous. Want to play.

Did play. Takes a little time to figure out the sweet spot for making your clues obscure, but not TOO obscure. You want someone to guess right, and you want people to play cards that fall in line with your clue. Very group dependent. Sometimes no one has any cards that fit your clue and things are obvious.

Fun game for the right group. Not my kind of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good party game. The art lifts this above other games. Some slight concerns over replayability, but that's why there are expansions, which are easy to produce as long as artists keep drawing new cards (and it might be cool to see different-style expansions by other artists).

Suggest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
We've enjoyed several plays of this game although it can be a little intimidating at first for new players. It takes quite a while to get good at giving clues that are just right, not too obscure, not too obvious. It's really fun to give long clues that work: my longest so far was seventeen words.* Many of the cards are very interesting, some are beautiful and poetic, and some are quite bizarre. Well worth buying the expansion deck, which easily fits in the base game box if you turn the insert upside down. [8 plays]

*In our most recent game, it became a point of honor to try to make your clue at least one word longer than the previous one. And so it went from five or six gradually on to something like twelve or thirteen words. Very satisfying.

Dixit is a great time, but it is better as a fun activity than as a game - the point scoring annoys me.  It strikes me as wrong that on your turn, you cannot make more than 3 points, while another player can make more than you.

Pros:

Beautiful artwork and fun social game where the active player gives a clue and all other players place a card they think will match that clue. Then, everyone votes on what card they think was the active players.

Cons:

Can lose replay value after repeated playthroughs because the game is dependent on the artwork on the cards and that can get stale. I guess that's what expansions are for?

Beautiful art, simple games and lots of fun. The clue seems to go deeper and deeper as we get to know each other better. I realize that the game is not for everyone. The players should have a wide range of knowledge, such as literature, arts, movies, songs, poems and fairy tales. It's disaster to play among people with different background. But with people you are familiar with, it's the best game ever.

Basically, it's Alias with pictures. It is a fine family and party game, but I'd rather play something that requires more analytical skills. This is also a bad game to play in a company of couples, because most often than not, people will choose the wording so only their spouse would get the right association. It's okay to play once in a while with new people, but I can't enjoy it for more than an hour.

Ez volt az első saját "modern" társasom. Interneten szörfözgettem, amikor olvastam, hogy abban az évben a Dixit lett az év társasjátéka (Spiel des Jahres). Akkor még nem tudtam ez mit jelent, de elolvastam, miről szól a játék, és a Jézuskától már ezt kértem ajándékba.:)
Rengeteget játszottam vele családi és baráti körben is, mindig garancia volt a sok nevetés. Azért csak volt, mert az utóbbi egy évben mióta "megfertőződtem", az újabb játékok miatt nem került elő.

The game that I put off playing for months.  My gf finally forced it upon me and I enjoyed every minute.  The artwork on the cards is second to none.  Very simple game that requires you to get creative.  Great game to play with family/non-gamers.

I love the art in this game, couldn't help but get every expansion. Gets deeper the more I play it, but I find that I've never really cared about winning in this game but rather it's the small victories that excite me. It's like experiencing a shared dream. Such a wonderful feeling to get to be creative for a while with friends and loved ones.

Definitely a favorite to get people addicted to board gaming.  You like Apples to Apples?  Great, here's one that kicks A2A's ass!  Yes, the cards eventually get redundant, but that's why I get expansions -- at hugely inflated prices!  But the artwork is truly mesmerizing.

Beautiful cards, but I'd rather just grab a great children's book or collection of surrealist art than have to play the game itself which wears out its welcome real fast. -- Also quite vulnerable to collusion among players who know each other well and can give clues that fly over the head of the rest of the group.

A fun twist on Apples to Apples and other similar party style games. It helps to know the people you are playing with in order to judge how obscure you make the clue.

The card art is a work of genious or madness - you decide!

RATING: 7.5
Such a great game that is open to just about any person...gamer or non-gamer.

Each round a player must say a keyword that relates to one of their cards. Each player then selects a card from their hand that best matches or has a link to the keyword. The active player adds their card to the mix and randomly shuffles and sets them out.

Each player then tries to guess which was the original card. Players then earn points based on if their guess was correct and if any other players selected the card they put out as an option. 

The centerpiece is the gorgeous artwork of the oversized cards that are very evocative.

Nice party(ish)/gateway game with the right people, but kind of lost its novelty for me after five or so games. Actually, I don't know whether it's a game or just a mechanic or a system, because you could play it with anything. Rocks, for example. Or songs. 

Mysterium has kind of replaced Dixit for me (though lately Deception has maybe replaced Mysterium...)

Big success as a party game. Enjoyed by both men and women. Seemed much better with six rather than four players.

UPDATE: I downgraded the game from 8.5 to 7.5. As you play more games, descriptions used for given cards in previous games seem to creep back in your mind. I've subconsciously used some of these past descriptions leading my wife to guess instantly which card I had played even before it was revealed...

I have never played a game at family holiday get togethers that generated so much fun, laughs, and quality moments. My dad, an artist, loves the artwork on the cards; my mom said she wants to buy Dixit even though she doesn't care for boardgames; my daughter repeatedly asks to play; my nongamer wife never turns a game down.  I've even played Dixit with my hardcore gamer friends and they like it.

A refreshingly creative and different game, really works your lateral thinking skills. It can be gamed a little too easily by focusing on clues based on too specific things that you know one player will probably get and another probably won't, but everyone seems to prefer to play for fun and creativity rather than victory anyway. Could use more cards, or expansion packs (I admit I haven't checked if there are any available).

Dixit is a game for creatives. If you want to sit back, roll the die and let the game just happen as it may - Dixit isn't for you. The artwork in the box is simply stunning. I'd be tempted to buy an extra copy just to take them all out and frame them around my house; and unusually, the game revolves all around the art. The mechanic is similar to Balderdash or Mysterium; the 'Storyteller' selects an image from their hand and names it, with other players attempting to submit a different picture that matches the title. There's something very zen and calming about Dixit. It really is interesting to play.

Super family/party/fun game. Quickly explained, little rules and more difficult than you'd think at first.

Though I suppose it won't stand up to groups actively and repeatedly playing it, due to eventually knowing the cards a bit too well.

Math trade

I usually don't rate games lower than 5 but, although we laughed a little during the game, I didn't like it at all. Maybe with a larger group of players it's gonna be better... For a "spiel des jahres" it was a total disappointment. I think it has low replayability, not many choices about the cards (apart from the obvious which give you 0 points) unless you have the imagination of an author, depressing pictures and very little connection among the cards which makes the finding of the right picture easy for most of the times.

UPDATE. Played yesterday with 4. I don't have much of imagination and I almost run the scoreboard twice while 2 of my opponents barely got to 30 points. The group likes it. I DON'T!!!! Gets a 4 only for how often it is (and probably will be) on the table...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Fun, lighter game where players try to guess another player's card based on vague clues.  The game is simple and accessible which makes it good to include everyone in the game.  However, the game is not going to give you any deep or thought provoking choices.  If you want to keep it simple, this is one worth looking at.   But, be ready to buy expansions as the number of cards in the base set will make things repetitive rather quickly.

This fun party game resembles a combination of Apples to Apples and Balderdash. Players are dealt cards with cartoonish pictures. The current player says a sentence, or hums a tune to convey the meaning of a picture, then a card is placed face down out of their hand. Everyone else then plays a face down card. Cards are revealed and players have to choose the the current player's card to score points. You also score points if people choose your card.

It's a different game, fun to play at a party,and was the French game of the year in  2009. It would be interesting to see how replayable it is, though I heard there are expansions already.

Ordered this and looking forward to trying it because I don't think apples to apples or cards against humanity are worth owning. This looks like a deeper more creative and more interesting version. Also, it keeps topping the charts as one of the best party games ever. If I really like this, I'll get all the expansions too.
----------
For a "small numbers party game" i.e. a party style game but you still sit around a table, for something you can play with non gamers and casual gamers, for something that is a great alternative to older more boring party games like pictionary charades, etc. This one IS KING!

Dixit is just one of the greatest games in that it's universally fun and interesting. It's immediately accessible, super fun, rewarding even when you're not winning and imaginative. I prefer this game over apples to apples or cards against humanity and even though I probably like Balderdash just as much for slightly different reasons despite having the same niche, this one is even more accessible and fast paced. Great game!

Excellent party game that rewards creative thinking as well as broad knowledge. As much about playing off of what you think the other players will do as your own cards.

Relating to Apples to Apples (which I loathe) I love this game for two main reasons:

1. It uses your imagination.
2. There is not just one judge deciding the random lucky winner. It uses a voting system.

Those two simple combinations make the game enjoyable to me.  

Apple to Apples gets very old, even when playing with a different group.  Since Dixit uses your imagination, every time you play with a different group, there are lots of laughs because of all the crazy ideas people have as to what the cards remind people of.

My party-game of choice. Best played with people who like creative things, those with artistic and writing aspirtaions can excel in the game, yet it is not a must. The art of the cards by Marie Cardouat, who obviously is a well-seasoned illustrator of children's books, is fantastic - the attention to detail and fantasy applied to the images is stunning.  Some people are vary of the game because you can apply the 'strategy' of only giving very personal hints that can be understood by your spouse or any other 'insider' - yet this is a *choice* of the players. If you refrain from this strategy you will get so much more out of this game and it really develops both fantasy and creativity. I see no reason other than adding some components why the game cannot be played with up to 8 or 9 people. As a party game, Dixit obviously has a strong element of randomness as you cannot know if your very well thought out clue or metaphor just has no equivalent in your opponents' cards, while at other times they do. The only real down-side I can see to the game is that some people have a problem with coming up with new descriptions/sentences for the cards once you've played them all a couple of times - but there's always Dixit 2 that can remedy this...

The optimal play as the judge is for only one person to guess your card. That way you get 3 points and only one other person gets 3 points. So the optimal play is to just grunt and not give any clue at all. Then random chance ensures a high likelihood that at least one player will choose your card. Seems broken to me.

A wonderful, creative game that suffers from two large flaws. First, it wears out its welcome quickly, with cards growing stale after only a few appearances and individual games sometimes dragging on too long. Secondly, it's a party game that relies upon invention and interpretation, which aren't universal skillsets, potentially leaving some players or groups apathetic or even uncomfortable with the game. Ultimately, I find that it's a great game (activity?) in concept that becomes less enchanting in actual play.

RATING: 7
Dixit is a party game running along the same notions as Balderdash or Fibbage, but in which vague descriptions of surreal images are used to form the questions, instead of words or trivia. Dixit is light, quick, endlessly diverse and incredibly easy to learn – but the fact that players functionally generate their own questions does leave it tragically open to "exploitative" play. The base game also desperately requires Dixit Odyssey in order to expand the player limit and accommodate large groups. 

Approved.

I recommend this as a great social game for up to 6 people.

I always want to like Dixit more than I actually do.

My desire is to play with a group of storytellers, who are look at the cards available and weave simple tales that are clever and concise, and can be interpreted in different ways but clearly point to the chosen card when you understand their intent.

My reality is that it's a breeding ground for the least imaginative or expressive in-jokes and statements specifically designed to exclude one particular person...

Clues like: "that thing we were talking about in the car on the way over," make me want to cry. It's like playing Balderdash with people who can't form a grammatically correct sentence.

Perhaps I was spoiled from having owned Dixit 3: Journey before owning Dixit, but compared to the lavishly detailed cards in Journey, the artwork in the original seems bland and, in a few cases, entirely uninteresting.

Additionally, it appears that I must have gotten a reissue of Dixit as it came with a separate gameboard and black plastic insert instead of the victory track insert that looked like the rabbit-hole from Alice In Wonderland which made an interesting theme with the rabbit-shaped meeples it had for pawns.

Altogether a disappointment compared to the version I would recommend, Dixit 3: Journey.

Fun party game where players are coming up with a remark that describes the picture on the card they have.  You do not want to be descriptive because if everyone guesses it correct, that's less points for you.  Optimally you would want one or two people to guess your card, so vague is good, but not too vague to not have anyone guess.  Reminds me of Cluzzle in that way.

Really cool game; the art is definitely the best part about it. Can kind of get stale after multiple playthroughs because the art will inevitably repeat, which is the only reason I'm giving it a 7.25 instead of an 7.75 or higher. Not really a fault of the game. Another detractor is that the fun you will have playing Dixit is highly dependent upon who you are playing it with.

Weird little French party game with wonderful graphics, clever gameplay, and far too few cards.  Needs Apples-to-Apples levels of support to become interesting beyond the first five games.

This game exercises a very different part of the brain than most boardgames, combining a person's verbal ability to selectively describe to their audience, along with the deductive ability to discern the truth when not playing the storyteller. It excels for people who do not want to over analyze problems during a game.

Having an experienced player model several different types of storytelling methods can help open up the game to more creative stories. I also find that as an ice breaker, it is useful to ask why each person guessed a particular card. Although it slows the game down, it helps a new group understand each other for better play each round.

This is an outstanding party game.  It absolutley needs to be played with the right crowd, though.  The ideal group for this game would consist of a few people you know quite well, and a few who you are maybe only acquainted with, as long as all of them were creative and willing to give themselves over to the crazy non-theme.  An excellent, fun, thought-provoking game.  And you can make your own expansions by obtaining other sets of picture cards.

RATING: 8
First impression (6 players) : An excellent party game when you know people that are playing. Good thing here is that only the "storyteller" must think of a word, sound, poem etc. and other players only choose a card that most closely reminds it. Brilliancy of the game is about good (and usually fun) clues. Not as much of a game as it is a good way to spend part of the evening with friends.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Spectacular and inviting artwork. This game is one of my best gateway games to lure non initiates into boargaming. Easy to teach and also plays well on big groups. Dixit taps into capacities seldom seen in boardgaming: creativity, imagination and almost poetical interpretation of words and images.

Roughly 30 plays from 2012-2015. Great party game, low threshold for new gamers. Is the game I use with non gamers. All expansions always mixed in.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Exactly the type of party game I actively avoid: You have to make up stories or hints about your cards. These kinds of performances belong in a high school drama club, not in a board game.

The game also suffers from the usual problem of hint-based party games: The main strategy here is to  know at least some of the other players so well (either in real life or from earlier experience with the game) that you can just keep racking up points using insider hints, and leaving the others completely without any possibilities to score.

And even if we don't consider that aspect at all, the scoring still does not work. The active player gets -2 points if everybody or nobody guesses the card, and +3 points otherwise. Even though other players can score a little during other players' turns by cleverly choosing their cards, that just doesn't balance the scoring enough. You should definitely get rewarded more if you come up with creative hints and only a few players get it right. But actually, that would just encourage using the insider hint approach, so looks like we have a kind of a catch-22 situation here.

There are way too few cards: You'll have seen all of them pretty much during the first game, so making up fresh hints gets even more difficult very quickly.

The two reasons why I don't rate this any lower are:
First, the illustrations are absolutely fantastic. They should print posters and sell those instead.
Second, there's actually a game in here, even though it's not really a board game. In Finland, it's a television game show called [i]Kymppitonni[/i].

Dixit isn't always a 10 but it can be. Played with casual acquaintances or at a gaming day it's a great filler but nothing amazing. 

Amazing is playing it with your friends and busting out the real clues, like -
"How X will feel the moment he realises he's gay."
"How I felt the day I saw the baby ultrasound picture on my ex's facebook."
"What my in-laws really think of me."

The cards are surpisingly versatile for plumbing the depths of your friends' depravity and your own personal tragedies.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The idea behind Dixit is simple and wonderfully original: a "declaring" player says a phrase associated to one card in their hand, the other players choose a card from their respective hands that matches the phrase as closely as possible, all cards are mixed together and then they've got to guess which card was the original one - if all players or none guess the card all players but the "declarer" score 2 points, otherwise all players with right guesses and the declarer score 3 points and owners of misleading cards score 1.

If this concept is already enough to guarantee an excellent, balanced game, the artwork makes it one of the most memorable games of late: all cards include pictures of a childlike, dreamy quality, avoiding easy associations and giving every session a unique, playful touch. It's barely possible to think of a better way to meld creativity, poetry and a good amount of chuckles around a table.

Gioco geniale, la maggior parte degli amici a cui l'ho fatto provare mi ha poi chiesto di comprarglielo. Ha il vantaggio di essere semplice e corto: si spiega in 1 minuto e le partite durano circa 30'. Ideale per serate all'insegna del divertimento, Dixit è un family game adatto anche ai più piccoli. A farla da padrone non è la strategia (che solitamente prediligo) ma la fantasia, l'intuizione e, a volte, anche un po' di cultura generale (dipende con chi lo si gioca). Un consiglio: massima attenzione ai dettagli... Il gioco, che trovo dovrebbe manderà in cantina i vari Taboo e Pictionary, potrebbe avere una distribuzione migliore perché adatto realmente a tutti e capace di avvicinare come nessun altro i babbani ai giochi in scatola. Lo consiglio anche se dopo i tanti premi il prezzo è salito troppo. Ha il limite di essere per massimo 6 giocatori (è uscita l'espansione Odyssey che permette partite anche in 12), ma può essere scaricata l'espansione fino a 8. I disegni sulle carte sono bellissimi e fantasiosi. Una volta entrati nel tunnel non potrete fare a meno delle numerose espansioni che regalano maggiore longevità.

Everybody plays it and all causal players like this game. So why rating is 7? Are you mad? This game deserves 8 of course. A best game for novice boardgamers. Are you giving 7 to prove you are an expert hardcore player? 

Okay game can become boring after playing it 10 times with same group and with same cards. However you can buy extra cards. Anyway Dixit opened new era in board game community. New people who are unfamiliar to boardgames started to play board games because of Dixit. Even our community get bigger because of this game. So it deserves 8 not 7.

Okay of course winning this game is a bit random. However I played it tons of times with different communities. I stop playing it now because of randomness of winning situation, however Dixit is a great game.

I'm not really much of a fan of these kind of arbitrary judging games.  (With Apples to Apples I don't even try to pick the best answer -- I just randomly play cards and actually seem to do better than when I try.)  But I love the art on these.  And the scoring is just enough different, that it takes away some of my concerns with things like Apples to Apples.

The artwork is fantabulous; the game play is OK.  I love Beyond Balderdash and like Apples to Apples OK as a very occasional group activity.  This falls in between.  Heavily group dependent.

However, the art is enough to draw in otherwise reluctant gamers like my sister-in-law.

Good for a party game because you have to think and actually play the others players.

I like the idea of Dixit, I just wish I had a better imagination! I always struggled to come up with clever description. Also it's very dependent on the meta game - e.g. two players were L5R players, and one guy based his clues off some of the background, others referenced TV shows etc., so it can depend on knowing trivia.

A much better version of apples to apples.  This fixes pretty much all the problems in that game and makes for a now respectable game.  Good for a wide range of players, and I like that inside jokes between people become very useful.  Great option for a party game.  Not my favorite game by any stretch, and likely will never suggest this, but also would never turn it down.

RATING: 7
It works well enough, crossing Thingamajig with Apples to Apples. Instead of a word, you pitch in a secret picture with a cryptic clue. Everyone else pitches in a secret picture trying to match that clue. The pictures get shuffled and revealed, then each player other than the clue giver secretly chooses which one they think was the clue giver's picture. To maximise points as the clue giver, you only want one person to guess, and definitely not all and not no one. As the non clue givers, you maximise points by picking the right one and having everyone else pick yours. The pictures are suitably wild and esoteric, allowing for all sorts of weird clues. You get through the whole deck in each game, so the trick is either to play with the same group each time and watch the emergence of more clever clues for the same old pictures, or continually play with new groups to keep it fresh. Or buy expansions. It's one of the downsides. It's simple, it's enjoyable enough, it's not too long for what it is. It's got the same card luck as Apples to Apples - either you'll have something that's close to the clue given or not. So you can't take it too seriously. It's not something I'll seek, but I'd say yes if anyone wanted to play. As long as it's occasional, not all the time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Group dependent.  After a few games you see the same cards, and clues may repeat themselves depending on who you are playing with.  This may require you to buy expansions....which is an investment.  So how invested is your gaming group?  Also, you need to play with people who are very creative and who enjoy the activity.

Beautiful game. It's much more fun then it might look at first, and the cute bunnies might scare older players off. But once people try it out, it's just too good to put it pack after the first round, and you immediatly want to play it again. Although 84 cards looks like much, you soon get to know them and if you play with the same players you'll have to get REAL creative very soon. A very nice one!

I hate party games that  involve players accusing other players of being traitors, within the first three seconds, and having endless discussions over their beliefs. I also hate charades.

This game came as a breath of fresh air, to save me from committing suicide or murder. Clever mechanics and nice surreal  components. 

I am really self conscious so I also appreciate that I don’t have constant pressure to come up with clues. I only give a clue once in every 5 or 6 rounds and I enjoy the rest of the game in comfort. Even when I have to give a clue, I can choose from 6 cards.

Different experience with different game groups. Great Game. Thank God!

Tough  3  player game,  I am sure that when we start playing it with more people I will raise the rating.

OK I raised it .5  we played a few games of 4 player and it was definitely way better than 3 player,  but it still did not take me all the way to a solid 8 

I am almost positive with 5 or 6 players it would be a solid 8+ in my book,  the play with 4 was good and I can see how 5 or 6 would really increase most aspects of the game.  

I look forward to playing the game with 5 or 6 and raising it to a 8+ in rating.

9 Plays - I've never had so much fun play such a simple game. Great at a social gathering and with some drinks! We literally always lol during this game, as we begin to describe exactly how many drugs the artist/s must do. We always award a bonus 2 points to the person with the strangest card left in their hand at the end of the game. This always makes us flabbergasted at the cards people then DO play, often exclaiming, "that's NOT the strangest card in your hand?"

One of those games where everyone throws in a card and you hope others vote for yours (like Apples to Apples or Balderdash). Not my type of game, hard to play with people you don't really know and most of the time you are just guessing, but after playing ti with closer friends I can see the draw. Creates some laughs and Dixit has the benefit of having beautiful artwork. I do find that the reply with the same group is limited as cards tend to stand for certain things, but still fairly fun to play.

The board, a platform built around the perimeter of the box, and the wooden rabbit player tokens are clever.  I didn't like the game very much.  Everyone gets a hand of cards that have different pictures on them.  The "Storyteller" chooses one of her cards and tells everyone a word, phrase, or paragraph that is supposed to hint at the picture on her card without actually describing it.  Then everyone else chooses a card to match the Storyteller's description and all the cards go into a pile and are mixed together.  The Storyteller arranges the cards randomly, face up, on the table.  Players use numbered chips to vote for the card each thinks best matches the Storyteller's description and everyone tosses their chips out at once.  Points are awarded for choosing the correct card as well as fooling other people into voting for your card.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Simply put, Apples to Apples with pictures instead of words. This provides more freedom for all players, the one giving the clue has their whole range of experience available, and the other players are forced to find a card in their hands that fits rather than going to blatant humor. The scoring forces the clue giver to be clever, but not too clever.

Very unique game. It's a party game for the sophisticated urban elite.

Players take turns as the storyteller. 

The storyteller plays a hidden card and says a sentence. All the other players must then play a card that "matches" the sentence. All the cards are revealed and everybody will try to guess which card was played by the storyteller. The trick is that points are awarded only if some players guess it right and some guess it wrong, making the storyteller's job much harder. 

None of this would work, of course, without the stunning art in the cards, by Marie Cardouat.It's almost worth it to buy the game for the art alone.

I like the tricky nature of describing a card in enough detail to convince some people but not all. I also like that everybody votes secretly, so it isn't like Apples to Apples with the one person judging. Some of the descriptions are so funny, and the cards people choose can be really entertaining. I think it would be fun to get the expansion, since we went through the cards pretty quickly and more variety would be nice. This game isn't a wild laughing game like Time's Up or Balderdash--it's more quiet and mellow. It is better with 5-6 players, not as good with 4. I happen to be terrible at it, but I still enjoy it.

Good for something different. It's more about getting the kids to expand their way of thinking instead of following the rules. The cards are like a version of Tarot for the kids.

Not much of a game rather than a nice way of passing time. It is a fun game with the right group, as all the games like this are. The paintings/pictures in cards are really well done, but the box could've been smaller.

If you want a game, don't buy. If you want a nice way to enjoy the evening without learning much rules, try this!

Please don't make me play this game again!  The gameplay is okay -- there are 100 or so cards with illustrations that look like they were drawn by Salvador Dali during his worst nightmares -- and the "active" player gives some label to a card and the other players try to guess which card he/she has labelled.  Well, yes, that is very lame, but it's okay, easy to learn, and moves along quickly.  But, I may not sleep for a week thinking about how extremely annoying and disturbing the artwork is on these cards.  I mean, one card has an alien with a hose coming out of a nostril, and you're supposed to describe it such that some opponents can figure out which card it is, but others can not.  If they all figure out your card based on your definition -- or if none do -- then you score no points.  I learned this at a game club, Dixit was being played at 4 separate tables -- the moment the games completed at each table it was quickly put away and the players rushed to the game shelf to find something different -- and much better -- to play.  Now, time to go to bed -- but I'm still thinking of that alien with a hose up his nose, or the mother trying to pull her daughter out of the throat of a monster trying to swallow her.  Yick!!

Decent party game with fantastic artwork. Very good for those with a creative mind (which is apparently not me, based upon the scores from the first play.)

I traded this after my non-gaming family refused to play it and now regret it. I think my niece and nephew are now old enough to play this, so I'm thinking of buying another copy.

This was different. You have to come up with a description (sentence) about a card you have, that has to be vague enough that not everyone will get your card, but clear enough that someone gets it. Which led to a lot of AP. But we had fun anyway, though it's one of those games where I'd need to be in the right mood to want to play it.

(01/18) Same thing that happened to Incan Gold/Diamant, happened to me with dixit, my friends always wanted to play it, so it got me tired, but sometimews it is a good choice for an opener or when waiting for the whole group to play. It is a good game for casual gamers, it is different from Incan Gold in that Push Your Luck can get repetitive. Dixit has good potential and the art is so good it can draw people who like the art to want to try it, so it is a good "recruit" game.

I've mixed Dixit cards into Mysterium and it's worked.

Lots of expansion might make the game vary.

Whoa! This game tests the creative part of brain of everyone. I played the game with 3 players and it worked fine, but I can see this game shine with 5 to 6 players.

I found out the hard way, I am not a creative person! Maybe I am biased but the 2 girls I've played with whooped my behind. Are girls better at this game?

----- Update ----
After around 20 plays this game drops from a 8 to a 7. Replay-ability is definitely an issue at this play count. I see it will hit the table from time to time but I won't actively suggest it anymore. Maybe when the right mood and with the right group this will come out. Oh and girls are not better at this game after the guys' brains got trained to play this game.

A very cute and wife-friendly game with interesting drawings that are able to provoke myriad "stories" to guess at.  Only one play so far, but it's fun (though in a Cockroach Poker kind of way - where it's likely not skill but luck that guides victory), but admittedly that's the point.  It's not all that serious.  Need to see how subsequent plays work out before committing to a serious rank.

This game is close to perfection, as party games come. Enjoyable, and creative. It will definitely will work with everyone, with the probable exception of heavy game buffs who will not extract fun from such a free flow game. It is a highly subjective game, so everyones opinion will differ wildly for the same concept. This is the time of game I consider more an activity than a game, but it excels at bringing game mechanics that allow for some structure on a concept that is so open-ended.

I've played Dixit enough now to give it an honest rating - as well as add a few comments.

Dixit is a very easy game to learn how to play but can be very difficult to master.  In order to succeed, you have to try and get a glimpse into the mind of the storyteller in order to decipher his/her card.  The art is fantastic, and is compelling to everyone I've ever introduced the game to.  

Like any game, it's not a game for everyone.  There is no hard-core strategy, it takes a very creative mind to enjoy this, and it truly is about the playing as opposed to the winning.

I've introduced this game to many people and I find it's been a real hit with non-gamers.  I wouldn't classify it as a gateway game, because there is no game like it and there is no 'next step'.  It's just a fantastic 'party' game.  I'll always enjoy playing Dixit, and I always recommend that if you're going to buy this, you also buy Dixit 2, at least. (If you like it, Dixit: Odyssey will likely follow!)

Not a fan of the fantasy art, thinking of using Musee/Big Picture Apples to Apples instead. But not only the art, but I'm not a fan of using exclusivity to score points, I think Dohdles gets around this type of tightrope scoring better.

Might be a good mind searching exercise to throw out a clue in family and friend gatherings that hopefully scores highly via vagueness. Might also stimulate conversation from why certain clues given or how they find meaning. Seems to get stale fast with seeing the same cards more variety means either buying more cards or playing with different people to hear different interpretations of the same card.

From TableTop video: Apples to Apples style card play in which the turn player adds a card to the mix after stating a clue as to the card played, so a test of creativity and tuning into what others may think or know, so may advantage the competitive player who know some inside information . One hurdle to the game is the scoring method which rewards being vague but not too much (as in Teubers Barbarossa). However this hurdle maybe be overlooked by the engaging puzzle as to which card best fits the statement and the reason behind the clue.

This game combines intelligent and innovative gameplay with beautiful aesthetics. The concept is simple: give clues about your cards, without being too specific or too vague. The reason being - you only score points if some but not all of the other players guess your card correctly. The abstract artwork allows a great deal of creativity in crafting your clues (whilst giving ample room for other players to sneak in their cards). I love this game because it combines creative thinking with a strong level of social interaction. It usually gets people talking (even if it's simply to express utter confusion over the link between the clue and the card!) and it can get people in touch with considering other points of views - What would appeal to specific players? What does this clue say about the person giving it?

A unique addition to any gamer's collection!

Dixit is a strange beast. It's a fun game, rewards creativity, and the art is fantastic. However, you will see most of the cards after just one play and it's a little too easy to take advantage of "inside" information between you and one or two of the other players (to each of your benefit, and the disadvantage of the rest of the group). Still, I think it's a great experience game and at 30 minutes, one I'd usually be willing to play. I wish there were more cards (like, 1000 instead of 80) but also realize this is unrealistic. You really need to change the cards up though to create a replayable game.

Highly dependent on who you play with (those who are uncomfortable with creativity or whimsy and power gamers need not apply), but with the right crowd, Dixit is an elegant, simple, wonderful, fun, fast game.  Gorgeous components.

Dixit is beautiful looking and has a good scoring system, but I wasn't sure about its replayability. Maybe that's just my lack of imagination though...

A very original party game with two problems: 1) players will quickly become familiar with the cards, and 2) "inside jokes" are an effective strategy but result in some people being excluded, which is very bad for a party game.

A unique and beautiful party game. It is fairly similar to the Apples to Apples type games, but has a very different feel to it. I like the challenge of picking a clue that will get some, but not all, of the other players to figure out which card is yours. That makes it more of a thoughtful game, and less of just trying to find a funny joke. The art on the cards is very well-done too.

Apple to Apple with pictures. A bit too much of 'insider' jokes but could be more fun with 'ordinary' people. (Played with one expansion and homemade play-aids)

Wise & Otherwise is far, far superior.

So... I didn't... hate this like I thought I would. Dixit is a game where you choose an abstract picture say a sentence or less, and then you play Apples to Apples, except not as a shitty game with no creativity or interesting bits. The art is quite nice, and I like the artsy fartsy process of giving vague titles to cards or vice versa. But the game end where you're trying to score points feels sorta hollow, and there's a little too little emergent play, creatively, as the cards do much of the work. I almost want to get copy of the cards to just look at when I want to relax. But I don't really want to play a game with these cards.

"A picture is worth a thousand words".
This game is truly unique, at least absolutely different from the rest of the games I know.
It has created a whole new category, that may not be large, relating gaming with emotions, psychology, literature...
We like it because it's very simple and a lot of fun, but also cause sometimes it unveils a little bit of what's inside of other players' minds.
It can be played with very different attitudes.
And kids love it. The bunnymeeples are a plus for them.

Before playing this, I was so skeptical that this could work. It seemed like it would be weird or stupid or confusing or awkward or shallow or all of those at once.

It's not. It's so difficult to explain why this one works, but it does. This is the game you show to people to prove to them that board gaming is more than just a bunch of games for adolescents or fantasy geeks. It's even replayable, because you have to make up new stories each time you see the cards. It is like nothing else, in a good way. Everyone should try this game.

Play it with the right people! It's a storytelling game and you need to have people who are in the right state of mind and feeling creative in order to really enjoy this game. Otherwise you will be describing or saying really mundane and monotone things to talk about your card. 

Only played once but it was very casual and not really for 'winning' at all. If you have a group of friends with lots of inside jokes you might have an interesting and fun time.

A low score because it is so heavily based on the gaming group in order to enjoy this.

RATING: 5.2
Should be better than it is.  Standard one-is-right game where others try to bluff opponents into guessing their submission over the "right" one.  Not nearly enough cards to work with and luck plays a huge factor (you choose a card and say "Nighty night" only to find that three others had perfect fits for that phrase).

Another game I appreciate for the ease of play and fact that it can appeal to different age groups and both gamers and non-gamers. The one frustration I have is that if you play with some people who have played several times with each other and some who are new, there is a huge advantage for those who know the cards and have a history of what clues have been given for each.  A great game for kids and families though.

RATING: N/A
Party games are tough. I don't like having to be funny on command, I don't like having to embarrass myself through acting, singing, dancing, waving my arms, or some other thing that I don't do when I have the choice. Forced camaraderie? I don't know. I'll risk the reputation of being a curmudgeon. 

Dixit is different. It's a creative activity, "be clever but not too clever," the art is gorgeous, and there's no hint of Performance Anxiety that most fellow Introverts would recognize from their personal histories of being forced to play Cranium or Charades, sitting there in a room with everyone staring at you as you try to remember how to hum the theme song to Hawaii Five-O and you feel your face getting more and more flushed. 

No, Dixit is different. It's very visual, it encourages conversation, the debrief between rounds is usually reminiscing and sharing passions, laughing over clues, who got what quotation wrong, was that from a Kids in the Hall skit? It's great. The whole thing is great. All while staring at a picture of a girl trapped in a birdcage.

Your Dixit experience really depends on who you are playing it. Playing it with hardcore gamers will result in consecutive moaning about how this is not a game. Playing it with geeks will result in myriads of LOTR and Dr. Who references being thrown around the table. If you play it with a healthy mix of open minded people it is great fun. Lots of laughs and great insights into peoples' personalities. The scoring system is incredibly confusing though and nobody, inlcluding the owner did not get it. Lovely game.

My only problem with this game is that it is possible to break some of its mechanics if you are playing with a really mixed-age group (we regularly play with a few adults and a few children -- it works as long as the adults avoid the temptation of providing a clue that is understood by the adults but too esoteric, abstract, or obscure for the children ...). Otherwise, a brilliant game!

Really cool at first, the initial appeal died down very quickly. However, after picking it up recently, it proved to be quite fun! I guess its just pretty darn group dependent and energy-based. Low creativity/inside jokes (which are now banned) make this game stale. 

It has really little depth though, so don't expect much. It's far better than Apples to Apples/Cards Against Humanity though. Artwork is beautiful too. 

It feels super short.

RATING: 7
Perfect party game for non-gamers who do not like making a fool of themselves. Unfortunately, I prefer party games in which *you do* make a fool of yourself since I think the point of party games is to laugh yourself silly.

This isn't one of those games.

I thought this would have the same feel of Apples to Apples since you are making associations between two disparate things, in this case, a surreal picture and a phrase. However, the point of this game is to create a phrase accurate enough to describe a picture, but vague enough that only some (but not all) players could match that phrase with the picture. Consequently, there isn't much room for creative, witty, or ironic phrases.

For party games that involve creating a phrase given a question or phrase, then players guessing who wrote what, I'd rather play Say Anything or Things ... Humor in a Box. But that said, I'd rather play Dixit with my parents or people I don't know that well, since I don't want to make a fool of myself in front of either,

Might be my favourite game of all time. I just love the lack of rules and the ability to take it as far as you want to. I could see the game being influenced by the group you are playing with but that is one of the best parts of the game. Art is awesome, and it's so funny to hear the explanations of why people chose certain clues or why you chose certain cards based off the clues given. I have never had a bad experience with this game and everyone I have played with has loved it.

Perhaps the celeverest and most attractive party game I've played, but not, critically, the "funnest".

It is actually takes some skill to be obscure enough with your storytelling to get that one vote - many people need to practice stop being so literal with their answers.

I've usually had enough after one round, but I really admire this one - and it's been a huge hit with friends.

Dixit is a party game that is different from what you would typically think of when party game is mentioned. While all players submitting cards is again how the field is populated, everything else is a nice take on the genre. The active player deciding what the "story" is allows for more open ended discussion. The art is gorgeous and well done. Expansions also allow for more cards and different styles of art to enter the game which keeps its replayability high. But while a party game, it can still get old if played too long in one sitting and it is a little tougher to get to the table as it isn't for all groups while other party games are a bit more approachable. Plays up to six if you want to keep score and can go higher if you disregard keeping score and have expansions to keep the draw pile full.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Dixit is certainly a party game.  If you don't like party games, you won't like Dixit.  Occasionally, I love a good party game, one that requires abstract thinking and creativity.  Dixit is a game that lets each player's creativity shine by asking the players to see many aspects the beautifully illustrated images.  Dixit requires serious out of the box thinking, and it can take time to get used to the idea of the game.  The rules are simple to learn, but it's hard to wrap your mind around the best way to play.  

I think the depth of the images leads to a lot of replayability.  Each time I take out the cards to look at them, I find more little details that I hadn't noticed before.  The number one reason to play Dixit is for the art, for the little details that make each card its own work of art; it's good that the game play is about the art or the cards would completely upstage the gameplay.  

I love the first moments of a game with people who have never played because when everyone looks at their first hand of cards, I can see how enchanted everyone is by the fabulous artwork.  That's exactly how I felt when I first picked up Dixit in the store to read the back of the box.  I had no idea what the game was about, but I knew I was going to go home and find out because if the game was even half as good as the artwork, I knew it would be a lot of fun to play.  Luckily, it is as fun to play as it is beautiful.

Very well known gamers party game. Personally i don't like it at all with people who know each other well. It is hard to not give clues that you know some will get and others won't in a game witch is only about it. Sure you don't play Dixit to win but still it is a big flaw for me.

really nice Gateway game for non/new gamer.
the mechanic is very unique for average person and will make them want to play more.

the downside is that I need Expansion to improve the card variety, The core set can only played once or twice with the same group before they draw the same card.

RATING: 5
A party game, not a strategy game. These games usually leave me mostly bored, but I can see how the right people would really enjoy Dixit. The artwork on the cards is delightful and intriguing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
An amazing casual game that works well with just about any group. Great source of laughs and insight into the way your friends' minds work. 

The only downside is that while the cards evoke a number of different interpretations, they are subject to diminishing returns each time they're played. But there are expansion packs that can liven things up again.

RATING: 10
Dixit proves the simplest games can also be the best, with its beautiful, surreal cards and its 30 second rules explanation, I would play this every day given the chance! even though sometimes it can be hard to come up with a clue as the storyteller.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Although suited for almost all ages and with simple enough rules to fit any group of non-gamers in a session, it's not a game for everyone. A certain inclination for the fine arts, perhaps, or a certain dose of storytelling in the party would decidedly be useful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
By itself, Dixit is a game that relies on its individual players to be creative, and create that atmosphere. It is fun. It is light. It is a good light game.

Great game.  Kinda like Apples to Apples, but with pictures instead of words.  I played one game with 8 players and it was too many IMO.  It was a chore to track the points.  I think it's ideal with 4P.

You can be extremely creative in how you give "clues" in this game.  It's hilarious when someone gives a clue that they think is obvious, but none of the players follow the connection they are trying to make.

Description: Storytelling, association, party card game, with beautiful pictures, voting and light humor.
Weight: Pretty light.
Players: 3 to 12 with expansion. Best with 5 or 6.

Impression: Light, beautiful card game that inspires imagination and wit. It consists of huge cards with fantastic and beautiful imagery, full of tiny details and dreamlike motives. The goal is that, on your turn, describe your own card however you like without showing it. Then the other players select a card in secret from their hand that best resembles your card. You then shuffle all the cards and display them for all other players to guess your card by secret voting. The trick is if all players correctly guess your card you get zero points. If no one guesses your card you get zero points. Simple and brilliant. And then it goes in circles. It works very well when you know how other players think.

Likes: Beautiful drawings. Imaginative. Quick and fun.

Dislikes: Not good and very random with more than 6 players. Needs expansions to stay fresh. Expansions have different artists and styles, not always constructive.

An excellent party game that manages to pull of being a game rather than an activity. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice, friendly and calming game that exercises the same 'imagination' brain muscles as games like Mysterum and Spyfall.

The (potentially significant) problem with the gameplay is that pairs of players who have very niche common interests can explot that to massive advantage - undermining the whole game. This is because the best result each round is to give a very cryptic clue that only one other person understands. So if you and your friend are massive Led Zepellin fans you'll probably want to keep making obscure Led Zepellin references to get high scores, effectively aliening the other players from having any chance to score in your turns.

Beautiful surrealistic cards and interesting social game.  Can be tricky playing in a family as you can easily share knowledge/experience as adults that the kids don't have and that's an unfair advantage.  In some ways it's best played with people you know, as it's more random when played with unknown others.

Have played this a few times.  I don't find it as funny as Apples To Apples, but the people that hate A2A because of the arbitrary judging like this.

It's a fine game to bust out in mixed company.  After one round, everyone gets how things works and plays well.  But after a few plays, it can be hard to not use the same clue or even telegraph to a specific person, which card is yours.  More cards would help with that problem, but given the cost of the expansions, that's unlikely to happen.

Decent party-type game.

RATING: 6.7
Look at a card, tell a story in one sentence (or make a literary allusion). Each other player then puts in a card and everyone else at the table has to guess which of the cards you were describing. To score some must guess and others must miss, so the game is about being cryptic enough to confuse some players but clear enough to get at least one on your card.
The mechanism is clever and it has been used in trivia games and the like but this remains more of a party game than a real challenge. Given the right group of players it could be huge fun, but with the wrong players I think it fail rather badly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.9
Changing rating to 6.5, as unless your prepared to buy lots of the expansions it begins to feel repetitive.


After 3 plays : Rating 7.
The wife enjoys this game, so i'm sure it will be get played some more.

Watched on table top.  Not necessarily a game I would pick to play.  As a light filler, could be fun.  However, I would imagine it would need the right crowd.  Wife liked it so...

RATING: 8
The best party game I've played to date.
Choose a card from your hand, give a hint (story, joke, word, gesture etc.) and then have others put down cards as well and guess which card is the right one.

This totally seems like it would be a party game, and exactly the kind of game I'd hate, but it is not.  It is saved by a few very important factors:

1. The scoring system
2. There is no "judging" player selections; there is a distinct right and wrong answer.

These change this from a stupid exercise in forced socialization into an actual Game that is definitely worth playing.

My wife bought this in lateish 2014 - it was not a game I thought either of us had any interest in - and we actually played it on New Years' Eve, with non-gamer friends. And everyone - both my wife and I and the non-gamers - enjoyed it. I can see it getting stale once your group knows all the cards, but I guess that's what the hundreds of expansions are for. It's definitely one of the most enjoyable party games I've played. And we played it for the second time the following New Year - I can see this becoming a tradition now.

RATING: 8
Whole family enjoys it from the 6yo to my wife and I so it has great reach that way. The gameplay is fun - like apples to apples a bit, but I think dixit is a better incarnation of the basic idea. Words are harder to match meanings than a vague description of quirky pictures are. The only complaint I have so far after about a half-dozen plays is that with so few cards, I think people have seen all of them several times and that's a) starting to stifle the "stories" (i.e. it's hard to come up with something no one's heard before) and b) it's easier to guess which card they may be looking at since you've got a sort of catalog of available cards in your head. Still, this one hit an extraordinarily rare niche where EVERYBODY not only likes it but can play it fairly competitively.

The real interesting part is coming up with the sentence that will not be to easy or too hard.  The rest is pretty standard. Fun to be had, but maybe a little light for my taste.

rating after 1 play - 6/7

it's a nice idea and it's nice to be creative but there's not much 'game' here AND it's just not a lot of fun.

having said that the 2 NGs we played with both liked it and wanted to play again which is cool but i don't see yet why this is getting more love than other similar party games...

NOTE - i feel the game is poorly presented - the box is nice but for a game about 'feel' and 'experience' the rules do nothing to draw u into a fantastical surrealy dream landscape of the mind - also the cutesy scoretrack and bunnies is unforgiveable for a non-kids game. lastly i find it inconceivably that for a game of this type the only example for a story-teller in the English rules is a reference to a French film!! y not have some more general examples of things u can say or at least change the reference to suit the language

I had a fun time playing Dixit. It requires the "right sort of people" to play, and its longevity strongly depends on how many cards you have for it. The base game is probably only good for 2-3 plays.

Update: The "right sort of people" probably means "weirdly creative" people or people who make "odd logical leaps".

Our minor houserule for all versions of Dixit: Player who gives 'hint' (plays card) also votes during vote phase for 'best other' card (i.e. card this player thinks suits best to his hint). This way that player doesn't feel 'out of play' during voting phase.

A creative language game that doesn't depend on arbitrary decisions of what's a legal word/sentence/etc. Good! You can actually play it competitively. Cool art.

http://www.transparent.com/esperanto/first_time_abroad_and_at_ijk/ has a photo of people playing Dixit at an Esperanto event in summer of 2011. I have often seen Dixit played at Esperanto events, which is fun, since we share a common language but totally different national cultural backgrounds, so references to old songs and TV shows and such don't play a role as they often seem to when everyone plays in the same national language.

31-08-2014. Rated after 3 plays of various Dixit versions. I am not sure where I stand on this game. IF it's your turn, you play a card and hint/make a story/sing a song that you think symbolizes something on the card you've played. Other players than play a card that they think is similar. Players than vote on which card they think was from the original player. If no one guesses correctly, all other players gain two points. If at least one player guesses correctly both original player and correct guesser gain 3 points. So basically you want to be obscure, but not too obvious. 

I am not sure what I think about this game. I think it's ok, but it'll never become a game that I really, really, really enjoy.

A steady favorite at my house these days. The acting player says a one or two word clue and then each player supplies a card with an image that resembles what the acting player said. There is a twist. If everyone or no one guesses which card belongs to the acting player, the acting player loses points. You have to be able to get only some of the players to guess which card is yours. How you manage this is the secret to the game. This game is light hearted and a lot of fun. You need probably at least two expansions to make this game pop since there are simply not enough cards in the base set.

RATING: 7
This is a visual game where you have to come up with the clues, but you want it so at least some one gets it, but not EVERYONE.  It is quite hard!  I totally suck at it!  But it can be fun and the cards and amusing in themselves! (JW)

RATING: 9.5
One of the most unique board games I've encountered recently. It's a bit like Apples to Apples, but with artwork. I have only two possible negative comments: 1) after about 8-10 games, you start to get used to the cards, and 2) not enough playing chips. It allows for up to 6 players, but this would be a wonderful party game for even more!

Update: We now own Dixit Odyssey, and in one box we store all our cards from Dixits 1, 2, and 3. Also, there is the possibility for up to 12 players (even more for us, since we kept our pieces and voting cards from Dixit 1). I've increased my rating of this game accordingly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Liked this one a lot more than I would have expected. It basically takes the fun part of apples to apples and builds on it, and removes the remaining 90% of apples to apples that sucks. Good fun game. Can't wait for the 12 player version to be available.

Played this game years ago and recently purchased it. It is  a fun, socially interactive game with some point scoring. The abstract art is nice and is like Mysterium's if you've ever played that.

The scoring is a little funky but once everyone knows how it works, it goes smoothly. Definitely give this one a shot as a party game!

--Sep2009-- Particularly delightful pictures, with a strange game reminiscent of Cluzzle (without the modeling part) hanging out in the same box.  It's got potential to work (with the right audience) or bomb royally: it's hard to know before playing whether there'll be frustration or not among the players.  I'm very happy with the game personally - but for a party game, that's not quite enough.

RATING: 8.5
Very fun game, and the cards are all beautifully illustrated. 

Similar to Apples to Apples in the group dynamic. Great for groups with non-gamers. 

Probably going to buy the expansion now that I've gotten to play this one.

The scoring track is kind of a pain, and a notepad is a lot easier I've found.

The release of Mysterium has lowered this game for me a bit, since it scratches that same "what did this person mean by this card" itch, but has a much more interesting gameplay.

This will be one of my favourite games forever. A really pretty game that can change vastly depending on who you're playing it with. One of those rare games where winning is nice but doesn't matter terribly much to the enjoyment of it.

It mashes up really well with other games. (We play a 'Cards Against Dixit' variant, where instead of making up their own clue, each player gets ten random answer cards from 'Cards Against Humanity' and must select their clue from one of these cards.)

Awesome as an opener, a closer, and any time in between.

This is my cup of tea. All in the box are pictures. The acting player has to describe one of your pictures, neither too obvious nor too obscure. Then everyone else try to play a picture to match that description and also guess the one that is played by the acting player. This game is about imagination, driven by players but not by the cards. With imaginative players around, this game can have infinite possibilities. On the contrary, if your friends are all very dull.... OK I know I am gonna badmouth the education in this country. Better stop it.

Just delightful! Great for a group of family or friends. Kids like it too. Their answers tend to be more obvious so their bunny doesn't hop along very quickly. But they love to be involved in the fun. The pictures draw everyone in. Fun study in people and how they think.
All sets are shuffled together for our games.

A great variation on the classic Balderdash where instead of given word people figure out a sentence (often a single world) which best describes a picture (beautiful art in this game) and the others pick a card from their hand which best fits the description. Scoring goes very much like in Balderdash. We had great fun playing with my wife, another couple and my five year old daughter. We all could enjoy the game.

I just played Dixit this weekend, and, yeah, see an Apples to Apples mechanic: As one of the other players, you're given a topic you must attempt to match, and sometimes the random assortment of cards you have match, and sometimes they don't.

As said, the hint-giving mechanic isn't unique, either. Just after Dixit, we played Linq (?), in which you give a hint that's understandable to your partner, but not the other players.

Dixit also isn't immune to the "couple's advantage", in which two players who have "insider's knowledge" can share information unavailable to other players. As a competitive player, myself, a hint I gave was "No, I'm a villager". No points as to what shape a certain shadow in the background was!

That being said, Dixit's surreal images certainly stand out. It's definitely uncommon for a party game to have pictures, and I can't think of any with such striking ones. And you can use the cards as story elements to make your own fairy tale game!

I'll probably pick this one up in trade, or at a deep discount. That's more than I can say for nearly all party games out there!

Pleasant little game that's all about having inside jokes and references with some, but not all of the players, so can be a little frustrating when one person gets locked out of all the references. Still, it's never been too stressful for me and it makes me be just that little bit of imaginative.

Dixit is one of my favorite party games. Each card can have any number of clues based on who's holding it, and that's something you just can't get from a wordy game. The art is charming, beautiful, and at times pretty dark. Excellent game, great fun.

In its most basic form Dixit is a fun diversion, if a little thin. But when you add in a few expansions, the increased variety of illustrations makes the game far more compelling and surprising. It has subtly become one of the best introductory games out there, and one of the freshest takes on party games we've yet seen.

My family (have you noticed a theme for this category?) has loved this one ever since it was published, even though only a few of us can play it with any skill. But winning doesn't matter here, the answers are so delightful and unexpected that asking 'why did you give that clue' is often the most entertaining part of the game. My favorite kind of clue is simply to name myself or another person at the table, and get the wonderful, startling, and awkwardly revealing answers that result.

Love that the game is 'tricking' people into paying money for art, that's delightful.

Visual Appeal: (5)
The original art for this game is amazing. It will nearly always get positive remarks from new players. The game looks compact and attractive on the table.

Component Quality: (5)
The cards are over-sized and easy to see. They seem durable enough to remain un-sleeved and still last a long time. Bunny Meeples make a nice score keeper, although the scoring track is a little hard to follow.  

Theme: (4)
The game is what you make of it. It has as much theme as Pictionary until you start telling stories. I routinely play with writers, musicians, and other artistic persons who really bring the pictures alive and make some challenging choices for the listeners.

Learning: (5)
This game takes under 10 minutes to teach, and I've taught to 8 year-olds and 60 year-olds. I recommend letting the players look through all the pictures before playing. It benefits your stories if you know what other players might be holding. The rulebook for my edition came in many languages, but I think each only required one page for the rules.

Gameplay: (4)
I think there is some great interaction in this game. Some of the best moments are thinking of that story that only one other person at the table will relate to. Instead of feeling left out of the joke, other players are encouraged (and rewarded) by the game to attempt to draw others to choose their card instead.

Overall Fun: (5)
I have played this game all over the place. It is a short, simple game that is friendly to everyone willing to let their creative juices flow. I've been impressed by some of the people I've met and the things they came up with. Playing with new people actually makes the game more entertaining rather than a drag to re-teach and re-work a group dynamic.

Dixit took me completely by surprise. I had never even heard of it when I sat down at a table in the Cannes fair. And the five of us (who usually like "gamers" games) were totally convinced by the experience.

It's a game that can be enjoyed by everybody : the rules are extremely simple and the poetry will appeal to your average non-gamer. Still the agonizing choice of the right expression (when it's your turn) or of the right picture (when you have to vote) will remind gamers of much heavier games.

A wonderful piece of art, mainly thanks to the beautiful artwork by Marie Cardouat.

5.17.10 - (5 plays) Very cool game. Not as fun with less than five players though. 
My only problem with this game is that instead of giving creative clues, or clues that stem from literature, music, and movies, it turns into a series of clues based on inside jokes that only one other player would get. This isn't in the true spirit of the game, and though I think this practice takes away some fun in the game, I find I still do it myself. Guess I'm not as creative as I thought I was.

5.17.17 - (13 plays) Mysterium appears to have replaced Dixit in our group.

It's a game for creative and intuitive individual. This is one game I don't really care about winning and only care about guessing what people are thinking. One of the best party game ever. Love how the abstract pictures can be different interpretation between other players. Love the artwork. Love the simplicity. Love being a good clue giver

This game is really fantastic. Sometimes I'm a little nervous to start a game of Dixit because I don't know if I'll be creative enough to come up with good suggestions. But after a round or two, everyone usually really starts to get into the flow and come up with great stuff. It's especially great with 5 to 6 players so that there are plenty of cards to choose from. The style of this game requires the art to be very interesting, and luckily it is. The art can evoke a lot of different responses, and it's beautiful to look at as well.

A party game of sorts, but without much of a humorous side...and it works.  The premise is simple but effective - come up with something clear enough that some players will choose it, but not so obvious that everyone will.  I love the surreal and slightly twisted children's book-style artwork, which is not only visually interesting but cleverly manages to support the mechanics of the game.

RATING: 4
Never played Apples to Apples or Say Anything before so I don't know how this one stands up to them. But it's fun! The ambiguous artwork gives the game character and makes it tick, and is best combined with thoughtful, ambiguous sentences. The game suffers a little in that it's good to play with experienced players to understand their tendencies, but the more you play, the more predictable the cards are. Bring on expansions!

The game can be really biased in favor of the player who happens to have cards that fit the sentence well, but it's a party game; who cares.

I don't like this as much as other people since so much of the game comes down to a blind guess between A and B. The "I picked this because of that time I blah blah, lolz!" afterward isn't always worth it.

Es precioso. Tiene unas cartas enormes con unos dibujos muy bonitos.
Juego psicológico, donde tienes que adivinar la carta que juega cada jugador en su turno, solo con la pista de una frase, sonido, palabra, canción o gesto.
Le ha encantado a todo el mundo que ha jugado.
Las 2 grandes pegas que le veo, es que me parece un juego muy caro para lo que es (unas cartas por 25 euros) y me dá que tiene muy poca rejugabilidad.

RATING: 7.5
Cardgame of guessing the described card supported with very nice illustrations. 
I have found that the game could be a bit boring at times if you do not have cards that are matching the cards of other people. But this might be more a problem when adding the expansion(s), I didn't have the feeling very often with the base game only.
On the other hand, the replayability of the game just with the base set and the same group of people is a bit limited as you start struggling with not using the same phrases for the cards.

At its heart, Dixit requires people to think out of the box, but not too much. Toss in some highly surreal illustrations and some personal creativity, and this game can spring a lot of surprises when people explain the reason why they described their card so.

The only major caveat is that the game can be killed if the group insists on only using inside jokes and pop culture references when playing with people who aren't familiar with them. The nature of the game rewards inside references, so some self-regulation is needed on behalf of the group depending on who is playing. That aside, this is one party game deserving of its popularity.

I like Dixit. It's a beautiful game with a fun social mechanism that always has your group laughing and chatting. In the end, it's a very light game with an easy to learn system and gorgeous cards.  I'm not as picky about abstract art as some other people might be, so I just think it's all beautiful and awesome.

[3 plays] The artwork is just fantastic, the quality of all components is very high, and the length of the game seems just right for a party game. I look forward to trying this with kids to see how they handle the imagination of the storytelling part.

We played with all adults, so we were a bit cautious , using mostly single word descriptions at first rather than "storytelling", but we did get a bit bolder with time. I enjoyed how this game played, the psychology of trying to get into the thoughts of the other players.

Most recent play 12-23-09 with Barb, Ruth, and the Davis clan.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Party, Creative. Sort of a visual Apples To Apples, we enjoyed it. I'd really like to have the base + expansion, otherwise you see the same cards every game.

It takes a play or two to "get the hang of it" then it seems quite enjoyable thinking of just the right clue to score the best, or choosing the right card to match someone else's clue. Also seems like it would benefit from multiple plays with the same group of players.

Incredibly art, always goes down a treat. Really fun but does get a smidgen old seeing the same cards over and over. It is also funny to see how non-gamers who dislike the competitive nature of heavier games will then try to game the hell out of Dixit with their dinky little clues that only their significant other should get. Makes me think that everyone has that competitive side if the games barrier for entry is low enough.

This game was described to me as better than Apples to Apples, but unfortunately I don't share that opinion. Whilst it was interesting to play, and I'd not be against other games, I definitely prefer the more fixed word based Apples to Apples. I think Dixit would be an amazing game whilst on an Acid Trip though, listening to Jefferson Airplane's White Rabbit...

Best with 5+ players.

This game makes everyone happy! Its design weakness is that with players who know each other it can pretty much be ruined with "insideer information" (not that anyone I've played with has abused this, but it's the elephant in the room)

Plays logged under Dixit Odyssey.

[hr]Actually, nto sure about my criticism anymore. I think if you think abstractly enough you can get a read on people even without knowing their inside jokes. Really, really try to get in their head, and you'll get some results whether you know what they're talking about or not.

This is perhaps the only party game that I can truly admit being fond of; Dixit speaks to my English Major roots, wherein the creativity of the group in relation to the card art becomes the source of fun.

Played once at BGG Con 2010.  With a group of creative writers or artists this would be an excellent game.  With any other group it's liable to be a dull affair.  Imagination and humor are necessary to plumb the depths of these images.

Might be fun to construct a bogus Tarot deck from this game and see what you can read into the images.  Might be a worthwhile purchase for that reason alone...

The rule where you only want to give enough hints that only 1 or 2, but not all, persons to guess your choice is very clever. Other than that, the game felt boring very quickly. Play a card and say a word (rarely a sentence in my experience), and guess, then you score. Repeat. Fun for the first 10 or so minutes and then died off pretty quickly for me.

Not what you'd call a gamer's game, but a lot of fun with the right crowd. I had initially been worried about the replayability, but the fact that the "storyteller" wants some people to get it but not everyone to get it means that it will remain challenging, even with the same group and the same cards. The rabbits and integrated scoreboard are cute, but not great at doing what they need to do (the rabbits fall over easily and the spaces are too small to know for sure which one you're on half the time).

Dixit is a great, inventive game. It has a few major flaws that keep it from perfection, however, with the biggest being that it seems to encourage inside jokes between players that know each other well (leaving others left out). I love the basic idea behind it, but perhaps it could have benefited from some sort of advanced ruleset with more restrictions and guidelines? It is, however, a very fun game with the right group of players.

I played this game several times with a group of friends and just love it.  Anyone that has played this game always asks to play it again and that is a great testimonial of how fun it is.  Essentially you hold 6 random cards with beautiful illustrations on them.  Each player must decide on a card that matches the word or story told by the "story teller".  After each player selects a card that matches the story teller's word or story they lay their card face down with the other player's cards in the middle of the table.  The pile is shuffled and that cards are then flipped over and bet on. It's very light but very fun for the group.

RATING: N/A
A very simple story-telling game where players take turns:
1. Choosing a picture from cards in their hand
2. Making a short (one sentence) story to describe the card (being as abstract as they want)
3. Other players pick cards from their hands that could match that story
4. Then players have to look at the picked cards and guess which one was played by the storyteller
Points are awarded to players who correctly guess, and to players who owned cards that others guessed.  The storyteller gets points for each person who got it right, unless everyone did, in which case the storyteller gets nothing.  The idea is to make the story clear enough that some people will guess, but not enough that everyone will.

I'm not a huge party game fan, but this game is excellent.  There's plenty of room for creativity in trying to kind of suggest what your card is without totally being obvious and the voting allows for some nice additional discussion.  I also like how the game has a definitive end.  Best played with 5 or 6 for sure.

RATING: 5
The first time I played this game, I loved it.  I thought it was so clever and innovative and beautiful.  The second time I played it, I didn't enjoy it nearly as much.  It doesn't seem like there is a "game" in here.  I will say that the 2nd play was with 9 players which makes the guessing next to impossible (with that many players, someone is bound to have a card that also matches the clue as well or better than the clue giver).  In the 2nd game, the new players loved it... but those playing for the 2nd time consistently felt it fell flat.  It seems like Dixit is more of a creativity exercise than a game.  And while there is nothing wrong with that, it is an exercise that gets old... in my case after a single play.

If you have a chance to play this game - I wholeheartedly recommend it.  You will almost certainly enjoy it.  I don't recommend buying.

I've had great fun playing this with my ex-girlfriends Dad, Aunt & Uncle. Really awesome to have such a great party game to introduce to non-gamers that they will enjoy, particularly when her Aunt is an Artist ^^

Pros
- Great artwork
- Fun casual game for a group of 5-6 people
- Very easy to teach

Cons
- You will see 90% of the cards in the box in one play-through, reducing replayability

A fun game that's easy to teach and enjoyable with a group of people; however, lack of replayability becomes a negative quickly, and I couldn't see myself losing several hours to this game wondering where the time went.

Sorta like Barbarossa and Cluzzle: give a (verbal, in this case) clue then hope that some people figure it out and others don't. Like Apples to Apples, play depends partly on being lucky enough to have the right cards in hand, and partly on knowing the judge well enough to understand what they're thinking when they give those weird awful clues. The images are really pretty cool, but it's just not generally my kind of game.

Lovely cards, the artwork is just awesome. And there is tons of stuff on each of the cards. Great replayability.

Best to play with group of people you know, you can target your clues on just some of them and it's really enjoyable to mess with the others by giving cards that fit almost perfectly on those ambigous clues. It's a great game. And also I think it brings people together.

The thing I love most about this game is it is one of the few that goes over well with the designer board game crowd as well as the party game crowd.  It's even more fun when it becomes a social experience as well.  For example, one of the stories that was told in one of our games was "Tony (that's me) loses his virginity".  It was all in good fun and we all had a great laugh as we flipped over the pictures of what made an embarrassing series of possible events.

This game is so fun and yet so simple to play. I guess Dixit could actually work better if you know who you're playing with but it still works pretty well with "foreigners". Liked it a lot. Playable in all languages!

It needs expansions because if players most of the time are the same, which is more than normal as in a gaming group, a good bunch of pictures become obsolete and the re-playability suffers from that. Some of the drawings are ambiguous enough to allow some creativity when picking something to say while others are more obvious and players tend to think on them always in the same manner.

A good idea is to choose a theme to go for and try it but then again players should not exaggerate on creativity because that makes the game almost unplayable. I like to play Dixit with the certain amount of creativity and realism, sort of speaking.

Another Family/party game?  Ugh.  But wait.  This one has cool art and hold the phone: Thinking is involved.  This cool little game is good fun.  We player gets dealt a hand of cards.  The cards are all interesting paintings.  The storyteller, describes one of his cards and places it face down on the table and each other player adds a card to the pile.  Then the cards are mixed up and revealed.  The storyteller wants the others to pick his card, but he gets no points if every other player picks his card, so the “story” has to be descriptive enough for most of the other players to guess the right card but not obvious enough so everybody does.  

We haven’t turned this into a drinking game yet but I am sure that is on the horizon.

Relaxing and fun with a good group. Kind of like Apples to Apples without the ridiculous subjectivity. Extremely well-designed game with a scoring mechanism that is self balancing - brilliant! Very swingy but in a good way.

A few minor negatives. The rabbit meeples are too light and the spaces on the board are too small. I found that if the board was bumped even a little, the pieces would be scattered. Also, I could see the image cards getting old after a few plays, but that's what expansions are for I suppose. 

Other than those things, it's a great light-hearted competitive and creative game.

Good party game which works with gamers and non-gamers alike.  It can be a bit slow to get going, until everyone gets into the groove, but once a few hands have been played everyone tends to get used to giving clues.  You'll need an expansion or two pretty quickly if you play it a lot.

Everyone loves this, and it engages non-gamer as well as gamer.

There is an issue about giving away hints to specific people, which is a great tactic. This gets worse with time as you can build clues on previous clues for specific cards. I still adore the game, it's so pretty.

I used to enjoy the 'dictionary game' a lot. This is just like that,except that it uses surrealistic pictures instead of arcane words. I though it was entertaining, but not something I'd  want to play every week. I guess a lot depends on the people you play with.

Such a great party game.  Without the expansions it gets boring if you play with the same group of people, but I almost always crack this out when new people come over to play.  It's a great icebreaker and super easy to teach.

RATING: 8.5
I'm not normally a fan of party games, but sometimes need something to play with non-gamers. Dixit is perfect for that. I can teach it to anybody in a minute or two, and I find it far more interesting and enjoyable than Apples to Apples, Cranium, or the other candidates out there.

The artwork on the cards is not only attractive, but perfectly suited to the requirements of the game. The artist can't be praised highly enough. The pictures are so evocative, detailed yet ambiguous, containing sufficient interesting details to support myriad associations and keep the game fresh through successive plays.


[update] This was the perfect game for our family gathering over the holidays. Everybody enjoyed it, and it was requested day after day. I'll definitely pick up Dixit 2 as well for the extra cards.

A very good party game which is accessible to children.  Good rules and entertaining.  The cards are very well done.  

The board is also the insert, which is terrible, because if you buy the expansion cards, there is no way to pack them in the original box, but that box is mostly empty air.  For any designers or publishers reading this.  Do not do this. I like packing my expansions in my main box.

RATING: 2
Wow, I can't believe the glowing reception this game is getting here.  After 2 plays I was done with it.  There are glaring problems with it--there are just not enough cards to keep it interesting for the story teller...after one play you've seen almost the entire deck.  If played with the same pool of people, it's far too easy to tailor the 'story' to people who've played with you before.  Its far too subject to shared experience clues which would be impossible for others to guess.  And it's far to subject to generation specific clues--clues given between 30 yearswill be impossible for someone in their 50s to get, for example.

To be honest, the game is borderline broken after just a few plays, and is certainly nearly impossible to bring new people into unless the experienced players purposefully handicap themselves to keep it interesting and remotely plausible for a new player to be competitive.

The only interesting thing that remains in the game is finding something in your own hand which might get picked for points.  Unfortunately that is extraordinarily luck-based as it is not uncommon to find absolutely nothing in your hand that even remotely has anything to do with the given clue.  Or on occasion, you might find something in our hand which matches the clue exactly, or even better than the card played by the storyteller.  Unfortunately this has nothing to do with any skill or wit used by the players.

For a similar style of game play you'll get FAR FAR more life out of the base set of Apples to Apples.

As a professional artist, I find it annoying that everyone professes how great the game will be for artists.  Yeah, interesting once or twice....

Very creative game. Require high creativity from players to give creative/atypical clues to make a fun mind-guessing game, otherwise it easily becomes a boring picture/clue guessing one.

I digs it!  Such a brilliant little design, and brilliantly executed too!  Prior to learning the game, I just thought the art looked weird.  But after finally playing Dixit, I have a much greater appreciation for the artistic styling.  And most importantly, it's a very fun and funny game with the right number of people (I'm guessing 4-6 would be the sweet spot).  If I could complain about anything, it's that I wish there were more cards provided (though I guess that's been done through a few expansions).  And this complaint is nearly nullified when you consider the fact that not only are the cards oversized, but each of the 84 cards is an individual work of art.  I'm just not exactly sure what's up with those rabbit/squirrel meeples...  But great party game for a small group!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 8/10

Quite fun party game. I don't think the scoring mechanism adds much since in my experience the outcome is effectively random, but maybe it helps keep people engaged. (Or maybe I just think that because I haven't played with a bunch of master manipulators.)

Honestly, though, I'd rather just play EPYC/Broken Picture Telephone, which takes the "describe weird picture" part and cranks it up to eleven. It's just a lot more fun.

A party game which doesn't feel stupid or shallow; I found it to be a lot better if you play with long-term friends or people you have shared memories with. The art is simply gorgeous. Caveat: some hyper-analytic types have had trouble with this game (as in "I don't get it. Is that all?")

RATING: 9
One of My All-Time Favorite Games. People can say it is basically Apples to Apples with a twist, but to me it is much more. I love the creative freedom this game allows. It's a game where you can say, act, squeal, or bark whatever you want with no rules to bog you down (e.g. taboo, pictionary). The cards contain beautifully designed artwork, and as it says so on the box itself, "a picture is worth a thousand words" as compared to 1 word/phrase (e.g. apples to apples, cards against humanity). While all the other games have their merits, to me Dixit brings out the best. 
Even when the winner was already determined we would still continue to play until the deck ran out just so that we can have the chance to give another hint or bait someone else into picking our card. I love it. What a wonderful game that is easy to teach and can be enjoyed by anyone. I guess the only vices to this game is that with multiple plays the cards may start getting redundant and people who do not enjoy games involving creative thinking may not get into the game as much. But generally, most people will enjoy this game. I found out that the game can be even MORE fun in teams of two. If you pair someone who isn't into creative thinking with someone who is, it usually becomes a more enjoyable experience for the uninterested. So this game scales well in bigger groups. I look forward to playing this game much more.

Dixit is a party game. A really good one, but still a party game. What's so good about it is that even non-gamers like to play it and it's suitable for all ages so it's worth having around.

The art is simply beautiful. Even for the art itself it's worth the price.

The only downside is the box. The bunnies always fall. The inner box should have a lid for easier carrying around. A shame they didn't include it. Also the scoring track should have been a separate one like in Carcassonne.

Works with 4 but better with more

Indeed, it is very good game, but not without a flaws. There's no storytelling but just associations. Depending on players, some sessions will be better and some worser. Re-playabiliy is good, but with some limits -- after a few plays with the same gamers will be too used to the pictures. Nonetheless, ideal for families and large groups.

[Libellud 2008 edition] {Party; creativity, story-telling; optimal 5-6p} Dixit is not a ground-breaking party game.  The voting mechanic (not to get all votes / no vote) is used in other games.  However, it does implement that system to its best.  Players really need to create a sentence / word / story so that it's neither too easy nor too difficult for other players to guess his card.

It has a potential to be a good party game.  It's easy to teach and learn.  It's fun.  It's interactive.  It can be wild with enough creativity.  It's language neutral.  I have a worry that its replayability is not good (Well, all similar games, such as Pictionary, Squint, etc. have the same problem.)  In all, I highly recommend this party game.  (French games are usually special in a collection: likely to be fresh and entertaining.)

Dixit is a beautiful game.  The components are nicely illustrated and are stylish.  The cards are stunningly beautiful and colorful.  The rabbit pawns are vivid.  If each voting token was uniquely illustrated, it'd be perfect.

This is an excellent game from first-time designer.  Looking forward to more Jean-Louis's games!

I was interested in trying this game because I thought it would be a good experience for my kids...work a creative part of their brain.

After playing it...I don't like it.  I really don't enjoy giving the clues.  We are not that great in giving clues as a family either so the answer tends to be obvious.  I do kind of like trying to tailor a clue to someone to try to improve my score but it's just not enough for me to want to keep it.  I liked it the first time because the cards have fascinating/weird art work.  Once you have seen them all though it was hard to give new clues each time we play.

My 5 year old daughter likes it a lot though.

Very fun party game. It's quite metagame dependent though - you might get pissed if a subset of your group kept using in-jokes or internet memes to collude for points. Played with close friends from similar backgrounds, this is the ultimate party game. However, in a mixed group, the "right" way to play Dixit is to try to exclude the people who are *least* in the inner circles - which can make Dixit an incredibly insular and mean game, least fun for those who need to be included the most.

Great family game.  It is a favorite in my house.  Our 5 year old daughter is able to play on her own and she's the wild-card because you never know how she comes up with why she's selecting a particular card -- it makes sense to her, but everyone gets a laugh out of it and usually everyone is rewarded by her randomness.  Recommend, just kind of weird artwork.

Relating to Apples to Apples (which I loathe) I love this game for two main reasons:

1. It uses your imagination.
2. There is not just one judge deciding the random lucky winner. It uses a voting system.

Those two simple combinations make the game enjoyable to me. 

Apple to Apples gets very old, even when playing with a different group. Since Dixit uses your imagination, every time you play with a different group, there are lots of laughs because of all the crazy ideas people have as to what the cards remind people of.

Amazing artwork, worth buying just to look at the cards.
The first time you play it you sit there with a giant smile on your face from the pictures and the game play. You think this is a game you will love for ever.
But the game concept doesnot take many plays before it get repetative.
Best play with people you dont know, because a winning strategy is , boringly, to give clues your partner knows. Which is very boring the second time.

Awesome game for such simple rules. If you take on the scoring, even small kids can play it.

Another thing which makes this game great is that it's vastly different depending on the people you play with. Everyone has a different mind and you can see that very clearly in this game.

After some plays when you see the same cards again and again, you wish for all fresh ones but for that they made expansions.

It's an imaginative game without theme or real goal but just for the sake of imagining things. If you can live with that, get it!

Played 2+ times.  A pretty neat game in the style of apples to apples but with pictures instead of adjectives.  The artwork is gorgeous.  I think a knowledge of the cards would help you with the game; ie. knowing what themes people might have cards for.  And without expansions I think that it would loose replay-ability for me but I've only played once so it's just a gut feel. **UPDATE**  The cards have way more detail than I realized at first glance.  There is a lot of opportunity for different cards to appeal to very different themes because of all the little subtle details.  Rating up but still probably won't play it that often. 2009/07/05

Dixit is fun, but it will take a few plays to get that right balance of not too obvious clues.  We played with the full range of players recently and had an amazing good time.  Everyone picked up on the clue giving perfectly.  It is gorgeous and I'm already drooling for the expansion cards

update : I find Dixit best with 6.  You don't have to be on point as much and you can enjoy other player's creativity more often.

I typically describe this game to friends a Apples to Apples with French surrealist artwork. While it isn't necessarily the best description of the game, it tends to get people on board quickly.

Like Apples to Apples this is a game about knowing the people you play with. It has a slightly more complicated scoring system that, in practice, creates a nice tension between making clues too difficult and too easy. There's a sense of creative license here that simply isn't found in Apples to Apples and is found to a still-lesser extent in Cards Against Humanity. And it's that combination of solid, tested party-game mechanics with creative spice that makes this game so brilliant at the table.

I feel like this game is deserving of a ten. The artwork alone makes me think I'll always enjoy leafing through the cards ... we'll see how I feel in a half-year or so.

RATING: 7
Feels a bit like a roleplaying game, in that players have to want to play along to get any real experience. Good fun with the right players, though.

Weaker points is the ability for sub-groups of players to form "knowledge-circles", where say two couples will consistently guess each other's clues, but never the other couple's, which makes the game insular rather than encompassing.

RATING: 7
It works as a party game if you dont like party games this will not work for you. It's not really unique as I think the scoring mechanic is based on Balderdash or something that came later. The clever part is where you subtely suggest the card but not say it overtly. After the novelty wears off I am not sure how much more I want to play it. It is repetitive which is a similar concern, i.e. the game state doesnt really change it's the same thing over and over. The rating is more about how well the game works, how clean the rules are, if I had to rate on how enthused I am about playing it again more like 6.5

Dixit is a light, party-type game in the lineage of Apples to Apples that uses (beautiful) illustrations instead of words. To its credit, it is certainly more creative than A2As and more of a "game" in its scoring and judging mechanics. While the illustrations are wonderful, one downside to the game is that you'll most likely cycle through them all in a single play through. I do not really find this a detraction, but if you do, you can always buy the expansions to add more cards to the game. Overall, an enjoyable take on the A2A formula that requires a certain level of buy-in and creativity from its players.

Dixit is excellent for many reasons. For one, it's an accessible game to all ages. I've played this with family, friends, non-gamers, gamers, and children (7+).

It's a simple yet elegant game with amazing art. Give a clue that isn't too obvious, but obvious enough at least 1 other person will get it. The art work is awesome and there's times where you're like "Wow, everyone's clue is really good".

I never hesitate to pull this one out in casual situations.

Played this game twice and was already starting to feel like the cards were getting stale. Biggest issue I could see is that once you start associating certain cards with certain ‘stories’ it makes it harder to look at those cards more independently/ creatively. I do see this on the short list for some friends next holiday season, though).

Eleinte ódzkodtam tôle, mert ezek a mesélôs játékok nem igazán jönnek be, de akkor még nem tudtam mirôl van szó. Anno régen, kb 30 évvel ezelôtt mi mûár játszottunk ilyet:  valaki az Értelmezô Kéziszótárból kinézett egy olyan szót, amit senki sem ismert , majd mindenki a fantáziája alapján írt az adott szóhoz egy jelentést. És ugyanúgy ahogy itt is, a végén a "mesélô" felolvasta a magyarázatokat, amelyek között ott volt persze a valós is. Aki eltalálta a valóst pontot kapott, akinek a magyarázatára szavazott valaki szintén pontot kapott. Most olvastam Simulacrumnál hogy már van egy nagyon hasonló játék: Defintiy

Féltem, hogy a kártyák kicsi klesznek, de ezk a nagy lapok nagyszerûek. Tény, hogy a rajzokhoz "elborult" elme kellett:D de nagyon jók.  A pontozás brilliáns: hiába játszod egy összeszokott társasággal, rá vagy kényszerítve hogy mindig új dolgot találj ki egy adott kártyához, különben nem kapsz pontot! Az egyetlen kis gixer: hogyha a társaságban van olyan, aki valamilyen szempontból "kilóg" a többiek közül, akkor ezt "meg lehet lovagolni" és kissé lehet befolyásolni tudatosan a pontokat. Például a játékosok között vannak hárman, akik egy osztályba jártak a középiskolában és az egyik tanárra tettek valamilyen becenevet. Akkor a többi játékos számára ez a becenév nem jelent semmit. A mesélô ehhez a becenévhez tesz ki kártyát és nyilvánvaló, hogy lesznek akik el fogják találni:)

A pontozósáv ötletes, tetszik; hogy miért pont nyulak a bábuk? Ez a sok elvont rajz után már nem is kérdés ; akár kilyukadt fürdôkádak is lehetnének;)

A very fun and simple guessing party game.  It is a breath of fresh air to me that a party game can involve pictures associated with phrases but not require drawing of any kind.  My only negative here is I would like it to play more players, but overall this is a fun game.  

Right now it still has that new niceness to it since I just picked it up, so this might drop to a more realistic 8 in the future.

A highly enjoyable lateral-thinking party game for the whole family. The artwork is quite lovely and has many ways it can be interpreted.  The rules are very explainable for the most part (the scoring can confuse non gamers and kids.)  Its easy to pick up and play and very versatile.  I'd like for it to be a "Party" game though rather than playing such a small group as it does out of the box... but that's what expansions are for.

RATING: 9.2
‘Dixit’ is a game with light rules that nonetheless manages to tap deep aspects of social cognition. If you are a person who revels in acts of interpretation, who enjoys reading people as much as exploring layers of subtext in literature and the visual arts, then chances are you will appreciate the unique invitation that ‘Dixit’ represents. It is an invitation to play with meaning.

Players are dealt hands of cards, with each card bearing a unique complex image. There are two basic roles for players. In the primary role, you will be asked to select a card from your hand (unbeknownst to other players) and use it to create an utterance that “matches” the image. That’s right, any utterance. You can recite the whole Gettysburg Address (in Klingon, if you wish); you can hum a few bars of ‘Ain’t Misbehavin’; or you can issue a monosyllabic grunt. But you should know that for whatever utterance you do make, the other players, in keeping with their secondary role, will secretly choose one image from their own hands that they feel best matches your “hint”. Then you will gather the cards bearing their selections, shuffle them, and spread them out onto the table such that your own card is included amongst the many foils.

After scrutinizing the the images, the other players will then simultaneously indicate which on display is the “true” inspiration of your utterance. Scoring is structured so that you are rewarded for offering clever clues–meaning an utterance that is neither too hard nor too easy to interpret. (If either everyone or no one chooses your card, you get bupkis.) In their secondary roles, other players will score points if they correctly interpret your utterance, and/or if they manage to deceive other players into choosing *their* foil.

Similar metacognitive “voting” mechanisms have been used before. But what makes ‘Dixit’ tick–and in an astonishingly novel way–is the artwork on the cards. Simply put, ‘Dixit’ features the most brilliantly evocative art that I’ve encountered in any game, bar none. Marie Cardouat has graced the game with hundreds of little expressionist gems that look as if they were pulled from the pages of a Jungian fairy tale. In terms of style, the illustrations are at times childlike, dreamlike, and often are subtly unsettling. Like imagery on Tarot cards, Cardouat’s compositions beg to be puzzled over. And in this capacity, they preserve the most crucial functionality of the game.

Ultimately, what makes the ‘Dixit’ worth returning to again and again, is its easy enchantment, not only with respect to what is “seen” in the cards, but in the predictions you are asked to make about others’ interpretations, and vice versa. The poetry cuts both ways, as you are both the interpreter and a text that is being interpreted. This also means that the tenor of the game is highly influenced by the personality of the individuals playing it. Depending on the group, your game may be punctuated by introspective “Aha’s” or by raucous laughter. Or both. To me, this is not just the sign of a great party game, but of a great game period.

Well...kind of ok game. It's a lot like "Nobody's perfect" except that instead of words this is about pictures. There isn't much going on and there are similiar Partygames which are much better for laughs. I would play it again, but Dixit is just not funny enough to be a good party game. I guess I don't need to mention, that it also lacks the depth to be a "real" game. So yeah...Dixit ends up in the no mans land of being a simple party game that's just not terribly funny.

Absolutely brilliant. I have played this game with many people and it always seems to make for a good time. It is thoughtful, deep, interactive, creative, social and great for bonding with friends and family. The artwork is gorgeous, and if you ever get sick of them, there are plenty of expansions to mix it up. This is what Cards Against Humanity should have been - it can be just as funny, yet with more choice, more thinking, and more bonding with those around you. The insights you get into the people you are playing with are much more gratifying than who can draw the dirtiest card. I will never tire of this game, and it will stay in my collection forever.

Cute, light party game. Nothing really groundbreaking here, but Dixit is pleasant enough. The artwork for the most part is interesting and the game tends to generate at least a few laughs. Update: Rating boosted from 8 to 9 as this game continues to grow on me and continues to see table time. One of the better party games out there.

RATING: 7.5
This is one of those games that is only as fun as the people playing it.  True of any party game, I guess.  I would probably give this game a lower score if my nieces and nephews didn't love it so much.  The mark of any good party game is the laughter it creates and this one seems to have an abundance of it.  The kids are fully engaged and thoroughly entertained while playing this game with us.  Adults must play fairly with the kids, though, because adults can easily give clues that the kids don't understand and outscore them.  If you are looking for a fun game that won't exclude the kids, then this is a great choice.

RATING: 7.5
This is best with the full complement (6 players), but it is still very fun with 4 and certainly 5. The card art is quite good and thought provoking for the most part, but there are some that could have a little more detail. Anyway, the idea of the game is nothing new, but is quite fun as it really brings out the creative side of people and it is a nice little challenge to try to guess what the story teller was thinking. Must be played with the right crowd to be good though.

RATING: 2
The game concept is fantastic:  Balderdash with pictures instead of words.  But the card art is deeply disturbing.  At best, the people depicted are melancholy.  Most appear to be wildly depressed.  Candles drip blood, a mounted deer head cries while a cat watches, a couple lives inside a grinder... I feel like I'm taking a Rorschach test.  Awful.

Another take on the 'bidding' party game ala Wits & Wagers.  I like it and easy to play.  It really was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.  I can see it becoming repetitive after repeated plays.  I guess that is what the expansions are for.

This light party game is based on a beautiful surreal art and it's a pleasure to see it on the table. More importantly it is highly dependant on the group you're playing with. If you have bunch of friends who are on the same wave as you are it can be awesome and you can learn one or two interesting things about others. On the other hand if you have poeple who are not that open you can experience quite a boring session based on simple symbol searching on cards.

This should be called "Ditch this"! "Hey, I have an idea. We can play this game that won the Spiel des Jahres award in 1985 - no - I mean, in 2010. The one with the beautiful and elegant Little Prince artworks, that could be found in lots of children's books. The one where we can rave about how it inspires the fantasy because of these tremendous illustrations and then find out that it's best to only say one word describing the pictures as opposed to tell a real story, because you didn't offer any contact surface and keeping it vague is way better as it fits better to more pictures. The one where we can drink some wine as it fits to the elegance of the whole game and we won't be in danger of spilling the costly wine we're drinking while playing this game, because there won't be laugh attacks like in Nobody's perfect. Or any of the fun from Cluzzle from which it also copied mechanisms." 

Now on a serious note: I feel disillusioned that this won Spiel des Jahres. In a way it compares to Nobodys perfect. A game from almost 20 years ago. And it doesn't even vaguely come close. And this one wins Spiel des Jahres? What drove their minds? It's so arbitrary to say "Let's go with party games this year" no matter what else was released. If you look at the nominees it seems like this was the decision making progress. For me this is hardly a game and I'm in total disbelief as to how many people buy into the hype.

I'd rather play Monopoly.

This is basically the only "party game" that I've ever loved, and boy, do I love it.

'Dixit 1' - original game. 

Cons: Only material for 6 players and board (score track) integrated as part of box. Only room for one set of cards. Dixit Odyssey fixed all these issues. Get that too!

Great game for both gamers and non-gamers of all ages. Love the odd, imaginative, dreamlike images. The game benefits from multiple expansions. 

I have eight set of 84 cards so far (i.e. 672 in total). I typically use ~84 cards for each game but change set from round to round. I have mixed up the first four sets but so far kept the newest sets separate due to their differences in drawing style and mood. However, I could see mixing these up if the decks grow old. 

Overview images of each set of 84 cards are available from the Dixit homepage to allow sorting the cards back into the original sets.

Like Cards Against Humanity, there doesn't seem to be much replayability. Once you've seen all of the cards then future plays aren't as fun, and the gameplay isn't all that interesting to begin with.

Update: Another issue with the game is that your best move can sometimes be really unfun for most of the group. For instance, in a recent game I gave a clue that was basically an inside joke between myself and one of the players. Since the clue was essentially a made-up word for which the other players had no reference, they just had to hope to get some points completely at random.

There can also be an issue if there is a generation gap between some of the players, or if they have completely different knowledge backgrounds.

After more plays, I still don't see why this game is so appealing to so many gamers.

Dixit is a fun 30 minute game where you can come up with the most random words or sentence to have some of your play mates guess your card :) 

I have had a few games now with board-gamers and non-board-gamers. This has created some interesting moments trying to guess which one was the players card or just choosing the right card to put down. Also I won one game :)

Dixit does what it's supposed to do: spark creativity and provoke a few laughs. It's a party game and a good one at that. Unfortunately, playing a party game does not scratch the gaming itch for me. I like more objective results over subjective ones as are prevalent in Dixit. But one thing keeps Dixit from dropping to a 6.5...it was the first game I got my mom to play! That was a HUGE breakthrough for me.

One of the most original games (if not the most) I have ever played. The art on the cards is stunningly beautiful and creative, and the mechanic super simple yet highly replayable because it counts on your imagination to make the most of it. I think you need to be with the right people to play it (I know many hardcore gamers that are "meh" about it, they'd rather throw at each other's throats with a war game than play this) but at the same time is very friendly for new players or some public not used to complex board games. I enjoy it as a filler really, but wouldn't base my whole evening on playing this because it can become repetitive and boring after some time.

RATING: 9
A fabulous game made fabulous because of the artwork on tarot-sized cards.  It is also a bit more "open" than say a game like Faces.

Easily my favorite group/party game.  I will buy EVERY expansion.

One downside to the game is that the artwork is so fun that once players have played the game a few times and seen all of the artwork it takes away a bit of the original magic of the anticipation of a new card.  This complaint only exists because the game is so outstandingly beautiful and whimsical. 

Update:  After 20 more plays with a variety of people this still holds up for me.  I have gotten over the artwork issue I wrote about before.  I think everyone goes through that as those pictures are so great, but the gameplay holds up beautifully for an incredibly wide range of kids and adults.  

For Sale used to be my "go to" game for a new group of non-gamers.  Dixit blows it away. It is just more fun.

I commented above that I would buy every expansion.  That might be true still, but I have purposely held off buying Dixit 3 as I find the artwork to be inferior and it does not lend itself to storytelling the way the previous artwork did.  I will only buy it to cherry pick a few cards worthy of its predecessors and to get the board and voting cards.  I am not in a hurry to do this however and I will only buy it when I find a cheap copy.

Update: I still think this is a great game. However, I have softened on my aversion to new expansions with "inferior" art. I buy them, but only the ones I like. None have ever been as whimsical or open to interpretation as the original art by Marie Cardouat and I do believe the expansions have diluted the card pool. Still having more cards has become imperative because of all of the play this gets. I started to hear the same stories.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 3.25

Torture....cleverly disguised as a board game.

In the 1960's the Rorschach,  commonly known as the ink blot,  was the most widely used projective test.

In 2003 a report was published that stated claims made by proponents were found to be less than favorable, but that the test possessed "validity greater than chance".  A ringing endorsement indeed.

Fast forward to the year 2008 and this kitsch is thrust upon us and manages to amass somewhere in the neighborhood of 1000 fans. 20,000 owners and a rating hovering just shy of the stratosphere - all on the greatest board game resource on the planet.

Different strokes and all.....but I am left mind- numbingly perplexed.  The art, which generally receives accolades, struck me as extremely maudlin - portending the dour experience that,  no doubt,   was soon to follow.  In that respect at least,  Dixit did not fail to  fulfill it's promise.

It's a very unique game that stimulates your imagination in a very elegant way. It's also fun and tense from the first minute till the last, while it also takes less than a minute to explain to new players.

Everyone I've introduced this to was fascinated, but after a dozen or so plays it gets repetitive. The main problem is that it gets progressively more difficult to enjoy or even play the game as you exaust your imagination describing the same cards over and over - never using the same description twice (or you more or less cheat). The expansion will probably help, but for how long I wonder? Best play this once in a while with a varying group.

It also has the worst board and pieces I've ever seen in a game. Plain horrible, and completely impractical. Thankfully the cards are pieces of art and sturdy.

Overall this game is like an explosion, it's great at first but whizzles away after more plays.

Dixit is a fun, creative party game that takes the premise of Apples to Apples, but effectively changes and challenges it enough that the hardcore BGGers will not snort derisively at being invited to play. Ultimately there are a fair number of ways to use player familiarity to "game" the system, but it's a rather non-competitive party game and if you are doing that you're probably a dick. It is light fare, but still rather fun and offers other ways to enjoy the game even without being "deep" into the system. It is not a gateway game, but a nice bridge to occupy a mixed group of gamers and non-gamers for part of the evening, or until the rest of the gaming group arrives or finishes their other game.

Here is the thing. This might not actually be my most favorite game ever, but I do enjoy it a lot. The reason I have to rate it this highly is because I have found that it is THE best game to play with non-gamers. I have even managed to get people who dislike games to play this. It even works with those who are usually pretty sore about losing.

It's such a creative an original title that challenges you in a completely different way from other board games and I appreciate that a lot. 

It's fun, it's short and it is going to guarantee a good time with almost anyone.

Gorgeous card game, of which there seem to be more and more of late (such as Krakow 1325 AD and Day & Night). Interestingly, all three are first-time designers and small publishers, who all clearly put a lot of energy into the art on the cards in their respective games. Dixit is not only beautiful, but also a clever party game. It's not entirely original, feeling like a mix of many previous party games (such as Apples to Apples, Balderdash, and Cluzzle), but it's original enough to be worth playing and purchasing in my opinion. I've played the game eight times so far and with a wide variety of different groups and it's gone over well every time. There's something about the illustrations combined with the simple yet challenging gameplay that gives this one a remarkably wide appeal.

RATING: 4
Not sure if this game works. It seems like the best approach is to choose ambiguous clues that might suggest the picture you're playing, but this can easily be thwarted by someone possessing a card that happens to match the clue better. I suspect the game is very shallow, but I may be wrong.

RATING: 6
A lovely idea where you choose a word and associate that with a card...you then submit that card, and other plays choose a card that they hope will fit your word.

These are shuffled, and dealt out.  Each player then declares which one they think was the original.  

You get points based on how many people guess right, with none being awarded if everyone else guesses right, or if no one guesses at all.  It's finding that balance.

Made more fun if you can only use sounds to describe the pictures!  

Cards repeat quickly though, so perhaps need the expansions.

I really wanted to like this game, but I didn't when I played it. The only thing it's got going for it is its lovely, whimsical art work.  Replay-ability is not very good, and the game loses its charm when you figure out people's specific ways of thinking because it becomes very predictable.

have now played with 6 and 4:  superb game with 6.  a very good one with 4 (we played with one card each only on the table).  with 6 there was always a good competitor for the story - with 4, not so much.  still love it tho.

Not my kind of game since skill doesn't trump dumb luck.  Of course the group you play with determines how well you like this game.  Game really falls flat with a random group, but might be great for a close knit group of friends.

Dixit's great, but I think it's a bit overhyped on BGG. Maybe I'm just better at thinking in words than in pictures, but I prefer Balderdash. All too often the "Storyteller" has a much too difficult time thinking up a clue. At least in Balderdash you can use the prefix/suffix of a word to get some clue as to where to go, (ie, somethingologist. "One who....")

Good:
-Gateway game
-Not very competitive
-More replayability than other games in genre
-Theming is universal
-Amazingly simple rules

Bad:
-Not enough cards in the base game
-Cards too big for standard sleeves
-Scoring tokens fall too easily
-Some players take too long to come up with clues
-Too unstructured selection process for some
-Not for hardcore gamers
-Can be frustrating when you are the group's outsider

Overall:
A game so fun and accessible that it teeters on being a party game.  Unfortunately, hardcore gamers are baffled by the appeal.  If you like Apples to Apples switch to this and enjoy a deeper and more creative game.

LO MAS
Sus ilustraciones. Sus conejitos de colores. Su mecánica que estimula la creatividad. Cuanto más se juega, más soltura coges; y cosas divertidas y dispares se te ocurren (no digais siempre lo mismo con la misma carta, por dios). Le gusta a todo el mundo (más o menos). Me gusta todo, incluso su tablero que a mucha gente le resulta aparatoso (pero si es precioso).

LO MENOS
Que me apetece jugar siempre y no siempre tengo con quien jugar.

Good party game. Excellent actually, but it remains a party game. I worry about re playability of the game since the card draw is the same. Also, there is a way to violate the spirit of the game by giving clues that only your partner would know and thereby excluding all other people in your clue giving process.

Still, it is a simple and great game. Lots of laugh and lots of nutty conversation.

MUITO divertido! Rápido, muito fácil, leve, lúdico, animado, integrador, ... Enfim, não tenho adjetivos para definir esse party game na essência da palavra. Pode inclusive desbancar o Love Letter e o Zombie Dice como entrada para qualquer não gamer.

RATING: 7
This is a neat, unique game when you want something light and a little party-game-ish, but still want a thoughtful game too. The artwork is just incredibly beautiful, and you'll find yourself picking out new details all the time. A big part of the game is knowing who you're playing with - a phrase that might be perfect in one crowd might be terrible with another. So there's a bit more to the game than just word association, as it might initially appear. This also helps with replay value - unless you're constantly playing with the same group, you'll often pick new phrases even for cards that you've played before.

Over hyped game of the year. In my opinion the board and pieces are useless but the cards are beautifully designed, so why didn't they make a much cheaper card game out of it? Nice game principle, you are trying to describe your hidden card as vague as possible but good enough that only one person guesses it. Would consider buying it if it comes back as pure card/party game.

People compare this to "Apples to Apples", which is fair because it's in the same genre, but really it's closer to an old parlor game called "Psychic" or "Telepathy", just with pictures instead of player-written phrases.

Dear Dixit,  Please come up with a 2P/duel version of this game.  Sincerely, someone who plays mostly 2P.

In all seriousness, I love this game.  Everything about it appeals to me.  It has gorgeous, unique artwork.  It has tons of expansions to increase replayability.  It encourages creativity and abstract thinking.  It feels like a social game, but is causal enough to pull i n even the shyer players who don't like most party/social games.

We've usually had scores end up pretty close, even when one person does get ahead for awhile.  Even if you aren't winning, you're almost always having a good time.  There are lots of laughs involved and not too much time to worry about being AP.  In other words, it's so fun you won't be agonizing that every move might be the one to put you behind in points.

Unfortunately, I play mostly 2P and only get to pull this out when visiting family.  Since it's such a nice, light game that works for all ages and types of gamers, it's really a perfect game.  We've tried to come up with alternate 2P scoring, but haven't yet.  If Dixit ever does come up with something like that, I'd probably rate it a 9-10.

I feel the game is a bit over-rated, but it is very solid fun.  I do agree it's a must have in any collection because few games have such wide appeal and easy rules.  It boils down what I enjoyed about previous games such as Balderdash and Apples to Apples, and delivers the experience with fascinating card art.

There can be hang-ups if people aren't particularly creative, you can get stuck with some hard to work with cards, but overall it's an enjoyable experience with some laughs.  Wish it could accommodate a few more players.

It's an alright game. It's not the story telling game I expected, but people seem to get better at the game as it goes on.

The games primary mechanic works better with more people, but adding more people means everyone is the storyteller less and there's a longer wait between turns.

Not super interesting, giving clues is semi-hard/semi-random, guessing is semi-interesting/semi-random. Most things that happen in the game make me say "...oh..ok" and we move on. Definitely not a party game, just a light filler.

I like this "Apples to Apples-esque" game quite a lot, though I definitely recommend getting one or more of the expansions, as the additional cards prevent the pictures from becoming too familiar. I've had as much fun playing this with my college friends as with my family. Big thumbs up!

Edit (7/18/2014): Dixit (including the first 2 expansions, which I never play without) has really grown on me over the years. It is my favorite family/party game in my collection, and it's a damn shame that I don't get to play it more often. What I love most about Dixit is the amount of room for creativity within that core Apples to Apples system. While I still own Apples to Apples, Dixit has more or less replaced it, as everything the former does, the latter pulls off better and in a more elegant package. Dixit is one of the few games I own that I can honestly say that I will never part with (not willingly, at least). It is an absolute treasure!

All Dixit versions are beautiful. The way you tell stories with car with just a single word or sentence is a genius idea. It was a revolution in the boardgame history. Since, we speak about the french game (like eurogames but with artwork).
However, all Dixit versions have the same problem : scoring. I find the scoring boring. It break the game rythm. And since Mysterium was released, it's worse cause this last one show how to score, win or loose keeping the game rythm.
So, play Dixit without point or use your Dixit cards to play Mysterium ;-)

I want my party game to be like a party.  Dixit is more like a a trip to a bad art gallery.  Some people, both in my game group, and on BGG, really adore this game, but I don't find much to hold my attention.  The game mechanics are similar to [gameid=74] with an everybody-votes twist.  I really don't like this mechanic, but was hoping that the art would save this game.  The art, while interesting, is not to my taste.  I prefer my party games to have shouting and acting and wordplay and group play.

RATING: 9
I think this is either the type of game that you love or you hate.  Personally, I love trying to figure out just the right clue to coax 1 or 2 other people to pick my card, as well as the challenge of picking a card to try and match the other player's clues.  So simple that it's easy to play with non-gamers, but interesting enough to keep gamers interested.

Érdekes, hogy nem is egy príma videót néztem meg erről a party-játékról, ahol a másik által adott "nyom" alapján kell olyan kártyát kijátszanunk, ami a többieket félrevezeti, miközben mi helyesen kitaláljuk mit játszott ki a nyomot adó. Mindenképp ki akartam próbálni, sőt, meg akartam venni, annyira meggyőző volt... szerencsére előbb próbáltam ki, és így rájöttem, hogy bár sokaknak tetszik, de nagyon nem tolerálja az "out of the box" gondolkodást, így viszont én nem tudom "jól" játszani. Ettől még persze lehet remek játék, de nem nekem...

Шедевр. Обычно, когда в колоде заканчиваются карты, всем хочется играть ещё, сперва потратить карты на руках, а затем разложить игру заново. И так до тех пор, пока кто-нибудь не посмотрит на часы с возгласом "Ого, уже Х часов! Нам ведь пора уходить/спать/свой вариант".

В моей коллекции всего два месяца, поэтому оценка может впоследствии упасть на один-два балла. В чём я сильно сомневаюсь.

After three plays, this game is a brilliant exercise in knowing your friends. Beautiful art, gentle, chatty, and great with non-gamers. The only thing stopping it getting a ten is the limited range of cards.

Finally, finally got to own this art-object-cum-game. It is absolutely beautiful, utterly charming. I can't explain how much I love just looking at Dixit... The box, the cards, the bunny meeples... It oozes charm. 

[NB: Been fighting Jon for ages about Dixit. He hates games like Dixit and doesn't think I can find two other people who will like it. I pointed out that the game was quite cheap for a 84 beautifully-printed cartoons].

RATING: 8.6
i dont understand the name dixit, nor i get what the theme is, so i'll  just look at the gameplay

the rules are very simple, guessing picture (with a bit of twist). i like the scoring mechanic, i think it's fair. the strategy changes a bit with the number of players, but it's still okay (3 players game is not recommended though). there is a bit luck dependence though : it's easy to get points when our card matches people's story, and very hard when it never match (because not everyone is a good storyteller). the playing time isn't really important, you can actually prolong or stop the game anytime you wish

the artworks are kind of abstract, but it suits the gameplay. otherwise the picture style is okay. the card size is big, but it's needed so we can look at the picture clearer. the amount of cards is too few though, it should have been made to accommodate the number of players nicely

this game is best played with people having the same amount of knowledge, otherwise you'll have hard time to adjust yourself to the group. it's because dixit is a party game without strong theme. i rate this game 8.5+

The only way to consider this game is as a party game, and in that respect, it's a pretty good one.  It encourages interaction and discussion, and it's enjoyable for players in both roles, as either a storyteller or a picker.  So ultimately, the game has to be viewed as how it works more as an experience, less as a game.  In that respect, it works, and it works well.  It just has a weird scoring mechanism, which in turn makes it more reasonable for a storyteller to be so vague as to be almost incomprehensible, since it's best to have only one player pick your card, instead of more than one player.  Still, it's a minor issue, as the game could be played without keeping any score at all.

Wow this game is amazing.

One caveat: some people have said that "playing to win" involves being creative. That is not true - truly playing to win as the storyteller involves picking the player who is the farthest behind and giving a clue that only he can guess. This is obviously pretty lame, as it can be really easy to do ("Ted and I saw one of these yesterday, while you two were out at the spa").

Fortunately, you don't have to play to win, and when you don't, the game is gobs of fun. Love the art. I'm not sure if I'll ever go back to Apples to Apples.

It benefits a lot from every additional player that joins as there are more cards to pick from when you have to guess what card is the current player's.

Light weight

Of all the association games, Dixit is my favourite for two main reasons. Unsurprisingly the art as it's fantastic, but from a mechanical perspective, I feel like it lends itself to gaming the players and not the game with more freedom than some of the others.

RATING: 7
A party-style game that is a rather mixed bag when playing with gamers who emphasize winning.  The concept is not entirely original (reminiscent of both Pictionary and Balderdash), but the art is quite fantastic and really makes the game fun and feel very original.

Great artwork, and an interesting game to boot. Not exactly a party game, but kind of in between.  It does take some effort to come up with the "good but not too good" phrase. But it's so open-ended that it's completely replayable. I have no idea why people are complaining that it's not (as if there's just one word/phrase per card).

The scoring is interesting, though it's a little wonky because you must guess something different than your own card, so you can get some lucky breaks here and there, some accidental big scores for people who just basically threw a random card in.  But it's very good, and WAY better than A2A.

Beautiful game that requires a lot of creativity.  The only bad thing is that there is a fairly successful degenerate strategy of just saying something completely random.  That's no fun, but since it's a pretty casual game, it's also pretty easy to say just don't do that.

Dixit is nothing more than a set of rules to make you say interesting things. You can forget keeping score, just let the game flow and your brains bloom.
It's a brilliant idea.
This was the game that convinced me that there is somehow more to modern board games. It is the game that feels closest to being art.

It can fail with a bad group (people not only insisting to play for points, but actually doing just that, and nothing more), but that says more about the group than the game for me.

I'm also really attached to this game because at this point I literally spent weeks making my own cards. Not to mention playing with them with friends.

An easy to learn game, where you have to guess how the other players think.

One player is the storyteller for the turn and looks at the images on the 6 cards in her hand. From one of these, she makes up a sentence and says it out loud. Each player selects the card in their hands which best matches the sentence. All the pictures are shown face up and every player has to bet upon which card was the storyteller's. If everyone guess the storyteller's card, the storyteller get no points. So you have to be descriptive, but not too descriptive.

Dixit is a great game with the potential for very broad appeal. It is great for parties or family gatherings and is very friendly for non-gamers, yet it also challenges the creativity, making it highly playable for seasoned gamers as well.

"word game". 
Storyteller gives a vague descripition of his card. Everybody else adds a card. Storyteller wants that many, but not all, people identify his card.

An ok game, but with a big drawback in mixed rounds: People who know each others well can easy give clue that the 'partner' recognizes the hint, but the others won't (for example, regular movie visitors telling lines from a movie)

A trippy card game where you're suggesting an idea to match said cards. Others try and muck things up by interjecting their own cards to steal the concept. Fantastic art, but just an average "game."

Dixit is a really solid light social/party game. It's interesting in that scoring points is actually quite challenging.

Fortunately it goes over well in most casual settings, so it gets play quite regularly.

Lots of fun to be had in this medium-size group party game.  One person, the story teller, comes up with a wacky phrase to describe an image, and the rest of the group all picks which of their card illustrates the phrase best.  Everyone votes on which card was the story tellers - lots of fun ensues.  The neat twist is that the clues have to be good enough to have someone guess the right card, but not too easy that everyone guesses right.  Lots of fun, and a very original game.

What I like:
-Each illustrated card can be interpreted many different ways.
-The current player's clue doesn't have to be a word or phrase, but can be an Action, a poem, an interpretive dance, etc.
-There are lots of expansions.
-Great for all ages.

What I don't like:
-If you only have one copy, without expansions, we always go through the entire deck about 75% into the game and have to shuffle and reuse cards.

TL;DR  If you enjoy party games, definitely play Dixie.

Smash hit.  A blast at parties or family gatherings. I personally love it because of easy teachability and it tickles the imagination of all players.  

Simple, brilliant idea for a game.  Game rules:  Look at a beautiful piece of artwork, come up with a caption, score points.  Then laugh--a lot.  This game delivers fun, laughter, imaginative play, and re-playability.

Many party games that force players to use their imagination fall flat.  Most people are shy in a crowd about sharing any imaginative thought their mind springs forth, so they shut down.  Those games then become slogging affairs.

Dixit fixes this with requiring only one sentence (or less) descriptions of pictures that open your mind up to ANYTHING.  These aren't pictures of a flower pot or dead fruit.  They are pictures of babies floating in an ocean of red, or toy soldiers jumping into the sunset.  Beautiful, fantastic artwork. 

Games go so quickly that you end up reshuffling and starting again.  The only lag in play may be a few people refreshing their drinks (or themselves).  

An instant classic which definitely will see my gaming table many times this 2011 holiday season.  :)

Interesting game with a potential to be hilarious in some groups (at parties, with a wild fantasy). Though it feels, like it lacks something. It is hard to bluff in this game. Also there is a place for cheating, when putting out completely not matching cards to be able to point storyteller's card. Though probably it can be counteracted and also makes the storyteller to come up with a very clever sentences. What i actually dislike is that board, which makes box huge. It would suffice to have notepad and pencils to keep the scores. This game is about the cards mainly, so i would want to take actually the inside box only with cards and markers and a small condensed rule book. Price would be smaller as well and it would be easier to take on the trip.

Each round, the judge picks a card showing some kind of artistic design from their hand and gives a short clue. The other players must also pick a card form their hand that the clue could indicate. The cards are shuffled up, and the players must try to guess the judge's card.

A very nice spin on the Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity style.  I prefer this to both due to the freedom it gives the clue-giver to be as creative or plain as s/he wants.  A great family game, and one my wife and I will continue to use to play with non-gamers.

This isn't a game, it's an exhibition of a very limited collection of art. The art is fine. There is no point in making it a game.

RATING: 7.5
Intriguing gameplay coupled with good artwork and substantial player interaction. It is also easy enough to teach, making it a suitable family game. However, it may not be suitable with a very diverse group of people, as the phrase or sentence made will reflect the player's background and probably only those with similar background may be able to guess correctly. Replayability may also be on the low side as the number of cards is limited, so many new cards with different pictures are required to keep it fresh.

Dixit is an enjoyable game, but I have a hard time calling it a party game, a light family game seems more fitting in my opinion. It's a good game, but not exactly laugh out loud funny.

Dixit is a gorgeous game, but for as good as the cards look, it's amazing how you sometimes feel completely stumped as the storyteller looking at your hand of six cards. After playing the original title, you will surely lust after Dixit 2 and Dixit Odyssey to add more cards to your collection.

I will not be play Dixit with my gaming buddies, but my wife and daughters love it! That alone earns it a high rating from me. It's the kind of game that you can teach to anyone, and with Dixit Odyssey you can play it with up to 12, and it becomes more of an actual party game.

It should be noted that Dixit Odyssey is a better implementation of the game, with better player pawns, score board, voting system, etc. If you have yet to play the game, I recommend that you first pick up Dixit Odyssey.

Dixit has gone well with many different groups. For some reason, my wife has soured on it, though. I find storytelling to be quite challenging since you don't want ALL players to guess your card. It's similar to Balderdash in that regard.

Dixit is a really pleasant game that flexes your creative brain muscle.  Beautiful artwork aside, my concern for this is that some cards have more going for it than others and seem to illicit more discussion.  Then there is the problem with people's tendency to give out the same clues especially to those they've played with before.  Could be easily expanded in the future but for now redundancy could be a killer for Dixit eventually.

Wow, this is significantly better than I expected.  The interpretive nature of art makes this game work so much better than every previous incarnation of this kind of ruleset, except possibly [thing=550][/thing]/[thing=9606][/thing].

I'm starting to think we need to add a mechanism to BGG for "getting only some of a group of people to guess your secret".  :)

After 1 play: Definitely fun, but two possible problems.  One, may go one a bit long, but this is easily remedied.  Two, it may be unstable when two of the people know each other far better than the others (aka couples) since inside jokes or personal history can be used to form the clues.

Entertaining non-competitive group activity. As a competitive game, it is very group dependent. You get two people who have a very different frame of reference to others, and they can give each other obscure clues (e.g. songs by an artist they both like) and win easily.

Wife's former #1 game. Like with other games, this is highly group-dependent. Sometimes it is a total flop when played with more literally minded people. My sense though is that expansions are totally necessary to make this game sing, so there is enough distance in between getting the same card so you're able to think about it differently

Great party game, gets people talking and thinking out of the box. Light mood, light gameplay. I have just the base game, and I suspect it strongly benefits from having some expansions. After a few games, you know all the picture cards, and I have yet to play a game that ends by score rather than by running out of cards. More variety would keep veteran players from strategically hinting to draw out specific cards.

Wunderschön illustrierte Karten und schnell erklärte Regeln: Ein Spieler gibt einer seiner Handkarten einen Titel oder eine Umschreibung. Die anderen legen Karten ab, die ebenfalls dazu passen. Dann werden die gemischten Karten ausgelegt und jeder rät, welches die ursprüngliche Karte war.
Ein Spiel, das auf jeden Fall die Fantasie fördert. Man bekommt nämlich als "Erzähler" nur Punkte, wenn ein Teil der Mitspieler richtig liegt. Sei nicht zu offensichtlich... und nicht zu abstrakt.

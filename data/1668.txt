Another one of my all-time favorite after Nuke War.  Usually play it after long RPG session to lighten thing up.  The expansion sets are a must as they added a lot more to the game.

Dan Verssen updates AH's old Naval War to modern standards (modern being mid-'80s).  A fun and light game that doesn't stress reality but rather playability.

RATING: 6
Can be a fun game if you like "simple" naval warfare. The major strategy is how you place the ships in your fleet. One of the biggest problems is that the torpedo cards are so rare, making the subs "almost" worthless.

Enjoyable and enriching reworking of the old Naval Battales card game by Avalon Hill. Air strikes, Gunnery, Electronic Warfare, Repair Partie, and more, are seemlessly integrated into a surprisingly fast game for the complex topic covered. Game also offers a real sense of the differing capabilities between the various leading navies of the world.

PnP version - Cold War Naval Battles.
Whoa, LOTS of cards!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
(Cold War Naval Battles) More complex than Naval Battles, with a little more weight, thanks to variable action points.  Air power is not as devastating as in NB, but a good way to hurt a weak opponent.  I appreciate the lack of player elimination.  I miss NB's fleetbuilding and the strategies that different national fleets have to offer.  Gameplay also takes much longer than NB.

RATING: 6
A simple card game which has overtones of top trumps insofar as the cards include and rate many of the worlds most significant modern naval vessels.  Not exactly harpoon when it comes to realism (well to be truthfull it has little or no realism) but a lot of fun.

NB
I'm becomming aware that abstract games are not my taste and this refects in my opinion of many games).  The theme on many simple games are painted on to level I find difficult.

Games in this grouping:
Taluva
Lost Cities
Bohanza
Jet Set
Junta
Enemy in Sight
Naval War

Some more complex game have a level of abstration that does not meet my expectation for the theme/subject etc.  This makes the game a less compelling experience.

Games in this grouping:
Elder Signs
Reef Encounter
Modern Naval Battles
The Fury of Dracula

My enthusiasm for these games is limited by a level of abstraction that challenges my taste and my rating reflects this.

Splendid. Naval War in the Modern Era juinced up with just enough to provide historical verity, but without detracting from it aas an enjoyable game. Give it a 10 despite 3W's best efforts to mess it up. Designer promptly replied to and answered every question submitted by mail.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is one slick card game. After having played Avalon Hill's Naval War for some time this was a real step in the right direction. More complexity, more uncertainty and more fun.

You roll a dice to see how many action you have (Fog of War). In regards to defensive cards you can choose to play in as an area defense or keep it in your hand to stop a specific attack.

Super game for six players.

RATING: 7
Neat, generic modern naval combat card based game.  Players use their warships, submarines and airstrikes to sink their opponents ships.  It can be a fun addictive game to play.  The expansions add more ships, tactics and other cards to enhance replayability as well as add different scenario play to the game such as NATO vs. Communist Powers.

Cold War Naval Battles is a fun game, but can drag -- I'd suggest either playing for a set time or to a lower score. It also reminds me a lot of Mag-Blast.

A quick note on printing -- you may be able to get away with printing this game on a lower print setting on your printer. I printed mine at my printer's lowest setting and the cards turned out fine. YMMV. Also, get some CCG card sleeves -- the game will last a lot longer.

I played this game quite a bit when it first came out. I decided there was way too much luck in it for my tastes -- much more so that Naval War which it took a good part of its system from. I never want to see an "action die" in a game again....

RATING: 6
This is a very good game -- there's some strategy in the placement of cards on the table, and yet a round of it plays fairly quickly because it's a card game. Usually played in multiple rounds. The basic game has players fielding fleets of mixed nationalities, which sometimes doesn't make any sense. Can be a bit random, but it's fun blowing stuff up! The one criticism of this game is the rolling for number of actions each turn. Still, fun.

Homemade PnP. Enjoyed AH Naval War, looking forward to giving this one a go.

Update: 16" barrels of fun! Oddly, the random "fog of war" chaos that's usually a demerit for me actually increases the fun factor. Played 3-player, and only one round, as getting up to 180 points would have taken perhaps 2 more hours. Not that I would have minded, as this didn't get old even after the first 2 hours. A solid keeper, one I will happily spend the effort needed to print up all the expansions.

This is a GREAT game if you have the patience to cut and paste all the cards it requires. Remember that this was a successful commercial game that you can get for free. 

Luck is a big factor, but that's good for this game, as there's always place for some tactics and hand management. Launching a massive Air Strike after rolling "6" in Fog of War is simply great.

This game made me buy "Modern Naval Battles: Global Warfare", a later commercial redesign.

Few remembers Dan Verssen designed a naval card game first before jumping on the air-card game wagon for GMT's Down in Flame series.  Indeed, the card system "looks" a bit more natural to individual jet fighter than to whole fleet in action.  However, 3W did produce this game right and without many major quibbles.  Hands playing is very fast.  I have fun of playing this game with my group.

Oddly enough, I've only ever played the campaign scenarios. Something about mixing ships from the US & USSR just didn't seem right. A clever card game that provides a great retro feel of the Cold War era. Of course, history was fudged a bit to give the Soviets a chance (they're given a few fleet carriers that were started but never finished by the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union).

About the free downloadable version.
First played the basic game (without any expansion cards): it's fun but maybe too simple. Then I played the campaign game with more cards/rules added from the II, III, IV, V and VI expansions: it's much better than the basic game. There's also the victory point management, to buy new ships and cards between scenarios. Game turns are shorter so need to plan more carefully which ships/subs can enter the fight and which ones are better to leave behind. Different types of mission require different strategies. Note: probably the most important expansion is the V (the 5th) that's the one with the campaign rules so after trying the first basic games is strongly recommended to add that. Considering this game is completely <b>free</b>, it deserves some attention. Standing ovation to developers  who decided to distribute this game to the community without charge. Thanks!

Two ways to play:  multi-player free for all (fun, but players do get ganged-on/knocked out as the game proceeds) or naval combat simulation (using stuff from the second expansion).  Rules are not well written. Sim mode might be too abstract for realism nuts. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This game went over big with my group.  Printed out CWNB and all the expansions.  Only downside is the lack of Additional Ship cards, which we rectified by printing more.  It kind of sucked to be in a 5 player game and have nothing but a submarine mid-game and as soon as you got a ship, everybody tries to sink it and get the VP's. Still, all in all we have a blast with it, the defenses and attacks give it a unique flavor that requires some interesing tactics.

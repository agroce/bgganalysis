I am really glad to have tried the OCS: a great system-- good, clean rule with lots to think about, especially supply. I can see that it would really shine in the "monster" games, and especially playing in teams. I enjoyed playing Reluctant Enemies, and would play again, but I don't see any time in the foreseeable future I'm going to be able to get into the whole system, which would mean the monsters.

RATING: N/A
Reluctant Enemas.

This is my least favorite OCS title that I have played to date. I don't see the point of the 9-turn scenario, which essentially requires the CW player to capture only 3 less VP hexes than the full CG, but in half the time.

Two of the 3 CW attack paths are over restricted, difficult terrain and lead to a grind; the other route to Damascus is more mobile, but the supply line is vulnerable to being cut; none of the 3 routes can support each other.  

The Vichy start with better armor, better units overall, and better planes. The CW may have a chance in the longer game, as several key units get an AR bump, and they get better airpower.

Great intro into a rather complicated series of games.  The game is designed to get you playing (after the obligatory rules grokking sessions).  Totally tailored to the newbie OCS guppy.  Probably won't help much when facing the real sharks, but at least you'll be able to swim with a measure of confidence.

Have not finished a game yet, so will rate again after wrapping up a game.  I expected to see the numbers rise!

RATING: 7
Although sold as an intro to the system, and it includes some good resources (core rules summary and detailed playthrough), it is lacking a real intro scenario. Most (all?) of the larger games do better on that score; so does Sicily II. Without that, it's very frustrating to try and learn this very different style of play.

For the more experienced player, this is actually a really interesting situation to play. And the OCS shines so well at showing you enough detail to really feel like you're gaming WWII era battles out.

RATING: 10
I'm continuing to really enjoy this, but it does seem tough on the Commonwealth, at least in the short 9-turn scenario (with more time to wield more firepower and better troops in the full game, it might be a better match). Not sure if a balance is needed; I'll think about it. It might be enough just to give the Aussies their 4 AR back from the beginning.
---
It's been ages since I played OCS, for a variety of reasons - mostly that most OCS fans seem to prefer the monster games (Case Blue, GBII) which I do not. It was great to get the system to the table again with RE, and OCS immediately hooked me again and reminded me why I love the system. It's relatively quick-playing for what it is, and the game system is actually impressively focussed and clean. I love the bloody and highly-variable CRT. Both attacking and defending are hard; the attacker has an ability to focus firepower which the defender will find hard to resist, but terrain and the CRT favors the defender more than usual. The mix of wide-open and congested terrain on the map makes for a really interesting mix of techniques that need to be employed. The emphasis on supply and costs is of course what makes the game though and it works very well here. There are three major avenues of advance, split by mountains, and the Commonwealth has to make some progress along all 3. A lot will hinge on the CW using their mobility to switch forces around while the relatively immobile French get pinned down.

Anyway, this is a great little game and much more than just an "introductory" or "starter kit" for OCS. It's a totally compelling game that stands alone just fine, and makes the case for OCS not just for monster situations, but for playable games also.

As an aside, this makes an interesting companion to Slouch Hats & Eggshells, the Von Borries title on the same operation. Von Borries uses a somewhat different focus and scale, and both games bring interesting things that the other chooses not abstract. A lot to like in both games, although OCS is a much more inherently interesting and robust game system.

RATING: 9
The OCS equivalent of the ASL starter kits. One map, one counter sheet, a rules summary and beginner's guide to the system.

Bumped my rating up a notch because this isn't just a really good introduction to the system, but a very good game in its own right featuring an intriguing, multi-front battle with both sides looking to balance supply and forces between three distinct areas of the map.

Although small in footprint, the 21-turn campaign is less forgiving than a 5 or 6 turn scenario from one of the bigger sets. Still, it's manageable, fun, thought provoking and a system with lots to enjoy in it.

I am not an OCS beginner, so I can't really say how useful the beginner materials are.  For someone new to OCS, they may be very useful indeed.

I do wonder about using this situation as an intro to OCS.  It is small, true, and there is definitely something to be said for that.  However it lacks the mobile warfare element that made me fall in love with OCS when I first played Enemy at the Gates scenarios, and later Tunisia.  The whole sequence of "do a hip shoot, overrun with armor in the open, pour through with mobile units, rampage in the enemy rear area, attack the enemy HQ, capture supply dumps and trucks, overrun airfields, cut the enemy rail line, and kill most units through encirclement and supply attrition" is absent here.  This is a grind. You will spend turn after turn trying to capture a single VP hex.  And you need a lot of them to win.

The situation in Reluctant Enemies is more or less a Bulge type of situation: advance slowly, often less than one hex per turn, up a very narrow road corridor (there are three "fronts" which each have the same situation), with no ability to flank, in bad terrain, and roll lots of dice in barrages and attritional attacks to try to blow the defenders away with brute force.  Mobile warfare it ain't.  Armor (and armored cars, and a variety of other weak Commonwealth units) cost supply to move, and are penalized in bad terrain, so they go unused on most turns.  When they are used, they don't tend to make much of an impact.

Some people - I call them "Nibblelungs" - enjoy this sort of slow, "nibbling away at them" infantry-driven attrition, but I don't.  After the first few turns, most attacks in Reluctant Enemies will be conducted in Very Close terrain (very bad for the attacker), to advance directly up a narrow road through rough terrain, with maneuver to either side prohibited by lava fields, escarpments, or supply-impassable mountains.  The coast road is a bit easier, but it involves attacking across rivers, which halve the attacker, so you will still rarely see any armor bonuses in effect.  

The game does feature airpower, lots of artillery barrages, logistical difficulties and the need to stockpile supply for pushes, lots of attacks and Surprise rolls - it will give newcomers a good intro to a lot of the mechanics of OCS in a small package.  You get to see what a difference it makes when the Commonwealth finally amasses some decent artillery. But I fear the impression beginners will be left with is a very slow, attritional, grinding sort of game, in very defender friendly terrain, which to me is not what OCS is about.  If this had been my intro to the system, I suspect I would not have been impressed enough to return.  I doubt I will play it again, except possibly with a beginner, and even then, only the shorter scenario.  The last 11 turns are a pretty brutal attrition-fest.  Don't judge OCS by them, they are atypical!

On a minor note, I don't particularly care for the color scheme of the counters - when you have a swirl of Vichy and Free French units engaged with each other, it's two hues of blue, which is neither clear nor dramatic.  I would have preferred an alternate color scheme.  OCS color schemes are often disappointing - last night I was sorting Tunisia counters, and again noticed that the multi-unit divisional color stripes are very similar, with several different Italian divisions for example having various hues of yellow, orange, and yellow-orange.  Check out the Tunisia counter sheet scan to see the overly-subtle differences between various divisions. I don't understand this sort of thing at all.  If I was king of the world....oh well.

Sold without regret.

This a great entry into the system, and a great game in general. The OCS rules are not as complex as some make out. Because roads are used as rails are for supply, and the limited numbers of aircraft and tanks, the decisions in this game are a little clearer than they are in other OCS games. If i compare it with Burma, there isn't as much depth, but it is more accessible and will still rival games like the Caucasus Campaign for replay.

About RE... Great little game to get started with OCS. It has almost all the rules in action but with not that much units on the map, it stays all very manageable for new players.

Not sure how much replay value this game has compared to other titles in the serie but I'm sure you can play it a few times before you have seen it all. By that time you will have spend countless hours enjoying yourself.

Starter kit for a beginner? Baltic Gap costs 20 $ more  or Burma 3 $ more and they are far better to start with and give you more in all sense.

OK game. At first a bit daunting with the rules being nearly 50 pages (not including supplements), but the mechanics are pretty simple.  I think a decent amount of chrome to make it interesting but not bog it down. Rules are loose in areas which leads to continuing confusion. It appears that if you can find an experienced player to explain the rules it may be a good system to break into. otherwise, new player beware.
--UPDATE-- After a handful of fits and starts and one very long play, this game, and OCS in general is growing on me. Excellent job of simulating the need for proper planning and forethought at the operational level.

Initial rating, should be taken with much salt. I normally rate games pretty objectively but this one more reflects just how much the system matches my preferences

This was my first OCS game, and while I found the rules logical mostly, after playing more and more wargames over the years and my memory getting worse and worse, I am now realizing that 25 pages of rules is a real ceiling for me, so here there are just too many rules for me.  I love the chrome here in theory, like just how critical the supply is, and how moving it to the front is important, etc but in the end its just too fiddly remembering and playing by that many rules and I want to play the game not the rulebook. 

Maybe I will eventually come back to this and some of the other really great looking titles like Korea etc, as I say I really like the system I just find its a fair bit above my rules threshold

The Starter guide is not really a starter guide, nice to follow but why does the Starter guide has to touch upon every single subject of OCS? How does that simplify things or introduces gamer to the subject? Other than that, interesting product.

My first attempt at OCS. This one is easy to get into due to its size and scope as well as the fairly straightforward situation. I really enjoy the operational/tactical feel of the combat system, I like all the different ground-unit modes, and all the air-mission types. There are plenty of things to think about and the sheer amount of available options make this a bit of a puzzle-game, at least to a newbie. I'm still getting my head around all the logistical rules, however it shows promise so far.

Curtis Baer's design of the Commonwealth attack into Syria in July 1941.  Aussies and Brits against the French - too strange in some ways, but true.  An excellent subject for an introductory OCS game.  The game is fun - with strengths and weaknesses, and opportunities to attack, on both sides.

Le matériel:
> La carte est splendide, avec celle de DAK je trouve que c'est la plus belle de la série.
> Les pions sont au standard MMP, mais cette fois les Français sont en bleu horizon, et pas en simili bleu violet comme cela a pu étre discuté ad nauseam dans Blitzkrieg legend.
> Des aides de jeu en couleur sont prévues pour le placement des unités en début de partie
> Les règles sont celles de la 4.1a, il y a eu quelques précisions et clarifications apportées par rapport à la 4.1

Les objectifs:
> Les forces du commonwealth ont 21 tours pour récupérer au bas mot 11 points de victoire, situés sur la moitié nord de la carte, la plupart du temps en terrain montagneux close ou very close. Deux objectifs (un aéroport et Damas) permettent une victoire par mort subite. Il y a plusieurs niveaux de victoire, et le joueur qui est terrassé par une défaite majeure "doit offrir une boisson d'homme à son partenaire, lui serrer la main et changer de hobby".  :) 

Les moyens:
> Les forces du CW touchent en moyenne 2.5 points de supply par tour, les Vichystes 1.5. Cela semble peu mais en fait, compte tenu du peu de forces blindées et des généreuses dotations initiales en supply cela m'a semblé énorme, à aucun moment nous n'avons été à cours de supply... Cette donnée est sans doute à relativiser sur une campagne complète, mais j'ai eu le sentiment d'une générosité d'un point de vue logistique. 
> Jusqu'au tour 6, les Vichystes ont la supériorité aérienne, à compter du tour 7 les Rosbeefs touchent un beau lot de renforts et d'unités aériennes, sans doute détournées du théâtre africain.
> Les troupes Vichystes sont assez hétéroclites, mais on peut compter sur de nombreuses unités d'infanterie et deux bonnes unités blindés sans compter quelques artilleries.
> Particularité de cet opus: chaque camp doit comptabiliser ses pertes, tous les 3 pas de perte une unité au hasard est reconstruite au tour suivant, c'est le 2e point qui m'a interpellé. Pour le CW cela incite à multiplier les attaques, et pour les partisans du Maréchal Pétrin c'est une invitation au sacrifice et aux combats pour retarder l'approche.


Le plan
> Le terrain laisse 3 axes de pénétrations aux forces du CW selon un axe sud-nord, avec en outre un débarquement de 3 commandos angliche au sud de Beyrout pour isoler un groupe d'unités aux ordres du maréchal moustache. Si les débarquements sont couronnés de succès (ce fut le cas dnas notre partie), le Vichyste va s'amuser à déloger les commandos anglo-saxons, cela va lui fixer des troupes et lui pomper du supply.
> La route vers Damas, à l'est de la carte semble la plus ouverte, avec un grand désert à l'est du lac Tibérias, mais un massif volcanique et une éminences peuvent permettre à des troupes vichyste de se positionner et de menacer les arrières rosbifo-françaises. 
> Au centre et à l'ouest de la carte, le terrain close voire very close (montagne, colline...) doit permettre aux forces bleues avec une francisque de tenir longtemps, avec un peu d'organisation et quelques unités les unes derrière les autres le long des routes, la progression des mangeurs de gelée et des éleveurs de kangourous doit être très limitée.

Au final...
> Un vrai module OCS, une situation intéressante, alors que le thème de l'opus ne m'attirait pas énormément.
> Les conditions de victoire du CW me semblent difficiles à réunir face à un joueur défensif ayant un peu d'expérience et de sang froid.
> Un système de reconstruction des unités cohérent (les pions représentent des compagnies ou des bataillons) mais au final assez généreux qui oblige à axer son jeu sur le gain territorial plutôt que sur le grignotage des unités adverses.
> Une dotation en supply généreuse qui va ravir les nouveaux venus à OCS et permettre de conduire plusieurs offensives.

An excellent introduction to the [b]Operational Combat Series[/b]. Helpfully, almost all units are 1/2 regimental equivalents, with a few being 1/4 RE, and it doesn't include hip shoots for aircraft. This game has it all, in microcosm: Attrition in rough terrain, blitzkrieg across open terrain, naval bombardment, amphibious assault, and air power.

Axis artillery and tactical bombers are very powerful, and can easily blunt an Allied offensive. The Axis will have to be very bold on the counterattack, especially in the east, if they're to cut off the Allied advance. The Allied advance in the west progresses very slowly, given that the river crossings can only be attacked from one or two hexes at a time. The way round is surrounded by impassable ridges, with a few passes (inevitably) garrisoned by enemy units.

The Axis have few units and can't easily replace any losses. The Allied forces have plenty of units and can rebuild destroyed units, so they can afford heavy losses. And there will be heavy losses.

I purchased this game in 2014. I have only played a bit of the first turn. It was my foray into the OCS. I liked what I've played so far. 

That said, I rate this game not only from my scant exposure to play but as an offset against Smjj. Smjj is apparently a member who sees it as his business to deride wargames without so much as a sentence in explanation. He just gives wargames a "1" universally. It's unfair and I'm trying to do something to counteract his sad and quite honestly stupid action against wargames.

Once I did this the system does seem to bad,  I'll have to give it a real play to find out.

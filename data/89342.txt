This one fell completely flat with my gaming group, so much so that we didn't resume a game that we suspended for the night.  It seems like my group is fine with conflict in general, but emotions run way too high in games which encourage brinkmanship and threats of retaliation during negotiation.  ...  I think we should never try to play Diplomacy.

We loved the first game of this, altho my dad and I got a little nuke happy and ended up losing the entire game for everyone. But lots of fun for a first play, and will definitely bring out again when we have 5 or 6.

Unfortunately, this modern military game doesn't work for our group as they don't appear to like getting dicked on / conflict too much. That's a crying shame because this game is pretty good.

I like it. The theme is where it really shines. Players do feel like they are the leaders of super powers sat behind their desks in underground bunkers deciding the fate of the planet. If the theme unsettles you, sort yourself out.

The game is extremely easy to explain. There are clean rules and simple choices making the game quick, smooth and very playable. The semi-cooperative reduce-the-pop by any means necessary mechanic is wonderful. The game feels very cut throat and mean which is exactly how it should be. As the game plays out a narrative emerges. If you've been targeted heavily by an opponent, do you retaliate with brutal force (like I did) or hit the points leader?

There are issues though. It isn't always terribly easy to assess who is a strong position and who is in a weak position in terms of points. This is important as strategically you should be hitting the points leader.

Sometimes it doesn't feel like you have much choice in which actions to take. Furthermore, a player prone to becoming stroppy if they are in a difficult position will derail the game if they want. Rather than going for points they can simply practice action denial on other players. In terms of game story, I feel that's fine and it makes sense to me. But it will probably ruin your experience. 

It doesn't work for people who are focused on VPs and winning. This game is an exercise in story-telling and a cautionary tale: we don't have a credible solution to deal with overpopulation; we'll never work together; large scale use of bio weapons would be appalling (and nukes worse so) and global conflict would end terribly for all parties concerned and likely end with no winners. Perfect sim ;).

The killer for me is how highly random the bio cards and special cards are. The Arabs seem appallingly underpowered.

With the right mix of players who appreciate strong negotiation games, this game is brilliant. The use of nuclear weapons in this game as deterrents that you are really better off never using not only rings true to reality, but is one of the best tools I've ever seen a game use for giving players in weak positions true bargaining power. It makes it a really, really bad idea to pick on losing players. On the flip side, if you play the game with people who don't care for negotiation, or are ok with tanking their game just to get back at someone, Tomorrow can easily be ruined. I don't get it to the table as much as I'd like for this reason, but with the right mix, this game is sublime.

After 3rd play.. Thats it, This game is Shit. Its not a negotiation game. Its not a war game. 90% of the cards never get used. The mechanics are simply juvenile.

Not my cup of tea. Hodgepodge of mechanics with a pretense of a negotiation game. There is no negotiation, only a ruse.

How do you win an unwinnable game? Tomorrow is the game that asks players to solve that question - It's an unusual and uncomfortable twist on Diplomacy - Every player is going to lose something. Winning the game will come at considerable loss, and you can't win if most players aren't willing to try and stay in the game to the end. Losing players can spike the game easily, so you have to show restraint, mercy and a deftness of touch. I love games that try to tap into different facets of strategy and diplomacy, and this well and truly does that.

This game has an awesome and dark story, which helps it get to the table despite being a bit over complicated for most groups. I appreciate this more as a design work of art than a game, although there is good game play there too for interactive groups (won't play as well with the Euro game mindset). Also really needs at least 4 to play which isn't always perfect.

One play. The rating will remain as I don't see playing this again. There seems to be little opportunity for planning as the turn order is left to the whim of one player. This is important as actions can be blocked by other players, and one can only hope they can perform their plans depending on again, the whims of other players in reacting or not to their own or previous actions.

Wow this dragged. I'm not playing this again. It was all fine & dandy at first, taking each other out, but then, well, there really wasn't much else to it. Sure, there were things that LOOKED like we were doing something, but in the end we couldn't wait for it to be over. The death track makes it a cooperative, and by the time we got that figured out, we'd had enough.

RATING: 3
I wanted to enjoy this game but it didn't quite pan out that way. I think what turned me off it was that the black cards at the end, 1 drawn was a single point and 1 drawn was a four point. That is a big difference in a game that seemed very close. And some cards had points and abilities that scored more than 1. And the cards seemed quite difficult to get. Maybe it was my faction, I know I could have played them differently but there are too many little bits that niggle at me about the game. 1 Play.

Played with 4, needs at least 5. Took a few turns to get the mechanics down. We were not overly diplomatic until the end. The game became much more interesting as the table talk ramped up. The winner was not the obvious leader which will definitely affect strategies at the next play. The card laying mechanic is a bit finicky and we all agreed a clear decorum needs to be agreed upon prior to the start of the game.  Intriguing enough that it will get a second shot. With more players this could be a hit.

not as much negotiation as expected along with the two actions makes for a kind of "meh" game. nice theme. so-so mechanics. 

have no problem with the theme. if you're afraid to think a little about outcomes of humanity's future in a speculative setting you should probably continue to hide in the Escapist Board Game World where caricaturing sketchy concepts from fantasy/sci-fi through metaphor gets a pass and anything made to think a little is "morally bad".

Twilight Struggle sits at the best game on BGG which has a mechanic for ending the game with nukes going off.

most fantasy/sci-fi games caricature slaughter of "savage" species, employ militarization of everything, or try to hide the 10,000 years of ecological damage of farming in "Euro games".

i enjoy all of them and realize all their themes are inherently LOADED with atrocity. time to grow up a little.

The game itself is fairly solid, however the theme is quite strange and unappealing. It is like Pandemic turned into a dark and scary experience. 

Your take control of a superpower and compete against the other superpowers to try to depopulate the earth using biological weapons. Thrown into the mix is good old military action, nukes, cyber hacking and espionage. The components and the game are good, but the context and setting makes playing this a strange experience. 

Would play again, but not something I would add to my collection.

A lovely dark game that plays 4-6. The game requires the players to negotiate, and even after driving one player into the ground (you can't eliminate a player - a plus to the game) you have to turn on your allies.

RATING: 2
Perhaps my group just doesn't get negotiation games unless the negotiations are an explicitly encouraged part of the game structure, but we found little value in the purported diplomacy of Tomorrow. There was very little to negotiate over. Having your people killed didn't spark much resentment because there is rarely anything you can do to defend your pawns. There was no fluctuating tension, the whole game was just a flat, boring experience.

Also, I wasn't a fan of the theme, not because I found the idea objectionable, but the realisation of it in the gameplay was lazy and uninspired, which is a big issue considering the game uses the theme as the main unique selling point.

Overall my impression of the game is that it's a half-baked product that was rushed out before it was ready in order to meet the shipping date, especially considering the significant changes in the rules that we see between the Kickstarter prototype and the final result submitted to the printer just 5 months later.

RATING: N/A
coöperatief spel waarbij iedereen samenwerkt om verschillende bevolkingsgroepen uit te roeien. aan het einde van het spel wint de persoon echter die het meeste mensen van zijn bevolkingsgroep in leven heeft. in dit spel moet je veel onderhandelen en aanvallen. risk meets pandemie meets diplomacy. 2,7

Deze titel deed in Amerika heel wat stof opwaaien, vooral aangaande het thema dat "echt wel niet zou kunnen" volgens onze preutse vrienden. Het thema omvat niet meer dan een relatief realistisch beeld (jammerlijk genoeg) van een niet zo verre toekomst waarin we de wereld als menselijk ras compleet verziekt hebben. De populatie is gewoon te groot geworden en overschrijdt de draagkracht van deze aardbol. Het is nu aan ons, leiders van de grote wereldmachten om dit probleem op te lossen door gericht populaties uit te roeien. U vermoedt al dat dit een onderhandel spel is waar u uw tegenspelers pijn gaat moeten doen. U zal ook wel moeten want indien u niet tijdig het wereldprobleem oplost, verliest u gezamenlijk. Punten worden enkel geteld als u de doodshoofdfiche op de smiley krijgt op het onheilsspoor. 

Tomorrow loopt over negen ronden, aangegeven door de negen gebeurteniskaarten die bij aanvang van elke ronde in het spel komen. Zo heeft u ook onmiddellijk fase 1 van het spel gehad. De gebeurteniskaarten bestaan uit drie delen, u leest enkel het deel waarin het spel zich op dat moment bevindt, geel, rood of bruin. Dit kan u weten door onderaan op het bord te kijken, want daar loopt een onheilsspoor waarop wordt aangegeven of je al dan niet goed bezig bent. 

In fase 2 (van de vijf overigens) mag de speler die de Cyberspacekaart controleert (bij aanvang China) het voordeel hiervan benutten. Je kan opteren om de speelvolgorde aan te geven, een strategiekaart te trekken (geel, rood of bruin afhankelijk van waar we op het onheilsspoor zitten) of een strategiekaart te stelen. Indien u wil stelen kan het slachtoffer in kwestie dit blokkeren, maar dan heeft hij of zij één actie minder in fase 3.

In fase 3 gaan de spelers twee actiekaarten uitkiezen (uit zes) die ze graag willen uitvoeren. Ze leggen beide kaarten gedekt voor zich neer. Indien ze zich hebben verdedigt in fase 2 met de "spionagekaart" mogen ze slechts één kaart leggen.

Fase 4 is de langste en belangrijkste fase in het spel, dan worden de acties gespeeld. De speler die met Europa speelt of die met de Cyberspacekaart (die opteerde voor het kiezen van de speelvolgorde) bepaalt wie wanneer aan de beurt komt. Als een speler aan de beurt is, mag hij één van z'n kaarten opendraaien en de bijhorende actie uitvoeren of passen. Als je echter past, dan verlies je één van je kaarten, maar kan je tijdens de tweede actie wel één van beide kaarten kiezen. 
- biological : gooi een ziekte in de strijd die onmiddellijke slachtoffers maakt in een regio naar keuze en gooi met de dobbelsteen om te zien of aangrenzende gebieden ook geïnfecteerd worden. De fiche op het onheilsspoor gaat naar beneden overeenkomstig met het aantal en de soort van slachtoffers (Amerikanen en Russen vervuilen meer, dus dan gaat de fiche meer stappen naar beneden). De andere spelers kunnen voor het uitspelen van de ziektekaart deze actie voorkomen door de spionagekaart te spelen. Andere spelers kunnen op hun beurt de blokkage dan weer blokkeren door hun spionagekaart open te leggen (uiteraard moet deze dan wel tussen de twee gekozen actiekaarten liggen)
- nukes : gooi een kernbom op een regio naar keuze, er sterft 1 pion en nog 1 pion voor elke vijf die er nog zijn. De speler die een kernbom gooit, zal op het einde van het spel sowieso 3 strafpunten krijgen, maar ook de speler die de regio controleert waar er een kernfiche ligt, krijgt 3 minpunten
- militair : kondig aan met hoeveel manschappen je een regio binnenvalt, andere spelers kunnen met hun militair kaart de ene of de andere zijde ondersteunen. Fiches verslaan elkaar één-op-één en komen onmiddellijk bij de spelers terug (onbruikbaar, tot na de opschoonfase).
- spionage : kan dus gebruikt worden om andere kaarten te blokkeren
- eigen actie : elke supermacht heeft nog één extraatje (zo mag Europa standaard de volgorde bepalen, kan Arabië een terreuraanval doen, is Rusland beschermt tegen verspreiding van virussen, is Amerika moeilijker om aan te vallen en start China met de Cyberspacekaart)

De vijfde en laatste fase is een opschoonfase waarin de spelers fiches kunnen bijleggen op het bord of terugnemen, waarin de cyberspacekaart kan beschermd worden met een andere fiche en waarin eerdere slachtoffers terug beschikbaar worden.

Als de spelers erin slagen om de fiche op de smiley te krijgen, dan is de aarde gered en worden er punten uitgedeeld :
- pionnen in je eigen land (afhankelijk van supermacht zijn ze 1,2,3 of 5 punten waard)
- pionnen in gebieden die je controleert : 1 punt per twee pionnen (afgerond naar boven)
- pionnen die je hebt verzamelt als slachtoffers : 1 punt per twee pionnen
- politieke punten verzamelt op je strategiekaarten : kunnen positief of negatief zijn
- 3 minpunten voor elke gegooide kernbom of kernbom in je gebieden
De speler met de meeste punten wint het spel.

A provisional 6 after one play. Fairly chaotic play. It seems like there are not very many viable options on your turn and you end up doing a lot of military or biological actions. It's also time consuming trying to figure out everyone's score during the game. It's doable but takes a lot of counting. Since there is a lot of "hit the leader" moves, knowing everyone's score is important.

Not my type of game. Conversation/diplomacy game that masks an underlying high-random Euro. Too slow for what it delivers, but might be good with the right group - which my group is not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
There are two main aspects I don't like with this game. The first is that you have a choice of 2 out of 5 actions which you can do each round - but this is no real choice as I think you have to chose biological warfare in at least 90% of the rounds to have a chance to win as this is the main source for victory-points. So this is no real choice. The other actions aren't very interesting. One is a 50:50 chance to get an advantage which I consider a bit boring. Even military protection is kind of boring.

The other aspect I don't like is that I can't see any erwin in a group of experienced players. With a group of 5-6 players I would bet that at the moment you reach the black zone at least one player doesn't see any chance to win the game any more. So he will start to nuke the second-worst player killing his chances to win, so that he will join the nuking-party. And once all but 1 or 2 players are using nukes and blocking bio-attacks the game comes to a stop.... On the other hand if you really manage to keep the game perfectly balanced until really late in the game - why play the first 2/3rd of the game?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I wanted to like this, and the first time I played I sort of did. The second time I played the rules made more sense from the start and I understood what I was doing, which unfortunately for Tomorrow made the game unplayable, unfun, and simply frustrating.

At face value it looks like a reverse Pandemic. The main goal is to depopulate the world and get points for how many people you've killed.

The game is supposed to be mostly cooperative, but unlike well designed cooperative games, one player can decide that if they are not going to win everyone will lose. Also if playing it purely cooperatively the game is extremely easy. The only reason it is hard is because each player is trying to protect their own population while nuking everyone else's. This leads to a problem in that for most of the game players are actively making decisions that bring about a loss of the game. Every mechanic of the game is detrimental to winning.

Cyber and Biologics are fun and interesting abilities. The espionage, nuke, and military abilities are terrible. If you take those out, there's the potential for a fun cooperative everyone wins but one player wins more score-based game. With them in, score is too dependent on who has the most population they control which means players are constantly working against winning. Unfortunately, taking out everything but Cyber and Biologics would leave a game where the last player wins control of Cyber, and the Cyber player gets to choose turn order or draw a card, which means the last player will always be choosing taking turn order in order to keep Cyber. Then you're just left with Biologics, which is entirely too random to be an interesting mechanic. 

The only way I can see this game being fun at all is with a group of people who purely like to actively screw everyone else over with no interest in winning or losing. The problem with this mindset though, is that if you play it this way there is nothing left but players being assholes to one another. If that is the kind of game you enjoy, there are far better choices out there that have far more depth and more interesting mechanics.

In the end, Tomorrow is more social commentary than game, and if I wanted social commentary I'd look elsewhere. Would never play again.

Very easy mechanics, plenty of opportunity for negotiations/alliances and bluffing. Sure, with only 2 out of 5 possible actions to play per round it could lead to some predictability, however strategy cards and overall chaos does well to mix it up.

There was more negotiation than I anticipated but much less than should be in a "negotiation game". 

Updated: second game play affirms my previous opinion. There is so little negotiation that this is definitely NOT a negotiation game. The game has some serious flaws as-is. The basic mechanism of the game is: you and your opponents spend all game removing victory points from the game until the end game is reached; then the person with the most victory points is the winner. This is not conducive to negotiation.

IMO, the game is very unbalanced regarding the actions (Bioattack was played every single round by every player, nukes are crappy and the strategy cards are really swingy points-wise). Would play again if pressed to see if the evaluation holds but I am highly sceptic regarding the balancing. In my group, we would probably tweak the nukes, actions and scoring (basically the whole game ;))! Note: the theme doesn't offend me at all!

Not really a game since you don't have any decision at all. The game plays you.

This game is hilarious, but requires players with a dark sense of humor who are willing to role play a bit. Trying to just play it as a puzzle game and only paying attention to mechanics is pretty boring. The bargaining, alliances, and backstabbing among the players is what makes this so much fun.

Compact military game.  Atypical theme - I think it's cool.

When you have only 1.5h and feel hunger for a military conflict game (on a map) this is the one.  Right now I cannot think of better alternative fitting this timeframe.

Clean rules and the simplicity of choices (enhanced by special cards) make this game quick, smooth and playable.

Still, I feel no need to buy it.  I'm happy to play sb's copy.

Sounds intriguing and luckily not too too similar to a current project, I really like the semi-coop nature in some games (although few do it right) and this shares that with my own game.

This is quite good game. But I have discovered that when I should play conflict game I much more prefer wargames. 

Theme is interesting. 

Game is little limited by small number of actions so for example if someone does something really bad to you in one of last rounds you will simply not even be able to retaliate fully with nukes cause you can launch only one per round. This is probably good from game balance perspective but thematically does not make much sense.

RATING: 5
Looks fantastic.  Really wanted to get a chance to play during BGG Con, but never had the opportunity.  When a member of my gaming group showed up with a copy I was super excited to play.  

The theme is very dark but didn't bother me, basically the earth has become so overpopulated that each nation needs to work together to wipe out most of humanity, however you want to be standing tallest on the pile of ash that is left.  

The turns are fast and easy to understand.  I feel like this should have been a great time, but honestly there isn't much of a game here in my opinion.  There are really only 2 ways to shrink the population, bio-weapons being the main choice, and it's hard to work together with countries who are using those on your population.  You may be tempted to use the other method, and nuke your opponents in retaliation, but nukes are really, really bad for the co-op aspect of the game and often reduce the population less effectively than bio-weapons.

There are other possible actions which enable you to fight for control of cyberspace or neutral countries but those don't decrease the population at all.

Not a fan.

Overall very entertaining. There seems to be more room for intricately constructed pacts and plans here. A very loud game, you need to haggle a lot. Until the final scoring the relative standing of the players in terms of victory points is a bit opaque. Very swingy Events.

This game may wear after a few plays but so far it's good fun doing absolutely horrific things to the human population and minimizing your own damage. It's important to depopulate the world but make sure more of the other guy's people get "depopulated" than yours.

Very entertaining game with lots of table talk, negotiation, threats, pleading, and exchanges of high fives! The board with the bits is beautiful, and the theme is really fun. Those idiots avoiding this game are really missing out!

I wasn't sure what to expect on my first play of Tomorrow. We had four players so we couldn't play every country, and weren't entirely sure how that affected the rules. One play through really helped there.

My group absolutely loved this game. As dark as the subject is, we ended up turning it into a hilariously evil game. We ended up losing because of backstabbing each other too frequently, but even the loss was a good time.

I think our group has a better handle on the gameplay now and has a better feel for how the diplomacy should work out. I expect to see this coming off the shelf pretty frequently in the future.

Directly attacking population that players score from, and which have been carefully guarded during the game, is downright nasty.   A very angry game. The players. The players …  A decent enough game, and while I like confrontation / direct interaction in games, I didn't like how nasty this game felt against other players (did’t mind the overall premise of the game).

After one play, I feel this game has a ton of potential with a good group. A very unique set of choices and interesting interactive gameplay. I found a ton of diplomacy in a game that kind of (but not fully) scratches the Supremacy itch. My rating will change after more plays.

Tomorrow is a light-hearted, semi-cooperative game about pushing humanity to the brink of extinction for fun and profit. Well, technically, no one profits, and it's not actually any fun. But why quibble?

It's exactly the sort of morbid theme that should fill my little black heart with glee. But mostly I (and to be fair, the rest of the players) puzzled over the rules and kept thinking about whatever random things (sex, Twinkies, dancing monkeys) popped into my head. I can't actually guarantee that any of them were thinking about sex or Twinkies, but dancing monkeys...surely. I mean, who isn't doing that? You're doing that right now!

The worst, and I mean very worst, thing about Tomorrow, other than the fact that it exists, is that the end game ruins what little fun was to be had. Someone with no chance of winning can just agree to be obliterated, thus guaranteeing the group will achieve a high enough body count.

It's not the worst game ever. Cosmic Encounter still exists, right? And there were a few laughs as we reread and reinterpreted the rules together.

But seriously, you'd think genocide would be a lot more entertaining than this.

Interesting game with an awesome theme. Only problem is that losing player or players can easily launch some nukes in the end so that nobody wins and everyone loses. This is a MAJOR design flaw that they should have fixed somehow, maybe with hidden objectives, ability to block nukes, etc.

I recommend everyone try this once. But after that, you probably don't want to play it again.

Dear Lord, please don't make me play this one again.  

Devoid of meaningful decisions, for a game that takes 90-120 minutes to play that is a bit of a problem.  The interaction centres around "take that" plays, but there are so many ways for a player to "spoil" the game so that everyone loses - so if a player feels like they have been victimised by too many "take that" decisions, the game will not end well.  So the players succeeding - and ONE player being declared the winner - requires very careful management of the only interaction that there is between the players!

There are better, smarter, and more fun ways to game this sort of theme. FWIW.

a thematic simulation game for sure, but one with a lot of neat game theory.  A bit too random but that's not so bad in a politics game.

This is the Kickstarter version with wooden pieces (for example the atomic clouds).
The theme is discussed controversially I know. But it is a game that makes you think about the future of mankind. And I have to say: it is a very good game. Every major power has a unique facility. The mechanic how the player order is determined is just ingenious (normally done by the EU player). This is a very assymetric game but also a tense one and exciting until the end. We played with full six players and it was a real blast! In the end the Arab Caliphate won just by one point in front of India. The components of the game are well designed, only the rulebook could be clearer at some points but all in all we had no problems. I can recommend "Tomorrow" for gamers who don't shy at macabre themes and who have fun playing Ameritrash games. This is definitely an "in your face" one.

The game is not fully developed. The bio card gives you much more victory points and you attack only regions with high population. The other cards are nearly useless, not important or random. The theme was interesting, unique and the only reason it’s not gets a lower rating. 

This game is an example for many Kickstartergames, interesting theme with very bad and unbalanced game mechanics.

The semi-cooperative nature of this game is one of a kind. You have to reduce the population of the planet drastically and be willing to sacrifice some of your own kind. But everything is worth some points and if you are not going to win why should someone else? Until now humanity always died because someone felt he has lost and started nuking other players to provoke them to fire back.

RATING: 4.5
When Tomorrow was released it attracted attention primarily because of its theme: a semi-cooperative Malthusian [i]Risk[/i] where players must eliminate 50% of the global population (primarily through tailored biological attacks) or everyone loses. In the case of victorious depopulation, of course, some are more victorious than others; it's best if other players' citizens are the ones to be dispatched onto their next great adventure.

In play it is an "experience game", i.e. "it's super random". Significant randomness from card draws and dice does inhibit strategy; gameplay is supposed to emerge from negotiations over players' limited pools of actions and targets -- temporary alliances, broken promises, good fun. In practice, though, military and biological weapons translate directly into victory points so the game incentivizes playing nothing else, and some regions just have more to kill. There is no penalty for losing your own citizens other than a few points, so you may be better off attacking than blustering defensively. 

The cybercard mechanism is a weird sideshow.

It's basically a cynical, strategy-gamers' party game, assuming your idea of beer and pretzels fun is committing genocide.

The rulebook is a disgrace and at least one rule in it, about whether control tokens are returned exhausted, has been flatly contradicted by the designer on the forums here.

Probably better with more people, but was really random and kind of a "take that" game where everyone has to self balance it or risk someone trying to ruin it for everyone. Not really my type of game.

I'm intrigued about the concept of mixing Diplomacy in a 'mutual negative' environment. Promises to be cut-throat (excuse the pun). Promising!

[EDIT: had rated this a '10' to offset bad ratings based on no actual gameplay experience, before. Have no clue about actual gameplay but eager to try this one out.]

[EDIT dec 2013] Ordered the KS edition with wooden tanks & mushroom clouds.

[EDIT March 2014] We played this with our gaming group and we had a blast. Of course, not knowing that a big part of the game is NOT pissing each other off TOO MUCH, we made a mistake by wiping out Russia pretty early in the game. He started nuking all out and in the end it turned out I (as the states) should have NOT used my CDC to counter the last biological deaths to have me win the game. As a 'show of good fate to the world' so to say.

Sadly, I did not realise this in time, preventing the biological disease from hitting the USA and thereby we lost the game.

Still a great experience, though I wonder about how our next game might play as Russia is in a VERY bad position not to send out those nukes. As he is so vulnerable to a 'last turn wipeout' strike, he might as well start nuking pre-emptively.

Defenitely a game that warrants more replay! And big plus for the design. Very slick and one of the coolest boardgame boxes all around.

Not a bad game (though it is quite evil), but kind of a skunky design.  The points on strategy cards are too swingy and there aren't enough viable options to choose from, so turns tend to be fairly obvious.   It's an ok negotiation game but is kind of lacklustre in other areas of its design.

The rulebook could also be clearer.

RATING: 7.8
A fun, semi-cooperative game of decimating humanity with biological and nuclear weapons for those with a morbid sense of humour, this definitely requires the right group to make it work. It often takes a couple of turns to overcome the initial resistance to being aggressive but the game absolutely requires it. The rules are superficially well-written but important points tend to be hidden in single sentences that are not necessarily where they should be, so you often find out after several games that you've been playing this or that incorrectly, but they're actually fairly simple and the game itself is pretty solid once you figure it out. It is susceptible to one player trashing the game for everyone else.

In the post-9/11 world of Islamophobia I'm not particularly happy with the depiction of the 'Arab Caliphate' and its 'terror' ability, but you can play without them if you aren't at the full 6 players.

People either love it or hate it, the later being hypocrites.

A fun asymetrical diplomacy game with a kinda world war 3 theme over a dying planets due to overpopulation.

A good game to remind us what could happen if we don't changes our way of living.

Would play it 6 times with 6 different friends just to have the feel of the different nations.

I know some people take offense to the theme, you do feel a little rotten at the things you hear yourself say, but it's not anything that troubles me.  It's an extreme idea of a worst case scenario.  In Pandemic the population is being wiped out by random pathogens, in Tomorrow those deadly viruses are weld by other players.  

The game is surprisingly pretty light, everyone has the same 5 actions and picks two to play each round.  Lots of slowly whittling down the population without hurting any feelings, while other see saw battles happen over Cyberspace control and military control, both to acquire special cards.  There's lots of room for strong arming and vendettas.  Each government is asymmetric and requires a slightly different tactic to succeed.  Russia for example has the most points tied to their limited population, it's almost required to attack them directly to keep them from winning, but everyone fears the wrath of Mother Russia and their supply of Nukes.  

The Nukes are interesting all around as they are detrimental to the global goal everyone needs to achieve, they hurt the player that wields them as well as their target.  So it takes a lot of consideration before using them, but at the same time you might need to show that you're not scared to use them if you want to deter future aggression towards you.

Gameplay feels a bit repetitive, but the fortunately the game takes around 90 minutes, just falls short of overstaying it's welcome.  I don't really like that 90% of the game people will be playing the same 3-4 actions, and usually the people who play those actions first will get shut down.  Turn order is at the whim of the European Union.

There's surprisingly less negotiation than I would have liked, there's really  not much to bargain with.  It's less negotiation and more, "if you hurt me I'll hurt you."

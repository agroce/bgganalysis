Καρτοπαίχνιδο για 2 άτομα βασισμένο στην διάσημη σειρά βιβλίων. (Πότε θα βγάλεις τον 6ο τόμο ρε Martin??) Έχει στις κάρτες φωτογραφίες από την αντίστοιχη τηλεοπτική σειρά του HBO αντί για artwork κάτι που λογικά θα εκτιμήσουν οι φαν. Να σημειώσω εδώ πως δεν έχω παίξει ποτέ το Game of Thrones LCG αλλά η εντύπωση που μου δόθηκε είναι πως αυτό το Card game είναι μια water down έκδοση του αρχικού LCG. Λίγο πιο casual δηλαδή για να πιάσει τους φανς της τηλεοπτικής σειράς.

Στο παιχνίδι περιέχονται 2 έτοιμες προκατασκευασμένες τράπουλες 50 καρτών (Lannisters vs Starks) ενώ ο κάθε παίκτης έχει και 7 plot κάρτες από τις οποίες διαλέγει και παίζει μια ανά γύρο. Αυτές οι plot κάρτες παίζουν μεγάλο ρόλο γιατί εκτός από το ability που έχουν, καθορίζουν παράλληλα το εισόδημα, το turn order αλλά και το πόσο μεγάλα μπόνους θα έχεις αν κερδίσεις τις μάχες. Γενικά πολύ ωραίος μηχανισμός.

Να σημειώσω πως το κουτί περιέχει έξτρα plot κάρτες για να μπορείς να draftάρεις τα plot σου, δίνοντας έτσι στο παιχνίδι αρκετό replayability. Πολύ καλή και η ποιότητα παραγωγής, ως συνήθως, από την FFG. Το παιχνίδι δείχνει να έχει αρκετό βάθος. Πρέπει να δοκιμάσω το LCG.

Μια χαρά είναι το παιχνίδι αλλά καλύτερα να περιμένετε να κυκλοφορήσει η δεύτερη έκδοση του LCG από την FFG κατά τον Σεπτέμβριο (νομίζω) και να επενδύσετε εκεί.

Beware - at first it may seems wildly unbalanced and unrewarding - it is not. Once the players gets a little more experienced and learn how to play the houses "right", it starts to shine. I'm only disappointed by the lack of expansions for the HBO rebrand - i don't have nor the will or the money to afford the LCG game and its countless expansions, but as yearly add-on with, say, Baratheon and Targaeryan houses, it would be an instant buy for me.

I like this game, but the big downside, is that the cards you draw in the first few rounds of the game will probably dictate success or failure, regardless of what strategy you employ.  Most games see the dominance winner taking a huge power lead after the first few rounds, while opposing player has practically no chance to come back.  So far, all games I have played have been complete routs (sometimes 15-0).  Makes it hard to be the loser, and not much fun to play if you don't get lucky.  There are also a few cards that are completely unfair (like iron throne, imprisoned, and brothel to name a few).  Removing these from the deck is an option.

I feel with a rules overhaul, this game could be great.

Nice card game for 2 players. I would prefer the artwork of the official card game rather than the HBO series pictures. The decks are preconstructed so there is no deckbuilding aspect, and so on limited strategy and tactics opportunities. It lasts a little longer than i expected... Ideal for casual players who like the tv series. I want to try a variant that each player makes a deck of 30 cards and that the victory condition is 10 power points, in order to shorten the time the game lasts and give the a game a touch of deckbuilding.

I know it's just the HBO version, rather than the fully fledged Living Card game, but at £7.50 from a HMV sale, it was a real steal. Very nice game, asymmetric decks and abilities, mean each side has to be played differently.

RATING: 7
Nice game, but since there won't be any expansions I'm really worried about the replayability of this game. Upgraded this rating to a 7 because of the plot-draft, which really makes the game more tense.

Acquired in auction 8/14

Played three round learning game with my college age son who is big fan of book and HBO series. The cards are cool to look at and read. The game played relatively fast after we figured out what to do. Luck of the draw on the cards determines a lot. Can see where one would get frustrated if not able to challenge due to one side getting good cards and the other not. Will need to play some more but has potential.

RATING: 7.25
Rating after two games (One victory for both houses once 15-0 but also 15-12), so even though it's asymmetrical it seems balanced enough that both houses may win. But is this due to player skills or just based on the luck of the draw? I have not enough plays under my belt for a conclusion. For now I like the game, but I also see that for subsequent plays the games asks for expansions.

Playing was excruciating.
Apparently routing is very common in the game- leading to a 15-0 end score. This led to an unenjoyable experience for both players- if you enjoy magic the gathering and have decided that building a deck is boring, go for it. I found it agonizing not being able to control what was in my deck, and it left such a bad experience that I doubt I'd ever want to try the expanded edition.

I have played the living card game and love it, but I do not own the living card game. My son picked this up at Target and it is a nice, entry-level version of the living card game. I think it is cool that the art work is from the HBO show (although I do not read the books or watch the show).

Bought it on a whim at Warzone (4/12/13) because I had just sold my 2nd Edition FF Board Game and was jonesing for some Thrones. It's a simpler version of the LCG and a game not a commitment.  I've rated it so low because I find it completely unbalanced in favor of Stark.

I was curious to see how AGOT LCG worked (and I am a fan of the series), so I thought this was a natural entry point, since I don't plan on investing in the LCG expacs anyway. UPDATE: Read rules, seems very straight forward and not that complicated. Component quality is outstanding, even for a FFG product. Thick clear cards and thick cardboard. Tried it now. Works well, asymetric, lots of choices. The game seems to be in the plot cards (esp since the Lannister/Stark decks are preconstructed), think it will be great with the draft variant. However, the Iron Throne card seems a little game breaking, at least it totally reduces tension and descisions regarding coin preservation and standing characters in the dominance fase. Think I will pull it next time I play.

This game walks a fine line between great and not really working. If either side doesn't draw cards it needs it can end in a 15-0 blowout. After 4 plays it's happened 2 or 3 times. If things are flowing the way they should, (lannisters getting money, starks getting characters) then it works fine.

Apparently the HBO version is a simplified and dulled down edition of Fantasy Flight Games' LCG (with the same name). The gameplay in this box is mostly static. There are variants that allow for you to change your plots, but you will be playing with the two same decks no matter what. The things that make LCGs so great is the deckbuilding aspects. I think I would enjoy the LCG, if the game mechanics aren't too clunky. As is, this elegant version has good mechanics. I hope those that buy this are able to use it with the LCG and its endless expansions.

Unboxed this last night. I have never played the original LCG so I can't make a comparison. In this set you get two complete decks, Lannister and Stark, and cardboard coins and power tokens. You play your cards against your opponent to gain power tokens.

The good: The characters, locations, plots, and actions are all true to the series thus far and I like this about the game. It also seems like a fun premise even though I haven't gotten in a full game yet.

The bad: The cards themselves seem very thin, which is annoying when that is the bulk of the game. There is a lot of text on the cards which makes the game slow to get into, since you have to read all 7 cards in your hard and think about them. There are typos in the instruction manual (begining? really?). 

Will update when I have had a chance to play more, but for now, not one of my smartest buying decisions. Probably should have just gotten the regular card game, especially since I have read all the books.

Edit: I just can't get into it. Too much text, too many unclear instructions, too slow to get into.

Very nice.  Slightly simpler than the LCG.  Still has some of the crazy, complicated timing issues, though, so you still have to read the LCG FAQ to make sense of it all.  I sold my copy of the LCG because I like the non-collectability of this set.  It's a slightly more streamlined game with better artwork.  Anyway, I wrote all this in my review.

July 2015:  Starting to play using this setup variant:  "Draw 11 cards.  Marshall cards costing up to 5 gold (incl. attachments and duplicates, but still only 1 Limited card).  Do not redraw cards before first Plot phase."  It offers more deck control and gives an incentive to play higher-cost characters from the outset, rather than simply playing the most cards right away.  So far we like it.


[i]*Own two copies each of the fan-made decks (most version 2.0):
[b]Arryn[/b] (March 2015; probably needs a reprint)
[b]Baratheon[/b] (Dec 2015)

The first thing I noticed about this when I opened the box, is the lower quality of the card stock.  As opposed to other products they make, in an effort to gloss up this version, they skimped on the durability.  No doubt to sell card protectors, which for this game, seems a must in order to avoid damage and marking of the cards.

A two-player card game; very similar to Magic:the Gathering.  However, I found the game mechanics less elegant and the combat element less intuitive.  The card mix seemed odd; multiple copies of the same cards instead of more variation.  It also seems that House Lannister's plot cards are more powerful than are the Starks'.

Fun game, also in the HBO version. Now, regarding the HBO version, I fear that unless more houses are added that it will grow old fast (I solved this by printing out more houses).

Beautiful game; great for fans of the books or especially the television series. Not a bad game, either, although you're mostly at te mercy of the card draws, and then the cards pretty much play themselves.

My brother and I didn't like the "lockdowns" that could occur when someone got ahead in Military Battle...how that played out was a letdown to us.  The Intrigue and Wisdom Battles were interesting, though.

Ordered all the professionally printed fan designed decks, but have only played the core game with my girlfriend. Generally enjoyable, but (much) slower than anticipated. Like all card games you play better as you already know what cards can do.

Wasn't too impressed by this game based on one of my favourite series of all time, way too many things going on each round, making the game seem more like work than fun.

After two sessions I have to say "Bravo."  This game really hits the hot spots of George RR Martin's first book, and the HBO character images are beautifully rendered on the cards.  This is NOT an  all encompassing sell-your-left-arm time commitment to one game like its big brother, it is a solid strategy game, dripping with theme;  you can easily play several games in one sitting. Not a filler game, but no brain burner either. Well worth the price of admission--recommended!

It's like the LCG only with two pretty good decks pre-constructed and 1v1 only. The decks play quite well and feel like they are loaded with good options. If you only intend to play GoT with two, then I think this is a far better purchase than actually going through the LCG.

Weakness? It's usually whoever's deck fires first and stronger that wins. There are a lot of tricks and tactical plays you can make but if you do not see the strong cards you generally are not going to win.

Still, lots of fun. Pull The Iron Throne out of both decks though. That is wretched.

Kind of interesting, but Game of Thrones with two players just feels vindictive.  I beat my GF the first time and she said she never wanted to play again.  It was interesting game play, but just didn't draw me in.  Certainly worth a try.

I like several of the mechanics of this game. I especially like the way the plot cards work, and this is an unique mechanic I have not experienced before. However, I really did not care much for this game. I feel the same way about this game like I felt about War of Honor and Romance of the Nine Empires. The game has a lot of mechanics that work together, but do not do much. This game bogs down something awful Each potential challenge has to be figured in advance, each opponent potential challenge has to be figured out, and sometimes doing nothing is the best option. For me the game really lacked excitement, felt bloated, and it was just not fun to play.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Plays logged under the LCG entry since it is essentially identical with just a special/limited card selection.

Love the banner style card backs on this, and if you like the HBO show then the photo stills are great.

If you like the gameplay, then step on up to the second edition of the proper card game.

I feel like the core set isn't a complete game in and of itself, and I haven't yet picked up any expansions or chapter packs. It's a little daunting.

Slightly more efficient and (maybe?) more balanced than the vanilla core set for 2 players. Same game though, so see that one's rating.

RATING: 7.3
Hmm. The Iron Throne card might well break the game; one player had it in his starting hand and so scored seven 'free' points in seven rounds (before we called it).

Without these 2 cards, I think there is an interesting game here, though like many card games, I'm not entirely convinced I played the game well, or whether I drew cards that just happens to work well together.

The fact that it is not a living card game (translation: money sink) is a big plus for me as I'd never be into spending £200+ on a questionably balanced game.

Summary: an interesting, if not massively promising, first play which requires further investigation.

Update: I've played it a few more times now and the order in which the cards come out will have a major impact on the outcome of the game. It felt a little like, in my last play, that the Lanister player is trying to hold on to prevent a quick Stark victory. The longer the game goes on, the better the expected outcome for them.

Rating up from 6 to 7.3.

This is a solid game that captured the theme very well. The characters all felt very thematic and I like how there are intrigue and power struggles in addition to the usual military fights. The plot cards are a little strange and I'm still not sure how I feel about them, but they can definitely change the game in a big way.  If I wasn't already invested in the LotR LCG I would think about investing in Game of Thrones.

I like it quite a bit, but unfortunately it's a little bit too confrontational for some. We don't mind games that have some level of confrontation, but in this game every move involves messing with the other player: making them discard cards, taking their victory points, or even killing their characters permanently. It probably won't get many more plays from me.

Funny to imagine a fan of the show who's never played a gamer-game trying to figure this out. There are at least a few things that absolutely need the full game FAQ to get sussed. (Joffrey's ability triggering when Joffrey dies, for instance.) We've probably played a dozen times. We take a long time. We have fun. This is finally gonna get the bricks of LCG stuff I've been sitting on played. Well, it's gonna get the base game played, anyway, and the other stuff looked at.

HBO edition. I like it, but then my opposition got tired of me winning all the time :) Otherwise pictures are really nice and gameplay is okay. But once you get the cards you need it can be game over very quickly. It doesn't feel like you can come back easily if you´re already behind. Either you have the good heroes out and you are already winning, or you don´t and whatever hero card you pull out is managed by your opposition. A bit one-sided in that respect.

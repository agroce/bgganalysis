Minis quality is lower than previous releases, but the sculpts were not originally Heroscape figures.  Some of the tiles fit together a little rough, but other than that this thing is a beauty.  A return to thicker cards.  The best rulebook yet in terms of content and materials.  The units are fun and full of theme.  Uncommon heroes and treasure glyphs are great enhancements to the game.  This will alter the core Heroscape game in a very positive way even if this particular game/set/expansion doesn't make it to the table.

My personal first monetary foray into Heroscape, and while it may not contain as much terrain nor figures as other master sets, Battle for the Underdark still serves as an excellent introduction for newbies like me.  The rules and campaigns are easy to understand and fun to play.  A blast to play with 2, but with additional figures and terrain (through other master sets/ expansion) can easily accommodate more.

I like this set, though smallish, it still is far cry from being worthless for the Heroscape fan. Following the scenarios is actually good fun, and provides a nice contrast to the usual all out battle. So for now I will choose, happily I may add, to not worry about the future directions the property may or may not take, and continue to conquer this first dungeon!

This is a fun set that features characters from Dungeons & Dragons.  It can function as a dungeon crawl, but I didn't have much success using it that way.  Too many characters were dying in between each section.  Still, playing the rooms in isolation is quite a bit of fun.

I'm not much on the D&D expansion, and yet I like this set very much. The new Stalagmites and Shadow tiles add in great replayablitliy.  The included figures are great without being overpowered. Having a low cost Acid Dragon is a nice bonus. New terrain to really sell that cave/dungeon feel to a map. Would recommend.

While there are fewer miniatures than in previous Master Sets, the ones included work really well together.
The campaign is a major step forward, compared to "Swarm of the Marro". Online scenarios are very well thought out.

For synergies and terrain, I would pick this one over SotM

I know this is a base set, but I consider this as an expansion to [gameid=11170]. 

A good expansion to [gameid=11170], and adds some nice terrain and figures to the game.  I rate it as an average (5) expansion.

It did include a nice new rulebook to the game as well. Although I didn't really want Heroscape to go into D&D theme, I was hoping it would keep it alive.  Obviously the D&D theme didn't work that well since they discontinued Heroscape.  I just use these parts with my other Heroscape terrain and figures (IE: as an expansion).

I always wanted to integrate my DnD play with heroscape, and here we have the perfect system to do it.  To truly do this, you would need a leveling system too, but heroscape figures and tiles look SOOOO much better than flat paper backgrounds and player tiles (that I currently use).

D&D turns out to be a good match for Heroscape. The RPG has been moving toward a more tactical miniatures experience for some time, and so this Heroscape version of the game feels appropriately like "D&D Lite." This set is a little thin on components, but still a good time -- just realize that the scenarios can be swingy because there are so few troops in the box. The Drow really need another squad so they can swarm the heroes, and the heroes could use a unit of hirelings to give them some fodder ... but for such small scenarios, the set gives good play out of the box, with memorable situations and flavorful scenarios. I think the heroes are stronger, overall -- some of their synergies are very potent, while the monsters kind of feel like punching bags, trying to swarm the heroes while not having enough guys to properly form a swarm. As good a place to jump into Heroscape as any.

I was brought on as a play tester of this set later in its development.  

I won't rate any of the future Heroscape stuff.  I was a huge fan first, so I'll let my appreciation of the earlier releases stay.  This was the game system that brought me to this site, more or less.

Throughout all of the testing, I've been very impressed with the stuff that Peter, Paul, Jerry, Colby and Chris have turned out.  I'm extremely excited about the future as well.

Interesting twist...
 Any day now... 
  GOT IT!

Sure you could complain about Master set shrinkage, reused D&D figures, and icebergs cast in grey plastic, but hey, it works! 
Sometimes the most creativite solutions come from working with limited ressources, and I think this is a worthy addition, that brings something new to the Heroscape game.
Great new figures, and interesting scenarios! Making those 4 heroes work together is the main source of fun in this version of the game. 
I´m looking forward to more treassure glyphs in the coming expansions...
The upcoming expansions look very intersting. This spin-off is fleshing out fast!

A word of WARNING:
If character creation, exploration, and other such RPG-like elements is what you´re looking for in a Dungeon Crawl, you should probably seek your fun elsewhere! Heroscape is, at heart, a tactical combat game, no matter what guise it comes in.

This title adds a campaign of a sort, with chained scenarios. The different scenarios are actually rooms and you play one room at a time, with treasure and deaths carrying over in the next room, but wounds are healed. You are very careful to try and conserve your party, because once someone dies, their gone (except for one resurrection potion) and you will miss their services in the next room. Very good!

Doesn't really matter which Master Set you start with. Either it falls flat instantly for you, or you will buy anything you can get your hands on. At least, I can hardly imagine someone saying: '[i]Hm, this is a nice, well rounded game in this box, there's absolutely no need for boosters.[/i]'. The addictive nature of Heroscape comes from the vast number of thematically and mechanically different units you can pit against each other; Master Sets are just large boxes of terrain pieces, of which you can get never enough. 
Pure, unadulterated tactical fun with extremely high toy factor.

The best miniatures skirmish game I've ever played.
This Master Set has very little figures, their scale seems to be a bit odd and the shadow mechanic is difficult to implement properly in custom games. I wouldn't recommend it alone, but it works as an expansion.

PROS
- Amazing terrain: absolutely no other game looks this good when displayed on the table.
- Good-looking pre-painted figures.
- Easy to teach and learn.
- Simple atributes and powers system for the characters, with no complicated rules nor exceptions.
- Simple movement and combat system: no need for rulers nor any other components.
- High level of strategy with the possibility of bluffing and deceiving.
- The possibility of creating an unlimited number of scenarios and variants.

CONS
- The almost inexistent distribution in Spain.
- The fact that it has been discontinued for a lot of years, so finding material isn't easy nor cheap.

I had no interest in Heroscape due to its multi-genre theme, but I took the plunge with this set due to the D&D theme. It looks like it may be a hit for me and my seven-year old daughter.  We like the LEGO-like experience of building the battlefield then pitting our forces against each other.  It is definately tabletop eye candy. The basic rules are way too simplistic to be any fun, but the "master" rules have enough depth to keep me interested. The rules are clean with lots of illustrated examples and niclely formatted.  I hope the D&D theme is well supported with expansions.

Bad value for the money.  The sets keep getting smaller and smaller.  Heroscape attracted me because of its anything goes whackiness ... now it is getting sucked into the single genre of D&D - bye bye history, bye bye sci-fi, bye bye aliens, bye bye killer robots, bye bye ninjas, bye bye me ...

I'm still not sure how I feel about the DnD scape.  Wizards likes to buy games and ruin them, and I can already see this happening.  In this set they make only one squad of the non-uniques, making you have to buy two copies of this to have two squads.  This means I have a bunch of duplicate heroes now, a problem not had in any previous set.  The dragon looks a bit funny, and the paint jobs were half assed.  Still, game play wise the units are neat and the shadow tile idea is pretty cool.

I bought 2 copies of this one. Good mechanics, but miniatures are recycled from D&D Miniatures and they are different in size, color and quality.

For me Heroscape ends with the Valkrill's Gambit set...

Me encanta sacar todos los personajes y piezas de mapa, montar el escenario, montar el ejercito, la historia... Todo tan personalizable! Es genial! Y mas fácil de aprender a jugar imposible. Quiero hacerme con todo el heroscape que pueda!!!!!!! 

Este Master Set en concreto: Pues está bien, ha sido mi primer set, pero lleva poca cosa en comparación con el Set I y II. Pero a pesar de ello no deja de ser recomendable, el troll es una bestia y el Dragón me encanta con su especial de ataque en las sombras. Y esa escena de rescatar a un héroe que se encuentra prisionero en una jaula en el agua a punto de ahogarse me pareció genial!

Continues the unfortunate degeneration of what is called a "Master Set" into something barely playable on its own.
I guess if it is viewed as simply an expansion to the true game, it could be considered a successful addition. 
The problem is - there is no longer a single Master Set that kids can buy at a store to get into this game the right way. So it makes further expansions kinda odd since no new players can pick up the game at a store unless they buy at least 2 of these puppies + some expansions to provide unit variation, shelling out a hell of a lot more than $40 for the perfection that was Rise of the Valkyrie (MS1).
Unlike a multitude of HS fans, I embrace using D&D minis to eke some more life (and hopefully creative units) out of this game. The D&D line of minis has a ton of workable pre-painted minis that can work great in HS. Many excellent customs have used them for wildly creative units through the years. Further, it gives people the option to buy the D&D minis on their own and just play with the cards.
It's actually neat seeing an official HS product include some custom creation ideas that have been floating around since the beginnings of the HS online community (dungeons, treasures, shadow abilities, common figures with more than 1 life, etc). It's too bad they couldn't go further, but the 10-year-old demographic target audience (still :( ) seems to hold back most of the neat ideas the game could expand to.

Heroscape is a great game system. Easy to follow and play time is reasonable. Biggest downfall seems to be target audience. Looks like it could be very childish. Maybe that was the intent, but how many young children play D'n'D? The theme and gameplay appeal to an older audience and yet the look appeals to young children. Don't get me wrong I like the game and think it's cool but if I'm the target audience then there is no money to be made. Great thing about the game is that it's an investment. Found this set for about $20 at a shop recently and it sells for more on eBay already. That's also a downside, prices are going to get high for anyone who wants it. Overal a fun game that has a core fan set that loves it. I wouldn't be too surprised if the brand reappears.

I really like the campaign that comes with the game. The characters abilities have been very carefully designed to encourage the player to use their powers together. If you fail to work together with your four heroes then you will fail to make it through the campaign. The drow, dragon, and troll are also very cool.I love having the rock and shadow pieces to add to any map. I am also a big fan of the visual design of each character included with this set, and do not care that they are just D & D miniatures put into a heroscape set.

RATING: 7
Unlike the other two, this is the only Heroscape box which doesn't seem to be a 'base-set'. It seems to be an introduction to the game - with a sample of what you could get if you get the other packages...

If this is all you can get, then you'll need at least two to make up even the smaller 'swarm of the Marro' box, and even then you'll lack a lot of the variety available in that set.

It's good to see if you like the game, and a nice little expansion to give you some unique terrain bits and a dragon, but it's either an expansion, or an 'intro kit'.

A good effort for WotC's first master set.  The new dungeon terrain is quite nice and the shadow tiles add a fun new element to maps.  The figures are good for dungeon crawls but probably won't show up in many competitive builds.  Good set for the money - superior to Marvel which was at the same price point but RotV remains the king of master sets.

An excellent HeroScape master set, whether it is your entry point to the system or an addition to what came before. This came at a time when production costs were rising, and it has less in the box than Swarm of the Marro, and far less than Rise of the Valkyrie, but the quality of the scenarios saves it.

As with the other master sets, the value is multiplied if you add associated expansion packs, but even if you just play what comes in the box, it's a great value. It makes an absolutely stunning gift for any child who loves fantasy combat, and one that adults can enjoy equally.

I've not yet worked through the scenarios in the game, but just for the added terrain and the new squads and heroes this is a good Master Set. It lacks the terrain variety or quantity of RotV, but still doesn't seem like a bad deal.

The linked scenarios look interesting, even if they will perhaps lack the replayability of the originals.

Even though this set does not offer the same value for money as the original did, it certainly brings some atmosphere to the Heroscape world. I really like the small scale scenarios in the box, which suit the characters in the box perfectly. Who needs tons of monsters if you have a regenerating troll? And who needs an army if you have a handful of heroes that really add to each others strengths?
Good stuff, and a really excellent addition to my Heroscape collection.

The only "lacking" expansion for HeroScape in my mind was the Marvel edition.  Prepainted minis, hundreds of abilities and build-your-own-map with hex based tiles, HeroScape is one of the best strategic games available.  Underdark loses 1/10th of a point for being smaller than the other base sets.

Another awesome Heroscape master set.  The amount of terrain keeps dwindling, but the scenarios are the best yet.  The shadow terrain is a nice new addition, and the ice repainted as rocks looks great.  

Most importantly, the new units are awesome.  My two favorites are Tandros Kreel and the Feral Troll.  The Troll is an absolute beast against high value heroes, and at 90 points makes an excellent cost-effective Marvel/Dragon/Jotun slayer--just don't let him get swarmed by squads!  Tandros is just an all around good hero with high life.

I *really* like the new focus on scenario/campaign design.  They seem really smartly designed, fun, and interesting so far.

It's great in that it's more Heroscape. It's not great in that the D&D was really pasted on, the minis weren't quite the same scale (which is fine except that the dragon is terribly small) and it just doesn't give you as much as the other sets. The campaign idea is cool, but nothing that didn't already exist through variants.

My kids' scenarios are so much better than the real ones.

In our last fantasy explosion, we had the usual outdoor terrain battles, but we also had the option to teleport characters into a hidden dungeon to collect glyphs - which in turn had to be returned to our home areas and placed in a particular pattern.  I'm not sure why yet, as we're still in the middle of playing.

Also, as a complete surprise to me, there were boss monsters - both in the dungeon and in the open terrain - that were conjured into existence (huge dragon, giant insect) when we collected a certain number of glyphs.

I was also informed that we were to take turns moving the NPC monsters in the dungeon to annoy and kill each other.  Where did those come from again?  I'm still not sure.

All that, and there was a back story and flavor text.  Wow, my kids are nuts.

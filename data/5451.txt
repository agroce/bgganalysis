Korean "Style" brand deck with plastic cards, numbered suits, and lovely modern artwork
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game that is originated from Japan but becomes very popular in Korea.  There are many games that can be played with the cards but the most popular one in Korean should be Go-Stop game.

The cards are separated into months, 12 months with 4 cards associated with the each month.  In total, there are 48 cards and 2 joker cards.  The basics of the game is actually fishing whereby players had a number of cards in their hands and some on the floor.  Players will have match cards by month before the cards can be taken into the played cards of the player.  The player throws one matching card (if he has one) from the hand and flips one card from the deck and if it matches another suit on the floor, the player will also take cards from the suit.

The calculation of points is also a little difficult as the cards are further divided into Junk, Animals, Ribbons and Light cards.  10 junk cards are considered as 1 point, with 1 point in addition for every additional junk card accumulated.  5 animals cards are considered as 1 point, with 1 point in addition for every additional animal card accumulated.  If 3 birds cards accumulated, it is considered as 5 points.  5 ribbon cards are considered as 1 point, with 1 point in addition for every additional ribbon card accumulated.  If 3 cards of same ribbons suit are accumulated, it is considered as 3 points.  There are 3 suits ribbons in the game.  Light cards are the hardest to calculate as there are dry light and wet light cards.  3 light cards inclusive of the wet light card is considered as 2 points.  3 light cards exclusive of the wet light card is considered as 3 points.  4 light cards inclusive of the wet light card is considered as 4 points and 4 light cards exclusive of the wet light card is considered as 5 points.  If all 5 light cards are accumulated, 15 points is awarded.

The game has a go-stop system, which after a player reaches 2 points (determined by players in the game).  The player can continue or stop the game.  If the player choose to stop the game, he will win the round.  If he choose to continue, he must gain at least another point before he can stop the game.  At the meantime, if another player can reach at least 2 points and stop the game, the new player is considered to be the winner instead even though the new player has less points then the other player.

Going is not without its benefits.  If 1 player go and managed to win the game, 1 point is added to the player, if the player goes twice, it doubles the score.  If the player foes trice, it triples the score.

Good points:
The game is considered to be easy to learn.

Bad points:
The game relies too much on luck.  The compatibility of the cards in hand and on the table.  The luck when flipping of cards from the deck.  The game is more exciting when it is played with money, some may think that it is not fun at all without the gambling element in it.

RATING: 3
A little hard to rate, as there are so many variations of rules and scoring systems.

Varying complications of scoring systems exist, but none really matter as the game is completely dominated by luck unless one player is just completely unskilled (or hasn't learned cards or scoring system).  If the cards are stacked favorable to your play, you win.  If not, you lose.  Heck, you can't even actually guarantee a loss no matter how much you try for one.

It's basically War with a thinly veiled disguise to make it look like your play actually matters.

A very nice, exceptionaly mobile game. Or should I say games as there are 2-3 better known for Hanafuda deck. The most known is Koi- koi. If you have a bit of interest in Japan you should have it, especially if you like fast 2 player games. (Only registering plays for 6/12 months with live oponents)

Small cards, pretty line art, simple pair matching set collection game. It is a good coffee break game and there is a reasonable amount of strategy on offer given the simplicity of the game. Does get a little tedious after a dozen plays (koi Koi). I have a Nintendo set.

Nintendo "Napoleon" deck. Beautiful deck of cards used to play the addictive game "koi-koi." See my rating and review for "koi-koi". Have not played other games using these cards, such as "Hawaii Hanfuda." 

I currently have:
1 Nintendo Napoleon deck (excellent quality)with black backs.
1 Nintendo "club Nintendo" Mario themed set with red backs, which I believe are of the same quality as Napoleon deck. 
1 Nintendo "Miyako no Hana" deck with red backs, which I believe is their least expensive set, but also very nice, just a bit thinner tiles/cards than Napoleon decks. 
1 cheap Korean brand deck with red backs. These are actually plastic. The prints aren't nearly as beautiful as the Nintendo ones, but these are great for playing in any conditions(plastic cards).

Great card game from ancient Japan.  Appeared in the Edo period under the Tokugawa clan leadership when Japan banned Portuguese and Spanish (western style) playing cards.

Many game variations including Hachi-Hachi (88) and Koi-Koi.  I've only learned to play Koi-Koi so far.  It's the easiest of the game variations to start with.

I own the traditional Nintendo brand Diatoryo or Napoleon or Presidents deck.  Great game to play, a bit of a learning curve as it uses no written characters and only images on the cards.

RATING: 7
This is a childhood favorite for me. I play with "Hawaii rules" and don't know how to play any other variant, so I'm specifically speaking about that game in this review. 

The game itself is incredibly nostalgic for me, but does withstand the test of time - it is still an enjoyable game to play as an adult or in a variety of contexts. I don't get to it frequently, but it's not for a lack of enjoyment, just that it doesn't tend to fill quite the right niche very often. 

The card shape and design is really inconvenient, as cards can't really be shuffled traditionally, and they're kind of hard to deal and manipulate. Because of my nostalgia I don't really mind, but I can see how they would be kind of annoying and sometimes I wish there was a version where the cards are reprinted onto something resembling standard cards. Scoring is also a little opaque if you're not super familiar with the game, although with my "Hawaii edition" it is a little easier since the point values are printed on the cards. "Back in my day" we just had to memorize the card values and the yaku combination. But, maybe there's some intrinsic fun in knowing all the combos by heart. 

Hoping to get this one to the table a bit more in the future, perhaps aided by a friend from Japan who also played it as a kid. Amused by the yakuza connotations, though. :)

Hanafuda is a very exotic, very unique, and very beautiful set of cards. With it's 48 cards you can play several games: simple hanafuda, honeymoon hanafuda, koi-koi, 88... There are games for the children and games for the adults. For example koi-koi is fun game for two which offers luck and stategies in a good mix. 88 is a very popular gambling game.
If you haven't ever played with Hanafuda cards, you definitely should... :)

Pas mal, mais bien trop hasardeux, même sur des parties à 12 manches. Je possédais l'ancienne version japonaise de Nintendo, mais n'y avais jamais joué (trop compliqué pour identifier et retenir les images et retrouver les yaku), mais cette édition multilingue simplifie quand même bien le tout et est très agréable à pratiquer (au prix de quelques légers aménagements de règles qui ne changent pas le jeu).

I finally own this game after long search. Japanese edition, beautiful cards made by Nintendo. Love the traditional art and how the cards feel.

After repeated play this turns out to be a really simple heavily luck dependent game. It's fun but wears thin after too many plays within a certain time. I will probably play this often since my partner really likes it (and often wins) but it's not as good as I hoped. I still keep it though since it's so difficult to obtain and the cards are amazing.

I just love this game...quick to play and seemingly simple it can be played as such as or it can be deep and complex.  Addictive and the fact that the cards are small tiles more than actual cards (like a cardboard mahjong tile) makes you feel that you aren't actually playing cards.  Takes a while to get to know the cards and even longer to get used to the scoring and recognizing yaku. But its a fun journey. Found a really nice free app on iTunes that is so clear you learn this game really quick if you are having trouble.

Have acquired a fairly large collection of Hanafuda decks, including 3 quite old antique/collectible decks. Also, 4 Nintendo collectible decks. I have Koi Koi on 2 Nintendo DS carts. It's hard to evaluate Hanafuda as it is more like evaluating a deck of cards as a game. Many different games are played with the Hanafuda deck, and some more fun than others (Kind of like comparing Bridge and Poker: same deck - different game.)

Let's not kid ourselves, the reason this game has any appeal is
1.) Gambling, and 
2.)  Throwing cards at the table as hard as you can.

The verison I bought came with rules to a Hawaiian version called Higo Bana.
With the complicated points system I never persevered with an actual game.

Another in my series of Asian games.  I have played a couple of different games with Hanafuda cards.  The cards themselves are lovely.  Koi Koi is quite fun.

Too many games to be played with them to actually "rate the game," but watch out for poorly-printed decks.

Discovered Koi Koi (played with the Hanafuda deck) whilst playing Yakuza 3 and spent the whole weekend just playing that minigame. Later discovered that Nintendo first made their name making Hanafuda decks. Played with a Japanese deck of playing cards, which consists of 12 suits of 4 cards representing the 12 months of the year with a specific flower. The game requires you to match cards in your hand with cards in the middle to make sets, but as the game has its origins in gambling there is a risky push your luck mechanic. 

I love the fact that the game is associated with Yakuza. Only in Japan could organised crime be seen playing 'flower cards'.

Decks themed on the 2002 World Cup (Japan/S.Korea) and Super Mario. Also have a couple of Korean decks (they have the wild cards which are used in Go-Stop) that are a lot more cartoonish.

I love everything Japanese and this traditional card game is very interesting.  It reminds me of solitare, although the two games are not at all alike.  It also gives a little insight into the Japanese culture in regards to depictions of the world around them.

I wasn't too impressed with the game play as it is rather dull, but a game in this category isn't going to be a blast to play.  Taking that into consideration, I felt it was too simplistic.

If you want something cultural and like all things Japanese, then try this out.

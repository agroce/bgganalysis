GAME: Pea Ridge: The Gettysburg of the West March 7-8 1862
RANK: 4177

RATING: 7
This is a excellent game with the Confederates advancing on two fronts, and the outnumbered Union forces- aided by the heavily wooded terrain- desperately trying to hold back the rebel onslaught.

RATING: 8
Low counter density also makes good intro to GBACW series. Playing this via Cyberboard at present. Nice rule where if the designers great, great grandfather is killed, he game ends immediately...as the designer is never born.

Even though this is from the late 70's (SPI), and with the poor-looking counters by today's standards and the old GBACW rules, this is still a great game.

Very balanced battle
Interesting tactical situation. Very good special rules.

I believe this is one of the best of the smaller TSS battles.  I've played it twice, and the second game rated as one of the most exciting games I've ever played.  I essentially lost on the final turn when my Texans, who'd overrun two strong Union hedgehogs on my right flank in the two previous turns, ran out of ammo!  A wonderful game of feints and attrition.

RATING: 4
The "split fire" rule kills this game with extreme "Tikal-think".  Adapt the GMT rules for this series instead. (Although this takes some work, it is well worth it.)  Using an incremental CRT also helps. With these tweaks, this game merits at least a 6.

RATING: 8.5
One of my first GBACW games.  I like the subject matter of a less than common but important battle.  I've played a number of times and both sides can win.  Fun, with plenty of replay value.

RATING: 7
A manageable portion of the Terrible Swift Sword system (though 5+ hours) ,
like a more interesting mini-Gettysburg, the North trying to hold a position 
while receiving reinforcements, the South attacking across a valley but 
being held up by a single union unit on their left. 
The realism of the very thoughtful TSS rules lets you “become”
the battle and experience the ‘Ken Burns’ moment free of gamey-ness. 
Charts by Myrdin for F2F or Cyberboard for PBEM are a must  
for the extensive housekeeping. 
Great game with many “what if” possibilities.

The GBACW system really revolutionized how ACW battles were represented in gaming.  A favorite that got played so often I had to buy another copy.  A tense well balanced battle that also works as a good intro to the system.  A collectors game now.

I'm the designer of this game and I'm still quite proud of it. It's fun to play, balanced, and the game situation is fascinating as the South is attacking from the North and they outnumber the Union (for once).

I have removed my rating (it was a 7) now that I realize that game designers should not rate their own games, even when they try to be objective.

I really like the GBACW system.

One of my earliest GBACW series games.  Pea Ridge is a good "little" engagement (also featured in Across 5 Aprils (VG)).
Rated it 5/5 in my teens ... now have the "Next Gen" GBACW from GMT ... graphically superior.

RATING: 6.5
The GBACW system is a great vehicle for simulating regiment level combat in the ACW. Pea Ridge is well-balanced game but the burden of attack on the Rebs is heavy indeed. The split advance of the Rebs creates a real headache for the South but, on the flip side, you force the North to make hard choices too. The rough terrain around Elkhorn Tavern also makes it tough for the South to deploy and punch through.

GBACW brought to Pea Ridge.  This is a great game and the battle is a lot of fun to play out.  The Union is really in a tough position here and they need several breaks to change the outcome.

One of the best in this series of games.  This is a great game.  The leader loss rules will usually cause the Confederates to loss momentum and probably the game.

RATING: N/A
This is is actually a pretty good game but unfortunately there's a perfect strategy for the South (the game is broken). It involves the use of independent brigades.
A fun touch was that if a certain commander was killed the game ended since he was the ancestor of the designer and thus the game would never have been made. ;)

RATING: 8
An interesting meeting engagement with both sides having strengths and weaknesses. Well balanced; both players need to pay close attention to what they are doing.

A bit long at 30 turns (it's a two day battle). One of the better GBACW entries.

I've played this one a few times and it remains one of my favorites of the series one-mappers (followed closely by Cedar Mountain). Interesting terrain and units, too. There's something about a meeting engagement that really gets the pulse pounding! I really should get this one out for another try, soon...it's been far too long.

One of the best of the GBACW/TSS system. A must have! More detailed than most of the GBACW gamettes, Pea Ridge really is a smaller version of TSS's meeting engagement on the first day. Lots of excitement! Plus it is the first step toward creating a truely integrated rules system for GBACW, with culminates in the release of the second edition of TSS. But Pea Ridge has lots of excitement on its own as the huge Confederate brigades swarm onto the board, with only a regiment standing in their way! Can these poor pickets delay the Rebs long enough for the shooting to alert the Union camp and get reinforcements in place? This game can be played over an over, since different options are available for the rebels and thus different choices face the Union, too. It can be over the first day, or the Union can hang on by their fingernails and drag it into the second day, where things start to shift in their favor. LOTS of action in a short playing time. While it isn't TSS, it is LOTS OF FUN with the same flavor!

RATING: 7.5
TSS/GBACW system treatment of this important, but little known (outside wargame/history buff circles) battle. This was a transition game, based on the TSS system, in which it evolves into the GBACW standard, debuting with this title. A smaller more manageable battle, like this one, was a good place to start. You get what looks like a standard TSS derivative counter set and map, with a significantly revised system. The battle takes a good Union player to keep things interesting and turn a one day route into a two day victory. The Union is initially overwhelmed by Confederate numbers, but greatly aided by the constricting terrain. If the Rebs can't win on day one the tide turns, in a big way, in the Union favor. One of the better games in the series.

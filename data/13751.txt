RATING: N/A
Got this in the math trade, and figured it'd be good to have since I plan on picking up Return of the Heroes eventually.  [update] Still haven't played this one yet.  I guess I don't really play Return of the Heroes enough to warrant the expansion, but there it sits on my shelf.

RATING: 7.7
Played solitaire and I like it. It models a typical RPG game quite well though on a smaller scale. But don't let the fewer board tiles (in comparison to Return of the Heroes) fool you because this game forces you to make more difficult path decisions. The characters are different and will take different paths to level up. The game could get a little stale after multiple plays but then you just merge it into ROTH and you're back in business. 

There's no reason this game couldn't be played by 3 players. Things I'd do to modify the game a bit for 3 players: 

* Hand out the Magic Weapon Quests at the beginning. Halfling gets Bow of Perfect Aim Quest; Paladin gets The Lyre Quest; Orc gets the Axe of Bragg Quest.

* The world is round and you can move from top to bottom or from right to left by exiting the board and re-entering at the exact opposite compass point.

Adding in the 2nd goal (killing the dragon) makes this a better game since now the heroes have another way to win. It's no longer a race to see who can get the necessary attribute boosts to take on the Nameless One. It's still a race but with two ways to win there are more choices in how each player should best go about building up their characters.

I can't see playing this alone as a two player game or solo. Adding it as an expansion with the base game is much more satisfying. I like a lot of the additions that are added with this expansion as well. Some nice variety in the map tiles, items and tasks.

RATING: 7
While the art may not be as great nor the gameplay as streamlined as other fantasy adventure titles, this game seems to offer a whole lot more in terms of how various quests and tasks are handled.  Players are presented both with short term goals and complex quests as they work to prepare themselves to take down the dragon plaguing their lands.  The board layout allows for some variance in exploration and the simpler movement system (simpler and cleaner than Runebound at least) makes traversing through each panel less bothersome, focusing the game on the adventure aspect rather than how to optimize movement.  Overall, an interesting adventure game hidden behind some silly CGI and hand-drawn artwork.  Hope to someday acquire Return of the Heroes!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Purports to add a distinct new end-game condition - slay the big, nasty dragon! - but when you break it down, the quest isn't much different than defeating the Big Bad Evil Guy in Return of the Heroes. Overall, the expasion's more of the same.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Expansion and standalone game (2 players) adds a lot of variety to the basic game, with more quests, terrain and Heroes.
Also the rule book is much better than the base game.

As a two player game it is pretty average bordering on broken as certain things need to happen in the right order to actually succeed in the game. Luck plays an even bigger part than the base game.

However, as an expansion it kicks RotH up a notch and makes it a rich varied and fun world to inhabit for a couple of hours.

RATING: 6
2p, i actually liked this one better than regular return of the heroes.  i'm not sure why others don't, perhaps they don't play 2p often or they like huge games in terms of size and length.  to me, this river doesn't run deep enough to justify a many-hour extravaganza.  with the standalone version of this i think it hits the right pace and length perfectly.  i like the dragon theme better, no weak family honor restoration backstory, very interesting tiles with the labyrinth/city of mages/desert.  my only beef is that it does seem fairly resource-starved, especially on gold.  scoring the gold bag is pretty huge, even if it might take forever you can loop the jester for free cubes.  these are details though, not much of a synopsis.  synopsis: smaller and better than roth for 2p.  oh yeah, and i love the dragon events.  we'll see about replay.  if i keep it i'll just be doing it for 2p, i'm probably never going to join it up with the main game.  i find myself uninterested in relearning the rules to play again though, so trading.  wish i had something clear to scratch this occasional adventure gaming itch.

I am glad I did, it looks fantastic was very well taken care of by the previous owner and looks to offer a good deal of fun.

This is a very nice two-player expansion for Return of the Heroes.  I have yet to play the combined game, since that would take a while, but could see it being fun.

Fiddly rules, poor translations from the German make this one hard to get started on. The game works best, by far, as an expansion to Return of the Heroes, which my nephew owns, which is even worse in regards to the rules... but once you get to the point where you know the rules well enough to only occasionally refer to the book, it's a blast. I rarely win because I'm usually too busy building up my character to go end the game...

I like the things this ads when played as an expansion to Return of the Heroes.  I didn't enjoy it as much when we tried it as a 2 player standalone.  The smaller maps means that you're near everythiing and makes the game feel less "epic."  Of course I still love Talisman and all it's expansions and have no problem wasting an entire day wandering board after board looking for random loot.

Just like RotH, the random way the chits come out just makes this a bit too random for me. Waiting on something to get pulled from a bag isnt the most fun thing to do, in an adventure game.

Excellent game, very adventure like and suitable as a two player.  I like the idea of the quests, these are a neat aspect to the game.  Otherwise I find that poor tile draw can sometimes be a hinderance.  I like the game, I like what it does, but I'm not quite ready to give it a high rating - maybe after more plays...

Update: Return of the Heroes is a wonderful adventure game.  Under the Shadown of the Dragon is an excellent addition.

RATING: 2
I don't know how it is as a game on it's own, but it's not a great expansion. Adding this set to the original game lengnthens the game by an unplayable amount of time, and increases the complexity to entirely unnecessary levels.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent 2-player version of Return of the Heroes.  Suffers the same problem as that game: random chit draws from the bag - you can't win if your quest targets stay in the bag while your opponent's are on the board.  Can be fun to play once in a while, but there are better adventure games out there.

The rules are poorly written and incomplete.  Read the rules and FAQ to RotH if you are starting with UtSotD because there are elements of the game that are not covered in the UtSotD rule books (purpose of your manor house, full rules for how to place drawn chits, etc.).

Never used it to expand RotH.  The downtime in a 5 or 6 player RotH game would be too excessive for me.

I concur with the sentiment.  It's unfortunate that you should have to read the rules twice, then download the simplified version, and play a solo aborted game to get the gist of how this works.
But once you've done that, if you move the game along, this can be quite a fun pick-up and delivery adventure game.  It's fun to play, even when you lose.
Excellent artwork & bits here too.  Kudos to the art director and anyone else involved in making this look great!

This expansion doesn't add quite as much as I'd hoped, but it is nice to have the larger map. There are a couple ways to play it, but as a small stand-alone map it fails. 

I like that there can be multiple ways to win the game with the expansion added to the mix, but in truth we only played a couple times and then we were 'done' with it.

Every bit as good as the original- I freakin' love this game.  Unlike most of the current crop of RPG-styled board games, ROTH actually has quests and short-term goals, it's never just about buffing up for the final fight.  The expansion does have some fairly confusing rules, but once you've played it through it's not a problem.  I really liked the new Dragon quest and it's nice to have some other options to play the game.  Excellent, a far better game than Runebound or WoW.

Two player game based on Return of the Heroes.  The rules are essentially identical.  Players take a fantasy character, skill themselves up via training, experience, and equipment, then go off to fight The Big Bad (here it's a dragon).  Simple, clean mechanics, a much clearer rulebook this time around, and a good, tight two player fantasy romp.  The game takes around an hour.  As an added bonus, it can be bolted onto the parent game for an huge fantasy epic.  Interesting to play this just after Prophecy - both games cover the same ground, but this feels much better.

Played it standalone.  The turns go by quite quickly, which is nice -- largely because combat is limited to a single round, so it doesn't drag out like in Runebound (1st ed. at least).  It wasn't entirely clear to me exactly when to draw new counters -- and the various Dragon events were extremely irritating, so we just started ignoring them after a while.

I'd rate this a 6 for the base game and a 7 when combined as an expansion.

I really like the ideas here... but the 2 player game is a bit processional. Still fun, mind you, but not as much oomph as the RotH. The expanded game, however, is almost TOO rich with options & stuff... but our 1st two-player game went down to the wire, with me killing the dragon just as my son was attempting to pass the guardians to kill the Nameless One. Excellent.

Got it from my Secret Santa.  

6.5 as a standalone game.  Too small a map and too many fiddly rules for some of the tiles.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty fun as a stand alone adventure game for two.  There doesn't seem to be much player interaction.  Rules don't seem clear or out right contradict on a few minor points.  Also the art appears similar to early 90's computer games.  While it looks harsh and even odd on the character chits, it serves the items and board art just fine.  I actually kind of like the appearance of the board all laid out.  I still think I prefer Talisman for its over all flavor, but this is different enough for me to want to keep both.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Two-player game is fun for a few games, but like Return of the Heroes, the lack of counter variety makes re-play repetitive.  
As an expansion, game variety is increased but tasks and quests become harder to fulfill.  In the end, too much time is spent running around the expanded board trying to complete tasks. 
Game components and artwork are good.  The game is visually appealing.

An excellent addition to the game which really adds a lot in my opinion.  Not too nuts about the 2-player game, but adding the 9 tiles to the basic game (making it 5 x 5 grid) is super-neat-o when playing with the "discovery" variant.  Looks like this one will be a tension-filled race nearly the whole way.  Very nicely balanced, as well.  I can see where certain characters can be a bit underpowered, but there are so many ways to make up for the little balance issues.  In my last game, my opponenet died a good ways into the game and still came back to win as he pressured me into trying the Nameless One a few turns too early.  Fun!

This expansion has fixed many of the small things that annoyed me about the first: Characters with skills that better relate to who they are and not just abilities to get through certain paths easier; more healing areas; greater decisions concerning quests and motivation for movement; less provocative pictures so I can play with my nephews without having my sister yell at me... UtSotD when combined with the first game (RotH) is such a great gaming experience. It's simple, yes, but simplicity doesn't down grade a game. It's wonderful to be able to pull out a fantasy game that only takes 10 minutes to explain (let's see Magic Realm do that) and can be played with any age (MR again for the young set and Talisman has a way of annoying older and experienced players). This is just plain fun.

This game reuses the theme & mechanics of Return of the Heroes, and can be played either as a standalone 2-player game or combined with the original set for a 5-6 player game.

As a stand alone game, [GAMEID=13751] doesn't work nearly as well as the the main game.  With only 9 land tiles, the game would seem to be shorter, but this isn't the case.  There are fewer low level monsters to beat, fewer quests, and less chances to train, resulting it being very hard to level up your character.  Also, there are a couple of land tiles that are just aggravating---for example, to get through the labyrinth or to the City Mages, you have to roll a specific number.  Or the desert, which saps one health each turn (and if your quest involves attempting to defeat the scorpion, it could take a very long time as you fight and then retreat to heal over and over again.  

However, as an expansion to [GAMEID=8170], the game is much better.  Combined with the main game, there are many more ways to improve your character, and more variety in the tasks, monsters and items.  The ability to go after either the Nameless One or the Dragon gives you more choice in selecting your main quest, although the Dragon now appears to be easier to defeat since he usually comes out of the bag earlier.  It also doesn't lengthen the game too much either---we can finish a game in under 2 hours.  A nice expansion to spice up the game, and we usually keep all of the tiles and chits mixed in.

RATING: 5
3 / 5 - Good

The biggest problem with the base game was a lack of variety and the identikit nature of what little variety there was. This helps a lot with that - two of the three new characters are unusual, a couple of the new monsters are also something special and there are even some new location tiles with specific rules. Best of all the mage can now be a proper mage with some magic spells. But this all comes at the price of considerable extra play time and time spent looking stuff up in another daft "glossary". So on balance, I can't say it really does enough to save the game from itself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quite hard in the beginning - probaby more an expansion than a stand-alone-game. Still fun and great mechanics... but getting your hero to a usable level/stat is quite frustrationg.

RATING: 7
We played the ROTH and expansion with 4 players which got a little tedious towards the end as we had trouble pulling chits out of the bag.  Admittedly there were a couple of time we forgot but even so, the balance seems a little bit off on this particular aspect of the game.

The new tiles are gorgeous and the new tasks are pretty cool - so over all I like it.

RATING: 6
Ugh! The rulebook makes Baby Jebus Cry! As a 2 player game, I'd still prefer the full RoTH. This one the challenges are a bit too much at the very beginning. Adds many options as an expansion to the main game, but it some cases its just not worth the pain of seperating all the tiles out again.

Played this once as an expansion to RotH. Adds a lot to the base game, but makes the game play way to long. Our first six-player game took four hours.

Played once as a two-player standalone game. It's better as an expansion to RotH. The movement restrictions on some boards is very frustrating, as is the relative dearth of EC's. When you combine this game with RotH, it adds some nice spice without overbearing the original flavor.

You can play it as a 2 player, nine tile game, or combine it with the base game for a 25 tile game. Rulebook is more direct and easier to refer to. You still need to read the glossary at the back, particularly for the special locations (like the city of mages).

Comment after reading "rules": The one who did rules layout should be shot. Come on, some critical rules are mentioned only in the glossary! (Yes, there is a point to write them in such way but I was pretty annoyed with this solution) And having glossary in pure alphabetic order isn't a good idea all the way. Most of the spells on City of Mages would be much better to separate into its own section. There is excellent file here on geek under "Return of Heroes" -entry that does just this. You should download it especially if you play games using expansions!

The two player game is quite like the Return of the Heroes but I like things in basic game a bit more. There seems to be more specific stuff (ie. Labyrinth and Desert landtiles) in expansion/standalone-game and I'm eager to try it as an expansion with the base game. I think the possibility to add fifth and sixth player is nice but I'm not sure how often that option is going to be used as the game is probably best when played with 3 players.

Update (30.5.2010): As an expansion this makes the base game more varied but also lengthens the playing time by almost an hour or so. I like the first one but not too much about the last one. But it is better as an expansion than as a standalone game.

Great game concept.  This is the 5-6 player expansion for Return of Heroes.  But, it can also be played as a 2 player stand alone game which is actually a decent, but rather confusing, game by itself.  The rules need to reprinted by someone who knows how to communicate.  Plus the battle system is a little tricky.  Sometimes played as the expansion the Return of Heroes, but most often played as a two player stand alone game.

--Dec2007-- The rules aren't any better than the base game's - which is really too bad; they might have learned.  Still, the game adds some fun new interactions, and some relatively useless ones too!  The City of Mages, for example, is really annoyingly random.  But the dragon target is cool, and we really enjoyed the big array of tiles.

Rated as an expansion of [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/8170]Return of the Heroes[/url][/i].  It adds some nice terrain tiles with special features, like the Desert, in which players lose a life point for every turn they spend there; the Labyrinth, in which you never know where you are going; the City of the Mages, with its portals and a new magic market, and so on.  It also adds a new villain, the [i]Dragon[/i], that you can choose to fight instead of the [i]Nameless[/i], if you have made a quest that give you a proper weapon and knowing that the match would be based on magic skills.  Of course, there are also new counters and quests with new twists that give a new air to the game.  All the new features are nice, but they do add some time into the game.  So, if you are up for a quicker game, stick with the base game.  If you want more choices or if you are five or six players, don't hesitate to go after the expansion.  Also look for it if you are two players, to play it as a stand alone game.

I like this "expansion" slightly better than Return of the Heroes, perhaps because it is playable as a shorter, two-player experience. Although you can combine it with the base game for a 5-6 player adventure fest, you'd have threaten puppy-torture or something to get me to play this as an expansion. I just don't think I could take it. I already get to the point where I just hunt through the stupid bag for the bits I need instead of drawing them randomly. But if there's time to kill, Under the Shadow of the Dragon is really an excellent table-top adventure experience for my daughter. I definitely like Prophecy better, and for myself, there is a supreme adventure board game: Arkham Horror. Under the Shadow of the Dragon is a good choice to play with kids though, as they aren't going to appreciate the Mythos theme.

Gameplay is just like RotH, save that you are beefing up to fight one of four dragons at the end, and your "heroic quest" is to acquire a magical weapon that will allow you to challenge the dragon (and hopefully live). Again, the rules are very poorly done, but if you've puzzled through the base game, learning this one is no challenge.

1 play, 2er

Like the base game, you move around the board finding things and delivering them to other locations, fighting monsters, leveling up. Here, you eventually complete a series of quests that give you a magic weapon, which you use to fight the dragon -- if you win, it's a Major Victory; if you lose, the other players has 4 turns to defeat the dragon and win the same, or can quit then and still get a minor victory; or if the dragon kills everyone, the Dragon wins. 

First play marred by rules issues; will try again before putting in a final rating. What a horrible rule book (again?)! Information is spread out in different areas of the rules, and hard to find ... game cries out for a good player aid! Why the hell are basic rules included in the glossary, and not with the actual rules?! 

Anyway, a pretty basic adventure-style game that reminds me I need to play Runebound again!

This expansion makes the world of "Return of the Heroes" even more interesting by adding several different types of terrain that add various challenges to travelers, as well as adding a whole new victory condition in the form of the dragon.  Of course a whole lot of smaller items and a few more characters are added too, which all adds to the variety of the adventures.  I've never played without this expansion even though it seems to create a tediously long play time, because the extra elements it contributes seem to outweigh that negative aspect.  Of course, if you're really concerned about play time, this expansion can also apparently be played as a stand-alone 2-player game.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

Generic fantasy theme.  Game is fairly easy to learn, but easy to play.  The two player game is very good - nice challenge and good game length at about 1 hour.  

The add on expansion (to base RotH) is good but needs some tweeking.  The dragon baddie tends to be too difficult to defeat.  The game board is huge and it takes some time to move around the world, makes game length drag a bit.  The rulebook does not cover how some of the items interact with the base game.

The components are excellent - thick mounted modular boards, thick chits wood & glass pieces.  Artwork is above average - very colorful and unique but a bit cartoonish.  Rulebook is much better than the base game but still has room for improvement.

Rating as a stand-alone two-player game rather than as an expasnion for Return of the Heroes. This has perhaps the worst set of rules I've ever had to slog my way through. The game also has a bunch of typos and misprints (counters often do not match the cost listed in the rulebook, etc.), and a lot of what happens remins unclear from the rules, leaving newer players to take their best guess. The game itself has fairly nice graphics and theme, but it tends to stall out and hit a lot of lulls, especially when in those area where players are forced or given strong incentives to stay jn one spot and roll dice turn after turn. Still, the game has nice flavor. Call it a near miss ... one of those games that doesn't work well enough to play often but that you feel could have been special with a little more design work.

Not awful - but not enough flexibility in character development (... which goes for most fantasy adventure board games).  It's a pain to look up tiles in the rules.

I like that quests require you to travel to places... there is a good sense of geography.  However, there are not enough tiles to give it good variety and replayability.

I haven't played this one or incorporated it into the base game yet. Looks like fun though. **March 2011 - One copy was destroyed when my storage unit flooded.

Fantasy romping family style.  A nice 2-player addition for couples and the option to play with 5-6 players to boot.  A simple but fun quest game and nice addition to the original.

RATING: 6.5
Very good in combination with Return of the Heroes with only ~4 players. Rating 7.5 as expansion.

Not as good as 2 player game. Too many special rules; Dragon event "Fear" may lead to unplayable game state.

More tiles, more chits - and dragons!

I can't imagine needing another ROTH expansion, but this one is well worth the money in terms of freshness and variability.

Played this when it first came out. Very similar to it's parent game. The 2 player game is fun but not as good as the multi player game. However down time is much recuded so it has it's benfits.

Instructions are contradictory and badly presented.  It totally messed us up that there was important specific rule data in the glossary.  There is even some points that are apparently absent for the directions altogether.  Having worked through all of those problems, it is a decent game.  I have only played it as a stand alone 2 player game.  This game clearly is more about enjoying the adventure than it is about trying to win.  An active fantasy imagination will greatly boost the enjoyment factor of this game.

Excellent addition to an already excellent game.  Much better as an expansion than as a stand alone.

I wanted to like this.  Really.

But... first off, it looks terrible. The monsters and people are poor quality CGI that appear to have been made as a class project for a graphic artist 101 class.  They look cheesy and amatuerish at best, and the mobs & even the heroes look disturbingly weird (look at the pdf of the manual on the geek yourself!).

Add to the ugliness of it all and you'll find a game that has no strategy at all, just a move & roll mechanic dressed up in a light RPG skin.  Yes it has quests.  Yes it has swords & +1 boots and healing potions.  But none of it really means anything - it all just modifies the same base mechanic; move & roll the dice yet again.

I enjoy good dice rollers. A good dice roller has you in drama waiting for the dice to reveal thier numbers; here you just dont care.  You've already done it 47 times before that and it was all the same, and on the other side of this roll & the roll after that there is no great consequence BECAUSE there is no great strategy for that dice roll to affect. You dont care because the game gives you no reason to care.  Even the 'epic' dragon battle at the end is just the same old stuff. 

Really - skip this one.

more Return of the Heroes... for 2 players or add to original for 5-6 players...plays well except for the Dragon Fear event, it can lead to a long, dragged out game if there aren't enough tiles on the board after it takes effect...

RATING: 5.5
Interesting expansion for the base game.  Adds some cool ideas for boss fights, but the rulebooks still feel too raw.  Some of the new mechanics were either not properly playtested, or were intentionally made overtly brutal.

If Return of the Heroes proves to be a hit, then I'll get this next.

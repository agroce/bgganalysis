This game would be ranked higher but the rules are a freaking mess and a bit more time thinking about rulebook usability and cheatsheets would go a long long way for improving the game experience.

Heavy on the science AND game play. I'm impressed with Mr. Eklund's ability to pull off both of these tricks as well as he does. He even invokes a desire to learn more about natural history -- a subject that didn't even interest me until I played this title.

Complex, intimidating, a little ugly, and viciously unfair, but with absolutely no apology.

While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, since the winner is fairly arbitrary, this is one of the most heavily thematic and densely researched board games there is. A hell of a ride, for which I am always keen to rejoin the queue.

I like the theme and I found some of the things that the game try to do very attractive, but gameplay was not so great. We followed the original rules and the game stuck at some point (due to the card combination that came out). I was reading about it and it seems that this situation is not uncommon and can be corrected using the live rules. I may try again, but when I buy a game I would like to think that I am not playtesting it.

[1st PBEM] This game grows on me the more I play it. The generation and movement of the biomes is brilliant, and I'm getting more of a feel for how the game plays out. My only real problem is I'm playing on Vassal and 1 turn a day or thereabouts is way too slow.

[2nd PBEM] This game has its claws in me now.

Bios Megafauna is a very ambitious game that tries to scientifically mimic the evolution of life from the beginning of the Mesozoic era (Age of the dinosaurs) to the beginning of the Cenozoic era (Current age of mammals).

Each player takes a group of protolifeforms, either Herbivore or carnivore dinosaurs, or herbivore or carnivore mammals, and then tries to build their genetic codes to allow them to inhabit surrounding biomes and populate the map.

At the beginning of the game the map is created by randomly taking 22 mesozoic biome tiles and placing them on the map according to their little pictures and numbers. Each players starting proto-creatures are placed in thier home spaces and the game begins.

Each player has a number of DNA chips to trade in for cards that give their animals genetic information that allow it to expand into surrounding biomes. The more genetic information an animal has, the more likely it is to be able to expand into surrounding environments. 

A player can also create new species that inherit characterisitcs of the parent species, which can also be expanded upon to spread your animal kingdom further.

Be careful though, giving your animals too much genetic information makes them more susceptible to extinction by way of global catastrophes.

To add to the danger, greenhouse gas lavals change throughout the game that shift the biomes and can even end the game by making the planet a furnace or snowball.

At 4 stages of the game (Changing of the ages), players need to add up thier populations and the winner takes victory points from the tar pit. The overall winner of the game is the player with the most victory points at the end.

Overall this is a very ambitious game that is more of an educational exercise than a game. Lack of options per turn mean that each player is kind of forced down specific routes as opposed to being able to make meaningful choices. For example, on a given turn a player will only be able to expand into 1 space due to having only genetic information that they can afford or have had to buy because all other options were useless.

This is somewhat lessened by the Living Rules set that are freely available to download and print out. This is a reworking of the original rules set that you get with the game that opens the game up to give you more options and freedom of choice. I would say it is a must in order to enjoy the game properly.

The artwork on the board leaves a lot to be desired, it feels to me like the rulebook and graphic design were all done by the same Doctor of Paleontology.

Overall the living rules make this an excellent playable game but more work is needed on the aesthitics... Oh wait, they did a second edition, I'll have to investigate that one.

This is next to exactly the kind of game I've been looking for. The designer's other game "Origins: How We Became Human" is the exact game I want, but it's out of print so this Megafauna is my second choice. Ultimate dream would be an entire series from amoeba to space colonization. Which this designer will supposedly be doing. Even his space colony game is out of print. I found him a couple years too late, it seems. :( The theme, different board every game, changes in the board during game, still requires a little thinking, but doesn't demand too much of it, etc. makes for a nice relaxing game that gets my inspirational juices fired up.

This is a chaotic game that is lighter than I had expected.  Can be very frustrating if the right genes (typically B or G and sometimes I) are not available.  Solitaire variant is played against a rule-based AI, but the AI is simple enough that it can be easy to manipulate into a corner.

This game seems to be mostly about the theme. IF you do not dig evolution/science, I think it will lack greatly for a player. Otherwise it is a clever design and fun game. Playing time so far in 6 games( 2 being solo, and 4 at 2 players) is under one hour. Lots of small tactical choices and uncontrollable (but possibly avoidable) chaos. Feels too light for me overall.

RATING: 7
This is a hard game to pin down. I don't think it really works all that great as a game: the way you score points is too random (you can have a lot of points in one era, very few in the next, with little way of controling or predicting it), and it seems to me that it's easy for the game to get locked into a statical state. 

But in common with other Sierra Madre titles, it's a great "experience game". If you play it ignoring the more competitive game bits, you can really appreciate the narrative and have a great time. In one of my plays, there was a moment when a major catastrophe wiped out most animals - the comet hit took out four species by itself, the subsequent greenhouse shift destroyed most of the biomes the rest dependend on, leaving only a couple of lucky survivors. I don't think I've ever had a moment more aptly described as awesome in any other game, and this pretty much encapsulates why I'd recommend this game.

Bios is my second experience with a Phil Eklund game (after High Frontier) and he definitly has his own style.  My first game of Bios was highly entertaining.  My second one felt a little static.  

The rule-set is still sort of in flux (which seems to be a common trait with Sierra Madre), I get the sense that in a few more months the game will be quite solid, as even my experience with this early rule set has been engaging.

Overall it's highly thematic, and like HF - very much an experience more than a strategic brain-burner.  Players attempt to guide their species of mammal or dinosaur through pre-history, by making sure they are well adapted to an ever shifting and violent landscape.

I'm going to give it till the end of 2011 to give it a final rating as I expect the rule-set will be more or less solidified by then.

I enjoy Phil Eklund's games because you really do get in a lot of learning (and discussion) in with your gaming time.

But once again, the components are crammed so with information and symbology that it's hard to get a handle on what's really going on. It's like you have to fully understand the game before you can really begin to play it.

I don't think his games are meant to be easy. But you should be able to complete a turn with confidence after a few times around the table. 

One play, three players.

I wanted to like this, I really did. But playing it with the rules as written was just unenjoyable. It's complex and obtuse, very confusing when you're trying to learn. The game is brutal and random to the extreme, meant to simulate nature itself; you can be doing perfectly fine one moment, and then the next you've been wiped from the board, lost everything and have to start over at a potentially severe disadvantage. Even having been warned of this and excepting it before we started I was ill prepared. The game was interesting and I could see enjoying it with house rules maybe, but as it officially plays I'm glad I do not own it. Willing to give the new edition due for release soon a try though! Too few dinosaur games out there for my tastes!

I love the science themes of these Sierra Madre games.  Maybe a little too random but there's so much crazy stuff that can happen in this game.  The problem, and this applies to all of Eklund's games that I've played, is that they are more "interesting simulations" than "fun games" and they're all painful to learn from the rulebook.

RATING: 7
Es un juego difícil de definir.  Se trata de una simulación a través de cuatro eras prehistóricas de la adaptación de las especies a las condiciones y hábitats cambiantes. Cada jugador comienza con una especie de protodinosaurios o protomamífero y debe conseguir sobrevivir en el tablero. Cabe la posibilidad (y conviene) que la especie inicial derive en otras especies. Cada jugador puede tener hasta cuatro. 
Las series van evolucionando incorporando genomas a su código genético que incrementan sus posibilidades de subsistencia otorgándoles ciertas características. No se trata de atacar a las otras especies, sino de conseguir la mayor subsistencia.

El juego dispone de muchos parámetros relacionados entre sí, por lo que es dificil de explicar y asimilar. Al principio puede resultar algo confuso. Es de duración media (tres horas, más o menos)  y bastante caótico, puesto que el juego (la evolución del planeta) incorpora condiciones arbitrarias que pueden echar por tierra cualquier planificación. 

No apto para no jugones. Incluso para jugones, es un juego bastante peculiar que a muchos no gustará, porque causa la impresión de no poder controlar prácticamente nada.

Es admirable cómo se ha trabajado el tema y el contexto del juego. Es más una simulación científica que un juego de mesa. Desde luego, lo que es innegable es que es muy original.

As a simulation, this is a fascinating and brilliant design. Even the rulebook is informative and incredibly detailed from both a rules and a pedagogical perspective. This would be an amazing addition to a biology or General Science classroom, and despite the initially steep learning curve, it's actually not that difficult to teach (especially with a competent teacher there to explain it).

As a game, however, there is much to be desired. Due to the random makeup of the gene market and the very rapid and unpredictable changes to the board, strategy is virtually impossible except to basically diversify and spread out as much as you can. This arbitrariness, however realistic from a historical/scientific perspective, means that in a competitive game, one card draw can basically destroy one player's species while leaving another player completely untouched. Mass extinctions that wipe out the entire board are also very common, even with the most careful planning, and in my experience usually result in a general agreement by all players to stop the game (not a good sign!). 

Ultimately, the pervasive randomness makes this an almost purely tactical game, which leads me to believe this is better suited to a solo experience rather than competitive play. It's still very cool, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This has held up quite well through a number of plays.

I'm considering a small tweak to add a few more genes into the mix in the beginning of the game, maybe 5/6/7/7 or something (instead of 3/4/4/4). It might give the players a little more resilience and flexibility, especially when there are two displays.

Of the new rules, I think you'll want to use the two displays with 4 and maybe 3 players, and the new +1 migration range for P DNA is a nice bonus too which I like. My current impression is that the other optionals (stealing a gene, roadrunner evolution) are unnecessary though. If Bios were 4-6 hours like AMF was, maybe the extra control would be a bonus, but since Bios is under two hours (one hour with two players), you don't want to go nuts. All the optionals add length, and honestly, Bios does not want to be any longer than it is.
---
Also, get the living rules. There is a significant change for the 4-player version. I've played 2, 3, and 4-player versions, and they all seem to be fine, but rules-as-written no question 4 makes a pretty chaotic game even more chaotic, so probably many will appreciate the second set of cards to draft from. 2- and 3-player seem pretty solid.
---
Top tip: you need to get your population up to 3-4, preferably on two species, to be in good shape. A lot of people miss their carnivore options, so if you're third and the first two people both get decent B/G/I/H DNA, grab a P and go carnivore.
---
Yes, Bios is much more random than High Frontier. Climate change can wipe you out, meteors can wipe you out, and you can never get access to decent DNA. That, at the end of the day, is the message of the game - the durability of life, but the tenuousness of individual species in the face of how much climate can change over long periods of time. It reminds me a bit of Settlers - sometimes you play well, but the dice just aren't there, and sometimes the dice are weird and the game takes a strange trajectory. The great thing about Bios: Megafauna is that it's short. American Megafauna had the same set of problems and took 6 hours to play. Bio: Megafauna takes 60-90 minutes tops - same as a game of Settlers, more or less.

I think you'll enjoy this game a lot more if you make the commitment, which may mean reading and understanding the rules and reading the players' tips and design notes. While the systems are not complicated - a lot simpler than High Frontier - like High Frontier it's a hard game to teach all the details of, and if you miss the nuances and don't see all your options it can be frustrating. Also, remember what the game is trying to do - it's not High Frontier, or 1830. It's a "historical game", a game that allows you to experience history in the game format. As such, I don't think the raw game mechanisms evaluated outside of that context are in the same league as the top-tier euros, or as good as High Frontier. In perspective, though, the game supports the history and the combination is very good. In some sense better than High Frontier, which while a fascinating thought experiment, was hugely speculative. 
---
I picked this up with a lot of hope but some trepidation ... I loved High Frontier, but other than that, Eklund's track record isn't great, favoring historical flavor over game, and high chaos, to a degree that often isn't fun to play and takes much too long. And also, let's be honest, several of his games (like Origins) have pretty serious mechanical problems as well. So my fear was that High Frontier was the outlier, the one hit.

But after a couple of games of Bios, I've been very happy with it (although, we played two-player; I've been hearing some reports of frustrations with the 4-player game, which seem possible). The advertised play time of ~30 minutes per player seems accurate - we whipped through two two-player games in one evening having never played before and needing to go to the rules, with a total of maybe 2.5 hr. The first game was a little bumpy but the second one was quite smooth. It's not an AP trap the way American Megafauna was. It plays fast and cleanly. It's much more chaotic than High Frontier, so you can get wiped out, but the rules for coming back into the game after extinction are easy. None of the detail lost from American Megafauna is missed at all, while crucial systems like speciation are vastly improved. There are huge wins all through the game over the old system, and like High Frontier, this is a playable, fun, highly evocative game. Yes, it's random; but the players have significantly more control than in AMF, the balance is better, and the mix of flavor, detail, chaos, and length seems just right, a sweet spot not often hit.

So yes, I'm pretty excited about Bios. I think it's not going to be the hit that High Frontier was just because of the high chaos, but it plays a lot faster too and doesn't have High Frontier's problem where games go really long before you learn how things work just because players have to succeed for the game to end. Bios: Megafauna will end one way or the other in an hour or two.

There is still a one-game learning curve on this sucker though, and there are a couple little tricks you need to figure out. Definitely read the player tips at the end of the rules; there are a couple simple tricks with branching your species early and predating between your own species that give you a much-needed bump early; you need two species fairly quickly to give yourself some options. Don't neglect the carnivore option to keep a few pieces on the board and your options open. Don't try to do everything; try to find a niche or two. Be very afraid of over-specialization. Compared to AMF and other games, piece count is going to be very low; you may be doing well if you have only half-a-dozen pieces on the board. And don't let yourself get too low on genes, especially in two-player.

Anyway, first impressions are really positive, and I hope that this and High Frontier indicate that SMG and Phil Eklund have arrived as a game producer, and we can look forward to more great stuff. Like maybe an updated version of Origins.

Well this just seemed to be pretty random on what cards you got and how it ended and what tiles were around that you could eat off.

Didn't enjoy it and would likely try and not get into another game again. 1 Play.

A fun science game. The only knocks against it are the somewhat arbitrary nature of some of the rules and the usual Sierra Madre rulebook problems (a fairly simple game made complex by poor writing and layout). It is a chaotic game, which makes good thematic sense and is pretty fun, but beware if you're a control-gamer. 

The perfect evolution game has yet to be made. Modeling what science implies is a random process while giving he player some measure of control is a pretty tricky problem. The player will either end up in a a godlike role deciding how a species will evolve or just tagging along for the ride. The essence of Natural Selection is  random mutations confering fitness through accident and pure dumb luck. Here, Eklund is trying to have the cake and eat it too by keeping things fairly macro. And it works in its own way. But I'm still waiting for THE definitive evolution game that manages to keep the actual evolution random while still giving the player something to do. What that would look like or how it would work is unclear to me at the moment...

Pete: So how was it.
Me: Wacky. And complicated.
Pete: Like taxes.

So, while Bios is actually more fun than taxes, it is not the game for me. Knowing it was Eklund had aligned my expectations. I knew it was more something to be experienced than played. The wild twists of fate on the tiles and the cards were okay; it was the fact that they could result in almost unplayable positions for some players. I'm glad I played once. I am unlikely to be swayed to play again.

RATING: 8.5
Highly provisional rating.  There's a great deal of game here to chew.  I'm only a couple games in but both were memorable, interesting experiences.  I get the feeling that one can make moves of strategic importance and play the game well but the real fun comes in exploring the topic.  The game provides an excellent locus for conversation and learning and, while it's not Origins, it's still leagues beyond anything else published in 2011.

Update:
Okay, provisional no longer.  I've played a solitaire game, two-player, and three-player.  This game is incredible.  Every move spawns discussion which is precisely what I look for in an Eklund style "experience game."  Over the next few weeks I've got a full roster of players who plan on linking the game with Origins and High Frontier to play the mega-game.

It's worth emphasizing that one needs to download the living rules which has a few changes that vastly improve the game (I'm looking at you Roadrunner club).  I also haven't had a chance to try the four player "double display" rule yet, but once I do expect a full out review.  This is looking like my Game of the Year.

RATING: 9
This is one of two games that we played again immediately after our first play.  It's the only game we've played 4 times within 24 hours - and then twice more the next day.  I don't know why I like this game so much.  I like the theme.  I very much like the information included as flavor text both in the rules and on the components - even though I'm usually so immersed in the game that I don't notice the flavor.

I usually don't care for games with wild swings of luck.  And yet, somehow, I like this game, perhaps because the randomness is appropriate for the theme.  Each time I play it I immediately want to play it again.  Can't wait to try it with more than 2 players.

Summary:
Each player controls a set of animals that are either all mammals or all dinosaurs.  A player set is divided into 4 species.  Play includes a map onto which biomes (map tiles) are placed.  A market of cards exists, which includes mutations and genotypes.  Players attempt to increase the numbers of their animals on the board through expansion or speciating with a genotype card.  A mutation card can be purchased from the market and used to help a species specialize, which generally aids in expanding.  A genotype card may be use to begin a new species, if certain prerequisites are met.  

As cards deplete from the market, new cards are drawn.  The events on the cards occur.  These events can add biomes, remove biomes, and cause extinction in overly specialized species.  During this process, it is possible that the climate will shift.  Climate shift is accomplished by shifting biome tiles (with a few exceptions) on the map.  This can result in further biome removal and additional extinctions.  Removed biome tiles become victory points.

The game is played in 4 eras denoted by 4 small decks of cards.  At the end of an era, biome tiles are awarded to players in descending order of numbers of animals on the board.  Each biome is a victory point.  Genotype cards can become victory points if certain conditions are met.  Lots of biome tiles and cards help add variety and replay value. 

Sound easy?  It's not.  You must specialize if you wish to expand since you will likely not have the necessary DNA to survive in another biome.  Size may be adjusted to aid with increasing migration range - but it may come at the price of losing genes.  Changing climate can eliminate dozens of animals causing several extinctions in the blink of an eye.  After the first game, I wondered what had just happened.  After the second, I was starting to get a grasp.  Everything since has been an attempt to explore different aspects of the game while trying to survive what the game throws at players.  

Not to mention, it's a lot of fun to see how species and genes combine.  Farming flying rhinoceros... burrowing amphibious cat-canids...  It's also interesting to read the flavor text.

Update 1:
Rating from 7 to 8.  The seemingly huge swings of luck are thematically appropriate and can be, to a degree, managed.  Don't get too specialized, try to speciate through expansion.

Update 2:
Bumped to a 9.  We played 3 times today and each game was very different and equally compelling.

This streamlined version of American Megafauna is improved in some ways and not as good in other ways. American Megafauna allowed for more mutations per species and you could create more interesting ones as a result. A lot of the movement and finding habitable biomes and such is a lot nicer and more easily understood in this version, however. I do like the species meeples a lot though.

American Megafauna is a great game, but mostly because it's a wild ride during which all players will suffer. In other words, more of an experience than a game.
In Bios players have more control seem to have more control over the fate of their species. Although this is scientificly incorrect, it'll make for a better game.

I'm thinking now that this does everything that Dominant Species tries to do only better.   Don't get me wrong, I really like Dominant species, but Bios Megafauna softens the combat just enough that it doesn't sting, there's liberal catchup mechanics, the science is better, the board is a common enemy, and it takes about 90 min.   The counterpoint to this was best put by my buddy Alex, "This thing is an amazing model, and I really like the concept and the science, but it's trying too hard to be smart, and not hard enough to be fun.  Let's play Euchre."

Not much of a game, it is really unfair. The board can change drasticly over a few turns, wiping out a strong position. But it's what make it a great experience with a strong narrative. You can really see species go extinct while a underdog become dominant.

RATING: N/A
I enjoy american Megafauna a lot, there is chaos but you can play and take decisions. Bios Megafauna is more a show than a game. You sit and watch the movie, you can't take decisions although you have 4, because all is reduced to take a card, shake the map, die, wait for your turn, take a card, put again your piece on the map to be dead again. And no, it's not bad luck.

Edit: Removed my rating (1) because Phil has been trying to remove that problem, and it seems it's not the same game now. No rating because I sold my game and haven't tried the new rules.

Very dense, pretty incomprehensible, and not terribly well explained. I am convinced there is a good game in here though - I think it could work a lot better as a solo game given how the board is constantly trying to kill you. Dominant Species is much more playable.

This game is unfinished. I had to download the living rules and then it lists like 8 different ways to play the game.

Bios: Megafauna was a hoot. One of the silliest games I've ever played with lots of crazy take-that and ridiculous hijinx that you'd expect from a typical Bruno Faidutti game -- what's that? This isn't a Faidutti game? 

OK, silly intro out of the way, the game was very interesting at first due to the enormity of [i]stuff going on[/i], but in the end I can't find anything to hang on to. The card play is not nearly as interesting as that in Origins, and the game just doesn't let you do anything cool. I found the cards too restricting in that you'd have the DNA but not the size or vice versa or you'd have what you need to start a new breed but it requires an animal that you already have on the board. Goddamn, let me do something! Every time I thought I could chain a sequence of moves into something cool, I found I couldn't for some reason or other. 

By the end of the game I felt frustrated from grinding my gears. I came in second but for the record, the turns where I got wiped out were the game's doing and the turns where I scored a bunch of points b/c my opponents got wiped out were the game's doing. I made one good move to adapt such that my opponents had to remove their predator figures from the game board. One move was me, the rest was the game.

UPDATE: I'd like to retry this one using the updated rules where everyone gets 2 actions per turn as that sounds like just what the game needs.

I think Phil Eklund has gotten better with his rulebooks.  This is much harder to learn than Pax Porfiriana, although the density of the rules and extra information make reading the rulebook quite an experience.

Another great simulation design from Eklund. Not as meaty as High Frontier but also much quicker. I like how there is a constant struggle to stay flexible enough to survive whatever mother nature may have in store. Of course it is difficult to get through the rules, but they are a bit more straight forward than some other Eklund games. Looking forward to more plays.

There is quite a bit of chaos in this title. If you dislike chaotic games stay away. A few games in and I really enjoy the experience.

This game has lots of rules and choices, which can make it a long game for beginners.  But once players all know it, perhaps it will be smoother and better?

There are definitely different paths to victory -- being a herbivore (feeding on a biome), or being a predator.  Choosing multiple species, or trying to specialize in one (and try not to collect too many attribute, lest your species die in a catastrophe).  But there is a lot of randomness, especially in the choices of DNA that are available on your turn, and that can make for some painful reversals of fortune.

BIOS: Megafauna is certainly a game that I can't quite yet put my finger on in terms of not how I feel, but rather what I feel. Wow? I've always been a fan of Dinosaur-themed games (e.g., Evo, Trias) and interested in evolutionary mechanics but, boy oh boy, this game takes the cake in terms of striving for scientific simulation (and this is important) while also keeping the flow game-y. This is an ongoing battle of risk versus reward in a tense, dynamic, and ever-changing world (well, the Americas until I get a copy of the zazzle map) that has it out for you from the get go.

I know what painted on theme looks like, and I know what fluffy theme looks like too. However, I had not one clue as to what a hard theme would look like until I played this. And is it ever richly thematic (it's actually fun to imagine what your creatures look and behave like after a few rounds of evolving).

It is also worth noting that this is the first game that I played solo and actually enjoyed (as opposed to play to learn). The living rules have set up a very difficult challenge.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like BIOS: Megafauna. it works great solo, and because you only use a fraction of the available cards no two games are the same. that makes it too unpredictable for some but for solo-ing that is a big plus because not every game will be the same.
there is chaos in this game, that goes for all of Eklunds'designs, but if you know the game you can manage your risks and come out on top.

Another terrific game of hard science and harder luck from the esteemed Mr. Eklund. Once again, it's brutal and random and I absolutely love it.

It's streamlined, I suppose, but only to the degree that his games are capable of being streamlined. Everything meshes together well, and the narratives provoked are terrific fun.

The solitaire game could use some tweaking; I think that he tried to keep it as accessible as the main game, when it could stand to be beefed up more, since the only ones who are likely to play it solo are fellow travelers.

But I'll play it with just about any set of rules options.

Damn! Looked good as usual but also, as usual, it sounds like a big random factor can throw your whole plan in what otherwise is a long highly thematic and high strategy game. Maybe I'll still play once for the experience, if I can being myself to being subjected to such punishment. (I know its highly thematic but it still sucks too much when it happens) 

Edit - Well several years later, my tastes are changing somewhat, and I've done some more reading on it. I REALLY want to like Phil's games (and I do really like Pax, the only one I took the risk to play) this one sounds like you could have very limited options at some points, and of course get randomly and unfairly punished at any point. I really need to watch the gameplay videos and/or play it

First impression: Old-school Eklund game, with gratuitous amounts of chaos and player punishment. Rules are slightly fiddly (but not worse than High Frontier and possibly a lot easier with more experience). Lots of charming details, but the random elements really soured my first impression. Many times, it felt like the game played the players rather than the other way around.

Update: Although, like with High Frontier before it, afterwards I can't stop thinking about the game, and looking forward to my next play. There might be something here after all.

Update: A few games later, while there's a lot to like with the game, the randomness is out of hand here for me. I think all my games have seen at least one player who never made it out of his starting biome, through no fault of his own. The fact that you can't guarantee having mutations available to match your neighboring biomes (most often; M biomes with no matching DNA in the south, and B or G biomes with no matching DNA in the north), plus the fact that greenhouse shifts are likely to destroy your setup, even if you manage to find a couple of habitable biomes, makes it hard to do anything constructive in the game.

Possible suggestions for variants to "fix" this for me:

- Let all starting species start with a single DNA letter (dietary or roadrunner), chosen freely after seeing the initial biome layout.
- Choose between more cards. I've tried playing with two separate rows of 5 cards instead (so you start with five extra cards visible, but the decks are the usual size), and it worked well.
- Lessen the effect of greenhouse shifts somehow (we've tried taking the greenhouse track/effects out of the game completely, and while it diminishes the game somewhat, it worked fine from a gameplay point of view).
- Somehow seed more biomes onto the board to make it less empty. Perhaps turn over two new era tiles after each greenhouse event.

Update:
Phil has come up with a couple of optional rules (somewhat reminiscent of a couple of my suggestions above) to fix the issues players have reported:
- The Roadrunner club rule introducing a fifth type of action allowing species to buy a extra roadrunner DNA letter at the cost of two genes.
- For 4 players (but why only that?): A second display of five cards, fed with cards from a second, 25 card deck. These cards do not activate their events when revealed.

Both rules seems excellent - I look forward to trying them.

At last I got to play an Elkund game :D. Not sure how I feel about this one though. I had fun playing it so I like the game (for now). Love the theme and it fits perfectly with the game mechanics. 

I didn’t feel the game to be overly complex due to its rule set; most rules are in congruence with the theme so they are (somewhat) intuitive.

As I’m pretty sure the game explainer got some rules wrong, the jury is still out on this one, however, I feel the game will go down with more plays because it has lots of uncontrollable luck AND it has a high play time. First of all with the events, I know they are a faithful representation of what really happened (or could happen) but when a random event kills most of your species there is no planning for that (except perhaps having less than 4 genes). Second, you can be isolated by your environment and the genes you need to escape could not be available, it is luck if they appear when you need them or not. Chaos everywhere so planning most than one turn can be a tall order, still it is a fun experience.

Playing the game can be hard (a plus for me), which genes to buy or where to move. Analyzing if you can survive in an environment is also hard slowing the game considerably so the down time can be high.

For now, I will read the rules and try to get this to the table again. Not sure if I like the game or not. 

Current Rating: 6.0

RATING: 7
Two solo plays only.

Mechanics are clean and consistent with the evolutionary theme once you've wrapped your head around them. 

If the cards and tiles fall right for your animals it's fun. However, it can seem that sometimes you could have no viable choices for a turn or four other than to draw and discard a card in the hope it's replaced in the card display by something more useful which in turn isn't snaffled by one of the other players before you can get to it. (More often event cards mix things up and reset the map).

You need to accept that the cards and tiles can deal you some unexpected blows that you have to deal with. Consequently, it's probably not for Euro-puzzlers who like to find an optimum strategy and execute it as efficiently as possible. That's a plus for me (I enjoy managing chaos) but may not be for everyone.

I suspect it could play long with AP players if it goes the full distance - it did with my first game! (I had a few rules queries that took a little time to sort out - my second play ended with Snowball Earth and was a lot quicker).

If you like the sound of the theme and implementation (it's almost a planet earth evolution sandbox) and can handle some randomness, I'm up for a game.

Complex, but plays relatively quickly.

Game 1 was 90 minutes and ended with a hot house earth.

The game is highly dependant upon the luck of the cards that come up and sits firmly on the 'experience' end of the simulation continium.

Enjoyable and thought provoking like all of Phil's games. Rated 8 as I do want to play it again asap.

Even when the game puts you in a tight spot I find that the ability to 'go carnivore' can often lead to better opportunities to score.

Will have to play again with new rules, especially 2 coins on the first card to move up the roadrunner DNA chart. That is a definately improvement for the game. 

Even with the new rules the game is slightly towards the 'experience' side of his games. I think that this will ultimately prove less fulfilling than High Frontier.

I am really digging this game.  The randomness may turn off some people, and for me it is keeping the game fresh and challenging.  The short play time helps, too.  Definitely recommend the genotypes after a training game, and the roadrunner club rules to help balance things.  While this can be frustrating to see species die off, it gives a good picture of how life barely made it on the planet.

*All Comments Based on Solo Play*

Lots of luck so it's hard to really strategize, but that fits with the representation of evolution. As a simulation it suffers from strange abstractions in the climate model. The way biomes displace can sometimes seem to be without clear physical cause and effect. Some of this can be explained by realizing how abstract the model actually is despite the appearance of specific biomes and creatures. Still I enjoy it as it has a lot of flavor and it does make sense in a loose way. It's fun to play solo and just imagine the story that is unfolding. Pretty quick and easy to play four players solo.

A couple of the acculturation options (agriculture, projectile weapons) are a bit silly in my view, but they can be harmlessly ignored if desired.

Haven't played American Megafauna.

I love the theme and really wanted to like the game.  That it was a "Euro-ization" of the designers American Megafauna was promising and the enthusiasm for the game from several BGG members, plus the simpler variant that is relatively short made me pull the trigger and pick up a copy.  However, in the back of my mind was the knowledge that this might not be our kind of game and I made a pact with myself that I would let it go if that turned out to be the case.  Sadly, it turned out to be the case.

I played it solo and that nailed down some of the rules for me, but even as I scratched through that solo game I got a feeling that the game was more playing us than us playing the game (this in a game where the Earth became a Hothouse before the end of the Triassic!).  I played it with my wife and we went a good way into the game without major events before a Level 4 Catastrophe hit (the worst kind) and that meant almost everything on the board was wiped out apart from my just spawned dolphin species.  That rather killed any enthusiasm my wife had and was the final straw as she wasn't really getting the game as a game - the move from biome to biome was too difficult and restrictive, especially when taking on too many genes was asking for trouble.  And if you did that, how to expand the population (which is the driver for scoring points both between ages and at the end of game)?

It is a game that tells a good story looking back and if that is the kind of game you enjoy then it could work for you.  With a more receptive opponent, I might be talked into attempting to master it and see if there is any real control we can exert, but it more or less seemed to be a case of making the best of the situation and enjoying the ride.

Almost as good as its predecessor. I don't guess I care for the attempted Euroization of the game. The original was great and didn't need a streamlining.

Of course, it's a so-called experience game.  You try to survive within the limits of the model, which is unforgiving.  It's very easy to play once you know the rules, like gateway game level.  I pretty much figure this game to be a light filler.  Not for everyone because of how harsh the model is: nothing in this game is player-driven, and it's entirely possible for the game to end early with everyone having perished for some reason or another.  Just getting to the end should count as a win.

After my first game I was so disappointed.  We played the four player version with the rules as the originally came in the box.  I was wiped out by catastrophes before I hardly could make any decisions, and was never in the game.  I basically just watched my friends play and thought, "meh!"  Mercifully it was a short game. I didn't give up on it, however, and played it with the modified rules, adding more cards to the display among other things, and began to like it.  Each game would play out very differently and this somehow gave me a new, deeper perspective on the process of evolution.  It seems more of learning experience than a competitive game.

Received as a Father's Day Gift, 2012.

As excruciatingly difficult to learn as High Frontier, and just as rewarding and worth the effort.

At it's core this is essentially a tight area control game with some card drafting built in that changes the effects of the area control struggle. However, in this particular case, the theme is so significantly integrated with the mechanics that in spite of the game going on, one cannot help but see a kind of narrative develop. In this case, it is a strictly scientific narrative - the story of the natural history of a species as it struggles from apocalypse to apocalypse against the unkind, indifferent, and in some cases outright hostile whims of nature. Like High Frontier, it is a game I am happy to play regardless of how poorly I am doing - the experience is immersive enough that the outcome matters far less than the journey I took to arrive at that final moment.

Extremely rewarding game in which you play either a race of protodinosaurs or protomammals around the time of the Permian extinction.  You must try to get your species set up with the genomes needed to compete effectively while having all kinds of climactic changes and other species competing.  Very detailed instructions that need a few readings to feel like you can even set up the game, but it runs quite smoothly once you start playing.  Very educational game too.  Highly recommended!

In terms of gameplay, this is easily a 4 or less. The game plays you 80% of the time, and even when you do make a calculated move, it gets undone by some completely random event (card, tile pile). Even if it doesn't, you certainly don't feel good about having some grand strategy when you see your opponents getting wiped off the board through no fault of their own. Sure, there are constraints within which you can play in order to mitigate the damage from these events, but why bother? I just don't think there's a whole lot you can do here.

Despite all this, I can honestly say I'd play this again. Willingly. It's an "experience" game if I ever saw one, the sort of thing you play just to see what will happen. I even got a kick out of the random draw of some [i]homo sapiens[/i] during the Cenozoic Era, even though they had no place to survive on the board. I'd been reading articles and watching documentaries about these eras prior to the game, and it really does a good job of simulating a lot of the events that happened. Sure, it would be preferable were there more of a "game" here, but the experience is enough for me to come back to this a few more times.

Je n'aime pas attribuer de mauvaises notes aux jeux qui me déplaisent profondément après une seule partie jouée, tout comme je n'aime pas que mes jeux favoris soient très mal notés dans les mêmes circonstances... Mais pourtant, je ne peux m'en empêcher.

Certes, nous n'avons peut-être pas appliqué les (quelles?) règles à la lettre, mais il y a beaucoup trop de hasard et de contraintes pour se sentir engagé dans la partie. Comme d'autres l'ont mentionné, c'est le jeu qui nous joue.

J'investis trois tours et tous mes gènes pour tenter de modifier les mutations d'une de mes espèces (afin de lui donner le vol), pour ENFIN pouvoir songer m'enfuir d'une Afrique isolée. Puis, la fin de mon tour se solde par l'extermination complète de mes trois espèces (trop de mutations, glissement de continent, tuile qui écrase l'emplacement où je me situe). Je me dis alors: "Ok. Mauvaise expérience. Je n'aime pas ce jeu. Ce n'est pas plaisant".

J'étais encore loin de me douter que durant l'heure qui allait suivre, j'allais soit consacrer mes tours à (être contraint de) voler des gènes, soit repartir des espèces qui allaient être presque immédiatement exterminées à cause de d'autres événements "random".

Impossible de ne pas privilégier Pax Porfiriana lors d'une prochaine soirée Eklund.

Note: je serais tenté d'attribuer une note encore plus basse, mais je laisse un petit bénéfice du doute à une possibilité qu'une règle ou deux n'aient pas été parfaitement appliquées

In this game, one starts as a dino or a mammal, and attempts to migrate and achieve majority on the board to score points from discarded tiles: the leader gets half the tiles; second place gets half remaining, and so forth. You need certain genes to move to certain tiles, such as having a M (marine) gene to be able to migrate to a marine tile. You also need predator characteristics if you want to feed on other people. You get genes by picking up cards. The games last four rounds from the Triassic era to the Teriary era.

I have played this three times, all with 4 players. It seemed very random to me. Sure, with experience now, I can try to control the randomness a bit more: 1) Try not to have more than 4 genes, so you won't be affected by level 4 and greater castastrophes, 2) migrate to high numbered tiles, so oncoming tiles won't crush you. We also played with the original rules, but the optional rules give you more gene selection cards and also allows you to trade 2 genes for another ability. 

Now, if you view this game from an educational point of view, then it does a pretty good job of inspiring you and teaching you about the era, greenhouse cases and dinosaur characteristics. You can download the rules, and read some of the footnotes. That is interesting. 

The game experience is a completely different matter. Having events that move the map up or down a row, potentially crushing other tiles is a bit extreme. Likewise with tiles that come on the board, you might lose your dinos when the tiles come on. We didn't play with the two key optional rules (have 5 more gene cards, and you are allowed to trade two genes for another attribute) which would add more to the game.  The game might not support 4 players as well, and perhaps it really shines with 2 or 3 players.

[ImageID=247533micro][/floatleft][b]BIOS: Megafauna[/b] designed by [person=174][/person] (High Frontier, Pax Porfiriana)

With Bios: Genesis, Bios: Megafauna, and Origins: How We Became Human, designer Phil Eklund takes players through almost the whole breadth and scope of life on Earth.

Reimplements: American Megafauna


[b]UPDATE:[/b] a new 2nd edition is coming in 2017

[q]This year we are publishing the first of a three game series on the history of planet Earth. Called Bios Genesis, this covers the first 4 billion years, including the creation of life. This should appear in Oct 2016, with preorders in June. 

Also in work are the other two games in the series, Bios Megafauna and Bios Origins. These cover the last half billion years on Earth. Both are due to come out in 2017.[/q]

[q="phileklund"][q="andrewdoull"][q="brrrmanza"]I'm interested in seeing both of the BMF/BMO reprints.
BMF is probably one of my favorite games of all time, so whatever tweaks come through, I'm open to.[/q]

Phil has set the designer (Jon Manker) and developer (me) of BMF 2nd edition a challenge that's going to involve a little more than a few tweaks. I'm working hard on preserving the game play and it's mostly working out, although I want as many different meeple types as they'll let me have (the plan is 4 phlya, I think I can marshall the arguments for 5, but ideally I'd like 13 i.e. more than three times as many as the first edition, even though I know that's crazy talk).[/q]

Bios Genesis covers the first 4 billion years, and the next game in the Bios Series will be a complete remake (2nd edition) of Bios Megafauna.  As Andrew says, both he and Jon Manker of Ion Design are on commission for this effort, which doubles the timespan of the game and starts it shortly after plants and animals first crawled ashore during the Cambrian.

The rules are a bit fiddly, but boy is this game FUN! Continual tension between specialising a species to make it more competitive or staying unspecialised in order to avoid the extinction events. Nice components too, although I may get a cloth bag to pull the tiles from (rather than stacking them upside-down on the table).

After 8 plays, this had to go ... blech!

The biggest issue is the random/chaotic nature of the game.  If you only like games where you can really plan and expect very little to interfere with your progress and plans, then Bios is not your game.  If you enjoy planning but with copious amounts of chaos and/or risk-management, Bios might be for you.

The wide swings in scoring due to dumb luck are a problem for me.  However, with skill and experience you can certainly mitigate the wide swings, so what initially appears to be an unforgivable chaotic mess of can be mitigated.  Most of the time.  However, even the best player in the world will lose at times because of a poor set-up, poor upgrade availability and random events.

Pros:
- flows quickly with very little downtime between turns
- random set-up and events make each game unique
- tells an interesting story
- very thematic

Cons:
- random set-up can leave some players with an initial disadvantage
- rulebook is hard to get through because of the esoteric vocabulary
- very chaotic
- the game plays you and you see the story unfold

Other attributes:
-	2-4 players
-	Game length is under two hours
-	Not suitable for non-gamers (too complicated)

Many years ago, there was a computer game called "Sim Life" which allowed you to watch and participate in a world as it evolves. It was a fascinating program and one that I spent hours playing and enjoying. The designer stated at the time that it was not a game but a toy since a game is competitive with a distinct winner and loser. With a toy (he stated), you simply play with it.

Enter Bios. A game that has many of the same features as Sim Life but defines itself as a game since there are winners and losers when the game is over. The funny thing is, I didn't care if I won or lost. It was more about the crazy hybrid creatures I created along the way. As a result, much like Tales of the Arabian Nights, to me it is more about the narrative than it is about the game. 

If you are a competitive gamer, you can mentally work out all of the strategies to maximize your chances to win. However, if you just want to put wings on a dolphin to see what will happen, you can do that too. In that sense, this could be called both a game and a toy.

I've played this a few times now with different people – every time it's been a fascinating journey. The rules out of the box are just fine, you don't need to get involved in all the modding discussions. With first-timers I usually leave out the genotype cards just to keep it a bit simpler. This is a gloriously ambitious, absorbing, mind-expanding game. I love it.

Area control with a big pinch of chaos and some of the coolest dinomeeples you could ever hope for. A great game that takes the players for a ride. Don't expect to control the fate of your species too much as this game throws bad stuff at you every turn. I've had a few games where all players have had their species wiped from the map, sometimes more than once! If you don't mind this sort of thing and you like the evolutionary theme you should definitely look into this game. Just make sure you pick up the living rules as they add a number of optional rules which make the base game much better.

Thematically rich and visually appealing game, but it seems like it's hard to plan very far ahead due to the changes in the environment that occur.

Chaotic and overly thematic.

If you're looking for an evolution/migrating game with decent mechanisms and don't care at all about the chaos, this might be for you.

Given enough plays perhaps it might be possible to mitigate a bunch of the chaos but I don't feel compelled to invest any more time with this.

[Disclosure: 1 play - I prefer abstract games with "pasted on" themes, and with less randomness]

[Tip: Read Chris Farrell's comments for a more thorough, and positive, perspective on this particular game.]

Someone once asked me what the greatest story in board games is, and I replied with "Bios: Megafauna".  What greater story than the history of life and evolution through millions of years?  

There are a lot of evolution games, Dominant Species being one of my favorite.  But those are just games with an evolution theme.  Bios is a simulation of what it would be like to look out the eyes of species as they evolve over time.  It has tectonic shifts, biomes winking in and out of existence, the splintering of species, the race of predator vs prey, birth and extinction, greenhouse gasses and planet-wide meteoric catastrophes.  It is the closest you will get to evolving in your lifetime.  

I love how on this scale the land seems to be a fluid. That's what it would be like if you lived for millions of years!  Sometimes all of your species on the board perish, and you have to start all over.  Remarkably, you are not out of the game!  That is just life in Bios: Megafauna.  

I got into a long argument with a friend about whether this is a game or not.  It is so chaotic it may feel like you have no control, especially the first time you play.  But persevere, there is no game experience like it.  It usually plays in about an hour, even with four players, and I come away feeling like I have lived through eons.  I will never turn down a play.

First game was absolutely disastrous. The rules leave A LOT to be desired, being alternately vague and impenetrably overexplained.  I've played few games where I've spent the first seven or eight full four-player turns and done absolutely nothing.  Just my one animal sitting the starting biome surrounded by stuff he couldn't get out of.  I'm committed to giving it another try, but this one left a deeply sour taste in my mouth. 
Extremely disappointing.  Perhaps one of my worst board gaming experiences in years.

I find Phil Eklund a fascinating designer: he has the war-gaming spirit of thematic veracity, but applies it to science instead of war. My one game of High Frontier was a wonderful, confusing experience, and I was excited to try his latest. Phil seems to be getting better at harnessing the crazy experiences his designs provide into playable games. If anything, Bios was too short, though we did mess up a couple of rules. I admire his imagination and uniqueness and really want to try this again soon.

UPDATE: the second play, using the revisions to the rules, was longer and more satisfying than the first.

It amazes me how many times this has hit our table. The struggle to even learn the game at first was quite tough, and then to learn how to play it correctly as the living rules evolved was another issue altogether. Sure it is pretty random at times and the way the game can kick you in the teeth and then stomp on your head when you are down, will certainly turn many people off. But Cass and I have so much fun with it anyway!

RATING: 6
Lots of little details superimposed over a relatively simple mechanism.  Fortunately, many of those details are printed on the map so need not be emphasized when teaching the game - just refer to the rules as necessary.  Player's actions not that complex individually, but like many Eklund games, there is the puzzle of figuring out the necessary combination to get anywhere.

Our first game saw a preponderance of Genotype card events which steamrollered the game into a snowball fairly early in the Cenozoic.  Too many extinctions - which I interpret as a sign of beginning players learning the game rather than an overly harsh game.  Our second game seemed to flow a bit better, but one player was surrounded by water and the M genes were just not available for purchase.  Felt the biome change was too rapid and dramatic relative to the pace of animal adaption.

A definite upgrade in "snappiness" and playing time from American Megafauna, but I'm a little concerned about what feels like a relative lack of player interaction in Bios: Megafauna compared to its older sibling.  There also feels like there are consistently fewer biomes available at any given time, leading to, well, just *less* to do.  I would, of course, have to go back and play American Megafauna again to be sure...

Still, a cool theme and something I enjoy playing.

Bit random at times - it seems like you can get wiped out, whilst another player survives due to location. 

Also, the random distribution of cards occasionally makes the game a bit slow - when there's no Marine adaptations, but loads of water, for instance. 

However, the theme shines through all this, and makes the game very playable even with this. Coupled with the fact the two-player game takes all of 1 hour, makes this a very good filler game with a fairly unique theme.

The game seems a little fussy - (I wondered if it could be made visually easier to check habitats and competitors/predators etc - but maybe it's as good as it can be in that respect).

This game honestly still has me a bit puzzled. 

Parts of it are utterly random and seem to have little to do with strategic play (for instance the pulling of disaster tiles and how they affect your species is very hard to mitigate for - but I'm certain that is entirely the point).

Other factors can be fiddly to keep track of, particularly, the requirements for a carnivore animal when feeding on prey - size and defenses must be taken into account, and it is not uncommon for a player in our sessions (ok, honestly, usually me) to miss something vital until a couple of turns later, effectively making a couple of rounds of play invalid.

This can make this game frustrating, but overall, I still enjoy it enough to want to play it again each time.

Update: With repeated plays, this game becomes far more intuitive. Our games typically end with close scores, and I must say the game is very enjoyable. The depth combined with a reasonable play-time makes it likely to hit the table fairly often.

-I want to like Phil Eklund games due to how he integrates themes so heavily into the mechanics, but his games feel more like simulations or homework rather than anything that enjoyable to actually experience.

It isn't really like other games. It's super chaotic, and you often don't have control over what you're doing. This being said, it is a fun and entertaining experience. If you're a science nerd (especially biology/ ecology/ evolution/ enviro science etc.) you may really enjoy this. I think I appreciate the game more from a science nerd standpoint than a gaming standpoint. I wouldn't want to play this game often, but I think I'd have a lot of fun pulling it out several times a year. If you have the right group, it can be really fun. If you are someone or play with people who hate(s) randomness, this game is not for you.

A very interesting game, and some beautiful visuals. Unfortunately, the main issue with this game is the same that I have with the other titles by the author: great concept, interesting science, but poor playability. As a simulation or explanation of a specific set of scientific theories, it's quite good, but as an actual, playable game, I'm just not so sure. It is more approachable, certainly, than "High Frontier" for the average gamer, but I suspect my comfort with this subject probably helped me along here.

Really feels like the game is playing you.

You're so limited on what you can do and when you finally get a good creature, it gets wiped on with no warning. No matter how thematic this is, it makes for non engaging gameplay.

Their is some good idea in the game that could be be recuperated in a better design. As is, you're only playing the card row and its randomness.

Would never play this over Dominant Species.

Freakishly fascinating trademark Eklund design that takes a *lot* of prep time to digest (though it is much more palatable than High Frontier). Once on the table, the game flows smoothly and quickly.

Quite a bit of chaos that is tempered by the Living Rules (highly recommended). Replayability is off the charts.

Just oozes with theme, and it seems to me that the designer is learning to better harness his fringe creative genius.

It's worth noting that the game plays very well solitaire, as well as with 2P, 3P, or 4P.

Years later, I am still completely captivated by this design. Full illustrated review here:

A highly climatic, well-designed and complex game. However, the rules can be a horror for a newbie. Without the living rules, you can easily get a stalemate situation.

Complex with an amazing theme.  A simulation more than a game.  Rough though if you get too attached to your species - the ones you build up a lot get slammed by climate changes and meteor impacts. Also, this has been the most fun I've had with any solitaire game. I played three full times through in solitaire (over a few days) the first time I tried it.  You're playing as four different factions, but the competition is the environment much more than other species (in my games at least).

A chaotic simulation where a player can be eliminated or taken out of the game through random chance. Not my thing at all. Almost not a game, rather an experience.

Well Phil Ecklund certainly doesn't design gateway games, that's for certain. This game has a lot of interesting ideas. I really like the way it tries to model very scientific concepts as a game. That seems to often make for very complicated and esoteric games. I know will turn some people off, but I appreciate it. However, it also makes for games that are difficult graphic design challenges. And I think that is one area where this game fails. Not only is this game not visually appealing, the graphic design felt like an impediment to learning the game. It felt like the first part of the game was learning how to play... where the game was trying to prevent that from happening and I had to battle the game to get to the point where I knew how to play.

Once I understood the game, it was fairly interesting. But I think it ends up being a little too random for me. For example, I ended up on a homeland that was isolated from any other land for a large part of the game. The few times lands moved near me (I was in a mountain range) they either were things that were likely to disappear from the world soon, or had food requirements that weren't matching available genes in the card row. And shortly afterward an event triggered that wiped out my homeland and all my animals off the board just before the biggest scoring round in the game.

Yes, there are ways you can mitigate the randomness, but when you don't have the ability to migrate very far, eat very much, and the only place you can live disappears... there's just not much mitigating that can happen. You do get to respawn though, and I came back and made a halfway decent showing I hope. Usually when I look back on games, I have a very clear conception of what I did wrong, and what I needed to do differently to play better next time. Honestly, I don't know how I should have played this game differently. If there were better moves I should have been making I have no idea what they were.

The other problem I have with the game is that there are turns where there is nothing good to do. At all. I had one turn where I discarded a card from the gene pool for nothing at all, and a good third to half my actions in the game were taking/discarding cards simply because they had a lot of chips on them.

The combination of being subject to random luck and spending a lot of the game having nothing good to do just didn't sit well with me. It felt like there was an interesting game somewhere here, but only really when the stars align just right. It's not a bad game... but I don't think I want to invest much time into a game where it plays like this first play did.

Is it a game or is it edutainment? The second I think. Lots of details and lots of fun creating weird species but most of all a very very thoroughly made scientific game that is very difficult to survive. Its rulebook is infamous for being hard to learn the game from but it is not that bad. I do recommend watching the walkthrough videos to learn it. Even with the living rules I think there is a bit too much luck in which cards come out meaning you might be looking at lots of genetic traits that no one can really use. BIOS: Megafauna is also less thematic than American Megafauna so I much prefer that despite it not looking as nice.

Mercyless and swingy evolution-game where only the versatile and widespread survive, but still I feel it was realistic, this is what I imagine it was like for a species on a several million-year timescale. Also being an Eklund fanboy helps. The integration of theme and mechanics are outstanding in his games.

Came into this really excited, as I had thoroughly enjoyed [gameid=639] during my one play of that title.  However, my one play of this didn't evoke a similar feel.  I'm not sure if that was due to some quirks of setup and cards (there was a giant sea that cut off the northern part of the continent from the southern part, making movement impossible between the two, as well as a huge ice age that reduced the playable biomes to less than 10 for most of the game), or whether that was because a little bit of soul was lost in the transition to making this a shorter, more palatable game.

Don't get me wrong, this is still a good game.  The little wooden dinos and mammals are wonderful, and the components are of good quality.  The graphic design is still a bit rough around the edges, but it has taken significant leaps forward.  This game also has the advantage of being playable in an evening.  It's got the trademark Eklund research, and it's just fun to play.  Recommended for science nerds, or people who love dinos.

I have only played solo.

this is definitely a better "game" than American Megafauna - but is less of a simulation.  Component quality is hands and feet better than AM.

I will occasionally pull this out to get a game in of something completely different (I like evolution games).

Unfortunately, this game misses out on its full potential by a wide margin.
First of all, I don't mind the rulebook, which was, truth be told, very poorly written and could have benefited from the help of a professional rules writer. It took me some time, but I managed to get into the gist of it. 

My main complaint is that this game was incredibly poorly playtested. In our first 5 games we were mainly confined to 1 tile apart from the starting one and in two cases the players were completely unable to do anything due to a poor card mix and the game played itself. Theme or no theme this is unacceptable. This is due to the glaring disproportion and statistical imbalance of the gene cards. Most tiles require B and G genes, sometimes multiple instances of them and yet the percentage of these gene cards in the deck is surprisingly low, which makes the chances of drawing a useful gene card very low, which in turn prohibits you from expanding from your home tile. Some fans pointed out that this is thematic and that it reflects scientific facts. Well, simply put, no it doesn't. In the deck there is only a single instance of any mutation, e.g. a ruminant stomach, whereas in reality there were many species which had this particular trait.

The living rules patched up the game to a certain extent by making it possible to purchase M genes, which allowed species to migrate to sea tiles. But still, much of the game's potential remains untapped as the land tiles remain inaccessible most of the time. One possible fix would be spicing up the mix by including all the B and G cards in the random selection and adding other cards randomly. This would increase the odds of getting useful genes to an acceptable level. But still, that would only be another fix.

This game could have been amazing with only a little more statistical planning and playtesting. This way it's a Frankenstein's monster which functions at 35% efficiency mainly through patches and fixes.

The game really transmits you the key elements of the theme it develops. The evolution of the species, adaptation and mutation in a changing environment. May seem chaotic and random, but it's a survival game where you have to adapt to the situation turn by turn. If you accept that premise, you will find a well designed game.

Right now, I am enjoying the hell out of Bios: Megafauna. Strictly speaking, I'm not sure that I could say that it is a great game, because so much of it is completely out of your control. Yet every session provides a compelling story, while the weird creatures you evolve to survive the shifting environments are endlessly entertaining. There are a load of adjustments in the game's living rulebook for the control freaks among us, but I think those take away from the history lesson. Bad card draws and unplayable tile layouts just add to the storyline, at least in my opinion. I like the chaos...and I think I have learned more about what this game is trying to teach, because of it.

I got this game specifically for the theme and the ability to play solitaire. It's definitely an engaging experience. The "luck of the draw" effect is substantial, however, so a player could win (or lose) due to factors outside human control. While certainly fitting the theme of the game, it does diminish the satisfaction of making good strategic decisions.

The game is strange in that it is mechanically very simple (each turn you take one action from a short menu), but there are several small details that are easy to overlook.  For example, you can only take (or keep) certain cards and tiles if your animal is in a certain size range.  Similarly, predators can only eat prey within one size of themselves.  So, every time an animal changes size you need to check those things.  When you draw new cards, they come out of the game advancing deck if you draw from one row, but the other deck otherwise.  The game state can change quite a bit from turn to turn, so it is difficult to plan.  All that said, I like the game quite a bit.  It's definitely more than an "experience" game; you can clearly affect your position in the game.  But you have to enjoy dealing with a lot of chaos.

My most recent game was with four, and I liked that configuration least.  Things are just too different from one of your turns to the next to have very much control.  I like it with two or three much better.

I play with the living rules available in the Files here on BGG because they give the players more control and avoid some of the potentially game-stalling situations that could occur in the original rules.  I also highly recommend aaargh_ink's player aid (in the Files section as well).

In playtest. A total rules rewrite, with completely different components - but still every feature & segment recognisable from the previous editions. 

I wasn't too keen at first, since it looked to be slimming down the design too far, but things are progressing nicely now!

UPDATE: The released game is simpler than American Megafauna, faster in play. As a result, it lacks the detail of American Megafauna, and feels more game and less simulation. One real problem is the lack of Biomes in the starting setup.

after one play, where i did not have any choices, did not have one animal live more than one turn, never was able to have more than two animals on the board EVER, until the final turn, and ended the game with three victory points to the leaders thirty something, i can truthfully say that this is a game that doesn't work.  yuck.  i really wanted to like it too.

note: after another play, i like it a lot more, and not just because i did better -- i didn't really.  just going into the game with the expectation to die constantly, made me enjoy the process more.  it's just that kind of game.

3/12/2012 -- The game only really came together after our 4th game, by which time we realized it's plainly a snoozer.  All of your decisions are made with the knowledge that severe climate change, catastrophes, immigrant species, et al can wipe you out in the blink of an eye.  There are a lot of interesting points of view in this game, and, as food for thought, it's remarkably rich.  Plus, watching a simulation of the last few hundred million years of evolution transpire in an hour or two is compelling.  As a game, however, it's just not that interesting beyond the first few go-rounds.  If you're looking for the next High Frontier (as I suppose I was), this isn't it.

3/2/2012 -- Hmmmm.....1.5 games in the bag so far and we'll definitely be playing again.  We had a lot of trouble getting highly-needed M Roadrunner DNA, and were using the out-of-the-box instructions without the new Roadrunner Club optional rule.  Definitely get the latest rules before attempting this one.

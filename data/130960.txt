GAME: Triumph & Tragedy
RANK: 428

RATING: 7
In many respects, this follows and fills the "standard block wargame" in my collection. A model of pre/during war Europe, what I find I really enjoy about the game is it is less simulation and more sandbox; you can build the bomb, take over places with a military, or out produce everyone for the win. I've seen games which sort of recreated the war, and I've had a game where the Nazis were the only peaceful group even through 1943...

One of the things that I think helps drive the game forward in terms of pacing is that there is a standard kickstart (the initial hand draw and massive card deployment the first turn) and then there is a general sorting out; you try and achieve victory through economic/diplomatic jockeying first and as time passes, the game turns and becomes a war game. It's that turn that is fascinating as it occurs at different times and in different ways. It could be that you run late into the game and it finally turns, it could be in 1938... Fundamentally you have two "games" in terms of objectives/priorities/etc and it's a matter of determining when to abandon ship on one and focus on the other that makes this interesting. It works in terms of modeling that, almost emotional, thinking in the lead up to WW2, and it works in regards to giving players something to chew on (as my spouse and a friend both said; it's not a complicated game to learn, it's a complicated game to figure out how to do well in). That fluid nature of how things are in terms of VoN or DoW or production usage and the pressure that exerts on other players is really well done. It's bitter sweet though (see below).

On the outset, one of the few things I don't like about the game is that it takes ages to really play out. I've yet to see a game go past 1943 and take less than 5 hours. I think part of that is inexperience, but part of it is there is just so much stuff you can mess with and you sort of get bogged down with combat. Second, I think sort of knowing that you're going to make that switch in the model, it becomes less of a surprise; you can start seeing the writing on the wall and move on to military. Granted, that's the model of the time (and it does succeed at that), but that it doesn't seem to play out differently in the grand scheme is unfortunately. Where I think there is some variance is in when you make the jump to military and how much you pursue each victory condition as a hedge, especially to be successful, you have to make that plan at the beginning of the game.  

Rather interested if the short game is any better, and how the C3i scenarios play out.

This, this [i]game,[/i] is like nothing else out there.

I have described it as a game about the WWII era, not a game about WWII. It is a sandbox game, open to any and all developments. It is masterful at creating the tension and fear present in the era. There is no guarantee that the game will follow history, or even devolve into a war.

Is it historical? Not in the strictest sense of the word. What it is is a great game that won't ever play the same twice. I can't wait to get my own copy!

RATING: 9
An excellent 3-player strategy game about the struggle for power between Axis, Soviet Union and the Allied countries. Simple in rules for the nature of the game but I'd prefer it to be a bit more quick to play or have some more late scenarios when not having much time to spend. I would also like it to have some more cards for technologies or some events even fictionary for it to have more flavour. Consider it if you like a 3-player only game that plays in about 4-5+ hours

Basically two games in one. First diplomacy and later war. Interesting setting between three powers where the game can evolve differently in separate games.

This is not an ETO and possibly I hoped it would be. I wanted the maneuvering before the outbreak of war to deliver a more satisfying experience. The two games I have played have been a little anti-climatic. Still, a good game but not, in my opinion, a great game.

This is a good game, and it's in a rare spot, being a three player wargame.  The mechanics of moving countries into your sphere of influence is very well done, and the balance between the players is well done.... but in both games I've played, there's really not much point to Britain and the USSR coming to blows.  That's just not much fun as the German player, which I've now had to be twice.

Wow. Simple, but not simplistic. Multiple ways to win. A truly masterfully strung 3-player game. Every game so far has been fun and comparatively fast for 10 years of WWII era diplomatic-economic-military struggle. Oozes with tension and hard choices.

Tentative Rating after one play:

This seems to be the rare game that melds grand strategic economics, diplomacy and military affairs into a tight, playable package. The dual uses of the cards and the industrial might needed to purchase them, give the players interesting (and agonizing) decisions over what objectives to pursue and how to achieve them. Want to win key resource nodes through political rather than military means? Want to build a military that's ponderous but tough or one that's fast but fragile? It's up to the players. Simple mechanics like peace dividends and using the lowest of the resources/industry/population score for VP's adds interesting wrinkles into the decision making process.

Some may be bothered by the level of abstraction or lack of historical scripting, but it allows for a game that both focuses on the big picture and is actually playable in a reasonable length of time (5 hours at most). Triumph is exactly the kind of game that I find myself drawn to these days. Highly recommended.

RATING: N/A
This is a game with a brilliant mashup of mechanics that really work with the various aspects of the theme - war, industry & diplomacy. But my oh my is it LONG.  Not so much an issue in most cases if you like epicness on your table.  However, if you are going to play competitively you really need to make certain that you have players with full knowledge of the rules.  You don't want to be 5 hours into the game and have a rookie making a bonehead play and ultimately throwing the game into a death spiral.   The game is susceptible to unforgiving & unrecoverable mistakes.  And such is the nature of war, but flushing the game town the toilet after 5 hours is very unsatisfying.  But again, lots of brilliant mechanisms.  Would love to see if an operational level version could be condensed to a reasonable length.

Initial Impression: This game comes from one of my favorite designers and once again he hasn't failed to impress me. GMT has done an outstanding job producing the game, although I would have opted for a mounted board, and the board and cards are clear and functional. The game is light on rules and chrome but chocked full of interesting decisions. The asymmetry of the 3 major powers keeps things exciting and alliances must be formed in order to keep balance between the players. I love the multipurpose cards, forcing you to make difficult decisions about overall strategy. Combat is the typical bucket of dice but seems to work well for this game. Luckily, combat is only one of the avenues to winning the game. The game flows very quickly, especially in the early stages and doesn't overstay its welcome. I can see this game being played to completion during weeknight gaming sessions.

RATING: 10
First impression is that this game strikes a good balance between history, alternative outcomes, and reasonable game play. For an ETO it is fairly easy to learn and offers plenty of challenges. If you are going to refight WWII each time I say make it easier, faster, and vary the possible outcomes.

Update: 
This is a game were turn order and watching your opponent builds is important. You have to strike at the right time using surprise, technology, or your idea as to the opponent's strength to get the edge. There are serious repercussions for going to war so you have to be prepared to maximize your chances of success. I'm thoroughly enjoying it and I'm someone who prefers 2 player games. The more you understand the game the better it gets. I now fully appreciate the power of diplomacy but also the value of the operational side of those cards. Every card play becomes a calculation of multiple interests and threats.

RATING: 8.3
Wonderful game - a hybrid game that takes some modern Euro multi use card features and blends it with a Columbia style block war game to cover all the 2nd world war and a few years before.  Its sandbox-y and allows exploration of ahistorical scenarios.  A bit long for my tastes but does a really good job of shortening and streamlining 10 years into a managable amount of time.  One critisism is that a bad decision can be more critical than a good one, seeing a mistake (inadequate defense of a capital, leaving supply lines vulnerable to blockade) can be punished a lot - this leads to a tense game but could lead to players thinking a long time and bogging it down.  Only solo-ed it so far, looking to get it to the table soon.

Very slick, tight and well-developped design. Plays in about 4 hours. Nice three-players interaction.

Too a-historical for me (Soviets taking Delhi, really?, Denmark as a viable foothold for the anglo-allied army?) and a "bucket of dice" combat system which I dislike.

But it can work well for many and I am not taking the position that this is a bad game, it is on the borderlines of what I like though.

My preferences, depending on the crowd, are mostly heavy Euros and Economic games. War games are not really in my wheelhouse because of the payoff versus rules complexity and sometimes length of play; so I approach GMT games and war games in general with some trepidation. 

That said; Triumph and Tragedy is unlike most war games in that it is elegant and streamlined. The length of play versus the payoff is excellent. It could overstay it's welcome with some Euro-gamers, but to me, it is an engaging experience that lasts the right amount of time. The game design is innovative and fresh and the historicity/alt-history where you are replaying WW2 has a wonderful sense of narrative.

There is a sense of tension and angst throughout the game in keeping each other in check; at least until war breaks out. Then, it becomes more of a dice fest and a bit fiddly managing the blocks. That said, it doesn't detract from the overall experience and by that time the game is almost over anyways. 

All in all, this is an excellent title that merits it's accolades and exploration.

Really nice block game that allows players to enjoy trying to grow influence and also a sort of economy for their war machines.

Germany is very powerful Britain and Russia, not so much.

It uses cards to do various things like command units, buy technology etc.  The economies grown by influencing other smaller countries grown your hand count which allow for more unit growth and actions etc.

As a play tester I have had countless hours of fun. I love being able to get together with two other friends and battle it out. I have tried using the same strategy twice but the results have never been the same, it has incredible playability.

Enjoy!

Very nice game in a sandbox environment.
Has mechanics that makes every round very intense as you try to see what the other players are up to.
Like the hidden information that you have in the block system. Always a suspense to see what will happen when you do attack. Also the cards in the game relies on some luck and your ability to adapt what you have to what you need to do.

A very good game.

RATING: 8
Very FUN game. At least until war breaks out (which can
get slightly tedious and annoying with buckets of dice combat and
coping with those damned wooden blocks.
The good news is though, war may not last that long - the
game may be vulnerable to a 'quick stab' ending.

The decisions of the production: technology, diplomacy, 
command control, and military units are all bound together
in a design that is not deterministic, yet still gives
outstanding choices.
The economic system is a brilliant take on the WiF one
(factories and resources) by adding a third component -
the population base for the production, and making 
resources freely available, if not at war. 

Indeed, the attractiveness of peace is one of the most
appealing features of this game. It enables the three player
dynamic, in conjunction with the victory system, to 
fall out in very different ways than most games.

As to historical believability of the 'what if', I fear
the game may get a bad rap. The big picture is more 
believable than say Empires in Arms, for example. It's
just that there are nagging little things (like hidden
fleets, armies ect), that make it hard to swallow. But,
the three player dynamic would be destroyed, if you knew 
what was facing you, and that dynamic is perhaps the
best feature in this whole package.

RATING: 10
Hard to rate this, but really enjoyed the first game so provisional 8. Fast playing, elegant, clever streamlined, intuitive systems and lots of fun. Obviously wacky outcomes are the norm. so play it for what it is and don't expect an accurate military simulation of the time. Looking forward to see how game holds up to repeated playings and with 2nd edition fixes when we get chance.

Update: Second playing as Germany was even better. I now feel compelled to give this game a 10. In the past, one of my frustrations was not having that "go to" game of WW2 that hit the spot between time, fun, decision making/skill and simulation. All the games over the years have either gone for the detailed recreation ( the only one of these was World in Flames that I enjoyed and was excellent game ) or, on the other end of the spectrum, games like Axis and Allies were fun but essentially just glorified Risk and were lacking as a game with little to think about - chuck them in and chuck the dice. I feel T and T is a triumph in games design in being the first game IMHO that finds common ground between these 2 poles and delivers a fast, fun and action packed experience in almost an evening of gaming. There is a lot of game here to explore and strategies/tactics to consider. I love the various mechanisms, including the Fog of War and the way in which the game eliminates downtime which has been a constant problem with games of this genre. Essentially you getting that big WW2 feeling of running a major power with all the decision making involved without having to commit to a few weeks of gaming and huge amounts of rules and other time investment. Highly recommended, can see this game having lots of mileage with our group.

Regarding the strength of a 1936-38 Western Rush for Germany, this is a strong strategy and as the West you need to watch for it. If the Germans are spending a lot of money on steps right out of the box, you need to make sure you're matching their investment with forts in London and Paris. If the Germans are gunning for you, you're going to lose one of the two capitals, but you should be able to hold one - the Germans are not going to be able to build both the fleets AND the armies required to blitz both. As long as the Soviets jump in to make sure the Germans don't cruise to an easy victory, you should be able to make a game of it. Playing the West is hard because you are definitely vulnerable early and playing defense before 1939 will be hard. But this strikes me as historical.
---
I'm at the point with Craig Besinque's games that everything he's done has just been *so* good, that whenever I try something new I'm actually a bit nervous about whether he can possibly keep it up, or if this is going to be the game that's just pretty good.

But he's still on a roll with Triumph & Tragedy. I really enjoyed playing this and found it as engaging as anything I've played in the past few years. For a game of this type, it's quite fast-playing, elegant, and streamlined, creating a ton of great historical flavor with little fuss. I love the early game, with the jockeying for position in Europe as you head towards general war, ratcheting up the tension. Once war breaks out, the rules are simple but the command & technology cards nicely encapsulate a lot of nuance. It should be said too, it's possible that WWII may never break out! It's possible to play an entirely non-military game. However, the incentives of the game are strongly skewed towards war. The blocks tend to make wargamers conservative and gunshy, but at some point around 1939 or 1940 it becomes obvious that if peace prevails, one player is going to win, and the only answer is military action.

I've seen some complaints about the historicity of the game, but I actually find Triumph & Tragedy amongst the most historically interesting and evocative games on this period that I've played. Read the designer's notes for his comments on what he was trying to achieve. The political situation was quite fluid in Europe between the wars, and T&T embraces this in a really elegant and sensible way, giving you a wide variety of possible ways things can play out that feel within the realm of historical possibility; weird outcomes like Turkey jumping in with both feet (not uncommon in Vicotry in Europe) will be suitably hard to achieve, but there is a wide range of outcomes for smaller countries like Poland, Rumania, etc. This is a much better system than most games on the topic take, which tends to be to assume the historical specifics then add crazy alt-history variants on top of it (see Totaler Krieg, Third Reich). By recognizing the situation in Europe was actually much more fluid than most games allow, and building the design around that, T&T makes for an extremely interesting and historically engrossing narrative.

The advertised playing time of 4-6 hours seems about right. If the game goes the distance (10 turns), it'll take 6-ish hours, but early auto-victories seem significantly easier to achieve here than in most WWII games, so it seems like you'll be more likely to see an early win.

Anyway, this was a great game, the most imaginative and successful take on this genre of game I've ever played, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Britain gets Turkey to assault the USSR because the West and the USSR are losing the war with Germany?  WTF?  The victory conditions motivate just silly behavior; I had every reason to walk into India even though we were losing militarily to Germany.  Definitely a cartoonish game.  The military aspect of this game is not very good, but the initial diplomacy phase is reasonably interesting.   Also, as someone else said, playing the game conveys zero sense of leading the ideologies depicted.  Short version: I don't like pasted on themes.

Three player, asymmetric WWII game, beautiful map (2nd edition has a proper board). Clever mechanics, agonizing choices and several paths to victory. A way more intelligent, less scripted version of Allies and Axis. I enjoy the cut and thrust of the early diplomatic card play much more than the rather ponderous blocks wargame which takes over after three or four turns but overall I think this is a fascinating game.

Played as Germany (almost made the bomb before the Soviets invaded in 1940) and then as the Soviets (I was invaded and defeated by Germany in 1941).

Buy stuff including tech/industry cards and politics/operations cards and military might. Your allowance is the lowest of your population, your industry, or - if you are at war, your natural resources, too. Spend cards on politics in a Twilight Struggle-y back and forth to win resources, population, and - with persistence - military. Then spend the leftover cards on Spring, Summer, and Fall (and Winter for the Sovs) operations. Rinse, repeat.

Sounds simple enough, but the board is just so darned big! And the resources so tight! And the enemies so many (two is plenty).

I was quite taken with the way this game models the dynamics of the buildup and execution of the war without dictating the history through special rules. It is all about space, and time, and stuff.

All around tasty stuff. I'm starting it at a very optimistic 9. It might go down, but, given how rarely I'm going to play it, I don't want to skimp on my initial rating. And who knows, there is enough here that it might go up...

:tobacco: :( :what: :D Haven't been able to get through a full game yet, but I'm getting this surrounded so here's the quick takes:

- My gold standard for three-player wargames is Maria. This is not quite at that level. But it's not far off, and it could get there.

- Two interlocking subgames. The military side is grand strategy with only the broadest of strokes with regard to military maneuvering; may be a minus for some folks but works for me. Likewise the diplomatic game is a pretty straightforward card game with significant press-your-luck elements.

- Not much historicity to be found in either subgame; a run of good cards can sweep a previously neutral state (even, say Turkey or Persia) solidly into your camp with a minimum of fuss. Battles are standard block-game dicefests. All of this is in the service of design for effect, minimal rules overhead, and reduced play time. How you felt about GMT's Napoleonic Wars (and its drastic diplomatic and military reverses) will speak volumes about your reaction to this one. Personally, I don't mind much, but the extent to which, say, the Axis taking over much of Central Europe via a combination of diplomatic pressure and neutrality violations galvanizes the other small states of Europe is partly a matter of the luck of the draw.

- On the other hand, the mechanical simplicity of the rules can lead to some authentic pre-WWII disputes (or analagous situations) coming together in a fairly historical manner as an emergent condition of the rules as written, which is a neat trick.

- We don't have a good sense (yet) of which players need to be contained, and how quickly they need to be contained. In my last game, I as the UK let the Hun run wild over much of the continent before declaring war; I probably should have done this sooner. (But I needed to rebuild, badly -- a game that gives you a degree of sympathy for the choice Chamberlain made at Munich is probably a good game indeed.) Diplomacy has been very restrained in our first couple of learning games, which I think is a knock-on of our lack of experience. Future games will teach us to have a stronger sense of where the red lines are that our rivals dare not cross.

- I'm a bit disappointed by the physical presentation; I get why there's no mounted board (the game's already expensive and heavy and it's a first edition that could end up being a hit and could end up being a flop) but I don't have to like it, and moreover I don't like the cardstock map; it just strikes me as an unsatisfactory everyone-gets-to-take-home-half-a-baby middle ground between paper and a mounted board. Graphically, it's not up to the standard set by Virgin Queen or the Empire of the Sun reprint. The cards are sturdy but graphically a bit dull. The blocks are nice, though, and practical, and I appreciated the gesture of providing extra blocks and labels for all factions. The rules are OK, but just OK -- could have used a once-over from a fresh pair of eyes. Functional as a reference but not on the level of some of the better rulebooks from the same publisher, and it could have used a bit more of an overview of a typical turn prior to dealing with the edge cases.

- All in all, it's a trip. It's got a funky beat and I can bug out to it. It's fundamentally a beer and pretzels wargame but it works at that level without being lobotomized or crazy unrealistic. It can potentially get a bit draggy if A and B decide to declare all-out war in '37 while C remains on the sidelines, but overall the game's been pretty sprightly so far.

One of the best wargames I've ever played.  The design is so elegant and can be taught in minutes.  Yet, though the rules are light, the system is seriously robust, taking into account a huge range of situations effortlessly.  

But, more important than that, the game get's the feel of the 1930s right. T&T understands that WW2 was a war shaped by a highly liquid geopolitical situation.

Update: 
Six plays in.  Still getting better.

Solid mechanics, but rather chaotic and shallow on the historical aspects, the game is very cartoony as somebody here said. I strongly dislike free-for-all 3+ player games like this that mostly reduce to interplayer diplomacy and trying to look weak in order to convince people not to attack you. If you don't mind that, the game may be a lot better. Might work well with 2 players, but didn't try yet. Rating is based on a single play.

A couple plays in, this is hard to rate. It's a fun game, but it is WAY more chaotic and ahistorical than I thought it was going to be. It's like [i]Days of Decision[/i] meets [i]Axis & Allies[/i], with blocks, or something. I understand that it's a sandbox, and that variation is good, but I guess I still expected some semblance of realism. Nope. Still, it can still be an enjoyable game, as you get to invest in research, diplomacy and military units as you see fit.

However, even if you are happy to "just enjoy it for what it is", the game has some major balance problems. With even just a single game under my belt it became horribly apparent that a 1936/1937 knockout of France and/or England is the best play for the Axis and, short of some bad die rolling, is more likely to succeed than not. To wit, a healthy chunk of the 2nd edition rules update discussion revolves around nerfing an early Sea Lion by the Axis. It's just too silly.

That said, if you can get past this and just play for fun rather than for victory, you can have a good time. I have a hard time overlooking such glaring screwups in play balance, however. At 3 hours I could forgive it. At 6 hours, not so much. For that playing time I'd like something with a bit more depth.

I guess the good news is that the 2nd edition will fix the balance issues, but will also alter the map, so now I have to buy an upgrade kit for a game that I just bought 6 months ago. Ugh. I suppose it's easy enough to add some house rules at least.

UPDATE: I tried the second edition. Yes, they did make some tweaks to somewhat reduce the odds of an early SeaLion, but it's still a major problem as Michael Tan has confirmed. And, even ignoring the balance issues, overall there's just a lot of silliness. Granted, it can be FUN silliness, but it's still pretty much no deeper than [i]Axis & Allies[/i]. At least it's shorter, though.

Three of the gamers at Academy Games played two games of this great title as soon as it came to me.  We agreed the first part (before war breaks out) is brilliant, and we'd rate that a ten. After war started, though, the game bogs down into typical wargame pacing, which is a problem for a three-player game: "While you two fight it out in the North Atlantic / Poland, I'll go for a walk / regrout the bathroom."

Simply put, this is the best 3-player wargame that exists. I challenge anyone to show me a better 3 player game. A game about WWII where WWII as we know it may or may not happen? The Soviet Union could end up in a war with the Allies? Germany could take a diplomatic approach to conquering Europe, or secretly build up the Kriegsmarine to the surprise of the Allies?  Buy it.

''I have here in my hand an undertaking, signed by Mr Stalin himself, whereby the Soviet Union undertakes to refrain from any further territorial ambitions in Central Europe. Herr Hitler was present in person at the meeting, and agreed that our aims are in concordance with those of the German Reich, for peace in our time in Europe.''
Neville Chamberlain, Fall 1941


'God bless Craig Besinque' was my first thought as I opened the box. I don't know about you, but I was genuinely heartened to see an ampersand in a product about WWII, rather than the interminable 'of.' 'Of.' I'm sick of that banality. Band Of Brothers. Call Of Duty. Clash Of Clans. X Of Y. N Of Zero. Verb Of Noun. So it makes a pleasant change to see an ampersand in a title, A&A notwithstanding.

I will admit now that I've been quietly excited about this one for a while, but my thoughts remain objective. The contents of the box are rather nice, if mildly unspectacular. The map is clear and colourful and of a durable stock, the cards are very nicely done and again of decent quality, and the wooden blocks are large enough and clear in their markings - and for me, as a sufferer of Daltonism, that is a massive boon. Three decent player aids, a playbook and a rulebook printed to the usual GMT quality. The chits are a little small and underwhelming, but this is not a counter-heavy game and so I don't mind that at all. The box itself isn't quite up to the usual GMT high quality, but I accept that tradeoffs must be made to keep block games affordable. Nonetheless, the overall impression is very positive.

The game is almost certainly the best grand strategy boardgame I've ever played. There. I've said it. That is my impression, and I will not be offended if you choose to stop reading now. It's all here, it really really is. Politics, intrigue, research, failures and successes, paranoia of your rival's intentions, everything. Is that a feint into Rumania, or a precursor to jumping off into Southern Europe? If I order them to back down, do I have the power to back up my threats? Is that a navy on patrol or is he redeploying overseas?

It is a simple and straightforward game, deepened by emergent gameplay. The whole rulebook is about 15 pages and that covers more-or-less every situation that may arise. Contrast this with other games I have where the rules run to 40-50 pages and still don't cover it all. The very best games are simple but deceptively deep and allow the players to, you know, actually play the game rather than battle their way through the designer's intentions, guided every step of the way. This is a straightforward system, honed over years of testing, and has a succinct and clearly (beautifully) written rulebook and playguide.

This is, crucially, NOT a wargame in anything other than the loosest sense. The designer makes no claims otherwise, and as such this is an adequate consideration of the military activity of the period. This simple but key fact allowed me to sell it to my group who have been thoroughly turned off 'pure' wargames over the past few months, and they enjoyed it - or if they didn't, they lied to my face very convincingly. Don't buy if you're after a wargame of the period, but if you've any interest in politics and alternative outcomes this is a must-buy. I've been lucky to have played a lot of truly brilliant games in the past 12 months - this is the best of the lot, and I don't say that lightly.

Disclaimer here: I have played only one game so far to completion. Thanks to time constraints in the first instance, and the dual machinations of a fire alarm followed by a friend's cat on the table, it has only been finished once. Cats, the bane of the hobby. Why they love boardgames like catnip is beyond me, and I am certain my own moggy will one day die a horrible cardboardy death (I still anxiously consider the animal's furballs for traces of the German 18th Army from Paths of Glory, my very own Missing Legion). The completed game resulted, remarkably, in Allied victory through Atom Bomb development in 1944 whilst the Axis and USSR battered at one another, so it was reasonably plausible.

Overall? Not bad. Not half bad at all. This one will be seeing a lot of table time in the coming months and years, and it is definitely going to scratch my alt-WW2 itch nicely until Hearts of Iron 4 arrives. Two thumbs way-way up indeed.

(tentative rating after one play).  I can appreciate that this meets the need for a 3-p block game.   However, we spent most of our time playing cards for influence and technology.  That part of the game works well and is easy to understand.   The actual warfare and combat elements never really emerged in our play, and that seems odd for a WW2 title.   Game play was about 2.5 hours and the game ended about 2/3 of the way through the timeline due to factory, peace, and technology VPs.   A hundred blocks on the board, almost none of which were used.   Worth another look.

Deserves most of its plaudits, a simple ETO block game with a rather clever and rules efficient card driven diplomacy/research/economic engine attached. The main tension is how to split your resources and the way most cards have two uses, e.g. technology or industrial expansion. This constantly poses you with tough trade offs. I have one reservation, it seems that the best route for Germany is the historical one for the 1930s, perhaps this is good simulation but in a blank canvas alt history type game i'd like more room for weirdness. I might be overstating this however with only one game down.

Nice looking game...And, sort of a fun game. But, a tragedy to call this WWII. It suffers from being too generic and having too many luck-based mechanics. Combat especially is too luck-based. Since there are no quality differences between nationalities or even among their own units. One Russian 3 pip Armored Army is as good and the same as any Italian or German 3 pip Armored Army in 1935 to 1945. Other than the chance of collecting 2 cards of the same type that give each of the sides combat, movement, or range bonuses. Once again, all tech cards are generic and the Russians can get Jet aircraft or Nuclear technology by 2 cards just like the Germans can. Which, is luck again. Air and even Naval units are miss-construed for combat and mechanics in addition to them both should be taking longer to build. Overall, the German Army is under strength especially early in the War. And, has a very hard time ramping up their Army and invading or controlling minors as it historically did. Austria being under German control is particularly underrated. Though, wacky things can happen like in one game played the Germans had 7 aircraft carrier pips without the Allies or Russians knowing it until combat happened. Overall, there just never seems to be enough happening when Nations are at War. As the game progresses it mostly feels like it is going slower in motion. Needs a number of house rules including having quality differences of units and Nationalities. How the cards are drawn. Needs changes to Air and Naval units in how they work and get built. And, political prerequisites and how the cards work for each Nationality. It could have been much better than it is.

2016-04-20 : In 1982 we played Third Reich and loved it. Today after playing this, the search for the ultimate replacement for 3R has ended. This game is chock full of meaningful strategic choices and alternative history exploration in an elegant, flowing design. Grand strategy at its best. A winner. Waiting for the second edition with the mounted map.
2016-09-27 : 4th game and after 3 consecutive wins by the Germans (Kris) the unspoken strategy was that Operation KKK - Operation Krush Kris Kaputt - was on.. The rush to Berlin ended with Germany shattered but a victor was hard to decide as it would all depend on which front Germany would put up its final defense and that's the kind of kingmaking we don't particularly enjoyed so we called the game an Allied victory over Germany.

This is two different games blended in one.  The diplomatic card, pre-war game at the beginning is fun enough, but are used to build armies and factories.  Later the game switches to an A&A type game, with static fronts resembling WW1.  The 1st edition had game balance issues (Soviets favoured to win), whilst the West is tedious and difficult due to many rules exceptions.  All Europe likely to become embroiled involved in the war (Turkey, Spain, Sweden, Portugal), which I find too unrealistic, even in an alt-hist game.

Would recommend either a political 30s game or else a CG WW2 block game instead.

RATING: 7
A great game; requires a balance of industry, diplomacy, operations, military development, espionage and open war.  All the mechanics are simple and fit well together.  There are no rules driving a WW2 situation, however the situation gives the players the risks and rewards the countries faced in the 1930s and 1940s.  Peace flows into war seamlessly, and with repercussions.  Not a good time for small neutral countries!...unless they become allied with a major power.  There is a realistic feel to the alliances that develop with non player countries through card play.

RATING: 8
Took me a few plays but I’m a big fan of this game now. At first, I was put off by the a-historicity in play here. But it’s totally required to make this a playable game and not simply an historical recreation whereby Germany eventually gets divided and it’s just a race to see which allied power wins. There are enough of those games. Put this in a fantasy setting and it’d be more clear as to how triangulated the game really is. The West and the Soviets need to mess with each other at least politically if not actually fighting in India (seen it), Turkey (seen it), or Scandanavia (yet to see it).

What makes the game particularly fun is starting it in 1936 and giving players the option of spending several full turns (of this 10-turn game) playing a political game vs simply building up armies. The hook of the game is that you choose to spend production points on 
	building units, 
	taking factory cards to boost production and build techs, or
	taking action/political cards to either activate your forces or take over neutral countries with influence instead of force and converting their units to yours. 

The choices are delicious and regardless of how much you boost production, you never have enough points to spend.

Right there you have a mini-game of “will Germany build up units early for a quick strike in France or will they play the long game and go for peaceful control of satellite nations first? Does Britain/Russia need to build up for a Sea Lion/Barbarossa or do they have time to boost their production and/or thwart Germany’s political ambitions? What techs is he pursuing over there?” The techs offer different types of air/land/sea advantages depending on what your primary strategy is. Heck, as a longshot play you can even try for a win via building The Bomb.  

Make no mistake, these early rounds provide the framework for how the rest of the game will play out and yet there is no best way to go about it. It’s all triangulated so well that players need to react to each other and balance one another. As in any 3P game, there are times to smash your frenemy and times to let them recover so they can go get the other guy. 

The rules overhead is remarkably light for a game of this scale. We don’t have our noses in the rulebook much which is nice. As a word of caution I’ll say that there is a good dose of luck in play here. Of course, like any wargame you have the dice, but you’re pulling cards for production points, political control, and activating your forces [i]including turn order[/i]. 

Card draws can be wonderfully on time or frustrating. In my group’s only win by Germany so far, I had fantastic luck at gaining the Low Countries, Sweden, Poland, and Rumania as satellite neutrals via influence (and about 15 steps of units for free) and always seemed to have the right turn order/action card at the right moment. With that play as evidence, I expect my group to play that way for a while until someone comes up with a better counter which will lead to another counter and so on. 

I do wish the game went a little faster as it takes my group a good 6 hours+ to finish a game. Who's playing this in 4 hours?!

There's nothing like it. 

Relatively small rules overhead outlines a sandbox that proves to be both historically plausible and narratively palpable. Lots of what if scenarios are open to the players: what if Germany never attacked Poland? France? What if Russia went to war with the Allies? What if Turkey was occupied by the British? What if the US entered the war 2 years early? Or two years late? 
Brilliant deep but simple diplomacy system. Lots of tension between maintaining defense and working towards mobilizing your army while also struggling to build industry and extend diplomatically. Each move you make gives more reason for your would be opponents to strike before it's too late.

Note: I'm the developer for T&T.


During the fall of 2013 I went searching throughout BGG for a ww2 era grand strategy game that would be easy to teach, fast playing and just plain fun. Something vaguely reminiscent of Axis and Allies but just plain better, (way!) deeper and well... more! I needed to be able to play it with non-wargamers and wargamers alike and have both of them think it's their kind of game. I looked and looked and didn't really find what I was looking for until I saw Craig Besinque asking for playtest volunteers for his upcoming Triumph and Tragedy. I thought, "Why not? I can at least get a look at it."

 I jumped in with both feet and realized that this was the game I had been looking for all along. It met all my requirements but also has this great diplomacy aspect along with a really elegant production system that folds in very cleanly and thematically with the war-game part of the game. It's hard to describe but trust me, the first time you play as the Axis, you'll immediately understand that the decision to go to War is not to be taken lightly; there are true consequences and yet you'll want to do it anyway! What's more, T&T is a three player game, a situation I'm hit with a good deal of the time. I also love the openness of the game. The Axis can invade America, the Americans can arrive early or not at all, the Soviets can conquer London and yes the Axis can invade India, and so much more. It's all possible. I can confidently say that no two games will ever play out the same. And that's awesome!

Anyway, I could go on and on but the point is, I loved this game so much that I not only joined the playtest group but also became the volunteer developer for Triumph and Tragedy and put together the vassal module to boot. Since I'm not making a dime off this game I feel it's okay for me to give you my honest rating, but if you disagree feel free to ignore my rating. But whatever you do, don't ignore this game! It's great. :)

This one has a lot going for it. I like the  stream-lined technology, a solid three-player interaction, and an original but simple diplomacy system. Also, the game I originally feared was going to be about the opposing "ideologies" of the three faction with "the West" represented by capitalism instead of democracy. Which is odd since the Fascists practiced capitalism as well. This is not the final product and I am pretty happy about that. 

But yikes, combat is a disaster.

For one, the historical ebb and flow of the war is impossible. You cannot blitzkrieg the west because each phase you move and then fight. There will be no six week campaign, as you will spend months mopping up Belgium. Also, you only ever fight one round of combat and considering the relatively low hit values, you will not destroy much. The real stinker though is the rigid border limits. Why do block games do this? The defender is already favored by firing first.

All in all, the game will never replicate Germany's success in 1940 and 1941. If you launch Barbarossa, the world will yawn.

Some might say T&T was never advertised as anything else but an abstracted game with a light World War II feel and I get that. I own games like that. Yet, history  must at least be possible. Here it is actually impossible.

And yet, this is still a better game than Victory in Europe which makes me incredibly sad. At this point I might just stick with Rise and Decline of the Third Reich. So many disappointments in this field of gaming.

The system would be PERFECT for World War I. Maybe I should see the game as just that, a hypothetical experience, a what-if. In that spirit I will see about fixing the combat. I am getting weary of looking and failing to play a great game in this genre.

UPDATE: The more I thought about the more I do not like it. Fare thee well!

Components: good components but for the board, too thin but it has its charm
Complex: not hard to learn for what it is
Weight: heavy

Opinion: is hard to find a 3 player game where everything is so well balanced, and not another game where the winner will be the one out of the conflict. I love the theme on the game, you start on 1939 but there is no need to start the II World War, as you can win with an economic victory or a technological one.
Regarding the mechanic, is a card driven game with block, 2 aspects I like in these kind of games. Develop your Power with Industry, influence and war while take a look at what the rest are doing.
Just can say that the game is amazing

Have to lower a bit the rating, still thinking the game is amazing, nevertheless, what I like most in the game is the diplomacy phase, and, to be honest, this is almost non existent since turn 2, more or less (all neutral countries are on arms, or already occupied). Yes, this is not exactly a flaw, but is my favorite phase of the game

I have a soft spot for games that merge economic, military, and political (see Senji), and this is definitely the playable wargame that has it all. A brilliant three-player design. I have some concerns (still) about Axis balance, but it doesn't seem inevitable that it's West and Soviets vs. Axis.
It's a shame that this gem is being overshadowed by the vastly inferior (and admittedly not terribly similar) Churchill.

What a feat!
Craig Besinque should get a medal for this one. This is an instant classic within our niche.
Creating a game that spans the whole european 2nd WW + the build up, as a balnced three player game, with proper altnerate winning conditions, with such little overhead on rules..
Many have tried this in the last years, where many games became shorter due to time restrictions and a need for shorter playtime, but almost all have failed.
One can only phantom how much work must've been poured into this one..
The only quibble i have are the mediocre GMT components. As cheap as usual, wich is a shame for this kind of game.

Played a few times. Thumbs up. Elegant, simple fun. Very good intro wargame. Yeah, it lacks historical flavor, dynamics, beloved chrome, etc that we all love with WW2 games. But, it's beer & pretzels Friday nite fun. Been a 1st MN fav since it came out this summer.

I'm a playtester who's worked with Craig on this design for two decades (please see C3i 29 for details).

The three players (Axis, Soviets, and Western Allies) must balance the needs of using diplomacy to bring neutral countries into their sphere of influence, building up their industrial base, researching new technologies, and of course waging war.

The game begins in 1936 with everyone at peace and Nazi Germany having repudiated the Versailles treaty. Each power starts off relatively impoverished in terms of military might, but a quick build up may cause your opponents to unite against you.

There are three ways to win: militarily, economically, and by developing the Atomic Bomb.

One of the most fascinating aspects of this game, to me, is that the second world war does not have to break out! The game can end in 1945 with all nations still at peace!

The game is wide open and anything can happen. Exciting card play allows for major upsets and as in all block games the fog of war is front and center.

Highly recommended game from a renowned and widely acclaimed designer!

A wonderful design where players (The West, Russia, Axis) can re-write European WW2 history.  A great balance between economics, diplomacy and warfare.  Oh, and the A-bomb.  Straight-forward and clean mechanics, but a deep game allowing you to re-write history.  Extremely enjoyable and tense, but if you are ever the prime target of two factions simultaneously it can often feel like being the target of a flabby-arm spanking machine.

Holy cow.  Holy.  Cow.  What a game.  We've gotten this down to where we can play it in 2-3 hours most times (full game); 3-5 is very possible if there's lots of fighting very early and continuing.  But for a game that really feels like grand strategy to play in such a quick time (and so well with 3!) is just amazing.  I've had a streak of playing *nothing* but this game since I got it.  Like 20 times in s a row, playing nothing else, not even WANTING to play anything else.  Puredeadbrilliant.  You buy now!

On a joué au mois de août avec mon chum on était deux.  C'était la première partie mais on a quand même réussi à gobé 90% des rêgle.  

Un peu mélangeant les territoires satellite et les réaction quand on passe dessus.  Le choix de la fin du jeu est bien on est pas obligé de se tapper dessus mais si tu as qqlq forteresses ça bloque pas mal d'attaque.  J'ai commandé l'upgrade kit avec le mounted map.

La partie a duré 4h et on a pas trop gosser sur le brainburning.  Avoir pris notre temps je pense que 5 heures aurait été bien. Comme on dit les faits historiques sont pas trop représenté on fait pas mal ce que l'on veut sans suivre vraiment ce qui s'est passé.  Mon chum a voulu partir un guerre mais comme dit plus haut les forteresse donnent du fils à retorde même à la limite il est plus facile d'aller attaquer les sous capitales car il y a moins de ressources.

Les jets de dés ne donnent pas beaucoup de chance aussi le chiffre à atteindre me semble bas.  

Bonne gestion des ressources mais à un moment donné quand encore une fois les forteresses sont au top on se concentre sur les technologies.  Il devrait y avoir une technologie qui détruit les forteresses mais je pense que ce sont elles qui permettent d'avoir différents chemin pour atteindre son but.

Love the first half of the game, the paranoia, the "friendly" negogiations.

Still very much worth playing for the first half though.

Four plays, and I'm seriously impressed by this from one of the best block wargame designers.

A complex subject s portrayed in a relatively simple and (I hesitate to use the word given its overuse in Euro-game reviews) elegant design. The card and economic systems mesh really well with with the traditional block systems - the game feels very well developed.

It's a three-hander with open gameplay, but the significant early economic advantage of the Axis means they're likely to be the target of diplomatic activity of both the other players in the first few turns at east.

Timing seems critical - when do you hold back, and when do you go all out for the win? Time this right to win.

1st Play -2017-12-29: This was an amazing experience. We took a lunch break and there eas lots of chit chat so it ran to almost 6 hrs but I we all agreed we would have played a second game without pause. It's a fantasitc mix of the block fog of war along with diplomatic CDG driven control in a perfect 3P balance. The ANS warfare rules are easy once you take a minute to let it sink in and there's actually a ton of depth here. Strangely enough we found that our game paralleled historical events almost exactly where the timeline was concerned.

I like the idea of this as a pre-wwII sandbox much like a tiny infany brother doing what [thing=151952]Gathering Storm[/thing] does for [thing=7614]A World At War[/thing].

Can't wait to play again!

I wanted to like this game very much. Unfortunately it does not work for me and my group.

It is like playing fantasy wargame on map of Europe. I am missing any historical setup regarding influence. Like Czechoslovakia ties to France and many other examples which are completely absent and game tries to persuade us that anyone could join alliance with any big power. This creates quite a lot of problems. Germany starts with biggest hand, so it automatically means that it will came strongest from initial diplomatic phase.

I am also very uncomfortable with Italy having more starting blocs than France (did not have France one of biggest armies, although not very effective it is rather strange way how to simulate that).

Even in gameplay there are some things we do not like. Like pining enemy forces in space. Eg. one block can pin huge army in space and that army can evade from field but they cannot engage anyone else meaning that they have wasted season.

Industry is too abstract - so no fear for Russia to move factories behind Ural. Even if you conquest half germany if they do have enough resources in other areas it does not impact their production....

If you take look at above points you will probably realize that I was expecting more historical simulation. Yet T&T is pretty abstract wargame - it was even marketed as such - quick playing not too complex game for 3 players. In this it does great job and it succeeds very much. 

However I was probably expecting too much as Craig B. is one of my most favorite designers. So I was hoping for quick to play game which does simulate WWII properly and provides some options how to alter course or take another path but for my taste it goes too far in this direction. 

Probably another problematic point for me is that I do not see any national characteristics, all powers are basically same with only different starting areas, slightly different starting hands and industry.

My rating is 3 as I do not want to play ever again. However if you do not care for above comments and you want fine conflict game for 3 players which plays in one long afternoon I would probably give something like 7-8.

(First impressions after some solo testing)

Clever mechanics to balance the known and unknown, while keeping it fairly simple. A good and fun three player game, with little incentive to gang up against one player, since you more likely with keep a balance while looking for an opportunity, a breakthrough.

Ok, the game is, as many have commented, somewhat unhistorical. I would however like to comment on some historical "accuracies" as well:

- the main force against lasting German success is the USSR
- USSR is pretty weak at start but will slowly gain power, well reflecting Stalins hesitation to engage against a known enemy of the Slavic people
- U.S. hesitation and limited impact on the European front is well illustrated
- since the U.S. won't have a real impact in most scenarios, the race to harvest easy wins/influence in latter years seems to work pretty well

It's probably possible to find strategies and get cards that allow you to break above particularities about the real WW2.

In a sense it feels awkward to view this as a fun game, a war leaving deep wounds, that still keeps the world in a very sick state. Nevertheless, as a game it is fun.

I've played this twice, both times feeling excited at the start, but then drained and empty at the end. This just doesn't feel like an ideological fight between capitalism, communism, and fascim. Instead it's a standard block game with a WWII "theme" tacked-on. In short, more of a tragedy than a triumph.

Got to playtest an earlier version of this; I like the sound of the changes since then, & am super excited about this (but a little worried about the concept of command cards which can only be used in one season).

2015-07-29: it's here!  Some... minor but surprising production irregularities; many of the blocks are not quite square, and it looks like there was something wrong with the label cutter (jagged/not-straight lines, way off center), so the result is some pretty amateurish looking blocks.  That won't really matter if the gameplay is good, but I was surprised to see this from GMT.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Uncertain after half a game. I like the government and purchase pieces of the game but am uncertain about the conflict aspect. One could play the whole game without ever going to war - eventually, someone will likely declare war to prevent an opponent from winning the political victory. Want to play again, preferably sooner than later so the rules don't just drift away.

This is a really great game. You can easily play the whole WW2 in 5 hours without having the feeling of playing a RISK game. 

There are tons of difficult decisions an the game is a constant what if. During our first game french units disembarked in Denmark with the support of the British fleet and air force. Of course, some mechanics are a bit abstract ad of course you cannot reflect in this game every WW2 operation, but everything feels thematic and well thought.

I really like the setting, very cool!

I don't understand why the fad of completely "Hidden" blocks at this grand-strategic scale (I can't see the difference between fleets, air or ground units?), this is a feature I would prefer to see in tactical games.

I'll most probably play with most of the blocks not hidden most of the time. But it's a very personal choice.

The components could be a tad better, but nothing too bad (the die cut of the stickers on my copy is problematic, use caution when peeling them off; and some of the wooden blocks are not square). The game really needs a mounted board, it's worth it! :)

Very very good rulebook. 

All in all, one heck of an "Elegant" design. Buy it, even if, like me, you are allergic to 3-player Strategic Block Games. :)

My only gripe is that the generic cards make the game feel like a euro that is completely devoid of theme. Maybe a necessary sacrifice to play WW2 in 4 hours or less. If you can look past that, this game is a home run!

A gem.  T&T has a beer and pretzels _feel_, but is much more.  A unique design--more semi-historical than other Western Europe WWII designs.  The West and U.S.S.R. are organically rivals, as opposed to these sides being artificially forced onto the same side and then limited in how they can work together.  The drawback of the game is typical of multi-player wargames.  The game only works well if players are equally competent and ethically are trying to win for themselves.  There is no way to stop one player who wants another player to lose "no matter what"; it breaks the game--but this is no different than other multi-player wargames.  Two-player wargames do not have this problem.

Edit: In the middle of a second solo play. This is the game I wish I had back in college and after college when we had friends in town and we'd end up playing Risk or something. Three player max limits it for that type of situation, but I know we would have played this over and over. My initial impressions are quite high.

Couldn't resist picking this one up. The rules are tight and simple. Haven't played yet, but still have been thinking of this all the time. Seems really sandbox-y (which is great), while still keeping a foot in reality. Cool card based system of diplomatic influence and tech advances. Also, I commend Mr. Besinque for not allowing 'feature creep' or excessive chrome into his design. It seems like a much smarter Axis and Allies (a game I never cared for) type game, with much more in the way of options, and also has both table talk diplomacy and in game mechanics for influence. 

I don't believe Craig Besinque has designed a clunker yet. Really eager to actually play.

If you like ETO games but don't have 20 hours to spare (I'm looking at you Europe Engulfed), then this game is for you. It took the three of us five hours from start to finish.  The game has three main areas: area influence through card play, building units and techs, then movement & combat.  It all works beautifully.  The alternate history that can be made is fun but I suspect it would be difficult to follow a historical path.  I predict there will be a second edition with a mounted map.  And a better box cover - this isn't one of Roger's better works...

Update: My second game as the West was a disaster.  The Axis secretly built a ship radar tech that allowed his ships to fire first.  Then with some hot rolling, he wiped out my Navy and isolated Great Britain. Also, despite playing every USA influence card, the other two players erased them. I never got the U.S. into the war.  With only two resource points and no help from the U.S., I was knocked out of the game.  There was no pressure on the Axis from the Soviet player so it was easy for Germay to build a powerful navy.  Sitting there with nothing to do for 1/3 of the game was not fun.  

T&T is not history in a box because every game will be some bizarre alternate history that doesn't remotely resemble WWII. I don't think WWII can be replicated even if the players tried.  Therefore, this system would work well in a fantasy setting.

Fun: 5/5
You get to feel like commander-in-chief, with the fate of Europe in your hands. Also, the tension and uncertainty this game creates is brilliant. It is an emotional rollercoaster of a game and totally engaging.

Challenge: 5/5
The game gives you many, varied options to weigh up. Military or diplomacy; land, air or sea; east or west; technology or industry. Further, the way the game has been structured for 3-players creates unique challenges and tensions that I have not experienced with other games.

Theme: 5/5
This is a primarily a game rather than a historical simulation, since it is wide open in terms of strategy and direction. Do not expect the game to mirror the historical course of events. However, the game does a brilliant job of recreating the situation in Europe leading up to WWII and the unique problems, advantages, tensions and pressures affecting each power.

Overall: 5/5
The game combines many brilliantly conceived mechanics in an incredibly elegant way and puts them into a highly playable package that is full of theme, history and tension. This is a work of game-design genius.

One of the best WW2 games I've ever played. I really like the way the game is basically split into two parts: diplomacy and war. My only beef is that there are WAY too many special rules and exceptions, and also the battle mechanics are way too compicated. With less units and less everything, this could have been a 9.5/10. Still, highly recommended.

2-3 players, best 3

Pre-World War II setting. Read great things about this one. Seriously considering!

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Looks like there will be a second game called Conflict & Consequence based in the Pacific theatre, which might be combined with T&T to expand the 3-player games to 5-6 player! See: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/23888551#23888551

T&T 2nd edition comes with a mounted board and better quality components.
GMT P500 (Possible for 4Q, 2016)

Interested in a 2v2 player teams variant! A la Angola? Would it be possible?

Preliminary rating after first play, but I can surely say: This REALLY seems to be REALLY good. What we've got here is a peculiar mixture of thematic history game with three different paths to victory, including a military option that may or may not add a block wargame (for up to three players!) as a subgame. All mechanisms are kept intuitive 
and easy. 

Hard to say in how far the game itself will unfold in full scale, but it plays smoothly and develops the historical flair you're looking for in wargames (among other things).

A really good 'all of WWII in one game.' 
Diplomacy is excellent. Combat straightforward. Tech rules great - but tech isn't that good and you don't get any VP for the non atomic stuff.
Presentation ok.
Negatives: rules for movement, supply lines, blockade a little fiddly to implement and can interfere with game flow. I completely disagree with the weight rating on BGG. It is easily close to 4 than 3.
No solo game (not that anyone claimed there was!)
Peace dividends are pretty crap too. Most of them are worthless and there is no in game bonus.
Also - this took 7 and a half hours, so don't know where people are getting 240 mins from...
Am really on the fence as to whether I should keep this one or not

There is much awesomeness wedged into this game, even if the military mechanics don't seem to quite get historical results at less than the most strategic level.  It's a strategic game, so....  The best truly strategic, really playable game on the whole schmear of butter and guns.  Hmm, maybe the only playable, stand-alone game on the whole schmear?  Schmear experts feel free to correct me.  

Not, perhaps, for beginners, as there's a LOT to consider when actually running through the fairly simple mechanics.

This is an interesting three-player GMT game that came out at the same time as GMT's Churchill (also a three-player game) and so was eclipsed by it. Apparently I jumped the gun getting it when it first came out, as the 'second edition' reputedly incorporates several improvements.

RATING: 8
Good, interesting, and unique. Relatively quick playing. Too hard to get played, though. As it's only a 3 player game. It's a bit too fiddly -- a number of the rules could be streamlined without loss of theme or immersion (e.g. rules for colonies, distinction between aggression vs attacks, etc). I probably wouldn't introduce this to a person who hasn't played a block wargame before; if you've played a block wargame before you're largely familiar with how combat will work. Aside from the black wargame aspect, the core game system is pretty straight forward. And it plays pretty quickly.

RATING: 10
It’s great to see all of the positive reviews and comments for Triumph and Tragedy.  I’ve been play testing this game with the designer from its beginning and it makes me proud to have played a small part in its production.

Other people have commented on some of the main aspects of T&T (the open ended play, relatively simple rules with decent complexity, one night play time, streamlined fast paced action) so I’ll talk about some of the other details of the game.

The game has a quick setup with only a few mandatory unit choices (fortress for the Maginot line e.g.) leaving players to decide what types of forces to build based only on the population of their starting territories.  A few markers placed on supply tracks and a starting mitt full of action cards and you’re off and running.

T&T is fun right off the bat.  The diplomatic struggle often breaks out into minor hostilities and there is an ongoing tension as to when or if full scale war will break out.  The game tends to have a base in history because the card distribution makes it more likely that countries that were historically influenced by diplomacy will join one of the major powers.  The axis powers start with a diplomatic advantage as a parallel to the growing influence of fascism in the 1930’s.  All of this is happening simultaneous to the arming of the major powers and the players trying to gain an edge in industry and technology.  All in all the diplomatic game is an exciting jostle for position with good nod to history and straightforward gameplay.
 
When war breaks out you get to find out if you have been making the right decisions in your balance of military, industry and technology.  While industry affects your total output it won’t save you from a crippling panzer attack.  The cards that you use to build factories are the same as the cards that you use to develop technology, forcing you to make difficult choices in how to lead your economy.  The same quandaries exist in finding the balance between your economy and military leadership.  The action cards (the same cards that you used in diplomacy) have a command component that decides initiative and movement limits.  If you don’t focus enough on command cards you could find your armies bogging down.

I give this game top rating because of its elegant, simple play system and its complex, nuanced strategic play.  You constantly find yourself making difficult decisions against a backdrop of constant tension.  Triumph and Tragedy has a quick flow to the play that builds momentum as the game continues.  You will have fun the first time that you play this game, but I guarantee that you will have more fun the tenth time through.  Try this game.

RATING: 8
A simple game, but very evocative of the period. It is not a straight jacketed version of the thirties but much more free flowing depending on what worried each power the most. 
I like the card based economy where you draw a mix of diplomacy/maneuver cards, Industry/Tech cards and building your units. Really well done and drives a lot of consideration on what you want to focus. Captures the fluid nature of alliances and build up until one power (most likely the Axis) feels it is to it advantage to pull the trigger.  
The movement and combat seems to be more static, akin to what happened after all sides learned to stop the blitzkrieg, but it works in the context of the game. 

It is a fun game to play, and the system seems so elegant.

much more akin to Churchill that to victory in Europe. the war is done at a scale that should account for fr/it/ussr poor military performance, and the ussr hand limit not nearly harshenough to reflect their moribund state after purges. too little differentiation among the powers (start ge off with heavy tank tech?).
also, easy for axis to get screwed with bad initial hand preventing them from picking up allies.
and you got dealt nuke tech? great! turtle and go for A-bomb victory!

I've now played this game three times as each of the three roles. I love this game. It's the newest '10' on my list, and I give these out rarely (only seven games). It's one of the truly great grand strategic board games, and easily my favorite three player game. I will play this anytime, anywhere. After my first game, I couldn't stop thinking about the game for several days, and rushed out to Michael's to buy storage boxes for the game pieces. I haven't been this excited about a game in a long time. My one complaint, so far, about the game - only three players and often five hours (five hour games are fine, but I generally like those long games to be 4+ players). I love larger group dynamics and if this was a five player game, I am pretty sure it would be in my top three games of all time. The game designer is working on a Pacific Theater version of this game, and he is going to try to allow both games to be combined into a five-player global WWII scenario. Exciting!

The early game is driven by card play and diplomacy, as the three powers jockey to win influence over the neutral countries. Eventually, someone has incentive to kick things off to protect their interest or thwart a rival, and the military game comes to the fore. And the victory conditions, where you score for your lowest value in industry, population, or resources, makes this more than a conquer-the-world game. I know it's a cliche to call games elegant, but there's no other word for how this system manages so much with so few mechanics. Economics, production, diplomacy, maneuver, and combat are all woven together with remarkably few rules. It's a joy to play a strategic WW2 game of such scope and depth with so little references to the rulebook. And it takes less than six hours for a full game. The designer hit this one out of the park.

It's probably better than my experience so far has led me to believe. I drew the short straw to get the Axis (which is difficult for new players to win with) and I'm playing against more experienced players. my experience has been a lot of "can I do X", get an affirmative response, then get told I can't actually do it (either because of some exception or my question was misunderstood). Very frustrating.

Unter den „Wargames“ im engeren Sinne ist das von Craig Besingue entwickelte „Triumph & Tragedy“ die Entdeckung des Jahres 2015. „Triumph & Tragedy“ ist ein Area-Control-Game mit Blöcken, Karten und einem recht simplen, widerspruchsfreien Regelsystem. Es fasst den Zweiten Weltkrieg auf als Auseinandersetzung dreier Ideologien (Faschismus/Kommunismus/Kapitalismus) bzw. Konflikt zwischen drei Blöcken (Achse/Westen/UdSSR) und kann sowohl zu zweit wie zu dritt gespielt werden. Der Spielplan zeigt Europa und Nordafrika (aufgeteilt in relativ wenige Gebiete, Deutschland z.B. besteht aus vier Gebieten) sowie relevante Teile der übrigen Welt in abstrakter Form. Terrain spielt für die Bewegung keine Rolle; allerdings gibt es Einschränkungen beim Überschreiten bestimmter Gebietsgrenzen (große Flüsse, Gebirge). Wesentliche Mechaniken übernimmt dieses Game von den bekannten „Columbia“-Blockspielen; allerdings haben die Einheiten keinen eigentlichen Initiativwert (A – B – C usw.), der bestimmt, welche Einheit wann attackiert, sondern sie greifen an in der fixen Reihenfolge des Einheitentyps und dann im Regelfall Verteidiger vor Angreifer: Eine Festung etwa feuert immer zuerst, die Infanterie immer zuletzt. Jede Einheit hat eine unterschiedliche (oder auch gar keine) Trefferwahrscheinlichkeit – je nach deklariertem Ziel: Flugzeugträger sind gegen Panzer nicht erste Wahl, taugen aber gegen Flieger usw. Wer was bei welchem Würfelergebnis trifft (in der Regel bei 1 bis 3), das lässt sich einer Übersicht auf dem Spielplan entnehmen. Die erwähnte einheitenspezifische Performance kann außerdem durch (geheime) Forschung verbessert werden. Bei den Kämpfen zu Land findet pro Spielzug nur eine Kampfrunde statt (so dass sich solche Kämpfe länger hinziehen, verstärkt/entsetzt etc. werden können); allein Seekämpfe werden sofort bis zum bitteren Ende ausgefochten. Auch die gegnerische Industrie kann im übrigen Ziel eines (Bomben-)Angriffs werden. Gesteuert wird das Spiel von zwei Kartendecks: „Action“ und „Investment“. Die Action-Karten dienen entweder zur diplomatischen Beeinflussung der kleineren Nationen (diese kann man zu „Verbündeten“, dann zu „Protektoraten“ bis hin zu abhängigen „Satelliten“ ausbauen – was der Gegner kontern darf) ODER zur Bewegung und zum Kampf mit einer auf den Karten vermerkten Anzahl von Einheiten. Mit den „Investment“-Karten betreibt man entweder Forschung ODER spioniert/sabotiert ODER baut die eigene Industrie aus. Das Spiel beginnt 1936 (kürzere Szenarien: 1939, 1941 und 1944 sind inklusive) und dauert bis längstens Ende 1945. Eine Runde besteht aus einer „Neues Jahr“- und „Regierungsphase (hier wird produziert oder geforscht oder Diplomatie oder Spionage betrieben oder das Militär aufgestockt) gefolgt von den drei Jahreszeiten Frühjahr, Sommer, Herbst - der Winter findet, wenn überhaupt, dann optional nur in Russland statt. In jeder der Jahreszeiten folgt das Game pro Spieler der Sequenz Bewegung – Kampf; haben dies alle Spieler erledigt, wird noch die Versorgungslage überprüft, wobei die Auswirkungen mangelnden Nachschubs spürbar, jedoch nicht zu harsch sind. Neben dem üblichen Eroberungssieg (zwei gegnerische Hauptstädte) ist auch ein ökonomischer Sieg (gefördert durch längere Friedensperioden!) oder ein Forschungssieg (Atombombe) möglich, was das Spiel bis zum Schluss offen und spannend hält. Sollte bis Ende 1945 auf diesem Wege kein Sieger feststehen, zählt die wirtschaftliche Potenz der Kombattanten (also nicht z.B. erobertes Territorium). Was an „Triumph & Tragedy“ besonders fasziniert, ist sein Sandbox-Charakter, der gestattet, unterschiedlichste, aber stets plausible Strategien auszuprobieren: Was geschieht, wenn Deutschland von vornherein für eine Invasion Großbritanniens plant? Wenn Italien alle Ressourcen in die maritime Aufrüstung steckt? Wenn der Westen schon 1936 aggressiv gegen die Achsenmächte vorgeht oder die UdSSR sich Richtung Asien/Indien orientiert? Wenn die Achsenmächte allein auf Diplomatie setzen? Usw.

This is a good game, and I would rate it higher if I didn’t already have a 3p war game I would always choose over this one (Maria).  The blocks and step losses are a bit fiddly - easily trackable - I feel like hand sizes need to be hidden and opponents need to close eyes when you upgrade cv to really make the fog of war work better. I also wish there were mechanisms like Maria has for players to balance the game when another is getting far ahead - where’s the Warsaw Pact or West subsidizing Soviet tanks?  Apart from US troops entering the war, there’s not much historical flavor to differentiate the years.

--Sep2015-- It's a fascinatingly unconstrained system:  while the initial 1936 setting is plausible, the players may conduct themselves as they see fit thereafter - with very little need to adhere to historic patterns.  It's cool; and I need to play more.

lovely 3p weuro. You have to understand what the stakes are, though, when the game starts--until Russia and the West come to terms with what a steamroller Germany is unchecked, there are going to be some very lopsided Axis wins. Axis can win extremely quickly by crushing the west if Russia isn't aware.

RATING: 7
Cool, not-too-time-consuming fun. Just historic enough to feel like a WWII situation, but enough freedom to take in many directions. As the Soviets I deliberately refrained from combat in order to learn other elements of the system, only swooping in late and taking Romania from under Axis influence to shore up my score and end up tying the Axis. 

I also enjoyed the non-combat diplomatic interplay most. The military could have been simplified further and I'd not have objected, in fact the game might be better without it, although that might sacrifice your supposed role in this game as Stalin, Hilter/Musso, or Chamberlain/Blum/FDR. 

Some cool systems, the season cards rated with letters and numbers reminds me of Powerpuff Girls: Saving the World Before Bedtime, and the lowest of the three tracks being the base of your VP score reminds me of Tigris & Euphrates. It was cool how certain countries were more easy to influence via cards while some, like Poland or Afghanistan, appeared less on the cards, Poland on the one hand to apparently encourage its invasion and Afghanistan attributable to its periphery. 

I toy with the idea of random events helping add flavor, but the cards do add some and adequately represent opportunities and setbacks created by random events. Still, something to consider.

One might wonder how this would work for a WWI or other situations.

FUN ★★★★★
Each of my friends I played this game with have had a lot of fun. The cards have their importance but don't determine who'll win. It's possible to win with each faction, in different ways. The game might be long (4-6 hours), but the time goes extremly fast, there is no boredom at any moment. It's the best game so far in my collection. 

RULES ★★★✰✰
Awesome game that would deserve a 10 if the rules were a bit clearer. I'd rather have some more pages in the rulebook and make sure everything is understood in the right way.

IMMERSION ★★★★★
Even though there is huge simplification to make the game easy to play, it's likely the players will have the feeling of what were the possible strategies.

DEPTH ★★★★✰
Since the game is not scripted, all alliances are possible, so that the game can turn out in very various ways. Awesome game!

A rather light, sandbox-style game. There's no operational considerations to constrain the Axis advance into Moscow. Combat is incredibly 'dicey'. Units are highly generic and there's no difference between them. The generic technology cards are how this game differentiates between units, allowing the powers to create their own armies. The best description I can come up with for this game is that it's a highly simplified version of the computer wargame series [b]Hearts of Iron[/b].

I don't generally enjoy games themed with modern-era conflicts, but I went for this one because it brilliantly solves the three-player problem. The West and the USSR generally want to work together to stop the Axis early on but the situation is quite fluid and handles a wide range of possible outcomes. I really enjoy the sandbox feeling -- the game doesn't have to play out historically at all, the Axis for instance could play a diplomatic game and not even declare war. Simple, elegant mechanics capture a great deal of depth and complexity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is incredible. I love everything about it. The resource management, the politics, the positioning and posturing, the story arc, the arms race, the tension, the battles, the multiple paths to victory, the strategy/tactics/luck balance. Brilliant. This is a pinnacle of gaming. I think there is a good possibility that I will bump this to a 10 with one or two more plays. I don't see it falling from a 9 anytime soon. 

There is a good deal of luck in the cards and dice, but I think the game is long enough, and card draws/die rolls are frequent enough, where it should truly balance out. I've never been terribly upset at any of the results. Better play should win the game. 

The was a moment in our last game where I could have won if I wasn't so tunnel visioned during my battle of Berlin as the West. [-]Leningrad (my second capital, I had already sacked Rome) was mine for the taking and within moving distance with no resistance defending it. I completely missed it because I was too focused on this intense battle. I saw it the second after I declared continuation of the battle and my opponents (rightly) said that I couldn't move back from that declaration.[/-] I later learned, this would have been an illegal move because naval without ground support cannot conquer territory. During the battle, I still neglected to reinforce my Berlin attack which still may have cost me the game. Meanwhile, Russia was focused on absorbing countries left and right to push for an economic victory.  Germany built the atomic bomb the very next turn in 1945 and blew up London, and winning the game. We were all moments away from victory through 3 different game ending mechanisms! Great game, great stories! Possibly the best 3 player game I've played. I might enjoy this more than Maria. 

Truly an accomplishment in game design. Bravo Craig!

This game is just a masterpiece in design. I can't think of any other grand-strategy WW2 that that's accessible, fun to play, has a good balance of simulation vs. theoretical outcomes, and is realistically playable in a single game session of 4-6 hours.

Although it's playable at 2 players, I'd only ever want to play at the 3 player count which is all that the game supports.

I'm really looking forward to the designer's Pacific theatre game -- another insta-buy!

Very complicated to rate this one. I'm not a big wargamer but I do enjoy some nice disputes on the board :) 

Triumph and Tragedy is a very clever game. Players dress different codes and play in different shapes but in the end it's a nude battle over battle wargame with an interesting (until a certain point) diplomatic or influential aspect.

I dislike the cards because lots of them (too many) become obsolete at a certain stage of the game.
Also, from the beginning, especially the German player, seems to simply try to get rid of excess of cards.
I don't like the blocks because I don't find the fog of war interesting enough in this case (for example if comparing with Hammer of the Scots).
Although only played once I'm pretty sure that the game takes over 4 hours to complete if all turns are played.
The way the different nations play is usually something I enjoy but in this case I have the feeling that it's too scripted. 

All of this is based on a single play so take it with a grain of salt.

Have had a few plays now and after four tries I finally won as the Axis by taking Leningrad and Moscow.  But in fairness, it was against a novice player, so I am still not convinced I know how to play this well.
Due to the randomness of the cards, it does play differently every time.

Hardly historical nor simulation focused, it nevertheless covers a great variety of options in a decision rich quick moving game.

Fun take on the European theater of war. Personally I would have liked some more chrome rules for stronger historical flavor. But it is still a very enjoyable game with a lot of "what if" potential when it comes to the diplomacy part. Big plus for being a true three player game and not 2 vs 1.

Edit: lowered the grade. The game just feels to unhistorical. A fantasy theme or sci fi setting would have been better.

 A really great game, I enjoyed playing it the first time last week and am looking forward to playing again, SOON! Simple like chess but with lots of options. 

In a World where 3 player games are hard to come by this is a really good one,

An amazing game of war, politics, and power. While certainly not too simulationistic and definitely not historically deterministic, T&T is a grand experience.

If you expect a grand-strategy from WW2 this is not the game you're looking for. If you're looking for entry game for beginning wargamers that is easy to explain and understand with a quick gameplay Triumph & Tragedy might be for you. Production quality (2nd edition) is nice, rules are quite simple and you'll understand everything during the first few rounds. Combat is easy and so are other available actions and the whole game is more about negotiation and outmaneuvering others. Definitely worth trying.

Certainly the best strategic WW2 ever !

And more ! You can now understand why Hitler was so agressive during 36-39 period, and also why 'West' were so passive. You can forget Day Of Decision pre-war.

And alse, forget world in flames, 3rd reich, totaller krieg and all others.... maybe not unconditionnal surrender.

A must have

Very good first impression after one play.

The rules are very well rounded and balanced and it's very refreshing to have a total freedom to do what you want whereas normally WW2 games are very scripted.

The narrative quality is incredible. For example, in my game, the Axis never declared war on anyone but concentrated on diplomacy (near control of Central Europe before being countered progressively) and scientific research. He went very close to achieve the atomic bomb. But his plan was revealed by the Soviet spies and USSR+West declared war on the Axis in 1943 to prevent it and conquered it in 1944. We stopped the mad Nazi-scientists. It was a great alternate history and I'm amazed to see how the designer could incorporate so many elements (diplomacy, economy, military, technology, trade) into a simple and playable package.

2 thumbs up, highly recommended.

RATING: 7
It's fine... chaining two people to Germany and throwing them off either side of the table is fun, and splicing that to some basic card play to keep the tempo of things ahistorical & player-driven, but this relies too much on the built in tension of the "reveal" of block games for it's thrill. Which this does do very well. And the tech tree & political synergies are such basic wrinkles there isn't as much adaptability as I expected over the course of a campaign. And the turn order idea feels stappled on rather than integrated into the game dynamics.

In such an innovative landscape as wargaming right now the tropes, mechanical & thematic, feel slick but dated and simplistic. But then I find tech trees a tiresome import from Civ computer games that rarely does well in cardboard. It's such a gross tool to set up asymmetries to resolve in tabletop environment; that stuff is best done in silicon.

For this sort of game I'm more interested in the broader freedom, political intricacy, coherent point-of-view, tempo mechanics, and narrative scope that seem to be the underpinnings of the coming Catacalysm. It also seems as tho it would have far more intriguing player bindings in its multiplayer format than T&T.  I'm more & more drawn to the dynamism of chit pulls, expect more from card play, and discovering more innovative narratives & tensions in wargaming over the past few years than what I see here given the buzz.

Still, will always be glad to play with beers & a more raucous table I may get more from it than this initial take.

Axis should execute the Operation Sea Lion in 1938 at the latest if West drew three or more of the investment card in 1936.
Otherwise, the Axis should conquest the Baltic countries and Poland from 1936 to 1937, and would execute the Operation Barbarossa in 1938.
During this period Axis would consume 8-10 production point for CV.


If this plan can not be obtained by Axis in the Military Victory, Axis will admit defeat obediently.I believe this plan is most effective for a chance of Axis victory.

I would play again and even recommend, but with some house rules. The terrain boundary limits are needless. They remind me of the attrition based warfare of The Lamps Are Going Out, except in Lamps its historical, thematic and less aggravating than watching the Axis incapable of any historic accomplishment. A credible Axis threat causes the other powers to divert production from other pursuits into defending fronts. I think I'd also like to see a starting (face up) technology for each power. There is a good game in here, but it needed a little more get-up-and-go

This game is extremely fun.  Lots of strategies to consider, but it's not terribly difficult to learn.  Despite subtle differences between the factions, each faction feels very different.

A solid card driven fog-of-war blocks war game on a paper mat with some great additions.  Rotated strength on blocks is a handy tracker. Love the diplomacy card play contests and their resultant influence on strategy. The multi-use cards create good choice decisions.  And related, well timed espionage cards can be very effective. The integration of production with industrial capacity also works well. I’m not a war gamer normally but this one speaks to me.

My list of amazing three-player wargames has now grown to two: [i]Maria[/i] and [i]Triumph & Tragedy[/i].  Not sure about the order yet.

T&T does so much so well.  The tripartite production system is clever, the industry/influence phase is tense without being onerous, technological troop upgrades are fun, and the supply and combat mechanics (with echoes of [i]Rommel in the Desert[/i] and [i]Hellenes[/i]) work as intended in a sensical way.

The rules aren't trivial, though; they will make sense soon enough, but until that occurs the rulebook should be re-read religiously (minimally after the first few games) to remedy any omissions and misunderstandings.  Note: Rules tips for new players can be found [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1517171/rules-tips-new-players]here[/url].

[url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/157521/victory-europe][i]Victory in Europe[/i][/url], another ETO block game released around the same time, really suffers by comparison. ViE has undercooked rules (and no playbook!), handles diplomacy with neutral countries in a much less interesting way, has a longer campaign game (mostly because every unit can move every turn), suffers from a non-functional map, and omits key historical pressures (e.g., atomic bomb development).

[i]Update:[/i]

T&T has already gotten tons more play than Maria.  It's an epic, open-ended experience.  Even if I only play a few more times - which I won't - I will have already gotten my money's worth.

RATING: 7
Initial rating. This is a solid game.  It allows you to explore a very wide game space given the subject matter.  It may take you far afield of history.  This game will not appeal to you if ahistorical outcomes are undesirable.

The potential downsides are that there is not much differentiation of units in the game.  Ships can drive right up on land and attack ground units, which is a bizarre idea.  If you can get past being literal about unit roles, it's no big deal.  Otherwise that could be a deal-breaker for you.  Also, there is very little differentiation between countries.  That works in the game because you invest and build your own tech, which defines your armies' capabilities in the guise of unit upgrades.

In short: if you can get past the history and just look at this as a three-way contest, it's a great game.  It manages to pack an awful lot of strategy in a very simple ruleset.  Diplomacy is handled brilliantly in its simplicity.

Another game I was looking from the time I began my gaming odyssey - grand strategy WWII playable in an evening. Thank you and good night.

Only problems: strict player count (same as Churchill) and somewhat obtuse rules in particular segments (supply of course as in most wargames, some movement issues). Very hard to play well with Britain.

It did feel like a sandbox WO II game. Enjoyed the diplomatic part where you try to influence nations into your sphere. The combat is still a bit dicey though much less than in A&A. 
The fog of war through the blocks is something that makes the game feel more unique. 
WOII strategies and tactics felt missing : Airplanes too underwhelming. No combined arms bonuses. Blitzkrieg not really possible. Game would probably be more realistic if it was WO I themed.
Submarines are nice since you can really blockade. 
Good rules for supply. Movement limited by terrain is also good. 
Crazy alt histories possible: we had huge battles in Sweden.

After just one play, this game feels bursting with possibilities. Easier (and faster) to learn and play than I'd expected, and there is never a tedious moment; always a myriad of options to consider.

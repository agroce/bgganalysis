I have actually played this game twice, once as an early prototype and this latest iteration (version 1.09).  The most challenging part for me was the division of the randomly drawn buildings, units and events into "even" groups that would leave viable options in the leftovers, no matter what the other players selected.  It's not like any other game I have played, and I enjoyed the challenge.  It was fun to ignore the group that another player taylored to my "needs" and take the one that seemed to be best for them, then make it work for me anyway (well, mostly).

I just don't feel I had enough of a chance to properly rate the game, but what I saw wasn't terrific even though I completely appreciate the effort. On the other hand, I really don't like tower defense games at all - which is the inspiration for what we see here.

+ Interesting balance of defense (through buildings) and offensive (through units) makes for tough decisions with resource allocation.
- Splitting of resources can be a bit opaque at the start and can bog down if no timer is put on the process.

RATING: 4
This game was an interesting idea. The game itself was pretty mediocre. I would probably rate this a 6 if the rules had been clearer, but we had a pretty big misplay due to ambiguities in the rules.

I think this game has the same problem that every kickstarter I play has. The rules aren't clear, and the game doesn't play smoothly. As a result, there are plenty of games that I have that I just like better, and my playtime isn't as plentiful as it needs to be to play these games.

RATING: 7
In this game, I think miniatures or some other visual representation (tokens with some art, mini cards on a stand or something) other than cubes (for dragons, orcs, knights etc.) would give this game far better impression. Divide and choose is good, but other than that it felt like solitaire game...

2015 - After an interminable time period I got this game to the table for the first time this year! I enjoy it thoroughly! the clever sorting sharing mechanic that it shares with one of my personal grail games is well done here. The choices are as agonizingly fun here as well. The game within a game concept and then oh yeah, we have a kingdom to protect, is engrossing, but not over the limit of what is fun, at least not to me. Early bad choices are a bit harsher here, but the nature of the game also leaves you the ability to come back from that, all in all this is a rare gem that I will be glad pull back off the shelf for the right group! Not rating yet, though unusually I have an idea after the one play and several training games, I will still withhold until more plays can be had.

Went with the kick starter on this one and shall await its arrival, its a fairly long way off, so perhaps I can finally track down a copy of San Marco so that I may have them both. The theme here sets this one ablaze and I am glad I was informed of it! Looking forward to that un-boxing and first play!

RATING: N/A
Played at BGG.CON 2010 and Origins 2011, and the improvement from one to the other was palpable. My strategy didn't go building-heavy in either case, so I can't comment on that path, but in this latest revision mustering defenders and fighting the enemy (both at home and in the Valley) certainly worked well and was good fun. I wouldn't mind a larger/more varied event deck, but can also see why you'd want some cards to come up more reliably than a large deck would offer.

Next time I play, I'd like to try 2p or 3p, so that I'm engaged with what all other players are choosing every turn rather than going parallel for the splitting-and-decision phase, and see how that changes the dynamic. I suspect I'll like it even more.

RATING: 7.75
Current rating based on one play of prototype - this could go up with future plays.

The prototype was pretty refined by the time I got to it, I could tell the designer had spent a lot of time streamlining the design.  There was really only one element of the game that I thought needed a little more streamlining which is an issue for the 4 player game only and really quite a minor issue.  

The game has a shared element with San Marco in that a player has a handful of resources (some cards, some buildings, some units both enemy and friendly) that he must divide in such a way that his opponents get to pick their piles first.  You can often get a good idea of what your opponent will want, which may or may not be the same things you want.  

There are several different ways to go about getting points in this game - directly killing enemy troops, sending them off a cliff, or invading the forts in Dragon Valley (the last of which is the hardest to pull off and the most valuable).  You could try a hybrid strategy or focus on just one method.  There are a lot of different buildings to guide your strategy, but you have to also think tactically about which enemies are coming at you and also whether one of your opponents might try to recruit some of your troops for himself (there are buildings to protect you, if you choose to devote resources to it). 

The mechanics of the game were pretty easy to learn, though I think the symbology on the board and tiles still needs a little tweaking - but a couple small changes will make a big difference.

I look forward to trying the game again and will likely pick up a copy since I think the other gamers in my house would enjoy it.   I suspect 3 is the sweet spot # of players but it would work as well with 2.

Really interesting idea where the first player draws resources out of a bag and has to divide them into piles and then the other players get first pick, unfortunately this can lead to a lot of downtime when you are not first player.

The team aspect for 4 players is a little strange.

Enjoyable game other than the downtime.

RATING: 7
I wanted to love this game, but then after I played it; I like it.  There is a bit tower defense and some fights going on. The game is kinda broken when you play it with newbies. It IS very important to know the buildings and how many are in the game and who got them as there are more and less useful ones.
There are only two "Sappers" and three "Stables" which seem the key to sucess if one player get's more than one of them.
As the buildings are very small you barely know what your neighbours have built, but it is important to know in case of deviding or choosing the resources you get. Getting one of the adventure tiles gives you a whopping third or half of the victory points needed to finish/win the game. So players have really to be cautious what the fellow players are doing.

edit: a second play with 3 (instead 4) players did feel different as fewer of the action cards come up. However I am not sure if the victory points awarded through sieging the Orc Forts/Keeps are a bit high. The decision who wins the game was decided in the last turn depending on the action cards showed up.

Tentative rating. The first three or four turns in your first game are a real bear - it feels byzantine (not the same as hard by a long shot) while learning what everything does (the obtuse symbols on the tiles don't help). But it seems like it would be much better - and play much quicker - after understanding it.

RATING: 7
Rather positive surprise.  I was a bit afraid before the first play reading that DV proceeds too slowly and 'divide into piles' stuff takes too long and causes a serious downtime.  It's not entirely true, but there _is_ some merit to it.

The dividing part works better with 4 than 3 players.  With 4 two players divide the stuff into only 2 piles, with 3 - one player into 3 piles.  The former is less time-consuming and causes less downtime.  Everybody is more involved and for longer period of time.  This preference of 4 over 3 players needs a final confirmation as I played only 4 times.

You need some experience to have the most of fun from the dividing part of the game.  It's not easy, but it's achieveable.

--

The rulebook is messy (editing +  some _important_ interactions are not described...).

But the only issue which stops me from giving the game a higher note is the entry barrier for new players.  In the first turns (or before the game) you really need to absorb all the cards and the most of the buildings.  That's quite a chunk of knowledge.  Thus, the start of the first game can be sluggish.  

The game might also be a bit longish in some cases.  In general I have a feeling that this is the game for the dedicated squad, not for gamers who just happen to be around it when it's proposed :( 

Sold.

Makes a game out of a few very shop-worn mechanics. "I divide and you choose," for resource gathering, a modified rock-scissors-paper for combat resolution, and basic set-collection for sieges. The problem is that these mechanics float in the air, disconnected from each other and anything else in the game. They are simply a way of adding decision-making and really could be a different mechanic and it would make no difference. Buildings, heroes, enemies and bonus cards are divided and divvied. On your turn you build, move or recharge buildings that have been "used". Then the enemies move and you do it again. You get points for eliminating enemies or staging successful sieges against enemy tiles in the middle of the board (by moving the correct set of heroes onto them). There is a card/building combo called the "dungeon" that can also net you points. 

While the game is not terrible, there are a few problems. The biggest is pace. Divvying up the cards can be painful to think through and then you only get one action before you are at it again. (It tells you something that the designer designed a "mini-game" for the choosers to play while the dividers divide.) The methods of deciding feel disconnected from any kind of logic that can be justified in the world of the game. The method is arbitrary. And finally the rulebook is poorly laid out and feels like you are trying to find references and rules in an eight-page paragraph. What sets your turns apart from other players more than anything are the cards - which can give you extra moves or strength for a turn, but you don't really earn them, which makes their use unsatisfying. You simply take one pile or the other. I can see why some might enjoy this, but it isn't for me.

A well designed Euro with a medieval battle theme. I especially liked the game mechanics for dividing and selecting resources at the start of each turn.

There were several variables throughout the game to mix things up and make it interesting as well.

I was fortunate enough to be able to playtest this game with CW during its development.  It has some great mechanics which capture the flavor of managing an ongoing war against assaulting hordes, while trying to extend the reach of your realm to precious new lands.  The tactical choices each turn are really tough, and it has many paths to victory.  It's possible to turn the game on your opponents with a few brilliant moves.  Each game is different and fresh.

I have always played it as a 3 player game. And we find the game is best played with the Eradication Alternate Rules. We also like to play it with the Kings Favored being the only one to get to look at the Kings Aid cards when he deploys them face down in the piles to get rid of the paralysis analysis (buildings still get deployed face up). 

I have not tried playing yet with 2 or 4.

After 1 play. In the center of the board there's a valley full of dragons. Surrounding it are human kingdoms, and each player is King of one of them. Each kingdom is a grid of spaces.

In the game, a neverending stream of Dragons and Orcs with their Battering Rams come pouring out of the valley and into the Kingdoms. 

As they're pouring in, each player builds a system of buildings in his kingdom to create a "tower defense", which both diverts and destroys the bad guys as they arrive.

At the same time, each kingdom is sending a neverending stream in of knights, archers, and trebuchets in the opposite direction, from the kingdoms toward the valley, with the ultimate goal of laying seige to the dragons strongholds. 

But before they get there, these good guys meet the bad guys coming from the valley, and they do battle in the kingdom in it's tower defense system.  

You get some points for defeating the bad guys in your Kingdom, and you get a lot more points for successfully conquering the dragons strongholds.  

I don't normally like games with lots of different sources of victory points, but this one was more enjoyable to me for two reasons: 

1. Unlike many such games, it actually has some spatial, geometric considerations - it's not just a spreadsheet masquerading as a board game.  

2. The theme is better than normal for these sorts of games. Probably didn't hurt that the night before I played this I happened to read the section of the Hobbit where Smaug attacks the men of the lake. 

It has a cool resource distribution dynamic. Every round, new elements are injected into the game: good guys, bad guys, special powers and events in the form of cards, as well as new buildings for tower defense. One player divides all this varied stuff HOWEVER HE WANTS into as many piles as there are players and then the trailing player gets the first choice of piles, and so on. So it's basically a super-souped-up pie rule. But because the resources are so varied, and because they all have different values for each player depending on the state of his kingdom, dividing them into piles is a complicated, subtle bit of business. At least for this first time player, it was hard to avoid analysis paralysis in trying to divide up the piles. Not clear whether that would get better or worse with more experience, but it certainly was interesting.

Things I don't like: Maybe too much luck involved in attacking strongholds of the dragons. Each one is worth a ton of points, so the game can hinge on whether and when you get to lay seige to one. But it's way too early to truly render a verdict here. 

Other thing I don't like. I'm an abstract games player and I like rules that can be explained to me in under 2 minutes. I really don't like spending most of my first play constantly referencing rules, and that's what happened here. The game is supposed to take two hours and we took three and half.

A really cool looking game with a good theme, but not the best game play.  This borrows from San Marco's split and pick to get new resources, one of my favorite mechanics.  Only played once, but it felt like whoever conquers a middle tile first is going to win.

I like the simplistic battle, but with buildings it is far too easy to destroy all the incoming enemies.  I was able to set up just two tiles for buildings and never had a problem dispatching enemies.  Usually there was a card that made a defensive unit or building invincible and capable of killing multiple enemies.

I think the game is close to something good.  There should be more enemies per draw probably, along with less powerful cards.  I never had the sense of "crap, so many enemies flooding toward my base", which maybe was not the designer's goal.  Could have been a better game though.

Edit: Was suggested to remove some of the friendly troop cubes (knight/archer) from the draw bag for increased difficulty.  Worth trying on another play.

This game works, but it is mostly forgettable.  In a tower-defense-like game, I want a sense of overwhelming opposition, not easily defeated monsters.  Also, the multiple paths to victory are pretty much prescribed, allowing for little creativity or variation.

Pledged at Kickstarter.

Pie-dividing, Tower Defense. Really enjoyed my first play of this, one of those games where you want to play again once you see how things work so you can try out different strategies. I suspect that with experienced players the pie-dividing will become more agonizing.

Our first game was 3p and it took about 2.5-3 hours with explanation. There is potential downtime during the pie dividing - in a 3p game there are 6 cubes, 5 special action/event cards and 4 building tiles, and the relevance to each player's board position is more pronounced than in, say, San Marco. The mini-games (came with Kickstarter, and the designer has also published pnp versions) help pass the time and, since they can actually score you real points in the game, motivate the divider to hurry up, heh.

Looking forward to more plays; the game is a keeper for me.

Or not. Traded it away. It was apparent nobody else was going to be requesting it, at least not over other games in this weight class and theme.

I really wanted to like this, but it seemed to drag out quite a bit and the tension of choosing the piles did not seem quite as fun as in San Marco. The middle tiles do seem to be really powerful if you can get them. Perhaps our lack of experience caused us to give things away too easily. I'm interested to see if my thoughts change with another play, but for now, I'm unfortunately disappointed.

So far, having only played it once, I'm provisionally rating this a 6. I think it's probably got the potential to be better than that, but don't have enough experience yet to give a fair rating. With my solitary play, I'd say it's a lot of fun, with a lot going for it. Worth your time!

Update: The expansion that many of us paid money to be part of has yet to be released. The last we heard was that we were being asked to playtest it ourselves... Not sure who's at fault here, but... disappointing.

Edit:

Finally got rid of it. Expansion never showed, and that left a sour taste. Play was... not really worth the effort, in all honesty.

I had rated this a 7, but decided that's unfair given just one game of a prototype at Origins. Interesting mini-game of dividing up the stuff into lots for players to choose. I was told I split up the stuff so well it was hard to choose one pile over another, which I took as a compliment. I felt like there was something off when you start invading the valley, like it was more lucrative and easier to steal a space someone else had already started to claim rather than claim a space of your own.

The designer won me over at GenCon -- boy was he hustling his game to anyone who would listen! (That kind of entrepreneurship is compelling.) I backed the game, and have enjoyed several plays with my sons. It's not *too* deep that it burns brains, but it provides the right amount of decision-making, fast turns and satisfying dragon-slaying action to keep games feeling fast. 

Other commenters note that the biggest minus is the downtime while one player divides the resources for the turn, but we make that into a positive. We offer all kinds of suggestions, make our cases for what we want or don't want, and try to keep the divider from noticing we actually *really* want the OTHER stack. Good fun.

RATING: 7.7
This is pretty close to being excellent. There's a pretty decent tower defence game going on, with a little screwage, having to deal resources in such a way that someone will leave you what you want, whilst not giving them too much... A lot of good things.

Minor quibbles are that it is hard to keep track of every one else and what they have. In our 2 games, nobody really felt under a huge amount of danger of being overwhelmed.

But these are fairly minor. The game does a lot of good things and I can see this hitting the table fairly often.

I have only played Dragon Valley once, with two players. It was a learning game, and so my rating may rise. The theme of the game, and the way in which it captures the tower defense model, was clever. I enjoyed the decisions that come out of selecting and choosing batches of resources -- sort of an elaboration on the pie rule. The game, however, goes on too long. There simply isn't enough depth to warrant two hours of playtime. Half as long would have been more than enough. I'm almost afraid to play with 3 or 4 players because I'm sure the game length will increase.

Great "castle defense" game where youre not acting cooperatively and you have a chance to screw with your opponents.  Get the most points and win.

I usually really dig complex tactical games that involve a fair bit of luck but I just couldn't get into Dragon Valley.

Even though I love the choose and split (Fact or Fiction) mechanic in a game this one was a complete turn off considering how we had played it (which turned out to be incorrectly).

Also, having the pretense of theme and when it came to it having near zero theme hurt this title as well.

I do need to play it again to give it a fair shake.

I felt the downtime between sorting and choosing piles was crippling.  The randomness of the cube draws, buildings and so forth made for a very unpredictable and seemingly cohesive-less mechanic.

The production value is one of the game's more redeeming qualities and I like the sort/choose mechanic, I just feel like it might not be a good fit for this game.  I think it would be a vast improvement if players had a building track where they could build something of their choice vs. having to draw randomly and hope to get something useful... 70-80% of most buildings for each player end up not being used.  Maybe instead of drawing building tiles, you would draw a +1 build chip.

this is basic tower defense using a draft mechanic that is "I cut, you choose"... each round one player divides up the units, enemy units and cards into a number of piles equal to the number of players, then everybody picks a pile from lowest score to highest... everyone deploys units, plays cards and works out all the effects then automatic stuff resolves and it's a new round... this is fun, but I've had a couple of run-away leader games that weren't as fun... the group has to get good at dividing and choosing or you'll give someone the game...

Cool theme.  Nice looking board and components.  I split, you choose mechanic similar to San Marco.  I liked the fact that there were 3 different strategies you could choose to pursue.  Nice mixture of Ameritrash and Euro.

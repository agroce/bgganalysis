Somewhat unbalanced deck-builder with stupid amounts of cartoon cleavage. 
If your looking for fast and random go with star realms, if your looking for some randomness with length then go ascension. If however you want a game with risqué artwork with a good chunk of randomness (both in balance and game length) then i guess this one is for you

This game looks fun and has terrific art ( what can i say we are both fans of anime/manga). Tt even has a pretty cool mechanism that allows you to play cards in combination if you've played the right types of symbols. But it doesn't bring enough to keep us interested and plus it doesn't look Japanime games is supporting it all with more content.

RATING: 8.1
An interesting deck builder with a nice color combo system built in for when you're playing out cards. The theme is that of Greek and Norse gods at war, and the artwork is sexy in the anime/manga style. In fact, I got interested in the game because of people whining about the artwork, but my wife and I have absolutely no problem with it, and the game turned out fairly neat, or at least much better than I had expected. Plays simple, with either individual competitions or 4 and 6 player team matches.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Plays Ascension-style with more emphasis on PVP so its easy to set-up and play.  Gets boring fast though because certain card combos are chased a lot, so it becomes a race to see who can do the 4-card chain combo first.  Definitely needs a "third party" target like in Ascension or Legendary.  Biggest complaint is the font on the cards is VERY SMALL.

My first try at a deck building game.  Maybe this isn't the best gateway to deck building games, but it was a lot of fun.  I lost at my first game, although it ended up being a very tense battle in the last 15 minutes.  I felt like I could certainly have done better at building my deck.  It's a hard choice to go for defense, attack power, or better buying power.  My friend and I did not take any time selecting out main gods.  We both just took the hottest looking chicks from each of the different mythology decks.  I'm certain that this game was designed to be eye candy for dudes.  And it does a good job at that.  In fact, I will admit that I was tempted to purchase warriors based on looks alone on occasion.  The core gameplay was fun.  I would play it again.  I'd say this is one to pull out at an all guys board game night.  I certainly wouldn't play it with my kids even though it says it's for ages 10+.  A 10-year-old boy would spend more time drooling over the massive amounts of underboob and cleavage than actually concentrating on the game.  And a 10-year-old girl would probably be disgusted by the whole thing.  Yep, definitely a game for a bunch of adult dudes eating pizza and laughing about tits on tumblr.

Siguiendo las reglas al pie de la letra, el juego es injugable. No hay equilibrio por ningún lado, pero es fácilmente parcheable. Con un par de reglas caseras (y dejando a Libra dentro de la caja), el juego mejora muchísimo. Mucho mejor la versión multiplayer por equipos que la de todos contra todos, eso sí. 
Y sobre las ilustraciones, vaya sorpresa me llevé al ver que el ilustrador era chino... flipante.
Pero lo dicho, con un par de reglas, se te queda un deckbuilding muy decente y rejugable.

I've definitely been enchanted by this game's prurient charms!

Rating going down with a couple plays ~ until either a well designed (and necessary) expansion comes along or I can work out some kind of variant which makes the game move more smoothly, this game's rating needs to be cut down (/weep). 

Ten or more turns can go by in the beginning before players even start to build up a good economy and/or combo chain. My preliminary idea is change the "center row" from being random, to something more like dominion/tanto's always-available stacks. That way players can start immediately to work on building archetypes or sculpting their decks, without the unsatisfying grab-fest of random warriors. The costs of the disciple cards and starting deck could also probably use a tweak or two.

I would consider this the best combative deck builder before Star Realms had been released. That said, this and Nightfall seemed to be the only decent ones. Both used a chaining mechanism which was I actually really enjoyed. That said, I didn't like the asymmetric player powers because they didn't feel balanced. While I didn't mind the artwork because I don't mind a bit of T&A and I do enjoy anime, I would have a hard time finding other people to play this one. In the end, it comes down to the fact that I'm just not that fussy on playing physical copies of deckbuilding games at all.

Aweful game.  Add boobs to a terrible deckbuilder with some crappy 'combo' design.  Takes too long to play, terrible theme, bad mechanics, and limited card stock (I seem to recall only 10 goddesses).

RATING: 5
Deck builder in the style of Ascention (draft cards from 6 randomly generated slots), with card chaining along the lines of Nightfall, and add player interaction by being able to attack and defend.

Unfortunately the card balance is off in both the mix of cards (attack vs. defend powers), while chaining of cards is very difficult to acheive (to many colours?) and some "God" abilities are a lot better than others.

Card art and quality is very good but icons could have been used instead of so much text and the text is overwhelmed by the bright colours.

Still looking for that interactive deck builder that actually works well. Unfortunately, this one is not it.

RATING: 6
Pro:
I like the way you have to link or chain cards, and the fact that cards you buy will go to your next hand.
Cons:
The game can potentially become a tug of war over energy/HP. We've implemented a house rule of time limits to try and prevent that.
The artwork may put some people off.

I've played this a few times since receiving it. I find the Gods to be fairly unbalanced. The make-up of the deck is fairly unbalanced. The game forces players to play the aggressive strategy (and that's the only one that can win.) Very Unsatisfied with this game.

RATING: 4.5
Not a bad game, but certainly not a real good one either.  Pretty much standard deckbuilder with a few twists which aren't all that interesting.  Without the art (which is quite good) I don't think there's any way this game seems the light of day.  But even through all this it was reasonably enjoyable to play once.

It's probably the easiest deck builder I've played, and that's actually a nice change of pace. The rules are very straight forward, and simple, and it's easy to setup, and put away. Except for the can.

Things I really like about it:

* When you buy a card it goes on top of your draw pile.
* The action chain system is like what Night Fall did, except this actually works well. Where Night Fall's tends to get in the way.
* Super fast turns.
* The cheese cards never feel too cheesy, and there are times where you'll actually want to buy them!

Most importantly enough I had fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Great art, but the gameplay is just tedious. Tried playing both free-for-all and team match, and there are just too many life-gain and defense cards for the game to go anywhere. It's not like we weren't being aggressive either, every time a card with attack came out it got bought. Still have yet to finish a game because everyone quits when we're two hours in and still at starting life totals.

RATING: 10
My honest opinion: (This is a pure rating of an 8, but due to people dropping the rating because of the Kickstarter, instead of the game itself, I gave it a 10)

I was extremely hyped when I got my copy of this game. I love the anime theme, I actually am a sucker for anime themes. Don't judge, I am just a die hard anime fan -looks in my room-.

 I brought Elder Dragon Vault, triple sleeved( then eventually doubled; using anime sleeve for Tanto Cuore), and even went out to go print out a playmat, in the mentality to probably buy a custom playmat,too. 

I only get to play the game once, and the worst thing to happen is that I had a matchup with Apollo vs Loki. That match somehow lasted extremely too long, and that was the first time I played with my friend. I hoped to play the game more throughout the summer, but it seemed to turn the switch off whenever I pull it out. The gameplay is absolutely wonderful, its just as everyone else says; gods are just unbalanced. I had to eventually play the game where all gods and goddesses have no abilities, just use raw color combo in the playing field. It was much, much better than to include abilities from gods. Playing a bit that day more, I realized some matchups ends quickly and some last for centuries. I would really love to see an expansion, though. Balance out gods and goddesses is a must if there is such expansion.

I would like to say too, the card quality SUCKS. I mean, I can't sugarcoat it, but it really, really does. If I have to triple sleeve it once, it means that the card is extremely valuable, or just pure crap quality. Why? Here's why:

When I got my copy, I literally put on freaken gloves and carefully peeled the shrink wrap, then shuffled through the cards carefully admiring the art(to be honest, I may have over exaggerated on the glove part, but any anime I receive, it will be treated as a king/queen). One of the cards (forgot name, since I packaged it back for resale) had a corner damaged. What kind of damage? The corner on the card is lightly bent inward to the card, and faded color. It's like you peeled the card art from the actual card. That turned me off 100% on quality check. However, when I sleeved that card, it looks as if it was just light reflection. To me, it's hardly noticeable and blends in to reflection.

As to the text, for me, it's perfect size to read. I do admit, playing the game fast, yeah its small, but why place the cards far from where you can't see it? What I mean is, it's legible. If you can read a 12 font on Microsoft Word from a foot away, this is just no problem. THEN AGAIN, I am not a late adult, so my opinion on the text will differ.

This was my first deck-builder game ever. I used to play Weiss and Vanguard, but I love this game. I will miss it, but yeah. If it was reworked, I would love to buy it back in a heartbeat. For me, this was a very good game 10/10 for beginners. What does that mean? I mean that Kanzume Goddess is an amazing game to play to introduce people to deck-building, ESPECIALLY IF THEY LOVE ANIME.

Not only is this a great filler but it is also a game I would be happy to play several times in a row.  Set up and break down are very quick.  Good variety of ways to achieve victory and the combos are made more interesting by the color restraint.  Played 6 consecutive 2-player games my first sitting (I wanted to try all of the Norse gods).

For those that are let down by the T&A, don't be. The artwork is amazing!! And the card design is much better than other deckbuilder games.

This game is probably the easiest deckbuilder I played. The game goes by fast once all players know what cards do what. Some complain that the text font is too small but once you learn all the cards, you won't need to read what Aquarius does but you will already know its the draw 2 card.

Still disappointed that Aphrodite isn't in this game lol xD

A decent deck-builder, and 'easy on the eyes' (unless you're squinting at the gods' powers text). The team-play aspect is fun, but free-for-all is NOT. Unfortunately, the gods' powers are unbalanced: some are uber-powerful, some are situationally useful, and some are almost worthless. We frequently ignore the gods' powers when we play (easier to teach it this way as well).

i am so disappoint kanzume goddess

This game needs a (very well designed) expansion, baaaad. It's almost an interesting game, but it feels incredibly clunky and poorly designed. The variable player abilities are largely either totally broken or flat and uninteresting (no deeper strategic ramifications, I can just do this other thing). 

It's tough to pull off combos, they aren't very satisfying, and the randomization mechanic in the center removes waaaaaay too much strategy for a deck builder. You get two or three warriors early, you probably just won.

The defense mechanism also makes two player games unplayable. Unless you're interested in every turn being (A: 2 attack, B: I defend 2, A: alright 2 more attack, B: I defend 2 more k good turn my turn rinse and repeat).

It's too little of a game at 200 cards. A good base set for a dbg is at least 300 imho and with battle and avatars, this game feels about half the size it should be. It also feels only half play tested in terms of color chain balancing, God balancing and how the market is randomized.

Cardstock is crap (hold it next to a Magic card and it feels like a cheap knock off) and requires immediate sleeving, and as I'm sure you already know, the tin is insanely impractical (does not fit sleeved cards back in).

Pluses are that the artwork is very nice! And uh... the Chinese version has a promo set where all (some?) of the cards are cosplaying models, which sounds -hilarious-, but is completely and totally impossible to get in the US.

I used to give this game the credit of innovating the color chain system, until I learned that that's a complete rip from Nightfall, and the market works the same way Ascension does but with about half the cards, so it's twice as likely to get dupes in the market. It doesn't even innovate, it's just a mish-mosh of jacked mechanics with nice artwork on top.

Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of this game.

Essen '13.

Deckbuilder where you try to eliminate the other player(s), or get to 25 energy yourself. Has the Nightfall chaining mechanism, but only for your own cards (no chaining off the other player's cards). And the cards you buy go on your deck, not in your discard pile, that took some getting used to (but it does work).

Deckbuilder w mangowej oprawie, w którym wcielamy się w bóstwa z mitoligi nordyckiej i greckiej. Mangowa? - plus. Mitologia grecka + nordycka? - kolejny plus. Niestety mechanika trochę nawala. Karty bogów są niezbalansowane, a niektóre z wojowniczek dość przegięte w porównaniu do pozostałych. Potrafi to zaboleć głównie ze względu na losowe rozmieszczenie kart w stosach. Poza tym gdy ktoś gra mocno defensywnie to ubicie go potrafi trwać godzinami. Jednak w odpowiednim gronie daje radę się fajnie przy tym bawić, a możliwość gry w 6 osób też jest niewątpliwą zaletą.

Thoroughly enjoyed Kanzume Goddess for so many repeated plays that my thick sleeves actually started to wear and now need replacing. The game is a great team game pitting players against each other. Would love a big expansion to this game to add more cards. I rate it an 8 for its pure confrontational nature. There are way too many solo deck builders that this game is a refreshing change.

The first player to get Aquarius (remove from play x cards in hand; draw 2*x cards) basically wins the game. End of story. Remove all copies of it for a fair and balanced game. Bianfeng Games/Japanime should publish an expansion with more remove from play effects to make Aquarius more balanced (maybe a set about Shinto kami, Judeochristian angels/prophets, and/or Hindu avatars).

Cylindrical tin the game's packaged in makes what should be a portable game not as portable. It also doesn't accommodate sleeves. Also has a tendency to bend the cards, without the plastic insert inside. Very frustrating.

Also, the translation of the name is completely inappropriate. It should've just been "Canned Goddess". Using a Japanese word in the English title totally gives people the wrong impression about where it's from (it's from China).

Believe it or Don't, this one was purchased with my eldest daughter In mind:
She was an avid Anime fan, and had grown up on a steady diet of Sailor Moon and Pretty Sammy.
The art proved a bit too callipygian, and the gameplay a bit too flat (see what I did there...?)

This one had a bit of infamy in that quite a few people failed to receive various non-gameplay related 'extras',
and the campaign took quite a bit of flack for tardiness.

For me? This one was a Gamble, but I'd still say I broke even.

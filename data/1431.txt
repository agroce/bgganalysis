How did such a bad cartoon of a game give birth to such a remarkable simulation in "Victory In The Pacific"??  Even AH admitted this was just a silly beer-&-pretzels fist-full-of-dice GAME. Looking for a simulation of the Battle of the Atlantic?: look elsewhere.

Very dated by todays standards. I taught my 9 year old son how to play last week, he thought it was kind of boring, but wanted to try some new things.  I would have to agree with him.  Victroy in the Pacific is a better play, combine the two for tiny monster madness.  It's ok, but like I said dated and UGLY!!

Pulled this out while waiting for "Nine Navies", the Decision Games WW I game using the same system.  I liked WAS for quick and easy playing, not really all that deep and ultimately does not give me the sense of partcipating in history.  Hoping Nine Navies does a better job...

Update:  Nine Navies is the same system, with 10 times as many ships and takes 10 times as long to play.  Prefer WAS!

RATING: 7.5
Light introductory wargame.  This is not a simulation by any means and was initially meant to be an introductory wargame to get gamers interested in more detailed AH games.  Personally I think of this game as Yahtzee at sea.  Its a quick fun game.

I increased my rating for this game due to more playings.  It has a high luck factor which makes it very replayable.  You still need to devise and followthrough on your strategy.

Have no desire to go back to this game. Victory in the Pacific was a big improvement, and even that is awfully dated by today&#039;s standards. Contrary to what others may say, I do not believe this is a good introductory game as it is simply way too far behind the power curve. Wargames have come a long way in 25 years.

Roll a 6, sink a ship. Well, it is not quite that simplistic. This is primarily a game, with little simulation value except in a most abstract sense. Victory points are awarded on the basis of clever positioning of units and dumb luck, and a little dumb luck can always make for a competitive and fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An excellent game that plays in 90 minutes. Good for novice players as much of the game mechanics are fairly intuitive.

The Avalon Hill version has a much more attractive map than the Jedko edition.

I have both the Jedko and Avalon Hill versions. There is a difference regarding the POC value of the North Sea.

RATING: 7
Avalon Hill.  Great, really fun basic war game of naval combat in WWII in the Atlantic and Mediterranean.  Lots of dice and easy to learn and play.  Not realistic.  Lots of capital ships get sunk during the course of play and if you are a naval enthusiast, you'll love all the ships you get to "play with".  A cool War at Sea variant was also published by Avalon Hill which adds the French Navy, and some other minor power ships.  This is a good game for teaching a new player how to war game and just a fun, really basic game for passing away an evening.

[Edwards] Brilliant little wargame that can be tought and completed in a few short hours. There are a decent amount of strategic decisions, a little bit of min-maxing, and whole lot of fun in the game. Lots and lots of dice guarantee that both sides will have lucky shots and dry streaks every game. Furthermore, those lucky streaks are what make each game unique and downright fun; otherwise it would surely become a scripted excercise. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A light naval strategic wargame concerning operations in the Atlantic in WWII. The map is divided into areas. The actual fighting between ships is resolved in an abstract mode. The main goal is to hold superiority in most areas in order to win the game. There is some planning, air support and submarines but fate of battleships is left to dice. Just right to kill some time and introduce others to the hobby.

This is a much lighter version of Victory in the Pacific. Well, I played VitP first, so I think of it that way. Apparently, this was the precursor to VitP. In any case, I like the simple mechanics of this game system, combined with some deep strategy. Players have to make difficult choices about managing resources, especially early in the game. As you can see from my one play, I didn't make very good ones, but even though I got beaten badly, I enjoyed the game. I'd definitely like to play this some more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a rating from childhood plays, I need to play it again and see what it is really like.  I remember thinking it was 'ok' but that the Germans didn't have a chance.  Who knows if we even played it right...  I don't mind the board art and like it's simplicity and small size.  I'd like to dig into this old game since short weeknight wargames are at a premium in my life.

Update: played again and the game is nice but the dice rolling to resolve the combats is never ending.  I'd love this one with a CRT to simplify the process.  Not a huge problem, and I may get used to it.

RATING: 7
Back when I used to play this with my oldest brother (who taught me how to play it), I would play the Allies and he'd always win as the Axis.  Hope I'd do better if I played it now.  Tried it again via VASSAL, and it's okay.  More fun with the actual wargame playing against another person, but if you're snowed-in (like I am, the weekend of 2-7-10), it's better than nothing ... and no loose pieces to put back in the box at the end of the game.  Played this face-to-face with real player on 5-1-2010 and lost for same reason I did via VASSAL (Italian Navy destruction and area control more important than destroying German ships).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is a very interesting game. One can learn to play it in an evening, but the strategic possibilities are vast. It won't teach you about the effectiveness of British secondary mounts against Italian cruisers, it's not a detail oriented game. I couldn't even call it operational, although there are tactical decisions to make during battle rounds. Where competent players put their mental effort is in the direction of overall strategy, especially as that must evolve as the game develops.

Lots of dice? That's a good thing! If you believe in statistics, the more dice the better. If you don't want a game with a lot of dice rolling involved, try craps. One roll might be all you need (or get!).

I love to play this game. Find a worthy, smart opponent and you'll find out why.

My rating would have been 9 if the components were a little dressier. The person who is responsible for the map in the AH version should be punished for that. ;)

One of my first real war games.  This game is one of the easiest war games to learn.  The pieces are ships of the WW II era, from the countries of USA, Germany, Great Britian, and Italy.  It is a good introduction to war gaming.  There are a few things that I don't care for in the game such as some parts of the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterinean Sea are off limits for certain countries.  I also don't think the game has too much playability.

A very simple, very elegant introduction to WWII wargaming using (only) capital ships, area control sea warfare game set in the European theater of operations.

NOT a complex game.  NOT a detailed game.  It 'is' exactly what it is intended to be.  A fun, quick, simple game that can be played in a hour or two.  I have played this with my 8-year old and I bought my copy when I was 7 and still enjoy a game of this on occasion.

Simply one of the best introductory/fast play wargames I have ever played in over 40 years of board-wargaming.

It's a fairly fun game although I don't think it's as simple as advertised.  It has many different elements that have to be juggled.  While not an overly complex game, I don't think this is really good introduction to wargaming.  Depending on your type of game, I think something like Kriegspiel or Nieuchess is a good introduction, especially if you like the hex type of game.

A fun game where you roll a lot of dice. It seems as if the allies have the advantage but whoever gets on a hot streak with the dice could dominate. It seems as when playing the allies it might not be worth putting any ships down to fight with the Italian ships and just conceding that area and using the ships elsewhere. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice, light wargame. Doesn't have too much in the way of realism, but as a game it's pretty good. The "sequel", Victory in the Pacific, presents a longer, more involved, and finally more interesting take on more or less the same game system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Somewhat fun and evenly balanced (give the Germans a VP), it usually comes down to getting a couple of convoys through to Russia, or not.  There doesn't seem to be a viable Med strategy; if you fight the Italians you will be too weak to contain the Germans and their U-boats.

Good fun wargame with relatively simple rules, clean mechanics, the need for careful thought (especially from the Allies, who need to avoid costly mistakes) but one of the ugliest boards around. Cleaned up, this could still stand as a good intro level wargame (as could its longer-to-play cousin, Victory in the Pacific).

Here's an example of a simple game with lots of strategy.  I really like to play, but the nuances escape me... I have only ever won this game once (as the German player) and I've played well over 100 times.  I'll keep trying until I 'get it.'

A great little game with virtually no rules volume and an "open" situation where players can decide for themselves how they want to win the battle of the Atlantic.  Mechanically quite straightforward, but with a fair amount of tension in the speed rolls (will all my fleet show where I have sent it?) and combat (which comes in three flavors - ASW (anti-submarine warfare), air strikes and surface engagements).  Really quite a nice surprise.

Low complexity wargame that is wonderful for introducing kids to the hobby.  My 35 year old copy has seen so much use the pieces have faded severely.  Not a historical simulation by any means, (a true recreation of the surface action that actually occurred in the Atlantic would be boring indeed) the game does have some depth in strategy that isn't initially apparent.  Check out the Boardgamer magazine articles for more detailed strategy discussion.

Highly recommended!

Not my cup of tea.  Naval combat with area naval movements.  Dated production in terms of map and counters. System-wise, there are a lot more published since its original release in 1976.  L2 is going to have a new edition of the game with updated graphics.     
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I bought this on eBay for $7 (Cdn), just to try it out. The scale is very grand, with WWII encompassing all of 8 turns, and map covering the Atlantic Ocean and connected waters. Yet the playing pieces represent some of the individual ships that participated.

On the box, and on the front page of the rules book, it plainly states that this is intended to be an introduction to war gaming. More than that though, the rules book explains that it's intended to be a 'what if' scenario, namely what if germany had made a more focused effort to wage war at sea. 

This game has a very simple set of rules, yet there's enough complexity to bring a tiny bit above the level of a game like 'Risk'. The combat system relies on a lot of dice rolling, like 'Risk', but the pieces in the game have varying strengths and weaknesses, unlike 'Risk'. It's an original game, with enough depth to qualify as a war game, but relatively easy rules & combat system. 

What it intends to do, it does well.

Still a great game after so many years.  I got my first copy by mail direct purchase from Avalon Hill in 1976. I loved it then and after my recent solitaire play, I can see the game has aged very well.  I think it holds it own against newer games.  The first game I know that did not use a CRT...a common mechanic now, but really new and exciting then.  I also managed to get a face to face game in recently.  Played very well.  Fast play and exciting.  Highly recommend this game.

A fun, simple war game, mainly with ships but also involving planes. Provides a nice break from more involved war games, when one is in the right mood for something that explicitly was designed to be an abstracted game rather than a simulation. Take it for what it is, and have some fun. Was on my radar for a long time. With this game in particular I find the strategy tips of David G. Cox (on BGG) are very useful. Bought an unpunched copy, Nov. 2011.

A true beer and pretzels game. Only remotely historical in some aspects but entertaining as all get out and a game that I can be persuaded to play anytime with a spare couple of hours.

I think that this was the 2nd wargame that I ever owned and I enjoyed playing it immensely.  It appears that the same basic mechanic may still be in use in a couple newer games such as "Grand Fleet", "High Seas Fleet", and "Nine Navies War", so I gave it a 7.5 since it seems to have "stood the test of time".

Overall, its a fairly fast and simple yet enjoyable and even maybe kind of informative game to play.

A classic "beer and pretzels" (or in my case, "beer and cookies") game.  Lots of dice, but also lots of strategy.

I like the game, but the non-historical aspect of it (ie German ships that never appeared in the war)annoyed me so much I lowered its rating.

A good game.  There are a few basic strategies for each side which may take a couple playings to learn.  The British need to balance their defenses and cause attrition on the Axis, while the Axis make hit-and-run attacks and try to maintain open raiding lanes.

If you like this game, I encourage you to try Victory in the Pacific which uses the same system, but is a more substantial and interesting game.

Glad I'd played another war game recently or this would have turned me off trying them again.  Too much dice with nothing to do but dice---the lack of real places to move hurts this one for me.  It's slam all the ships together and hope for the best. :(

Predecessor to VITP.  I liked the area movement and it had several viable options as the allies.  The Axis often just had to react to what the Allies did as I reall.  Bombat was a bit too dicey., but the games seemed balanced and tense with lots of decision making.

There is something I really like about this game.  I like the British decisions about which sea areas to cover, I like the Axis decisions about where and when to fight and I like sinking all those ships with a ton of dice rolls.  I'm wondering if I will ever move on to VITP.  Quite fun and quick playing.

Nostalgia rules. First game at age 11, could not rate any lower. Fun to play, although the rules were a struggle for a newbie, being highly abstract with no turn examples (only combat rounds) and no designer notes.

High luck factor, but good decisions will usually win the day. The abstractions are not as unrealistic as they might appear, if looked at in a certain way. Ships in the same sea area trading shots could be looked as attrition results from search and chase as much as from combat, for example.

All in all, a good feel for the subject. No one has really done a detailed Battle of the Atlantic grand campaign game that I know of, unless only U-boats count, so this will have to do. 

Can be linked with Victory in the Pacific.

I like "Dice at Sea" and am looking forward to playing it more often than just at the WBC. 
5/24/05 - Updated rating (from 6.5 to 7) after playing Malloc. I hope we can get some more plays in before the WBC.
9/9/04 - Upped my rating again... all the way to an 8. I may not always agree to play it, but it sure is fun and I'm almost always willing to play it.

For a WWII buff like me the fun came from moving ships on the mapboard. But this is really an abstract game that pretends to be a wargame. There's an expansion kit but I don't see the point.

Was a quick fun game in its day, though not very "realistic". Quite a change from what AH was putting out at the time. Prefer the more complex and interesting Victory in the Pacific.

Fair game that I think is made obsolete by its younger sibling, Victory in the Pacific.

RATING: 6
Old-school wargame whose claim to fame is that players are guaranteed to roll dice for 90 minutes straight, although I can imagine that the Axis can effectively be knocked out in 10-20 minutes if they roll or play poorly.

Reasonable, if not insanely repetitive, introduction to grognardery for teens or pre-teens - if you're not morally opposed to such a thing.

Quick to play, lots of units.  Game definately shows its age in the quality of the components, but it does okay at what it sets out to do (provide a quick-play strategic level view of North Atlantic WW2 naval warfare)

Great little game to introduce new gamers to the hobby but very luck dependent due to all the die rolling. Easy to learn that plays in less than an hour once you've played it once or twice.

Affectionately known as "Yahtzee at Sea". Rated a 5 for nostalgia since it was the 2nd wargame I owned. Victory in the Pacific is a much better "intro" wargame.

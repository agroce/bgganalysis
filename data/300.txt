Light, should be fun, but somewhat boring.  Good design, interesting concept, just doesn't execute as well as it could.  Many other games I would rather play.  Not a bad game by any stretch, just doesn't captivate me enough to keep me away from a lot of my better games.

Another pretty simple game, also purchased to play with the family. Knizia is the lord of game design, but this one doesn't do it for me. It has a rather lengthy set up, looks rather odd when you're done, and amounts to an abstract. It's too odd to be enjoyable.

RATING: 6
[original rating: 7.5] Yeah, the endgame can be disappointing (kingmakey), but getting there is sure cool.

[years later]

Now that the reprint is out, I've gotten in a few more more plays, and the endgame is still just as disappointing (kingmakey)... but, uh... getting there isn't as cool as I remember it.  I still like the simplicity of moving forward/taking a tile, and the "board" just looks fun, but maybe this should only be played as a two or a three-player.

A good strategy game for the whole family.  Some people have trouble getting used to the move-as-many-spaces-as-you-like mechanic.  Also the setup is painfully long and fiddly.  But the gameplay is fast, and the victory will always sneak up on you as players make long-term plans and realize that they may never come to fruition because someone else can quickly use up their coins and win the game.

Acceptable and short set collection game.  Not super fun, but interesting enough to keep you thinking for a few minutes.  Set up and take down are probably too long for how long the game is.  Can't see really pushing this one out on the table too often, if ever.

Nice little game that's essentially a mechanic with a tiny bit of theme attached. There's a lot of analysis you can do, and many different strategies available.

I like this set-collecting game a lot - the 'take what you want but no going back' mechanism is an interesting one - encouraging you both to hurry on ahead to pick the low hanging fruit and to hang back to be sure you win the tie breaks.  For a change the second edition is an improvement of the original - a more compact box with a nice chunky pyramid and at a very reasonable price.  Kids like it too, which is a bonus.

RATING: 6
Played this once with 2 players.  Game would be great if 1) you could keep track of what needed to be scored (can be fixed with a nice homemade mat where dead could be placed)  and 2) they didn't pick the worst colors I have seen for a game (other than Keythedral), making the game nearly unplayable for color blind people such as myself.  It must get frustrating for others for me to ask every 3 seconds what color something is, just to realize that whatever color they tell me doesn't really mean anything in the context of all the tiles in the game.  If you are not colorblind, then you having nothing to worry about and it becomes a good Knizia addition to your collection.

A surprisingly decent lightweight set collection game. You pick up tiles along a track, and on your turn you decide how far you want to move... possibly passing up some "low hanging fruit" for something you really want.

I got this hoping to be able to play it with my 5yo.  But, after playing it once, it's clearly too much for that age.  It's not bad, as set collection (area control, really) goes, but others are better.  Two major problems: (1) set up is rather annoying for what you get out of it (similar set up to Walk the Dogs, but that game is much better), and (2) pretty severe kingmaking issues at the end of the game.  (Traded away.)

I really like the countering forces in this game of wanting to grab good/beneficial tiles, and not wanting to zip too far ahead that others are able to get stuff unopposed. You can taste the 'Knizia influence' underneath the thin theme. But, it works fine for me. I think the large pyramid piece does something magical that makes the game work. Anyway, its a cool piece.

There was no coin slot in the pyramid of my copy.  So I cut out the slot myself.  Works great.  Would have been super weak without it (having to lift up the pyramid to put your coins [i]under[/i] instead of thru the top slot as originally intended).  Nice job!

Interesting little game here.  Very portable.  Was just okay with 2 players.  I see it being better with more.

I enjoy set collection games, so this one went over relatively well for me.  I've only played 2 player so far - I think more would be interesting, but might get bogged down with AP.  2 p. was nice for a relatively short filler game without too many people to keep track of.  Players must be judicious in the use of their pharaoh and gold bag tiles and should try to make sure not to let one player gain a monopoly on the larger value sets.  Fun game - just not one that I think will come out frequently (playing with a distracted 8 y.o. didn't help - we'll see if ratings improve with a more focused opponent).
Edit:  Having now played Big Points, I think I prefer that one -- quicker, smoother gameplay will allow that to come out more often.

RATING: 5
Components: The Amigo version has nice graphics, but the sandy background and the complexity of the graphics makes it difficult to quickly distinguish the different items.  The Out of the Box edition has very clean graphics, but the choice to have multiple sets feature the same (though differently-colored) image is questionable.  I like the plastic coins, and the coin and tile slots built into the pyramid and box insert.

Experience: Somewhat interesting set collection game.  There is much uncertainty about how many of a type will be necessary for a majority.  A very sleek movement system, allowing players to move as far as they like, but at the cost of fewer options later on.  Unlike most set collecting games, there is no restriction on a player collecting any one item; but collecting any one item does restrict which other items may be collected, which I think is brilliant.  The game also features much tension surrounding the endgame condition, as a player could rid themself of their final point/chip before other players are able to complete their big sets.

Update: I don't disagree with the above, mechanically, but it's not all that tense with three players.

Simple Knizia filler that plays in about 15 minutes. A gazillion tiles depicting Egyptian artifacts are lined up to form the "board", and then players work along the line claiming artifacts for themselves. Artifacts are scored when the set is completely removed, and majorities awarded. First to the set number of victory points wins. A very clean design yet needs the FAQ to resolve some tricky timing issues. Can bog down towards the end, with a player not in contention deciding who wins (not so good).  Basically a reworked design from Neu Spiele im Alten Rome, and a good example of "early Reiner" (i.e. a flaw or two!).  Just seen the new edition from Out of the Box - nice compact size compared to the Amigo edition, with crisp art.  Game is still the same.

Another single-mechanic game aka light.  In some games like this (such as Glen More), the player who is last goes next - even if they get two turns in a row.  (If this is a rule for this game, we missed it.) However, it seems that absence of that rule could be exploited, with whomever is in the lead bringing the game to a swift end.

I was surprised to be so lukewarm on this game because it has many elements I like.  First I like Reiner Knizia's games generally speaking; I like tile games and games where the setup is different every time, and I like games with a minimum of rules; Good components too. It reminded me of That's Life! and although different, I would always choose that that game over this one.  So, I was a little disappointed.

The set up takes a little while, but once it is it's super-strategic.  The decisions can be painful, especially when you are playing with the full set of players.  I do like this game a lot -- though, as mentioned in some of the forums there is definitely some kingmaker aspects.  Actually, most of the times I've played, the winner was determined by someone elses play.  It's still fun.

Tutankhamen is one of the typical light Knizias: simple rules, no hidden information, and a few interesting ways of scoring (or preventing others from doing the same). It plays very quickly so is well-suited as a short filler but cannot really go beyond that.

My kids really enjoy this game.  We almost immediately chucked the idea of putting coins in the slot fo putting them in one of the half of the game box.  It moved the game along greatly.  We quickly developed a lingo for purple heads, gold doggies, brown kitties and bugs to help each other move.  I was the only one who asked why an archeologist would be paying tribute to a long dead pharoh... wouldn't they be seeking money or fame??  I discarded these thoughts and went back to having fun with the kids (11-12) and to enjoy watching them develop and try different tactics.  This was a great purchace I found in a clearance bin and the best money I have spent in a long time.

An idea so simple that it sounds banal, yet somehow a good, tense game emerges.  That's the very essence of Knizia's "early period" design style.  Tutanchamun might rate a point higher if it eliminated, or at least concealed, the endgame kingmaking scenarios that sometimes arise.

RATING: N/A
When I looked at the rules, I asked myself "Is there really a game here?"

The answer is, yes. The pieces are a lot of fun but, as long as you have at least three players, this is a game full of brinkmanship.

After the board is laid out, there are no random elements but the other players will do enough to keep you guessing.

2005 acquisition.  We've only played 2-player games so far and the impression hasn't been great.  The setup time is quite long compared with the actual gameplay.  The pyramid is cute but seems somewhat gimicky.  We feel that it may be a better game with more people.

A brilliant system, but kingmaking at the end is virtually guaranteed (even though it's often unintentional).

A good quick filler that can play up to 6 people. Nice feature: as you play score tiles, you can put up the game too (ie: throw them back into the box).

Obvious tip that might not seem obvious: Whatever tiles are the last few in front of the pyramid, you might want to steer clear of collecting. All of the tokens of a set must have been picked up (from players and/or being passed by all players) so if it is near the very end, the likelihood of that set scoring is very low.

A short okay set collection filler, would be good for kids, for adults ‘ok’ but really almost nothing to think about or decide on. There is a "little" bit of looking around and choosing which pieces to collect but really that is IT, nothing more to it. It does end fast, a pain to setup, typical pasted theme, potential kingmaking near the end. Reminded me of Cartagena

Having played this around the same time as Bunte Runde, I have to say that I greatly prefer Bunte Runde.  The set-up time for Tutankhhamen is annoying long, making the winding trail toward the pyramid.  I think the mechanics are very novel - having the freedom to move as far ahead as you want in order to collect your sets is interesting and provides for more of a game than you would expect from only reading the rules.  I have to commend Out of the Box for the nice price, very compact box and good quality materials.  But why are the instructions separated in two parts?  That silly fact alone kept me from playing this game for months.  The instructions aren't long at all, but having to go through two things for some reason always turned me away.

Simple tile game, felt very similar to Atlantis, but less punishing to someone who falls behind. Odd that the main selling point of the game seems to be the large plastic pyramid which is little more than a glorified piggy bank. I wonder how much money they could have saved in production costs if they'd just printed out the tiles. Anyway, it's a good filler.

RATING: 7
There is more here than meets the eye. Since everything is out in the open, you can try to plan moves in advance. I am not yet sure on a basic strategy- concentrate on the 6s and 8s, or is there a benefit to scooping up a few freebie 1 and 2s along the way. The few times we have played this, I have stumbled on the endgame.

My kids adore it, and it's a great family game.  Not a group favorite, so it gets played more at home.

Set collection boiled down to its essence.  Tutankhamen is a very fun filler game.  It doesn't have a ton of depth, but it's much deeper than people initially give it credit for.  This game also seems to hit its sweet spot at 3-4 players.  With 6 it's a bit too chaotic.

This game has an interesting mechanic as players seek to score a certain amount of points as they advance along a 'track' of artefacts. Once all the items in any artefact are exhausted, either by being al picked up or the last player on the track has passed that particular item, then that item is scored.

This game seems a little over produced and the box is certainly too large for what it houses, but that said I'd still play again.

This is a set collection game where tiles are lined up on a track and players move forward, collecting colors as they go.

When all the coins from one player are gone, the game ends.

Ancient Egypt exploration themed game by Knizia. Randomly construct a path using the many artificats. Players can go as far as they want up the path claiming tiles, but can never go backwards. Artifacts passed by all explorers are removed. Scoring is triggered when the last of an artificat is removed. It's very light, but clever at the same time. Once, a player left close to the end of the game, and he ended up winning the game! Make sure you have enough table space when constructing the path.

The updated OOB version of the game gives everyone gold coins. Once artifcats are scored, players deposit coins in to the pyramid. First player to get rid of all their coins wins, adding a racing element to the game.

Played once.  Another clever Knizia game that works, but is too dry and calculating for my tastes.  I should play it again though, because despite winning my first game, I didn't really have any idea about good strategies until the game was almost over; I guess I did something right, but maybe I'll like the game better once I know what I'm supposed to be doing ;-)

First impression (3 player): Technically taking this is no-luck abstract (theme is flavor only) game after setup. Luckily though there is enough chaos even with 3 players that it doesn't feel too calcutable even though you probably can overdo it if you're towards Analysis Paralysis. Most likely will get too chaotic with 5 or 6 players.

The tiles are layed out in a row. Players begin at the start of the row and move as far forward as they like, but never backwards. They collect the tile they land on. If a player moves so that there are tiles left behind the last marker, these are discarded. When the last of a particular collection is gathered (or discarded), that collection scores points for first and second.

The obvious strategy is to gather tiles in the collections which have the last tile as close to the start of the row as possible. These will score sooner. Secondly, watch what gets discarded and gather tiles in those collections ... there are less pickups required to secure points. Finally, try and force your opponents into plays that will help end collections and help you score.

Its not bad for 30 minutes, but its one of those games where you get to the end and wonder what you actually did to do well, or not. The strategy is fairly uncomplicated, a lot of the turns are fairly innocuous but some require thought. It takes almost as long to set up as it does to play (slight exaggeration mode on). The other issue is that it's abstract and all information is open, meaning don't play with those with analysis paralysis who wish to process all possible moves because any fun to be had will leach away very quickly.

The simplicity of the rules is elegant - I'm surprised it doesn't get more attention for that.

Brilliant in its simplicity.

This is a clever abstract and one of Reiner Knizia's better games. A long line of counters is laid out with objects from different sets (sets are 1 to 8 in size). Players move along the line any distance (but never backwards) claiming the piece they land on. Once a whole set is claimed (or discarded because the pieces have been passed by all players) it is scored, the player with the most pieces taking it and the next player half. Its a race to reach a particular points total.
The rules and game are very simple, they play quickly, there is no random element after you set up, but the game is challenging and tense. Knizia really is at his best with these sort of games.

RATING: 10
I can't believe this game is ranked so low. Weird. It rocks!

From the moment we got it out of the box I was beyond impressed. Wonderful idea. Simple. Rocko says: a 10.

However, this needs said:
***This game requires a specific house rule (the necessity of which I will explain below.)

Trust me, it is REQUIRED in order to play properly:
YOU MUST KEEP ALL COINS HIDDEN AT ALL TIMES!!!

You must a) keep the coins you have left HIDDEN at all times or b) invert the coin mechanic and keep your coins HIDDEN at all times.

here is what I mean by invert: This game uses a cool mechanic where you Start with some coins, then try to get rid of them. The first player to get rid of all coins is the winner. To 'invert' this mechanic: start with no coins, take coins as you earn them, and the first player to get the 'starting amount' is the winner, ie start with 25 coins, then first player to 25 is the winner. (I think the starting amount is diff for each pos # of players).

*** Here is why you should keep them hidden instead of in front of you, Especially if you are not 'inverting' the payment mechanism:

How do I say this? Ok. OFTEN you will find yourself in a situation where two players are in close competition for 2nd place and 1st place. 

Unfortunately, because of the coin mechanics, in this situation, a THIRD player (who is absolutely NOT going to win or take 2nd place) MUST take a turn which will end the game AND decide which of the other 2 players will win.

There is no incentive for this 3rd player to choose one way or the other, except to maximize their own profits, which they know will not win the game. 

So basically the loser get to decide who the winner is.

This is because each players coins are visible on the table, and everyone can see who is going to win or take 2nd place BEFORE the last few turns of the losing players happen.

So those players can take turns, Must take turns, which determine who wins and who loses between the high end players.

Its all really messy and people will get upset.

So to fix this: HIDE ALL COINS

Poof! problem solved.

Rocko for the win. Thank me later. peaceout.

While the Out of the Box version is compact, I'm not crazy about the plastic coins and the coin bank. Why are we giving back coins to the pyramid? Let's celebrate centuries of plundering cultures! I do like the mummified cat illustration, though. Obviously. And taking things is even more fun than buying things. This is a very light set collection game whose greatest pleasure is that it is relaxing.

This is a rather simple set collection game where you are rewarded for finishing first or second in number of items.

In addition, scoring the items as they leave the game makes for some interesting timing issues.  Be careful!

This is almost a really great game.  I quite enjoyed playing it and I felt that there were fun decisions to be had, but toward the end of the game you have to math everything out and soon it is never worth it to take your turns.  Normally, I don't mind kingmaker situations, but this just becomes ridiculous.  

What begins at light and fun really just bogs down in overanalysis, with many players realizing that they are going to lose well before the end.  I'm not sure if there is a solution for me.

Another one of those deceptively simple (but thought provoking) Knizia fillers.

Players pick up a sequence of tiles to collect majorities within sets. You need to watch what other players are doing to maintain your position and to stop them scoring big.

I've got the delightfully over-produced yet inexpensive Out-of-the-box edition - will this ever arrive in UK?

Played incorrectly the first time due to poorly worded rules (thought there was a rule to say you couldn't pick up a tile if you had already passed over one of the others in that set - but all they really needed to say was that you can't go backwards). Played correctly it was an interesting affair - one of Dr K's better fillers (although setup time almost takes it out of the filler category).

There are 69 artifact tiles in the game of Tutanchamun. These are shuffled and then laid out randomly in a long, serpentine trail. Players take turns choosing any tile from the trail, but can never turn back to choose a tile they have already passed. There are 15 different sets of tiles (three sets each of 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1), and when the last tile of any set has been claimed, the player holding the most in that set scores that number of points, while the player holding second most scores half that number. Complicating matters, there are also three tie-breaker tiles and three tiles that let you "buy" a tile from another player. It's an exercise in numbers that plays quickly, probably 30 minutes tops, and is suitable for youngsters yet susceptible to analysis. The game has a unique layout and a brightly-colored Egyptian pharaoh look. The new edition by Out of the Box Publishing games has different graphics, but is otherwise substantially similar to the original.

This game was the predecessor of another game from Schmidt Spiele Easy Play Big Points. This is a perfect information game where players more down the track to collect tiles. Once they reach the pyramid, no more tiles are collected. There is a certain tension to the game as players try to collect sets of tiles to score. The imminent threat that one player will move all the way to the end to finish the game is quite real. However, there is something lacking in this very simple game. I cannot quite pinpoint it. I am a huge fan of Knizia, but even some of his designs like this and Gold Digger, I don't quite get. I prefer Knizia's medium weight designs. His lighter fair is either a hit or miss and this one is a miss.

Played with 2 and with 4, and there's a good tactical challenge in there.  Though it has a random setup, the rest of the game has perfect information, and it makes for many tough decisions, based on what you think the other player is going to do.  I think it better serves its purpose as a 2- or 3-player game, as there aren't as many people between your turns.

Collecting tiles on the way to the pyramid. First to score the required number of points wins.

Nothing remarkable here, but it's a decent game of set collection.

It is a Knizia and I like it.
Light, but with a twist.

extremely simple but interesting game with non-trivial decisions to take, no luck, just trying to overwit your opponents. maybe not a lot of replayability but wonderful with younger players

I didn't quite get the strategy at first and I would remove the pyramid at the end of the game (such that players would deposit their coinage into the game box instead). It was initially difficult to remember that you don't want coins, and it took me a while to get the hang of this game's rules, but I won my first game and found it simple, quick, and fun by the end. A good game overall, definitely one worth playing but not one I'd seek out. I like the theme and the mechanics but the strategy is still beyond me.

A nice light/medium set collection game.  Out of the Box version is very decent and compact.

Actually a pretty good old knizia game but the out of the box edition with which I played loses points for terrible production quality. however on further plays I think there could be a kingmaker issue where a player can decide who gets to lose there points first and take the game..

We now know that the reason for the downfall of Egyptian civilization is that they failed to keep their eye on the big coin on the pyramid.  As it were.

Just enough angst to make it a good game. The new rules are slightly different from the old ones.

RATING: 7
Set collection/area majority with a clever mechanic, cute art, and a nifty plastic pyramid. A little bit mathsy, feels almost like it should be solvable, but it works well as a game. Plays very fast.

Overall a good filler.

A nice short session game that requires a deceptively high level of strategy.  Works perfect for 2 players.  I could imagine it becoming a little frustrating with more.

Light game experience.  It is good to play with children.  Move along a path and collect sets of treasures.  Score for having majority of several sets of treasures.  It the end of the path, the person who accumulated the greatest score wins.

It's rare to play something with a mechanic that feels unique, but Tutanchamun qualifies.  The balance of acquiring the more valuable tiles and trying to figure out how to get the to score is fantastic.  Out of the Box version is really nice looking too, probably the best looking game I've seen from them.

(Trade Interest: high) not too bad for a set collection game.  needs more plays to discover whether it is good for a Knizia.  there is some strategy in whether to complete an artifact set, or wait for someone else to do it.

Nice little game with more strategy than it looks, and I can imagine kids liking the "stick money in the bank" aspect.

A rather dry game where a player tries to collect as many majorities as possible before another player ends the game. The game therefore revolves around keeping track of how much money other players have and which majorities they are currently winning. The main interaction between players come from that.

Artwork and game components quality are average. Rules are easy to explain and game time is quite short.

RATING: 5.5
Quick, light and a little bit strategic but there's so much that's out of your control in this game. It suffers hugely from king-making since towards the end the game is solved and people can see who has the chance to win and either confirm or deny that victory.

RATING: 7
Fun, light, fast game. I like the idea that you can advance as far as you want, but at the cost of not being able to move back along the track. The first player, of course, has a significant advantage since he's always +1 tile over the other players, so I found it odd there's not a penalty of some sort for going first. Simple, fairly easy to understand set collection game, but with some unnecessary bits -- why have to put tokens, 1 at a time, into the pyramid? It's not like they're referenced or scored at the end... Stuff like that is a bit silly, and added to the production costs.

It's pretty OK for a fast filler that makes you use your head.  Elegant design.  The game that picks itself up upon playing!

I really like the components and think the production quality for this one is well over the top for what it is - a very light filler game.  

The game play leaves a lot to be desired and can be somewhat dull.  With the right group of players though, it can be fun. Just don't expect much.

RATING: 6.5
Pleasant, quick game that allows for some devious play, but provides the players with choices whose relative benefits are often not obvious - and I think that obscurity of value is good in a game!  (For the price, you can't beat it!)

A Knizia with (surprise) an interesting premise.  Might play better with adults.

My 5 year old son is a Bibberbande fan. I'm now trying to introduce him some other ways of "thinking". Tut.. is a good game for that, he is getting into it. Less fun than Rat-a-Tat...bibber so hard to convince him to play this one.

An interesting set collection game with a spatial element to it and the ability to claim anything you want (at a price).

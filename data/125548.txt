+ Extreme levels of classic geeky awesomeness all over this one; The sheer number of permutations of card plays, even with just one deck, is staggering and lends itself to all sorts of creative play.
- Tons of reading to get familiar with this one!

RATING: 7
Awesome for what it is: a light game with some tactics and lots of lead changes.  Requires lots of reading the first couple times, but still very enjoyable.

Unfortunately, that makes it more of niche appeal and isn't something I can get to the table often enough.

RATING: 5
1st Play: There is a ton of text on these cards, the system is complicated with the 3 phases and the 3 rows with orders cards and for a system this complicated, to have your options completely determined by which cards you draw makes the game pretty random. The characters aren't very compelling either.

2nd Play: The card tactics are still very random, and while the game is ok, there's nothing about it that draws me back in. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I kind of expected this to be about building an effective nine member formation but it seems to focus more on making smaller power combos. Some of the cards are definitely more powerful in certain roles which hurts the variety a bit. It's not terrible but I'm not into it.

RATING: 8
Had the opportunity to play this several times, and it and its expansions are at the top of the list for future purchases.

It's a fast game, pretty easy to understand and teach, and doesn't require much going back and checking the rules once everyone's got it down. The most fun parts of it are finding cool combos in what you happened to draw, and doing crazy stuff. I've described it previously as the kind of game where your opponent does something, and you think, "That's not fair! That's totally broken!" And then you go and do something that feels equally broken right back. You're bound to pull off some very memorable moments which are fun to laugh about the next game, when you run across the card that enabled it last time. Each card having multiple valid uses is a mechanic I really enjoy, and it doesn't have to be the kind of game where you always feel there's a 'best' move that you have to determine, or risk playing suboptimally (which I don't care as much for). It's about building a playstyle you enjoy, and countering your opponent's chosen style. The randomness of card draws encourages you to try previously-unexplored options and pull off new combos.

It can be a little mean for people more inclined toward coop play (and hence doesn't see play as often as I'd like), but we have friendly agreements about which orders (often the most powerful/disruptive use of a card) are off-limits, and the fact that a single match goes so quickly means no one feels too sore afterwards. (I think my usual opponent despises my use of mascots, though. My saying, "You don't want to hurt the cute little panda, do you?" probably helped fuel this.)

Finding counters for the hitpoints can be a pain, though. And then getting them to stay on the correct cards and not end up elsewhere while trying to read the text, because I never play on a proper surface.

I don't have a lot of experience with board/card games, but I'd rate this one a solid 8 at the very least, and a nine compared to the small assortment I have actually played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is hard to grasp. Making your cards work together better and faster than your opponent is the challenge of it. Since each card can do 5 different things (only 4 after leaders are chosen) it's really tough to know when to play and where! It's great but its got a bit of a learning curve. The box is also terrible.

I have been enjoying similar games (Pocket Battles, Summoner Wars) for a while, so was surprised by how little impression Pixel Tactics made on me.  The multi-use cards are pretty nifty, as are the competing pressures to attack, heal or clear away corpses, and get cards down.  Ultimately, Pixel Tactics felt more abstract than those other games I mentioned and, for that matter, Battlecon: Devastation of the Indines, which I enjoy.    The crappy pixelated artwork really doesn't help in this.

Only one play so far, but I enjoyed it.  I'm not 100% sold that all of the cards are balanced, but having the different choices for each card makes for difficult decisions.  I'm sure that if I played it more, I could anticipate cards and see how to mitigate them.

Good as a pocket sized two player head to head combat game.  Structure of units reminds me of SNES games like Ogre Battle which I loved.  The variability of the cards creates some interest.  I love the art style as well.  May be surpassed in the future by Sellswords from Lvl 99.

It pains me to rate this game a 6. I love the retro art, the sublimely weird names, and the interesting mechanics. It looks great on paper. So great. I just like to look at it. However, it becomes obvious very early in the game who will win, which takes the fun out of it for me. I salute the designer, and will definitely keep an eye on his future games.

RATING: 9.2
Not quite a 'looker' of a game, and it can be a chore to flatten out those playmats (not that you need them) from the backside of the rules, but Pixel Tactics is just an all out, fun assault based around an incredibly clever mechanic where various placement of each unit determines its powers (Hero or Leader), and they can also be used as one time Orders to deal large amounts of grief to the opponent. Love the old school strategy J-RPG aesthetic, and it shares the Indines world with BattleCON, which is the one Level99 game I actually like more than this.

Good little 2 player fighting game. I like how your cards can be your main hero, or a fighter in any of the rows, AND how they have different powers depending on the row they are in.

Juego de cartas para dos jugadores en el que cada uno debe defender a su lider en una formación de 3x3 cartas. Se ejecutan alterativamente dos acciones por ubicación de la formación (vanguardia, flancos y retaguardia). Las cartas tienen varios usos diferentes según la ubicación en la que se encuentren. Lo bien escogidas que están las características de las cartas es lo que la da valor a este juego.

While at first it did feel quite random, the game itself plays quick enough that so far that doesn't hurt it for me.  I enjoy that I doubt I'll ever play the same game twice the way the every card in the game is actually 5 cards for the different roles.  It does feel like there are some real gems and some far too situational cards but overall, as your opponent has exactly the same deck, it feels like things are bound to roughly even out if the game goes past the first couple of turns.  I have had some wonderful matches with this now with games hanging on a thread for turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game itself is good. The way it is sold and is expanding is messy. The game is sold as a deck construction game but the rules for how to deck build are not in the rulebook, they are found only online. As the game grows things get really messy. Instead of just buying each product once Lv99 games is turning it more into an LCG style game where you can have two copies of each card (I believe two is the limit). This would mean that to give both players all options you would need to own two copies of everything (the game isn't cheap either at $15 for 50 cards, not sure where this cost is coming from either. The cards only have a tiny amount of 8bit art, the cards are 90% text. Also it comes in a flimsy box). If you only had one copy of the game in order to play in tournaments with it you need to buy opaque sleeves because the two identical 25 card decks have different backs.

The game is still enjoyable enough though that I'll keep PT 1-3 but will not buy any more products for this game. With how many options are on the cards and with variance of the draw this should be plenty to get a lot of play out of the game.

Pixel Tactics is tricky to get new people to play. The cards have so much text on them and can do four different things that it is off putting to new players. It can also take a long while on the first play as players try and figure out all the options available to them.

I love Pixel Tactics! Like worker placement games, you never feel like you can do everything you want in one turn. This makes every turn tense and interesting.

As standalone games, PT1 is much more enjoyable than PT2. Each card in PT1 is meant to destroy your opponent, so it is a quick, active and tense experience. Ongoing orders in PT2 prolong the game, especially since many cards in PT2 are defensive. Pixel Tactics excels when it is quick. For this reason, I recommend PT1 as your first Pixel Tactics purchase over PT2, though I can't speak for PT3.

The only flaw in PT1 is that the Trapper is boring to use, boring to counterplay, and way too powerful. This is a minor flaw to an otherwise incredible game.

This game is crazy addictive and fun. Tons of game in a tiny box. It's got nostalgia value for me too as I used to love games like Final Fantasy Tactics. It can also be pretty brutal, especially in match-ups where one leader's power is clearly tailored to counter the other's or is just straight up overpowered. I suppose that's why you play games in best of 3 or 5 matches.

[2015-11-30 Rating: n.a. -> 7]
Pixel Tactics is a well realized tactical card combat game. I do like the multi use cards and the idea of the waves. 

One thing that I'm not so sure about, but this might change with repeated plays, is the importance of building up your unit. In most of my played games, the orders proved to be more important than the cards you placed on the table. While you can't totally ignore your unit, clever plays of orders have won most of the games. This is a bit unfortunate when playing with people new to the game who try to build a great unit that gets nearly wiped out with just a few orders. I somehow wish, the orders weren't as dominant as they appear to be.

Another thing that keeps it from getting a better rating (at the moment) is the fact that until you're familiar with the game, there's a lot of reading to be done each turn.

But all in all, Pixel Tactics gets one thumb up from me.

After playing it - well, it is short, intuitive, confrontational (in the end it's 2 players game) - smart card game. Not sure if it is the result of low expectations, however the impression about the game is 100% positive. 26 cards deck is little short - however there are enough expansions alraedy to give a comprehensive deck.

This should have been a card game I really enjoyed. It's a tableau style game, cards have multiple uses, lots of variability, and cool pixel graphics. In the end, I didn't really enjoy it. I felt there was a bit too much information to parse from all of the cards in your hand and I also didn't like how fragile the units felt. Also, the orders felt almost too good. I've read that this is mainly only an issue with Pixel Tactics 1, but I haven't played the others. Finally, I found no less than 3 different versions of the rules at the time of me trying the games in this system. I don't think any of them were particularly excellent. Maybe there is one good rules set now.

I also tend to shy away with games that have a lot of promos unless I start in at the beginning of a series of games and am able to keep up with the promos. Thankfully, the promos in Pixel Tactics have different card backs and I don't feel it's as necessary to acquire them as in other games. 

I think there are a lot of people that like it and it's definitely worth a try. Decent game and I wouldn't mind trying the other sets in the series. I'm just not willing to buy them to try them.

This is a little treasure of a game that manages to capture that "lightning in a bottle" asymmetric balance of BattleCON, some Final Fantasy Tactics nostalgia, and a pared down tactical system that plays out in about 30 minutes.  I hope the designer keeps running with this one.

From the Reddit thread: "Right now I'm in love with how Pixel Tactics is set up. Each card has a power as your primary leader, different powers for each position (vanguard, flank, rear) as heroes, and a power to use if you play it from your hand. It's a relatively deep tactics game boiled down. "

I really like the game but the rules, especially the abilities of each card (in combination with other cards' abilities) are SO vague you have to interpret them yourself. The rulebook should be much longer and contain a bigger Q&A. Not so easy to learn, very hard to master.

More fun and more freewheeling than I'd expected; it both felt like the powers are wildly strong and overbalanced... and there are never enough action points to do what you want to do. Neat.

Well who's this clever little package?

This is really good example of what you can do with incredibly little. 50 cards and a hand full of tokens becomes a richly nuanced and tactical game that still has a surprising strategic horizon for its size (e.g., there are certainly some comboes that are worth hunting for; choosing your leader at the beginning of the match invites particular strategies).

As someone who has spent a fair deal of time playing tactical RPGs, I really appreciate not only the theme but also how effectively both mechanically and aesthetically well it has been inplemented. In other words, the pixel art is great, and the way in which units are brought in,  placed in formation, and synergize in interesting ways for defense, offense, and creative disruption and support is very much reminiscent of classic games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Ogre Battle - while still keeping the game moving at a similar pace!

RATING: 5
Very confrontational 2 player game. The concept is pretty innovative & fun.
BUT having multi-use cards means reading all the text on every card. Sure after multiple plays you know what every role does, but that means you've gotta bite through 20 games that drag on. And that's work, no fun..

Also the various ongoing effects add up so we constantly forgot to apply bonuses, deal out damage and what not..

I don't care about the theme, but I really like the mechanics of this game (different uses for a same card)! It might be pushed a bit too far though, it's impossible to keep track of everything that's going on and all the options you and especially your opponent have. Still, this is probably my favorite 2-player game of the games I played but do not own.

I really wanted to like this game. I really, really did. But in the end the choices didn't seem to go much farther than A.) put guy in front of general, and B.) kill guy in front of opponent's general. Aside from that, the other positions serve mainly to distract from these 2 objectives.

Un buen filler para 2 jugadores. Simple, pero con la tensión y profunidad suficientes para que entre en la categoría de los "fillers pesados". 

En líneas generales, consiste en jugar con un mazo de 25 cartas igual al del contrario. Cada carta es un personaje y se juega formando una trama de 3x3 cartas en la zona de cada jugador, siendo el personaje del centro el líder de la unidad. El objetivo es derrotar al líder contrario. Cada carta puede jugarse en vanguardia, en los flancos o en retaguardia y tendrá diversos efectos según esta variable. 

Lo divertido está en encontrar los combos entre unas cartas y otras. Es muy probable que te encuentres repitiéndote la frase "No es justo. Esa carta está desequilibrada" tras una jugada contraria... para que unos minutos después sea tu contrario quien piense lo mismo. Ciertamente ambos tendrán razón, porque las cartas son muy desequilibradas, pero como ambos jugadores tienen las mismas cartas, podría encontrarse cierta "moderación dentro del caos".

PROS: Las reglas son sencillas. Dos acciones por turno a elegir entre estas: reclutar/atacar/reestructurar/quitar cadáveres/jugar órdenes, sabiendo que no se puede atacar dos veces con el mismo personaje y que tampoco está permitido reclutar a alguien e inmediatamente atacar.

CONS: No todos los personajes están igual de equilibrados y puede convertirse en una competición basada en la "acumulación de cartas de órdenes" para derrotar al contrario en unos instantes.

A board game version of games like Final Fantasy Tactics. Each character has different abilities depending on where it's placed (vangard, flank, and rear waves) as well as being able to play them as orders (like a spell) for just the effect.

Pixel Tactics is an addictive mini game, it kills time and it has an insane amount of depth to it. With hundreds of cards at your disposal and the versatility of the cards roles, you have a nearly endless replay value. I honestly can't wait to play more of this game.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (August 2015)

Last month I played Pixel Tactics 2 and it wasn’t a good experience, perhaps I was too tired or that game has a lot of turtling but it was way too long and each of us accomplished little each turn, in short I was very disappointed so my desire to play Pixel Tactics was low and it was sad because I bought the whole series thinking it was a game made for me. Now, I’m very glad I played it because this time, it was a very good game experience and it changed my whole attitude toward the game series. 

The game rules are very easy, you can explain them under 10 minutes. The gameplay is rather deep (and much slower) as you can use each card in 5 different ways. The player who knows the cards better have a better chance to win (a positive for me).

The art is ok. I have never used the play mat, it is ugly and useless.

Some of the cards are much more powerful than others, this is something of an issue when the cards are used as leaders, however the gameplay is fast (once you know the cards) and each player has the same deck, so it doesn’t bothers me much.

Pixel Tactics can be mixed with other sets in the series, I LOVE this feature and many of my favorite games has it as well (Dungeon Twister, Dominion, Summoner Wars). I look forward to do this soon. Also it has some variants I want to try.

The main negative for me, is that some games can take a long time to finish, playtime shouldn’t exceed the 30 minutes mark.

Bottom line, Pixel Tactics is a good 2 player game with lots of depth and replayability. I want to play it again soon to explore other strategies and to combine it with other Pixel Tactics games. I will give Pixel Tactics 2 another chance soon. A keeper in my game collection.

After more plays I find Pixel tactics to be fascinating. It is everything I expected to be. I really like the game and it has a good chance to continue to improve in my personal ratings. For now I want to try again Pixel Tactics 2 and play the whole series. I will always bring with me my Pixel Tactics decks.

After reading the rules of Pixel Tactics Deluxe, I realized some of the rules changed. I hate when publishers do this and Level99 do this often (besides Pixel Tactics, they changed BattleCON: War of Indines and NOIR: Deductive Mystery Game) so buying their games when they just come to the market seems like a bad idea. They will change it within the year and your game will become obsolete. I’m talking about core rules changes, if they just reworded the cards so they would be clearer I wouldn’t have an issue, but they changed the core rules and that’s very disrespectful with the original backers, supporters and customers who bought the game in the first place (as I did). The deluxe edition, changes the amount of cards you can have in your hand, attack powers no longer exist so they don’t trigger “attack effects” and I’m sure there are other changes I haven’t seen yet. The changes seem small and they are, but they have a huge impact in play and having two sets of rules is difficult when playing with other players who doesn’t know the updated rules. If you are going to change something, you can do it as an official variant when you release an expansion, but that’s not the case here. If I want to have all my Pixel Tactics sets updated, I would have to buy again the number 1 2, and 3 sets and that make me angry and sad. Why should I have to pay twice for the same game?

Bottom line, I’m disenchanted with any publisher who changes the core rules of its games. So far I have encountered this behavior with Level 99 Games and with Stonemaier Games (Viticulture has changed 3 times in 3 years and they also change Euphoria :/), both of them are Kickstarter publishers so perhaps they don’t test their games as much as they should. Still I love Pixel Tactics, an amazing game.

I have played the game a bit more these days. Almost always, I play a different edition of the game and I recently played the Mega Man series of games. I still think it is a very good design, but my desire to play Pixel Tactics, as a whole, has decreased this year.

Each player has an identical deck of cards. Turned one way, each card features a unique leader. You draw five cards and pick a leader for the game. The leader is very powerful and greatly informs your strategy. Then you turn the cards the other way and for the rest of the game you are surrounding your leader with the archetypes described on the opposite side. The object of the game is to kill the opponent's leader. Cards are played in three rows of three, with your leader in the middle of the 2nd row. Each turn, you can place or activate cards in a different row. Cards have different special abilities and uses depending on what row they are in. You can also discard cards out of your hand for single-use actions. Each card also has a special "reaction" that can be used in specific circumstances.

All of this is pretty cool and different from most of these kinds of games. But you can't really move cards around much once you play them, so the game starts to feel pretty static once you've deployed your forces. Cards in front can attack cards opposite them and you try to pound your way to the leader and kill him. From the artwork (which I frankly hate) I believe we are supposed to be in a 90's era computer game. The archetypes are all over the map, though, that the theme could hardly feel more generic and unengaging to me. With no inherent attraction to the theme and increasingly static game play and finding it generally tedious to hunt-and-peck for combos that I should be using, this game just isn't for me.

While this game needs the "ironclad" ruleset that is coming out in the deluxe version, this is a very overlooked and underrated LCG.  Very unique gameplay and after Deluxe, 4, and 5 are released, there will be a host of cards to support all kinds of decks and playstyles.  Hours and hours of entertainment building decks or just drafting and playing.  As per the name, the game is designed to emphasize tactical over strategic play; however, deck building is still a very real and fun possibility.

I really like the concept of this game.  It's simple, yet complex at the same time.  You have a 3x3 grid, drop some cards, and they tell you what they do.  I don't own a lot of 2p games, but this one is pretty good.  Not to mention all the expansions one can get for this game.

So why not a higher score?  Well, there are a lot of questions one can gather form playing this game for the first few times.  The rules aren't horrible, but there's just things like "does my ranged attack person get to attack melee from another card's power?" really get in the way of the game.  I know with more play this will get rectified, but it's a bit too prevalent for new players.

I think this game is amazing for the fact that you can literally put this whole game in a Magic the Gathering tuck box, and the counters in a tiny zip lock, and carry this game everywhere you go.  That in itself will earn it a few plays where it otherwise wouldn't.  Travel games are important, and being able to fit it even in my pocket makes this an amazing game.  I can always mix and match expansions with it as well by using a second tuck box (which I have plenty of).

Bottom line, the game is solid, if it wasn't for the rules, I'd score it higher.  I'm not usually able to play 2P games, so they will generally score lower for me.  I would love to, just that my group is usually three, and having one person watch wouldn't be fun.

The game's simplicity might put some off, but I think once they start to play it, they'll know the complexity.  The issue is getting them interested in playing in the first place.

Hard to get plays in, but solid game.  That's a 6 for me.

Pixel Tactics is a head-to-head game of tactical combat for two players. Each player has an identical deck of 25 cards, from which they draft a leader. The leader's abilities alter vastly the strategy and playability of every other card in the deck, making the game playable in 25 different ways.

* Pros

+ Quite streamlined rules. The "exclusive actions rule" (single Attack/Recruit/Restructure action per hero during a wave) seems a little artificial at first. However, it can be interpreted as a way of preventing big surprises that would be easy to pull off (e.g. Recruit, then Attack), and it could almost be inferred through this principle.

+ The "exclusive actions rule" makes the game less random, and also more strategic: it seriously limits the number of easy/uninteresting but unpreventable and devastating moves (like a surprise Recruit+Attack). As such, it also allows for more counter-strategy, since the rule makes the board evolve in a more predictable manner (thanks to limiting the power of hidden information—the cards in hand).

+ Each card has 5 different powers, which makes 125 powers in a deck: this is big. Crucially, the powers are varied in flavor.

+ In my first game, I really like how the heroes shaped the game (the Trapper power led to a game where a central "shooting" leader strive to get protected by a hero in front of him. This overarching strategy was simple and clear, with a strong personality, which makes different games different. Simultaneously, executing this strategy was rich in more tactical moves, or in sub-strategies (like using powers on the in-Melee heroes that let any hero attack): the strategy suggested by the heroes was not obvious to implement, which would be boring. Thus, it was simple enough to be clear and give a strong flavor to this particular game, but difficult enough to pull off effectively. That said, the strategies are more in the form of *principles* than of a overarching strategic choices and directions that cannot be changed easily: I like this less than the strategic commitments that Race requires: they add tension & risk, and variety (since each game represents *one* path only, and the next game will likely explore another path, where each path has a few distinctive flavors [Military, Alien, Genetic, Mining, production+consumption,…]).

+ While cards have multiple powers, the game helps you focus on only one of them at a time: the current wave dictates what power the card in your hand would have if placed there, and what power they have there. This makes the game flow smoother.

+ The card quality is very good: sturdy, with a very smooth glossy finish. That said, quite a few cards were stuck together (with no bad consequence, but I had to be very careful when pulling them apart), and one had a damaged back (with ink that bled).

+ The iconography is consistent throughout (unlike, say, 51st State's).  I only noticed one typo (Homunculus Rear power).

+ The designer is very responsive on BGG.

* Good and bad

$ The box is small: this is great for storing the game (no space wasted) and carrying it around, but the components are a little hard to fit. I put each deck on one side of the central folded play mat, cut in two halves, which is convenient enough for sorting the initial decks.

$ The rules are quite clear and streamlined, but a comprehensive and authoritative version is sorely needed: for example, the printed rules don't fully contain the important "exclusive actions" rule (Recruit/Restructure/Attack Action only once on a given hero during a wave: the printed rules do not prohibit Recruit+Restructure), or the restriction on attacking after being revived. Rules are scattered (and inconsistent) between the printed rules, the PDF rules, and the HTML living rules.


* Cons

- Short, but can be a little long (1 hour for the first game), compared to a deeply satisfying game like Race, even though I did not get bored. I like the time spent, though, it's just that it requires a bigger time commitment. On the other hand, it is not longer than great confrontational games like Puzzle Strike, Tash-Kalar, or Lagoon.

- There is not much of a sense of progression throughout the game: this layer is not really present, and the game is mostly tactical only (as opposed to Agricola's growing farm, to Magic's growing mana base, or to Race's increasingly powerful tableau). Maybe this is what prevents me from giving it a BGG 10 ("Always want to play and expect this will never change").

- Can feel a little too long, for a game which is mostly tactical: the ever evolving tactics make the game somewhat repetitive: there is no obvious qualitative progress (only the quantitative progress of wounding the opposing leader more and more), so the game keeps feeling the same "handle the completely new situation at hand" each turn. Still fun, but lacking the additional layer of controlling a slowly evolving board situation.

* Neutral

$ This is really a fighting game, with constant attacks. Good when you're in the mood, not good if you shy away from such games.

$ Each Leader hints a some strategy (or strategies). I wonder whether the game will become more and more a matter of implementing the strategy, in a way that becomes less and less interesting (once a strategy is found, this layer is removed from the game). I did not find that the pairing of heroes has a strong impact on the attack strategy, so there are mostly 25 strategies to be found, I feel.

$ There are lots of powers to keep track of. Maybe too many, but I like exploring, and always fantasize that one day I will have a clear picture of all these powers and of their interactions.

It is true, though, that games like Race, Cosmic Encounter, Libertalia or even Magic  are easier to put in one's head (Lagoon may be slightly easier than Pixel Tactics).

RATING: 9.5
*Really* enjoy this (and PT2). It's certainly rough around the edges (the rulebook is effectively useless and some card abilities are either difficult to understand or, depending on the edition, wrongly stated), but I don't care. This little tableau-building tactical skirmish game pack so many crazy ideas into its two identical 25-card decks, and these ideas bounce off each other in such unexpected and deliciously violent ways, that I can overlook the fiddliness and occasional rules confusion. The game does have a pretty steep learning curve - not immediately accessible.

A simple two player that has surprising depth.  It is fun but the lettering is very small and can be difficult on older players.

It might edge out PT2 as my favorite someday. Its relative simplicity, as well as the diversity of units, makes it great. One round of this plays out like a 'filler' game should, while still engaging one's sense of strategy. Add several rounds and you've got quite a long match going!

2-player card game.

If a game is supposed to be best of 3, then the length given on the box is way off, since a single match took us that long.

You'll feel your opponent is way overpowered over you, but meanwhile, they'll feel you are way overpowered over them.  It works out like a masterpiece in the end.

Very tactical. As a fan of 16-bit RPGs (Final Fantasy Tactics in particular) and a former Magic player, the theme and gameplay both speak to me very much.

There is a ton of choices in the cards, as each has 5 different uses depending on where/how it is played. It's an aggressive game for sure. A bit swingy and there's some luck there, too. The players each play with identical decks, which is cool.

With the right opponent where you can learn together at the same rate, it seems like a real winner (after 1 best of three match). Reminiscent of Race for the Galaxy in that regard: you want to learn along with someone because players of different experience levels will not have a good time together.

Pixel Tactics hat mich mit seinem Thema sofort angesprochen, doch beim Öffnen der Spieleschachtel kam die erste Ernüchterung. Die Karten sind zwar relativ groß, doch haben nur ein Mini-Artwork zu bieten und die gesamte Aufmachung wirkt recht dröge. Die Idee, die einzelnen Heldenkarten auf unterschiedliche Art zu spielen, ist eigentlich ziemlich cool. Jedoch erweist sich dies im laufenden Spiel als extrem schwierig zu meistern. Die Möglichkeiten sind dann doch sehr vielfältig und es benötigt einige Minuten, um sich für die richtige Position zu entscheiden (Downtime inklusive). Außerdem sind die einzelnen Helden etwas unausgeglichen. Durch zu viele kleine Mängel, leider nur ein solides 2-Personen Spiel.

The heads-up tactical battle is so simple and clean. Yet, despite this simplicity, no two games have ever felt the same.  

The need for rule clarifications and the early learning curve (such a wall of text) keep it from being a perfect 10 for me.

Neat game. I like it a lot, but some overpowered leader cards keep this from being truly great. This rating may change over time as I would like to play this more or in case I misread some rules and that accounts for what seems to be overpowered. The fact that the games are so quick keep the overpowered heroes from being too annoying. The rules are a bit vague in spots, but the fact that they use a qr code to link to a video tutorial is awesome and should be a standard for every board game. Definitely a great deal for $15. The only other problem is that the box sucks since it is made more as hanging display like the monopoly deal boxes. They should have used the small z man games sized card boxes.

On the one hand it is a very cool theme and system for a game.  It is portable and very expandable.  However, some leaders are flat out better than others and that bothers me.  Also some cards are crazy.  People argue that because both players have access to the same cards, the swinginess evens out, but I'm not sure if I buy that.  However I still like this game and want to play it more.

The leader thing is bothering me less. You do get a good selection of leaders every game.

my gateway game was boss monster, this was the game I got after boss monster. What a world this game opened me up to. I have a secret love affair for pixel tactics. I knew I had to have them all, so I got them all. A lot of people complain about the incredibly small text size, but each card does SO MUCH! I have no idea how else they would have been able to fit so much different information on a single card. I thoroughly enjoy the tactics of this game, the way the cards play with each other, all the different statuses. There is definitely a lot to this pocket sized game. I think about this game all the time, yet I never seem to take it out of the closet any more for some stupid reason. Any version plays great, and each version definitely has a different feel to it, so the tactics all feel somewhat different from game to game. Top that off with custom decks from the expansions and the various pixel tactics, and it's just a great game system, that apparently a lot of people don't know about. I definitely need to play this game a lot more.

Based on one play: The main game play is simply, play cards down and try to kill your opponents leader. However  you play in a grid nine square grid and each cards ability changes based on which row it is played in and each row can only be activate when it is active (you play the first row, then the second, then the third). Add this to your leaders ability, who is in the middle of the field  and you get an endless amount of combos. It is also not a deck building game, you both have the same cards, except for your leader, so just grab a deck and play. I was quite impressed, well thought out.

RATING: 6
This tactical 2-player combat game has some fascinating ideas. Each player has his own deck and at the beginning of the game, draws a hand of cards. Each card has multiple uses, two of which are a “general” and a standard unit. From that first hand, each player selects one of his cards to use as a general. This provides a special power for that player throughout the game, and the object is to destroy the opponent’s general. After selecting a general, the cards can be used as normal units or for an one-time effect. Each round is played over 3 waves, with each wave corresponding to one row of a 3x3 grid that each player occupies. An interesting consideration is that the effects of the units and the one-time events differ depending on which wave is currently being played.

Pixel Tactics is a new take on the genre dominated by things like Summoner Wars and Mage Wars. Its simplicity, variety, and a bit of depth make it something worth looking into. My main complaint is the ridiculous 8-bit art. I don’t understand why this has made such a comeback recently, but come on publishers - enough already.

It has been called a shorter Summoner Wars, and while I can see a little similarity, this game is definitely very different than Summoner Wars.  Each card can be used in 5 different ways (4 for most of the game since you choose the leader portion only once at the very beginning of the game).  Still, the actual card draws are less limiting in this game, and although you can definitely move units across a grid, in this game that essentially changes the unit's abilities instead of just re-positioning it.  This is a fun game that I look forward to playing much more in the future.   Bring on Pixel Tactics 2!!

I'm a very big fan of 2 player pvp games (Mage Wars being my favorite), this fits very much into my type of game.

Components - the cards are super quality. You get an awful lot in the small box it comes in. Card art is fun and really captures that old school graphics that it's aiming for. 

Both sides get identical decks, yet the games always play completely different depending on which "leader" you get to play with. The rules are fairly simple, the game is very balanced (many games I've played end up in a draw!) and for gameplay - it's just pure fun. Plays pretty quickly for a strategy game of this much depth. Setup and cleanup are super quick too. It's incredibly expandable, with loads of extra strategy possible from other sets.

I love the strategy element, I love the art, I love that I kickstarted and have all the expansions to look forward to going through. 

Yeah, I love this game!

I've played the german version at Essen Spiel15 and instantly bought it. I really like the tactics this game offers and the huge amount of replay value. I hope the designer keeps on creating such great games because I also like his battleCon series.
Pegasus changed the original box cover of the german 1st edition to gameboy look. I think it looks better than the original art but still it does not show well what this game is about. It's about cards and tactical battle rather than about Tetris and other games that mostly associated with the gameboy console.

Już sama oprawa graficzna i wygląd pudełka sprawiają, że lubię tę grę :) Mocno taktyczna rozgrywka, w której każda z kart ma 5 możliwych zastosowań. Jest trochę losowości w doborze kart, ale biorąc pod uwagę, że każdy dysponuje identycznym deckiem, szanse są mimo wszystko wyrównane.

This is a phenomenal 2 player game. There are so many things you can do with a given card that you can really try different tactics and strategies. Your leader really makes a big difference, and you need to play around your opponent's leader ability. There's a great sense of back and forth to the game, and you can recover from a disadvantageous board position.

------------

There are a few issues with the game however. Not all of the cards and leaders are that well balanced against each other. There are cases of a leader directly countering another leader. In addition, you cannot afford to build up your unit too much because of how strong the AoE damage orders are in Pixel Tactics 1. The action economy for certain cards was not well thought out. The rules are not particularly well written, and the terminology is not used consistently and can be confusing. Bad play can be punished so hard that it's hard to teach to new players.

Many of these issues are reduced in Pixel Tactics 2 and 3, and it sounds like more will be resolved in Pixel Tactics 4. Building a bigger unit is more viable, and the game is less about stockpiling powerful orders and then nuking your opponent back into the stone age in later sets. While the action economy is still not perfect, there is improvement. I believe the rules will get an overhaul and the terminology will be changed into something clearer.

Still, even with the problems, Pixel Tactics 1 is a fantastic 2 player game if you can get the other player through the learning curve.

I really love the aesthetic of this game. It really captures the feel a turn based video game quite well. I like how the leaders and the cards in play help define the strategy, but there are still a lot of good tactical decisions. Finally, I am impressed by how replayable this game is. Since each card is different depending on it's location there are lots of options that always present themselves.

2-player game where each player gets 2 actions a turn to basically draw/play cards which have 4 uses on them. Each card doubles up as a Cosmic Encounter-like player ability (high variation + nuke-like power) to choose from at the start of the game.

Feels like an exercise for multi-choice cards, which makes it pale in comparison to other similar games which layer them in to a cooler, bigger whole instead of having it being the whole game. Especially its direct ancestor Innovation, which makes much better use of 2er broken multi-choice cards with 2 actions. Having each of the 4 uses be text instead of being more subtle and variable also feels like less skillful design.

Open to trying to explore the powers, but not very necessary with Innovation out there.

...but then again, Innovation is a little big for its britches. This one should work better as a faster-playing game that cuts out the crap.

3+3

Interesting unique head to head gameplay. I love the super-charged Leader abilities and Orders -- I tend to have a lot of fun with games that achieve a level of balance not by toning down everything cool and fun you might want to try, but by making everything powerful beyond your expectations. Pixel Tactics is that kind of game.

Like most other games of this type, where you put down a bunch of "permanent" cards with a bunch of different abilities (Innovation, GOSU, pretty much any CCG ever) there can be a lot to keep track of for new players as you read the cards and get familiar with both your and your opponents abilities, which can slow down the game by giving you the feeling that you're either constantly reading or playing sub-optimally. This is only a weakness until you play the game a lot, and in the case of Pixel Tactics -- I don't mind if I do!

[hr]Design rating docked a point since a super obvious balance issue has been exposed (Merits of Hikaru VS Magdelina). Still an innovative design, but this doesn't bode well for the playtesting. I appreciate "balance in imbalance" and "letting chaos settle", but there's a difference between chaotic balance and carelessness

[hr]Design rating raised. Props to Brad of Level 99 Games for being one of the few developers out there to revisit and improve balance in his games. Now if only he'd put up printable update cards for first edition owners to slip into some card sleeves... (there are only a few changes)

Pixel Tactics is what I wanted Summoner Wars to be, from the gameplay to the artwork. Summoner Wars achieves balance in asymmetry by keeping every card at or near the mean. Nothing feels overpowered because nothing is. Pixel Tactics is the opposite. Players draw from identical decks, but every card is uniquely overpowered. Balance emerges, as it does in Innovation, by throwing in more broken cards rather than fewer. And each card can be used in only one of five ways, so deciding how to use your cards is difficult, meaningful, and allows for tons of game-to-game variety. All of this means that the first game is spent reading a lot of text, and it's a bit overwhelming. But once you get past that, the game is a sandbox.

My biggest criticism of the game, and I wish I could say it didn't bother me, is that the rules are too rough around the edges. Not enough playtesting went into the game, and it shows in the gaps and inconsistencies in terminology on the cards, in the pages of rules queries in the forums, and in ongoing revisions to the rules both for design and balance. To his credit, the designer responds to queries and has revised the rules and cards to improve gameplay, but it's frustrating to come across contradictory answers. Most of this could and should have been caught before release--and certainly before the reprint.

RATING: 7
This is a neat little two player card game of battling with different characters, each with special abilities, until one kills the other's leader.

The neat thing about this game is that each card can be played in 5 different ways and has different abilities depending on how it is played.  First each player selects a leader that has a higher life stat, typically, than the other heroes and a persistent ability.  Then players will take turns playing their other heroes in 3 different "waves" or rows and depending on the row they are in the hero will have different abilities.  Finally, each card can also be played for a one time "order" effect.

The biggest problem with this game is it is very luck-of-the-draw.  Some of the leaders especially have ridiculous powers.  For example, the leader side of the Alchemist does a damage to EVERY opposing hero each turn.  This is insane!  While there are powerful and not so powerful heroes in the deck otherwise and each player's deck is identical it can still be that one player gets all the best cards while the other gets crap.  Or maybe simply the best cards for a situation.

Also, the cards are fine, they display a lot of information without actually seeming cluttered, but the paper mat/rules are abysmal.  The paper mats don't really need to be used, they are folded and wrinkled and would look bad and you just need to remember a 3x3 grid.  But the rules are written on the other side.  Having to read rules on a giant 3 foot piece of paper is a pain in the ass.  Plus the rules are written poorly and you are going to have a lot of questions just in the first game.  Sure, they provide a QR code that links to a tutorial but for such a simple game you should be able to skim a thin rulebook, not stare at a map-sized piece of paper or watch a 20 minute tutorial on your phone.

That being said I quite like this game for what it is.  A decent filler with a lot of variety.  Each card being able to be played so many different ways with unique abilities makes for very varied games even if they aren't always balanced.  The rules are reasonably simple and it plays fast too. You are supposed to play best out of 3 rounds minimum (so 2 minimum) and the box says this should take 30 minutes.  It's really closer to 45 or longer if players are new and need to read the cards completely.  But there's nothing stopping you from playing just one round in 20-30 minutes which is closer to what a game with filler status should take.

Each player has the same deck of 25 multi-multi-multi-use cards. These can be played into the centre of that player's 3x3 grid of cards as its leader, to the vanguard, to the 2 flank positions, to the rear, or as a once-off order. In each case their abilities will be different. These opposing forces, each with strange and wonderful internal synergies, attack each other until one or the other leader is murdered.

Pixel Tactics is one of those games where everything is broken. Most of the leaders are insanely overpowered; every second card is amazing. But the opponent has them too, and they're good at different things and in different ways. 

The biggest issue is reading and understanding the different heroes. It will be particularly difficult on master strategists who insist on knowing what each character can do should it move to another position. Before playing I had expected this to be a huge problem and was pleasantly surprised -- hand sizes tend to be small enough that it isn't too bad.

A fun, fast 2p game of combos and synergies with a minor but pervasive spatial element. Very good.

Our first play, unfortunately, had a healing leader. As a consequence, the first match took about 45 minutes and it really was 'death by a thousand cuts' - I was able to do precisely 1 damage more to the leader than my opponent could heal each turn. The second match was much faster.

The huge amount of variability is both a massive plus and a massive issue. It means that the game is different almost every time you play it, with different leaders interacting in novel ways, but also results in huge rules questions which the rulebook simply doesn't even attempt to address.

It felt like a fiddly, slightly less nerdy, Summoner Wars. I think if I didn't already own SW, I'd think more highly of this, but it was a promising first showing.

+ most of the leaders are completly different
+ corpes (when you lose a unit it stays in tou play arena and blocks your playarena. You want to discard corpes, so you must use an action) - love this idea
+ both players have the same deck - you really know, what your opponent could have

- downtime (I think the more you play, the faster you will make your turn)
- in both games one player was almost done and we played over an hour until the game ended. It`s hard to finisz a player. There so many strong cards, that helps you stay in a game. But it seems you could not take over a game. I hate this.

Quick card game of combining the various possible abilities on hero cards to defeat your opponent's leader. Each card has one ability (if used as your leader), and four other possibilities to be used during the game, based on position and timing. The abilities and orders are almost all highly thematic and combining them is a thought-provoking exercise.

Played a couple of times, and never looked at it again. Something about it doesn't grab me. I'll have to think about why.

Put a guy in front of your leader to keep him from being attacked, then try to kill the opponent's guy in front of the leader, then repeat for over an hour until you can get through to hit the leader. It comes down to pure luck as to who gets the right combination of cards at the right time to be able to damage the leader. Very tedious and very boring.

I like the idea of having a deck of 25 unique cards that all do different things based on where they're deployed, but this game just doesn't deliver.

Neat gameplay, reminiscent of Summoner Wars, but instead of warriors moving around, they stay largely in one spot but act differently depending on where they are. Each card has several potential uses. The focus of the game changes a ton based on the leaders chosen, but never in a way that removes fun from the equation, amazingly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This particular set is a little overpowered on average, but it's an excellent introduction to the series. The first few games tend to take much longer than the average play length, but familiarity with the rules and with your deck leads to later games ending much, much more quickly.

There's a deceptive depth of strategy here, and it's impressive the way your entire deck's playstyle is shaped by your choice of starting Leader.

One quick note: while this is a turn-based tactics game, the organization of turns is unusual for the genre. Rather than a player being able to manipulate any character in their army on each of their turns (or, as in some games, their entire army), most of their actions are limited to characters in the currently-active wave. Play proceeds from the foremost wave (Vanguard) to the rearmost wave (Rear), alternating between players until the end of a complete round.

I can't say enough in praise of this series, but you've probably heard enough about it from other sources already. If you haven't, pick it up and give it a try.

The text is too tiny, the cards are too busy and the layout is almost too confusing to understand. If you can get over those hurdles however, you will find Pixel Tactics to be every bit as satisfying as Level 99's flagship title BattleCon.

It feels like a cardboard version of Final Fantasy Tactics. The cards are multi-purpose, with each one capable of being a super powered Leader, a generic troop with up to three different special abilities to choose from, or just as a supremely powerful spell, which adds some much needed chaos to the proceedings. It's a great system and one that improves with every play, as players get to know the card pool.

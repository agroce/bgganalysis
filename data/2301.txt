This was one of the first board games I ever played beyond things like Monopoly and Chinese checkers.  I loved it as a child, but it shows it's age.  Largely luck dependent and devoid of much strategy; I mostly enjoy it for the sake of nostalgia.

Despite being a roll-and-move game with little else to do than entering rooms, killings things and grabbing items, (The New) Dungeon is a rich source of fun for everyone since, however banal, these actions and their outcomes both make for a lot of jolliness around the table and keep downtime between a player’s turns to a minimum: after all, this is the essence of any self-respecting dungeon crawl. [i](August 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Over the years I’ve grown tired of most dungeon crawls: I’m still attracted to them by their mere theme - as an old roleplayer, I’m quite fond of dungeoning - but the way they play bothers me, as everything boils down to rolling a few dice and checking whether a special power activates or not. What’s still worse though is, they have the bad habit of crawling way too slow and turning into long, endless sessions of repeating the same few actions over and over.

This is why during my Fall 2015 rating revise I lowered my rating from an over-enthusiastic 7,5 to a better fitting 6. It’s higher than Heroquest as The New Dungeon has no GM/overlord, which makes the game somewhat shorter and faster.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
This was a Goodwill find -- I just had to play it once for some reason.  It's a functional game but I'm not convinced the different characters are well balanced.  I guess I'd usually rather play something plain like this than a game that is just as random but gussied up with lots of chrome & details.

I was surprised to find that I initially did not enjoy this one as much as the original Dungeon.  I think the simpler, original game has more charm to it.

However, I later revised this view after replaying the original Dungeon and ended up getting the Classic Dungeon edition (which has better art) for play with my kids.

This is great when we get a bunch of people together. It's pretty straight forward, and not complicated. So any hard core gamer that is expecting some sort of "World of Warcraft" type board game is going to be sorely dissapointed.

But for what it is, it's actually really fun. 

The game says from 1 - 6 players, but I suspect you could go as high as 10, it would mean that you'd really have to cooperate, and backstab each other.

I love this game!  There's nothing like taking an elf to the 4th through 6th levels of the dungeon and going for the big roll / big reward.  This is basic dungeons & dragons at its best, quick and easy with a fun-spirited competition mechanism for stealing treasure.  Of the vast collection in my family, it's seen a LOT of play.

It's the old Dungeon! but with a new coat of paint.  The New Dungeon!  As garbage as this game is, there's something endearing about it.  This is a beer and pretzels game that often hits the table early in the night when everyone is tipsy enough to suck at REAL games but not drunk enough to be stumbling over each other.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played this game many times and can say that it is very easy to get killed by getting wounded twice which can get to be discouraging.Also it is not uncommon to die 2-3 times in a game if you roll bad dice. The ambush rule adds more fun.

RATING: 5
I got this as a kid when it was brand new.  At the time I thought it was pretty awesome.  It has some decent art,  cool plastic miniatures and a huge game board.  In retrospect, it's not such a great game.  Players compete to get the most gold out of a dungeon full of rooms.  That's actually less exciting than it sounds.  To me, it feels like grinding.  There aren't enough interesting mechanics or meaningful elements of game play to make this one worth the time.

Like the original Dungeon, only terribly balanced.  Thieves are horrible, yet need massive amounts of gold to win.  Paladins can heal themselves, which is awesome.  Same silly game as the original, but it all worked better when it was Hero, Superhero, Elf and Wizard.

RATING: 7
This was the board game that first drew me away from the mainstay games like Monopoly and Cluedo when I was a kid. It has a very special place in my heart. It got me started on D&D and my love of strategy and fantasy-themed board games. I still find it to be a great way to introduce non-gamers to the exciting world of board games. An easy, light introduction to dungeon crawling and it is still as much fun as it was all those years ago. Over the years I seem to have collected four copies of this game from eBay that are all in relatively mint condition. That just goes to show how nostalgic I am about it. I also own a near mint copy of The Classic Dungeon edition.

This is a classic role-playing game.  It is also about as light as a role-playing game can get.  It gives the players a feel of rpging, in a relatively short time so that you can get their rpg fix between longer sessions, though you will be left wanting more.  It is also great as an introduction to rpg games for elementary/middle school aged children.

A classic from when I was younger, I played the original [i]Dungeon![/i] at a friend's place, over and over again.  And then came the day where I saw [i]The New Dungeon![/i] at a store, and I knew it had to become mine.  The fact that one doesn't need the little crypt chits anymore was quite favorable, and while I'm not sure if all the new rules are good ones, it was good.  Sure, the classes might not be balanced.  And sure, one might think that a lousy dice roll causes you to go back to start.  But this is "Kids Ameritrash" and will follow me wherever I go.  I'd even play it if anyone was willing to do so.

I was always fascinated by one of the earlier versions of Dungeon! as a boy and used to play it a lot with a neighbor friend although we didn't make much use of the rulebook.  I had to buy this immediatly when it came out and I spent a lot of time making variants and new characters for me and my friends to use.  This was probably the game that hooked me back into boardgaming after RPGing throughout my junior high years.    By today's standards I don't rate it that highly as there are now games that do the same thing much better.

This is a game I used to play when I was a kid. Back then I really enjoyed the game, though the longish setup was kind of a pain.

My family of non-gamers and I have some good fun with this one.  I don't know that it would last very long with your average gamer nowadays though.  It's pretty simple and has an awful lot of luck, especially when you try to affect the other players.  As a result, players often head off to their own private corner of the dungeon well away from the others to do their treasure gathering, and you often won't run into anyone else again unless treasures start running very thin or until the other players have no choice but to pop out of the woodwork to desperately try and steal your treasures before you can make it back to start for the win.

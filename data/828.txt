I can't say I really own this, but I've played it quite a bit with solo modifications.  It's quite fun, and I think a lot of the modern adventure boardgames out there could learn a lesson or two from Wizards's game design.  That possessive is right, isn't it?  I have to go ask Angry Flower again.

More a cooperative game since you are trying to save the world.  You try to complete quests to forstall the sinking of the land.  The end game is a race to get to the High Druid after getting all 6 pieces of the Gem.  Long game but very fun.

My rating is a bit provisional: it's old school, so in that context I'd give it a 7 or an 8. But with modern games in consideration, this drops to a 6 or so.

Sort of pre Magic Realm - and ahead of it's time as far as 'tile placement'.

Not sure if I love or hate this game.  I still keep it around!  Played 6 players and it took 10 hours.  It ended when one Wizard had the first 5 stones and the other had the last one, niether would give up the other stones!  Laughed our butts off when we realized that you couldn't swim to other islands cause it would take weeks and weeks.  The rules are a little hard to get through, but it has some interesting gameplay moments.  I would break it out again if the group wanted to try it.

This game is hard to rate since there are  parts that are very interesting, liek the game getting more dangerous and the need for coperative play, aliong with some mechanics that make it diffuclt.  We played it once adn one of our players wnated to stop inthe middle, feeling that the system was flawed  It probably needs more play thatn that, but at the end, we just didn't find it as immersive as most fantasy quest games.

I bought this when it was first published - during my stint as a retail game store manager. As interesting as the game looked, I could never convince others to give it a try. I was forced to sell it during a period of unemployment, still unplayed, along with some other gems (like Borderlands and a lot of the Lost Worlds books) that are very collectible these days. I'm really curious about this one, and fear that I may have missed a game that would have been a welcome addition to my current collection.

One of the most boring games I've ever played. The whole "island" mechanic sounds better than it plays out, and the endgame is excrutiating. Any ruleset that allows for players to lose 12 or more turns IN A ROW is fatally flawed. And don't get me started on the "toilet bowl of terror" that is the Dragon's Lair tile...

There are many things about this game that don't work. It's a multiplayer solitaire game with little to no interaction, most of the events are governed by dice rolls, the game can drag quite a bit (especially with many players), it is difficult for anyone to win with few players (the game - or evil - can win), very easy to win when played with many (the ratio "necessary succesful tasks to thwart evil/ number of players" remains fixed which is obviously a design mistake), and so on, and so on...
But somehow it doesn't matter, as rarely there has been a game with so much totally indulgent charm (an afterword to the rules even states that playing the game actually creates the game world for real somewhere, and that our world can - vice versa - be saved when playing it as well). If you understand the rules (which are poorly organized) you can actually find a lot of tactics in the game - it's not the dumb dice fest that you first think it will be. Where the game wins you over in the end though is in the atmosphere department - for some reason the "Wizards" world REALLY becomes real, and rarely has there been a game where winning really makes you smile BENEVOLENTLY instead of gloatingly. A rare fantasy gem of the early 80's this has to belong in any fantasy gamer's collection.

Better than Talisman in that you actually have some real options available in the game but not that it really matters since you're at the mercy of the dice and cards anyway. And rather than get a bunch of people to play, you might as well play this solitaire - doesn't make a difference anyway! If you're looking for a good fantasy adventure game, don't look here.

What a throwback to another era!  Everything about this game shows its age: the components, the rules, the long repitition of mechanical choices, die rolls and charts, and a 4  hour session of slow plodding and discovery.  Not for every crowd but I enjoyed this in a 2 player game.  Given the wild swings that the dice can muster, I doubt this is really workable as a multiplayer game.  Downtime shouldn't be a factor as a turn is really quick, but the amount of paperwork can bog down an otherwise well constructed game.  Would play again with someone who knows the game but I would have a hardtime convincing my current gaming group to put in the effort for this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Enjoyable, with very interesting narrative and a good experience system.  The freedom to explore the land is quite good and its a nice change of pace as there is no real killing in the game, its more a game of movement than battles.  The winner is usually the player that can move across the map efficiently.  The character classes and their upgrade path is interesting and plays quite differently from each other.  I really enjoyed the mechanism whereby the world gets more and more dangerous as the game goes on.

The downside is the length for what you gain out of the game and the quests do have an errant running feel to them that can get monotonous after a long long game.

That said, I think the game makes for a better solitaire game than multiplayer as there is minimal player interaction.    


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Adventure boardgame with slight RPG-elements. The character development is basicly very random, because you cannot affect the quests you get and can get stuck to the first level because of that. Also bit too long for what it's offering. Watching the land areas getting eaten away by the darkness looks really good tho'. Gets played very occasionally, because despite of it's flaws it still offers some nice adventuring.

Nice looking game.  If I had this one back in the day I think I would have worn it out...  And I may still do that!

From the Designers' Notes: "Wizards", Avalon Hill c. 1982: "In Gaming, as in Ritual and Art, players act out truths. The world of the Game is a real world – the actions which transpire throughout its course are real events, and the personalities encountered have actual existence. The players enter the world of the Game, experiencing and establishing the truths of that world. But these truths are not locked only into the world of the Game, for by playing it the players make its truths realities in our world..."

One of my favorite sets of rules (very trippy).  For whatever reason this game is very immersive, but I don't know if I ever finished a game.  We used to set this up and play over a period of days and after a couple of days it usually just drifted away... we would play a few times a year.  I doubt this has aged well.

Players have very little agency in this game; it is Talisman with more co-op, worse art, and hexes rather than rings. Yes, I know, 1982, but roll to move, roll to see whether you roll more dice for random encounters, roll to see whether you get totally screwed by the dragon's lair. I think you could program a computer to play this game for you, because you have so few meaningful choices in the game.

Yeah, it's a marathon game,. so what? I love that you have to co-operate or the world starts disappearing: human settlements, elfen lands, and even the infernal regions can disappear. And the fewer lands remaining, the more difficult quests become; when quests are not completed in time, lands will be lost. What are you waiting for? Complete that quest!

It might seem unlikely that Avalon Hill would publish such a trippy and broken game, but according to Jim Dunnigan, SPI's fantasy titles were often big sellers and funded many other games, so who knows. There is something very endearing about event descriptions along the lines of "Dewberry the Snow Maiden and the Starspawn Beagle telepathically entrust the Sacred Pepperpot in your care", but that doesn't make the game work. Even in the early 80s there would have been plenty of better options for a long sitting.

Bizarre-- was this really Avalon Hill?  The game looks fascinating, but what a New Age designer note section.  No offensive spells, a semi-cooperative game.  Oddball stuff, especially the rulebook illustrations.  Played 14 days of a solo game, and found it interesting and frustrating.  

Have also played multiplayer and enjoyed it a lot but apparently was the only one.  People didn't like the nature of the dice, or that you could lose a whole turn or turns because your boat sunk and you get stuck on an island.

RATING: 10
A game that can play a little long for some (usually 3-5 hours) but is underrated in my eyes. If played solitaire or cooperatively the endgame is much shorter (and makes more sense).  The tasks per fortnight must be scaled to the number of players which they don't allow for in the original rules (3 players = roughly 5 tasks - or more for tougher play).  Conversely, there should be more demons on the board to avoid/conquer, perhaps 2 appearing instead of each 1.  The Java version is awesome but pales in comparison to really playing it out on the tabletop (that hasn't stopped me from playing it 50+ times.  If you like games like Runebound, Prophecy, or Return of the Heroes you should investigate Wizards.  Or even if you're a fan of pick up and deliver games you should check it out.  Another nice variant floating around somewhere is the 'magical item acquisition variant' which adds a nice element to the game by giving the characters minor powers while they carry said item.  A lot of players wouldn't give a 10 to a game that needs tweaks but hey, I'm a dungeon master to the core.

Tips
Play cooperatively (allow meeting players to exchange optional tasks)
Build a reasonable map, with exits off of the dragon tile.
Scale tasks per fortnight down but increase demons.
Tweak druid to allow easier access to Ruktal.

Rule book a mess which doesn`t help game play at all. At first, aimless wandering around the map will put off a lot of players.Once you do get into the heart of the game however, it`s not that bad a deal, though fighting is not the idea like Magic Realm in these quests to bring 6 gems back to Ruktal for the win

RATING: 5
This RPGesque game "interviewed" really well - great theme, fun bits, some nice aspects - but when it came down to it, it was wayy too long for what it is.  My first (and only) game was a 3-player, 6-hour monstrosity.  Players felt victimized by the capricious dice effects that could nullify a dozen turns of effort with one toss.  After the false wizard is uncovered, a player's end game seemed to be an uninteresting exercize in point-to-point travel.  We played incorrectly - without the secret wizard markers (nowhere in the rules could we find an overt explanation on how to use them) and thank God, because the game would've lasted even longer then...

The mechanics here are pretty sharp, and the balance of the various character classes well done.  There is a finely tuned balance between competitive and cooperative as well, and the ho-hum dreariness of the many fed-ex delivery-type quests is significantly moderated by the real sense of tension afforded by the flipping islands and impending disaster.  One might wish that the penalties for demon encounters and similar foes were a bit more, well, meaty than the usual "you lose three turns" affair, which tends to keep some people out of play for a lot of the game.  And, unfortunately, this sucker simply takes too long for what it is -- the movement rules need to be severely moderated to bring this under control earlier in the game (before the teleportation ability is gained).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RATING: 5
This is an entertaining, but nonetheless shitty roll-and-move pick-up-and-deliver game. It has all the hallmarks of a game designed in the 80s: crappy components that are way too small for human hands and chits too large for the board, lots of opportunities to lose your turn or waste your time doing pointless things, very long and stagnant game play, etc.

I really do like pick-up-and-deliver games, and this game offers a decent logistical challenge. Despite all the frustrating luck in this game, it's quite easy to amass Task cards (which give you something to pick up and deliver).

Also, turns are very quick, probably because there's really not much decision making to do.

Despite what some comments have said, there is barely any co-operative play in this game (this is in reference to the non-partnership version). Although players, as a group, have to complete a certain number of tasks or else something bad happens, there aren't many mechanisms for players to use to help others; it is truly multi-player solitaire.

A potentially intriguing game, but with a "sparse" and boring playability. I and my friends (all fantasy nuts) gave it two whirls back in the day, when we were in our '20s - and then we stopped. I always had the nagging idea that we missed some interesting aspect of the game that needed more that a couple of plays to be appreciated - but, to be honest, today I barely remember what it was about.

Complete and in excellent condition. Have made a few extra counters so as to simplify game play more. Have also modified Task cards so that game can be played as a variant as well as the game without variant. (We found the variant to be more fun and made victory more achievable)

... I also include a variant to allow swimming in water hexes (normal cost=2 movement points, +1 if dazed or dragon bound, drown/die if movement ends in water hex not adjacent to land)... this tries to fix the problem whereby players get stuck on islands (esp dragon tile) and are unable to escape or call in nearby boats

GREAT SOLITAIRE GAME.  I always thought the random location determination (2 dice can determine 324 locations), the weighted 1 to 6 rolling on two dice (30.5%=6,25.0%=5,19.4%=4,13.9%=3,8.3%=2,&2.8%=1), and the random map formations were neat. The game is probably too long and missing a bit of something, but a person could always fiddle with the rules a bit. I think the game deserves at least 1 or 2 points as an excellent solitaire game.  I think would alter the rules by doubling the number of demons and reducing the power of the Elves.  

UPDATE: You can play it on the computer in about one-fifth as much time.

There are some great things about this game--the progression through the spells, the feeling that your final character brushes aside problems that would have been almost insurmountable earlier--but basically the game takes far too long and has a very unsatisfying end game.

Overly charty like most old AH games, but not bad.  Has a board that really lends itself to coming up with new games using the pieces.

Long.  I wish they had streamlined this. It does feel epic, though.

Actually very good when you use the modified rules from the net (by Don Woods et al). Was quite impressed by it.

This game has many features that I would normally associate with a flawed game:  It lasts all day;  It can result in someone having so many extra goes that another player has time to go and make supper (possibly a 3 course meal) between turns; finding a particular rule is nearly impossible and it is corny as hell.  

However - and its a big however - I & my family have always loved it.  It has so much colour and character and style that all else can be forgiven.  It is fun.  As a result deserves a higher score than I would otherwise have expected.

I want to like Wizards more than it deserves. It just moves too slowly and it seems the entire game is designed just to make players not accomplish anything rather than reward them for accomplishing anything!

But the basic theme is cool - maybe someone needs to re-do this?

One of those - "Gosh I want to like this game" games.  To be fair, had some fun playing it long ago, but even then (when expecations on mechanics were low, and atmosphere and flavor overcame some shoddy design) we sensed that not being able to escape from an island for the better part of an hour and losing turns up to ying yang were less than ideal...Still, how 'bout those designer notes?  Can you imagine Rio Grande cranking out those babies?  Ah, the gaming world has changed for the better, no doubt, yet those old theme-heavy games did have something the fine-tuned machines of today sometimes lack.  Still, it's so hard to go back to this one without just the right peace pipe in hand.

Semi-cooperative, in that players compete (sometimes aiding each other) to win by being the first to meet the victory condition, but it's also a race against time and all players lose if the race is lost. There are some echoes of Earthsea and Lord of the Rings. It might be the most new-agey game ever produced by AH. Certainly it's one of their weirder products. Nonetheless it's a physically beautiful game - well, for 1982 anyway - full of long haired hippie-type wizard art. The most interesting thing about the physical design of the game is the way in which the many islands that populate the map are die-cut mini-maps in themselves. As the game progresses some of them are lost to evil influences and flipped over to show completely black back sides, which is a surprisingly effective way to ratchet up the tension. I think there is more modestly scaled, shorter, simpler, but equally atmospheric game trapped in this one and hoping in vain to escape. (In fact I'd say a lot of AH non-historical titles are like that.)

Fun game, but the more players you have the better; we learned after playing this once that it's best to keep the tiles reasonably close to together so it's easier to move around. If they're too spread out, it makes completing quests difficult, and then they start getting flipped over!

All my games have been very fun. Superb game, but a old game by this cause not is a 10 for me.

I got the game at age 12, but never found anyone to play it with, so it was in my game cabinet for years...well about 25 years.

Conflict resolution for pacifists.  Old school multi-player solo with early elements of semi-coop mechanics.  A solid AH fantasy themed game with relatively easy rules.

I love this game.  Fun to play, and easy to teach.  The fantasy setting is enjoyable, and the multitude of tasks make the game play like a complex story.

I recently converted this game into a Java application you can play on your computer.  If you want to give it a try, visit http://wizards.dewkid.com/

Cooperative game with experience point system. Often the best rewards came to those who aided their fellow players the most (quite different from the other wargame influenced games of the era)

It&#039;s got some interesting ideas, and the flavor is...well...different, at least. But it goes on too long and is just not that much fun.

Probably the worst thing I ever tried to play. Just to remind that even Avalon Hill was not a warranty of quality in the golden eighties ...

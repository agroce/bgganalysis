{1 play • 5 player} An interesting idea, but I'm not sure you can do much here without getting some key cards.

RATING: 8
A fun card game that seems to confuse some people.  It's really not that hard to understand.  It plays up to 8 people, so it often comes out when there is a group of us looking for something light to play.

RATING: 8
Not a classic by any stretch, but much better than expected. Short, simple, but the strategy is not entirely trivial, and it plays well with larger numbers of players, as well as with more casual gamers.  Recommended as a lighter, occasional game.

A good fun, mind-bending "dump your cards" game. Can be hard to explain to a new player, but an entertaining filler once they get it.

RATING: 8
A lot better than Take 6! Most importantly, scales better even if you play wih 8 players. Overall, a fun game in a small package. I do like Ole also because the climbing aspect of Ole invokes nostalgia of all the Big Two games I played back in the army.

Quite a nice trick taking card game.

RATING: 7
A blindingly simple card game, which makes it too hard for my group to follow! A higher what? A higher colour means lower or equal number? Are you sure? YES!!!! We managed one tortuous round and then stopped. There is a good game here, aching for a player aid that made it as easy as it should be. *** Played it again, again I struggled to make decisions, but I won.

I loved this game the first 3-4 times I played it, and now find it decent, and one of the few that work well with 8 players.

How can a game played with 4 suits of cards be so evil?  Delicious!

RATING: 7
Good game with a fun mechanic of flipping the cards to invert their values in play. Might be too crazy with 8 (which is how we played it) but I had fun.

Simple, tight little game. It's a climbing card game, similar to Frank's Zoo. Says it supports eight, but does not work with that number. Six is a sensible maximum.

RATING: 7.1
Very good card trick-taking/card elimination game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It has a couple of gameplay quirks that make it a little more interesting than other card games of its ilk (particularly the ability to reverse suit values), but it is essentially a game of luck with minimal tactics.

I liked this but it didn't go over too well in the group.  It is a little Geshenkt like.

Is Red or Yellow high?  Only the loser (of the previous hand) can say...  Another fun little card game.

Surprisingly good card game with unique elements. But it might be even better; now it suffers: 1) a card luck, 2) because every card is in play (no surprise elements).

Played once.  Pretty good trick taking game.  Again, there's not much new here, but the twist of variable suit valuation makes it "different."

Rather unusual climbing game.

This is a quick, simple little game.  Some people have trouble with the whole "climbing in two ways" concept, so it's not as popular with my play group as I would like.

For some reasons I still like a game of Ole at times.

An interesting card game that takes a little while to figure out the best plays, as there's enough different going on.

Just have the cards. No rules or box.

RATING: 5
Hey, I won, so it must be a great game, right?  Took some time to get my head around the card play mechanism of either beating suit or beating the value of the card played.  Some chances for clever card play but mostly restricted to surviving the round with few real choices.  I pretty much played on autopilot, with a couple decisions that I don't know if they really mattered.

First impression: An interesting climbing game where there are 4 suits ranked from lowest to highest but higher number always beats a higher suit. Add into the mix that if you play higher in both suit & number, you must play another card. It's tempting to play your "higher in both" straights but then you might leave yourself in quite a bad position as if you can't play you must take penalty points. I liked the mechanics of the game with 3 players even though I'm not too sure if it is really possible to play anything other than an excellent hand really well. More than four players turns this definitely into a luckfest and I wouldn't like to try it even if box says up to 8 players..

This takes the prize for the simplest rule to explain and yet one of the hardest to intuitively grasp. Cards are ranked by colour and number. Imagine Uno, and there's a top card on the discard pile. Play a card higher in colour and number - play again. Otherwise, play a card higher in just number or colour. If you can't do that, take a penalty chip. First to get rid of cards wins. The rest score face value + penalty chips. Play multiple hands. Get past the quirkiness of it, and we've found ourselves warming to it. You're at first looking for a go-out plan, helped if you have some of the guaranteed go-out cards. If you have, then put aside any play-again combos you have and aim to get out as quickly as you can. Poor hands will require more conservative play to ensure you're not stuck with no-play turns. We think it works best with 3 or 4 rather than the 8 on the box. Card luck and your dependence on the strength of the hand of the player to your right may be overwhelming in the final analysis, but we enjoy it as a closer.

A nice - somewhat unusual climbing game. It is certainly a plus that you can call "Ole!"

The concept of valid discarding is  confusing, slowing game play and not making it an enjoyable experience. I was hoping the game would meet the 8 player range but I can't imagine playing this with more than 4.

A good challenge that makes you think and is enjoyable at the same time. Nice and tricky. This is one of those card games that seems to spark enjoyable social interaction - nothing is too serious - enjoy the ride.

RATING: 6.5
A quick card game that has a vaguely interesting discard mechanism: can either discard using a high number or a higher colour suit. Loser of round gets to transpose power of the colour suit. Not many plays but seems like playing it safe is the way to go. Keep the powerful red cards till the end. I suck at this game.

Ole is such an incredibly simple game that it is counterintuitive to learn.  The neat trick of flipping the suit strengths by flipping the cards over is delightful.

Better than average climbing game. It's a decent game that plays with up to eight, which is tough to find.

Score after one play. And probably only because I won. A counter-intuitive game that took awhile to catch on to. I would gladly play it again as I think it has a neat self-balancing mechanism (you need to hold on to high cards to play at certain points, but if they get caught in your hand they count against you.)

I need to get a proper translation. The ones available at this site and others online are lacking to say the least. I really like the idea of the game and the ability to dump cards in a series - and balancing it with the potential of not being able to play on a turn.

Cute ladder building card game. I would play if someone asked but I have more than enough cute card games.

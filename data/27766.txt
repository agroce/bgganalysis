I'm not a great Catan fan, but I think this is a really good version for young people.  Not really kids, the game is not so simple.  It keeps the good things of the adult's game.  Very good.

This kids' version of Catan is definitely very close to the original: it has the same mechanics (build on hexes, gather resources with die roll, trade resources, build on hexes) but is much less varied and challenging.
It is definitely not a piece of great design: it is complicated to teach (though my 3-and-half daughter was able to understand everything from first play), longer than the average child's attention span, and not so different from the original...
My guess: in gamer's houses, kids could start playing with normal Catan when they can stand one-hour long games, instead of trying this version!

Sokat Catanoztam és elmondhatom, hogy kisgyerekeknek abszolút megfelelő ez a játék. Nagy élménnyel szerezték meg a nyersanyagokat és kezdték el cserélgetni nyerés céljából. Ajánlott, ha kisgyerekkel szeretne az ember játszai Catant

Avec les enfants, c'est vraiment bien. En plus, contrairement à d'autres version junior, celle-ci est réellement différente de la version adulte tout en étant directement liée aux mécaniques utilisées dans la version adulte.

Simplified Settlers of Catan game for children: no cities, no distance rule, only 1 die and introduction of a market place for easier trading; nice to be able to play Catan with a 6-year old child; however, only playable during a certain period of age; soon you will start playing the original game.

Rating based on my interest playing with children of the appropriate age, in this case age 6+. 

This Klaus Teuber game is in German only.  Rules in English are here on BGG.  There are also a few cards in German, but there are only essentially 3 kinds and they include descriptive pictures so they are easily understood.  This game has been out for sometime, and with the popularity of the Catan games, I wonder why this game has not been published in many languages since it is one of the nicest games I have played that is made specifically for children.  I am just very pleased with it.

Components are lighter weight molded plastic than I would like, but very nice design.   Graphics & colors on the board and cards are okay.  

It is the play where this game shines.  Play is similar to the regular Catan game, but modified so that it moves quickly and is of course, a little less complicated.  Thea pirate theme makes the game more attractive & interesting to children, and it is carried out very well, featuring ships & pirate strongholds/warehouses.  For instance, the players are pirates who sail from location to location instead of building roads.

Lovely game for the kids. Though they do play the grown-up version this version is easier and they can now play on their own (they are 4 and 6).

Great introduction to the Catan franchise. My 5 and 8 year old kids just can't get enough, and if they do, it will be very easy to switch to heavier stuff (such as the basic game).

The perfect introduction game for families with kids who can't read or who find the mother game too daunting.

RATING: 5
Like Settlers of Catan, just stripped of everything that makes it interesting. What remains is a resource collection and building game that is interesting for smaller kids. The outcome is mostly decided by luck instead of strategic and tactical decisions.

Our first Catan game and not very impressed. A little boring and long for a children's game, but maybe it's just the way we played. Hopefully, it will get better with a couple more plays.

Update: Upping my rating after a couple more plays. Now that we know how to play, the game flows along smoothly. My oldest son really enjoys this one as it is a good stepping stone to 'adult' games. He is not too keen on playing children's games anymore.

This rating is based on playing with my kids. For just grown ups this would drop to 6 or maybe even 5. Our 5 year old son loves the games and can't get enough of it. It is indeed a nice step up for the 'real' thing.

Update 11-2010: Just played the game for the first time with our now 5.5 year old daughter. She likes is just as much as our son did.

Pretty nice simplified version of Catan. Has the key elements of the big game, but enough simplifications to make the game work for kids. Nothing for adults only, though.

Works with two, even though the box says otherwise.

Indifferent.

I'm obviously not the target audience for this, but it seemed like a pretty good Settlers variant for kids -- smaller board, only one die, and simplified trading. Given that it goes a lot faster, I enjoy it rather more than its parent game. Great little pirate ships and pirate lairs, too!

Use welfare-token rules to play this: when ghost (6) is not thrown and you don't get a resource, you get a welfare-token instead. You may buy a resource of your choice using as many tokens as you have VP's at the moment of purchase.

While the tiles look very similar to the original carcassone, this game actually plays pretty differently. Because it is so much easier to close off areas (by placing non-matching tiles), this game plays much more aggressively in our group. I also get a much heavier sense of anticipation/exilaration as the castle walls chase around the perimeter, threatening to close off your work! 

It plays best for our group with 3 or 4 people.

Another great evolution of the Carcassonne concept, with great 'bits' and a nice sturdy wooden chest to put them all in. A game with lots of things to think about, and plenty of depth and replayability.

The walled city comes alive on your table. The third round, where walls seem to come out every second turn or so, tends to break the flow of the game. Still worth it for those who love Carc' and certainly better than buying one of the other stand alones.

This Carcassonne version is the best of them all, but I'm still not sure how much I like it. I will definitely only play this one now... the question is how much I will want to play it when there are so many other great games out there. I'll give it a few more tries. If I can't get it up to a 7, out it goes! UPDATE: I just don't like Carcassonne. I realize that I have no need to own any of the Carc games. UPDATE: Traded for Parthenon: Rise of the Agean.

Makes my brain melt. None of the traditional Carcassonne tactics work, and there isn't much gratification in the tile placement (they don't fit as nicely as H/G or regular carc), but still a very good game.

RATING: 5
From the Reviews: This is recommended by some if you like carcassonne and it is considered by most to be a little more sleek and slightly more meaty that the orignial. I loved carcassonne but the love waned and now it rarely hits the table. I think that I will probably stick with one carcassonne game for a long long time.

A simple tile game.  Build a new City each time!!

RATING: 7
A very beautiful game with a nice set of self contained rules. Reactions when I brought the nice wood box to work was universal... "Wow, what is that? A game? How do you play?". Not entirely different than the original, but enough to deserve a place in my collection. While I like it better than basic Carcassonne, I rate that higher due to the simplicity of the base set and the additional fun of it's expansions. 
I still feel that there are small missed opportunities...  many of the innovations of previous standalone Carcassonnes are MIA...For ex. the fields being worth # of deer minus # of tigers, or the bonus tiles for accomplishing certain actions, etc. Those mechanics led to more aggressive, varied and surprising play than is likely to occur here (and more chaotic). The City is similar to the base set in that you can counter your opponent by blocking future points, but there is no real way to remove points or get a surprising lead through a bonus tile (of course, whether that is good or bad is a matter of taste)
So, in the end, we have a very nice, well tuned "advanced" version of basic Carcassonne.

RATING: 8
An improved version of Carcassonne which to me is a amazing evergreen game to introduce to casual gamers. It has strategic choices and the finished game looks amazing to behold with castle walls, gates and towers. 

Downside is the more players there are the less strategic it is due to the draw of the tiles and the actions of each subsequent player but still I can't say it is totally random with the max 4 players either. It is also much harder to teach and grasp for very causal gamers as there are more rules than just vanilla Carcassonne if you are getting it as an intro game. 

Overall, highly recommended if you don't intend to get any expansions for the base game and just want one solid Carcassonne game in your collection.

RATING: 8
The look and tactile experience of a game is as important to me as the gameplay.  This is a gorgeous execution of a solid game that I will return to again and again.  Unlike standard Carc, the available scoring methods morph with the introduction of the walls, towers, and guards. More than just adding more scoring options at the end of the game, this forces me to apply longer-term thinking to my tile placement in the beginning as well.

Rules seem cleaner than the original's, and the walls add interesting strategic considerations, but I feel like it loses the carefree feeling of its precursor with the addition of the walls and guards. The way the walls cut off options makes the whole thing seem more frantic, and less easygoing

Another interesting different Carc.

RATING: 5
Weird stand-alone Carc variant. It's OK but definitely feels like strategy is very different, unlike Ark of the Covenant which basically plays almost the same as the original. 

Also it took us like 2/3 of the game to realize you put the walls on their sides. We had been putting them down flat (very low) which was confusing and awkward to work with, and the wall just looked like a long bar bench table thing more than an actual wall.  

On the plus side, you can ironically (or unironically, if that's your thing) chant "Build the wall!" whenever you play this.

I have fond memories of playing Carcassonne in the summertime. This version replaces the farmers in the vanilla version and adds walls that are used to finish elements in mid-game. This could be a replacement for regular Carcassonne, but so is Hunters and Gatherers, which I already have. BGG review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/32582/user-review

There's more to worry about here than with standard Carc.  I like how the game shifts from a fairly standard Carcassonne scoring setup to a more delicate balance of setting up points within the city while not letting your opponents get good wall position.  Neat addition to the series.

A very solid entry in the series. Plays a bit like "Carcassonne: Castle", but with the extra coolness of the wall pieces. Those make the game really gorgeous, and add a layer of interesting strategy: when to place meeples has never been more fun! Looking forward to playing this game more...

Much better than the original, which is the only other Carcassonne I've played.  Building the walls and towers, and the fact that tiles only need to be connected by roads, adds additional strategy and freedom in tile placement, which I thought the first game was lacking.

I just do not like Carcassonne.  I find it way too light and the moves are almost always obvious yet it promotes AP...  I know its ironic.  There are other much better "gateway" games.    For some reason, most of the people I teach this game to is always confused. My wife likes the game quite a lot though and always asks for it.  At any rate, this game gets a 6.

Well, I gave the game another shot after I lent the game to my friends for a year.  It isn't that bad compared to what my comments seem to say above.  It is a light game and should be a good gateway game.  Maybe it was just my poor teaching skills back then that people had a hard time learning it.  This was the very first game I bought after Settlers and discovered BGG.  Just like any gateway game I'll play it if I have to.  Even though this game I feel like is still to be rated as a 6, it is very unique compared to the other games in my collection.  The game is reminiscent of Dominoes and those people that love dominoes should also love this game.
Rating: 6 -> 6.

This takes Carcassonne and corrects a few of the things I didn't like so much, (multipliers for bigger closings, no place-and-pulling of meeples) and adds a couple of interesting things as well (walls, towers, guards). We've played several times, and each game has had interesting twists. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Might be the best/tightest version of Carcassonne yet.  The way the walls restrict building opportunities over time adds yet another layer to the thought process - as does the number of ways you can lock up a meeple for the rest of the game... you really have to conserve your guard/merchant choices.

Our favorite Carcassonne game. I like all of the different scoring options. I like that you can you have more valid options for where to place your tiles. I like it that you can't put a guy on a market or road that just got completed. And the board looks really cool at the end of the game.
Scoring track should go to 100 though. 50 can be a little confusing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Whilst we slavishly kept buying the various editions of the "Carcassonne" franchise, my expectations of them kept going down with each new variation on a theme. I enjoyed bits in all of them, but if I had only known the first version of the game (with the "River" expansion tiles), I would probably have been just as happy. With each new gimmicky tile set our enthusiasm for more tiles and variations dwindled a bit, to the point that this reworking was left completely unplayed after acquiring it. Set apart for that rainy day, when it would be just the ticket. Even in Scotland that still meant waiting the best part of two years.

p: Anyone surprised if I said I liked this better by far? The original incarnation is without doubt still the superior game for families and newcomers to the hobby, and evidently hard to beat for global appeal. But for gamers who can put up with a marginally slower game this will offer a far better balanced scoring system and a wider variety of scoring opportunities. It all seems to make a much better integrated whole, with cause and effect of the various elements making a surprisingly snug fit. Considered placement has become even more important.

Some of that is caused by subtle alterations to the standard rules (you can't place and remove a meeple to immediately cash in on a tile just played), but most of it is a result of the addition of the what easily could have been a  gimmick-for-gimmick's sake: the walls, towers and guards. By slowly strangling the playing surface and introducing scoring along grid lines, whole new dimensions comes into play, making this a much more richly layered dilemma feast.

My main gripes with standard Carcassonne, the super-fields and the anti-climatic endgame (in which last tiles drawn usually mean you get to either make crucial changes to balances that took a game to create, or have no other option left than to make wholly inconsequential placements) are taken out. Because the playing area slowly gets closed down, easy escapes are no longer an option, meeples are in even shorter supply, and for each placed tile and meeple even more considerations have to be weighed up. And it has a ton of wood.

It's not perfect. The artwork on the tiles could have been much clearer by using less clutter. The less restrictive joining rules sit somewhat uncomfortably with me, although I can see why it makes gaming sense. The scoring within the city might be a bit undervalued compared to what can be scored from the wall point of view, especially since sacrificing a meeple until the final scoring round is quite an investment. And although I find the game more interesting, it has lost some of its quick-fun factor.

A house rule here, for all draw-and-play tile games, is to have one extra tile in hand, increasing the strategic choices for all involved. This time we all agreed that this would be counter productive as the looser playing restrictions already make players ponder longer over the choices on offer, and adding an extra tile would just increase turn time without having a huge impact on your forward planning capabilities.

I suspect that this is more the gamers' version of Carcassonne, and if you are looking for something a bit more challenging than the perfect bridge-game-version, this walled variety is probably it. For now.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I fell in love with the wooden box and wood walls. The rules are more involved than for most other Carcasonne games, unless you're talking about basic Carcassonne with all the expansions (which gets a bit hairy, though I like the combination often enough).  Certainly the rules are much cleaner.  I like the addition of landmarks, and the wooden walls and towers are nice.

[url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com/2007/06/carcassonne-city.html]Carcassonne: La ciudad[/url] es un entretenido juego táctico. Su base es el Carcassonne, a quien le guste el  Carcassonne (como a mi), sin duda alguna, le gustará este. En mi caso, no teniendo ninguno y gustándome el básico, con este tengo mas que de sobra, ya que atesora toda la esencia del Carcassonne básico y además no necesita ninguna expansión para mejorarlo, es un juego completo. El concepto de la muralla y las torres pueden considerarse una expansión.

Una cosa que me gusta son los mercados y los barrios, son fáciles de distinguir y todo queda muy clarito a la hora de puntuar, los campesinos del Carcassonne básico me han llevado más de un quebradero de cabeza a la hora de explicarlo a neófitos, aquí todo es mucho más visual y debes estar muy ciego para no ver los barrios y mercados con un simple golpe de vista.

Su arte a medida que se desarrolla de la partida es espectacular, cuando entran muralla y torres, es de una belleza que pocos juegos consiguen.

Imprescindible en cualquier ludoteca.

The walled city is a very nice addition to the game. The laying of the different looking tile borders against each other feels a bit awkward and takes away the beauty of a completed base game. Still a very nice tile laying game with enough difference to original Carcassonne to be worth owning.

If you love Carcassonne, which I do, then you will really enjoy Carcassonne: The City. The added feature of adding walls is nicely done. Don't worry about it changing the game because it doesn't. You put your followers on top of the walls to control rows of tiles that the wall faces. It is just another added point system to the game, and the rest is the same Carcassonne as ever. I highly recommend this game. I just wish they would come out with at least one expansion for it.

Packaging matters: the wooden box together with the wooden components lured me into buying this game. It's a standalone variant of basic Carcassonne. My major disappointment is that the tiles do not have to be a perfect match anymore. A marketplace can be cut off abruptly by a urban area. But this is merely a matter of esthetics

The City may actually be a superior game to the base Carcassonne, but the expansions to the original make for a better experience.  I do love the wall for the City, but I absolutely *detest* how markets and residentials can be placed back to back.  This aspect, combined with the colour choices for market and residential tiles, makes for a much uglier looking game.

Let me first say that when I first played Plain Vanilla Carcassonne I was pretty disappointed. However, recently - by discovering Hunters & Gatherers and the two tile choice variant (playing one, keeping the other) - I've warmed to this boardgame seller.

Unfortunately, Die Stadt left me rather cold. The various scoring methods within the city don't really draw me in. What is more, the tiles are quite counterintuitive in that markets - similar to cities in the original - are meadows and residential areas brownish. The opposite from what we know from the original. If you look at a medieval city, this does not make sense. Residential areas contained gardens, vegtable patches and orchyards, while marked where held on streets and squares. This may be an odd quibble, but I have to confess that the graphical appeal of the world of H&G being created is not an insubstantial part of that gaming experience. Die Stadt feels all wrong for me.

Further, the graphics themselves are oddly cluttered and just don't work for me. Worse still, one being allowed to but a brown side of a tile right where there's a green one, destroys that organic flow. Just not where I think Carcassonne: Die Stadt should have gone for the sake of a new gameplay twist.

Really, the redeeming feature of this one is the city wall and the watchmen on top of them. I wish that would have been combined with something more satisfactory going on within the city. 

Really, I don't see why one should shell out €30 for this one when Carcassonne and Hunters & Gatherers is sold for round €10. This is for the "hardcore" Carcassonne fan.

PS: Beats me how one can find these graphics nice than H&G. H&G isn't so squibblishly drawn, has more interesting detail and creates an interesting landscape. Ah well. To each his own. That said, the wall is very nice. The meeples on the other hand are oddly shaped.

I think it's a mix of Carcassonne, Carcassonne The Castle and Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers. As I'm not very fond of H&G and The Castle, I don't find this game great either. I still like the original Carcassonne the best. I think it's hard to sabotage other players and build into other players' markets due to the new tile placement rules (compared to the old Carc). I think the guards are neat, and it's a funny idea that you build the castle wall around the city, and though it actually is an okay game which I would play again, I just don't see why I need to keep it when the original Carcassonne does almost the same thing but better.

Not as good as the original Carcassonne or The Castle. Mostly I dislike the washed-out look of the market tiles. Also the image you get by placing market areas (green) right next to residential areas (tan) is not pleasing to the eye. Which is a shame really, because the overall look of the game with its wooden walls and towers really is great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'm a fan of Carcassonne the base game, and my wife and I have gotten plenty of play out of the original. So, trying this version, it's interesting to compare the two.

I dunno... I love the pieces and the look of the completed city, and I also like how roads are scored double if they are 4+ tiles long. But the wall in practice feels a bit wonky... players can get a hefty chunk of points by placing a guard, simply if they are in the lucky seating position to benefit from it. I might be missing something, but it made me miss the more straightforward approach of the original.

I'll play it, but it's not replacing my base copy.

I like the added complexity that grows throughout the game as you introduce the walls, guards, and towers.  Just make sure you save some workers for those walls cause they can score a lot of points.  Farms/residential areas seem to be more balanced than in the base game, but can still run away with it a bit.

RATING: 7
I'll hop on the bandwagon and say this is the best Carcassone.  I'm not sure I feel the need to own my old one anymore.  Figuring out which expansions to play with started getting frustrating... so it's nice to get back to a basic, self-contained set.  That being said, if you had big problems with the original, I don't see this changing your mind.  If you liked the original, you'll probably like this a lot more.  I have heard complaints about walls constraining the game too much, but I haven't felt that way during play.  Also, it's a beautiful set.

Seems like a good game which happens not to work for me that well. It was merely OK for me. Yes it is pretty, with nice wooden pieces.  The game mechanic is reasonable, thoughtful, and it was OK for me, but I didn't feel the love. And, now, please brace yourselves--I know that this is ridiculous--I don't like the bloody red butcher-market tiles. I don't know if it's because I'm vegetarian, an animal-lover, or because I played the game during an unfortunate time of depressing real war. So, if you like the game, ignore my comments and enjoy it.

I guess this is the best of the Carcassonne games. Both material and gameplay are top if you like rather simple tile laying / building games. Nice to play if you want something light, however it is not a short game.

It looks strange that markets can end right next to a living area, the look 100% cut off. This building rule completly breaks with the placement tradion of Carcassonne games, requiring that new tiles always continue structures or close them up with a clear special ending tile. Simply does not look right!

It just doesn't feel as smooth as the original Carcassonne (and expansions). The first problem is the features are just ugly to look at (on the tiles, that is--the wooden walls are nice). The whole wall thing is a bit ridiculous, because there's not nearly adequate control for placement, and often all you can do is choose who to give massive points to. And if you get the points, it's not any good thing you did, but rather an unconscious result of who caused the scoring.

Components: Great wooden pieces, nice linen-coated tiles. The art is very detailed, with lots of tiny people on each tile, yet the tiles aren't too busy-looking.

Experience: I don't think I can consider this game without also considering the others in the series. I like the walls, which add a new strategic reason to trigger scoring, and make the city beautifully enclosed by game's end (something the Castle begins with, and the other two definitely lack, with all their unfinished areas). I like the market scoring multiplier. I miss being able to plop down a meeple on the tile I've just played, score a few quick points, and get my meeple back. And like in the Castle, I dislike not having to match up the terrain types; it makes for a less aesthetically pleasing product, and makes it a bit too easy to close sections off (and cut people off). My favorites are still H&G (for the mechanics and game play), and the original (for the art and theme).

I absolutely hate this expansion and will never play with it.
I dislike it so much because I like carcassonne. The City does not expand Carcassonne, but totally changes it, perverting Player incentives so that there are no large castles or roads built and the entire game becomes about farmers fighting for area control of farms.
(If you don't mind that, you won't dislike The City the way I do. )
I just don't like this new game, it isn't Carcassonne anymore and that's the game I'd rather play.

The walls complicate the game (and possibly take it out of the entry-level category) by slowly constricting the playing area and adding more torture to the decision to place or conserve a meeple. While the sprawling farm is gone, you still can pile up perhaps too many points with its counterpart --- the residential area --- because of the rule that permits dissimilar land types to share the common edge of adjacent tiles. On the other hand, blocking the sprawl is easier for the same reason. I miss the simplicity of the original, however.

A solid game that unfortunately lives in the shadow of its older brother and is now is out of print.

Carcassonne The City is a lot more spatially strategic and interactive, particularly with the wall segment of the game. In some respects, it feels a lot like playing regular Carcassonne with a couple of the expansions thrown in -- making you think a little more beyond just the basic moves.

My one gripe is that the color scheme of the game is pretty much the opposite of regular Carcassonne (eg. what effectively are the fields in this game are brown, and what mimic the castles are green.) Sorta throws you off if you are a regular Carcassonne player.

Game play: resource management of not running out of meeples.
Play consists of maximizing own points each play, while minimizing leaders points.  The trick to winning: finessing the sharing of any large scoring farm areas that an opponent creates.

The best of the Carcassonne games. The growth of the wall through the game adds an interesting dynamical aspect to the game, cutting off some options and introducing tension through the competition for the guard and tower points. The limiting of the matching condition to roads (markets do not need to match) makes it much easier to fill spaces with three neigbours than in the original game where both roads and cities must match.

Another game in the seemingly never ending run of Carcassonne games.  Players draw and place tiles, place pawns, try to score points, etc.  However, the quick cash-in play of place and score immediately is now forbidden.  Also, at a third of the way through the tiles the city gate and walls begin to be built.  This allows for guards to be placed on the wall to guard (ie. score at game end) for buildings along the "row" they are guarding.  This version plays quite well, introducing some new subtleties - sufficiently different to pick up if you like these games.

carcassonne: the city : non smetterò mai di ripeterlo, questo gioco rappresenta l'apoteosi di carcassonne. Semplice quasi come il base, ha una maggiore varietà di tessere, e il meccanismo della costruzione delle mura costringe a giocare e cercare di tirar fuori il meglio da aree che normalmente avremo ignorato. Stupendo davvero, soprattutto rispetto al base, che sì viene migliorato dalle prime due espansioni, ma lo allungano e lo appesantiscono oltremodo. vittoria anche qui

RATING: 6
Didn't much enjoy my first game.  Not requiring urban and market areas to match up prevented the mid-term structure on the map that allows for strategy.  The walls phase was better, but you often had no choice whether or not to trigger scoring, leaving less use for tactics than I would have liked. I ought to play it again, but vastly prefer Carc+I&C at this point.

Good game so far, 2 games played, and like it so far. the walls add a lot to the game, but still not sure about how tiles can fit together... Only roads need to be connected, where other things can clash.  I hope there's some sort of expansion, as I get the feeling that we get through this game too quickly.

PERSONAL COPY. Such an improvement over the original. I'm gonna have to track down a copy! There are less restrictions on tile placement so tiles drawn are not so entirely luck-based. Towers add a push-your-luck element to the game, which heightens the tension a bit. Also, finishing your opponents structures is sometimes a viable option in order to secure those valuable Public Buildings. Overall, I like it a lot.

Carcassonne: The City is a very different take on Carcassonne. The biggest change to the game is the wall that's built around the tiles, but let's not jump ahead of ourselves. The actual tiles are easier to place legally than in normal Carc. The only limitation is that roads need to connect to roads. This game's version of cities (markets) are scored differently and can be 'closed off/scored' by what would be considered 'fields' in normal Carc. For this reason, I find it more difficult and perhaps less worthwhile to try and horn in on an opponent's 'city.' The roads are more beefed up in this game in that if your road is 4+ tiles long, you get 2/tile (instead of 1/tile). Otherwise it's the normal 1/tile. Another big difference is that you can't do the 'pop scoring.' What I mean by this is, you can't place a meeple on a feature of the tile you've placed (ie road or 'city') if it would complete a feature and there are no meeples on the feature.

As you can imagine, this changes Carc a fair bit already, but this doesn't even include the wall. The tiles are initially placed in 3 stacks (A, B, C). When A is depleted and people are drawing from B, if a player initiates scoring, wall pieces are placed in an alternating pattern. The first person places the gate, from which the walls extend from. When placing wall pieces players can place a meeple on the walls. These are stuck here until the end of the game and looks at all the tiles in the row or column (to the end or a gap). If the tiles that are being looked at have specific buildings that are in the 'fields' of the tiles, they will score points at the end of the game. Due to this feature and the game having something similar to 'farmer' scoring, it's even tougher to manage your meeples. At the end of wall placing, the player who triggered scoring can lay a tower at the end of a string of walls and score points. Hence, you may really want to score, even if it means trigger scoring for an opponent's feature. When scoring is triggered each time during the C pile, double the number of walls are placed. There are 2 new end of game triggers that revolve around the walls.

To me, this feels really different than normal Carcassonne. In ways, it feels more strategic because of the easier tile placement. On the other hand, triggering scoring is really important during the mid-to-late game, which will be dependent on tile draws. There is definitely more table presence with the wall enclosing the tiles and the wooden box of the original printing. All I can really say at this point is: give it a try if anything I said piques your interest. The jury is still out for me.

I typically shy away from sequels or expansions, but I was completely drawn to this because of the nice wooden blocks.  The concept of Carcassonne is pretty much the same, but with a slightly different spin on the rules.  The tiles are more detailed and attractive than H&G, but only plays up to 4 players.  It's fun to sit back and look at the city when the game's complete.  Grade: B+

Next to the two player game, Carcassonne The Castle, this is my favorite Carcassonne.

First of all the 3-D aspect with the walls, towers, & city gates.  These features are beautifully designed, and the 2 shorter walls (that go next to the gate) are slightly darker so if they get mixed in with the other 70 walls, they can be easily found.

The walls, towers, guards, pubic & historic buildings add much greater depth to the game.  Unfortunately there are a lot more options to consider which can lead to brain burning.  As the walls enclose the city, options do start diminishing. There is a nice balance because as meeples are freed, they become available as guards who stay on the walls to the end.

Scoring still has a difficult & fiddly element with the stewards on large & complex residential areas.  I detest scoring these areas.

Interestingly, streets must match up, but all other features may be placed without regard to similar landscape.

Love the wood box.

The game's 3-D features are a visual delight and add considerable strategy.  Looking forward to more plays.

RATING: 7
My favorite of the Carcassonne incarnations.  It is the most beautiful and certainly purest way of playing as this one actually involves building the city that spawned a tsunami of expansions.  The walls mechanic force a new choice which at the start does not seem to be all that obvious when you are casually laying tiles from which you hope to expand.  Walls quickly change the possibility of expansion and create new scoring opportunities thus creating even more walls.  The city looks really nice once built.

My second favorite of the Carcassonne series (behind only the base game plus all those expansions).  It's possible towards the end of the game that nearly all of your meeples will either be in residential areas or on walls, so you need to be careful how you manage them.  And the wall is like the river from the original game, except you build it during the game instead of beforehand.  Tower placement is key too, and adds emphasis to not only scoring lots of points, but scoring often as well. All of our games have been two-player so far, and there's a temptation to be stingy with your towers, but you shouldn't.

But possibly the game's biggest improvement over others in the series is the variable endgame - you can never be sure when it's going to end.  One of our games ended well before we finished the third stack.

The game does come with two cloth bags, despite the fact that they are not actually used to draw tiles.  We cannibalized them for use with The Castle and The Discovery.

the closing walls combined with easier tile placement (only roads have to match, which makes fields/cities very different too) make this a very different game than basic Carcassone or Hunters&Gatherers.

The game started off rather ho-humly however, and I wasn't quite sure if I was going to like it. However, by the time the walls were brought in, it got a lot more involving and intense. Apart from the rather convoluted scoring system (that gets easier to understand and appreciate after a while) I thought this was a nice edition to the Carc family, and definitely is a meatier feeling version of the base game. Quite lovely to look at too after the game is over. I'd definitely want to play again!

An interesting variant with some really nice components. It gets an odd rhythm around endgame with the triggering of wall placements, almost like what a chain of farmer placements at the end of a regular game of Carcassonne would feel like. It becomes quite a nail-biter to see who pulls out ahead.

Overall this feels like a more strategic, tense, and competitive game than vanilla Carcassonne.

I've only played two person games and the wall placement is THE make or break portion of the game.  Also, the residential ares don't score nearly enough to justify the permanent placement of a meeple.

A great variant of classic Carcassonne and certainly better-looking than the basic game. The first part (1st stack of tiles) is a bit slow and similar to regular Carc. With the second stack of tiles the walls are introduced, things get more interesting and the city starts taking its shape. The last third of the game becomes very tense and frantic with the endgame closing in at an increased speed. 
Quite a few strategies are possible and walls can be used both to block your adversaries' paths and to let you score valuable points. 
Components are excellent and the wooden box (first edition) is a very nice touch. The final view with the city completely surrounded by walls is quite pretty. 
Negative aspects: the rulebook, while generally informative, leaves a couple of debatable points. Only 4 players can take part into the fun. Not expandable and therefore less replayable than regular Carcassonne.

Fun, fast, and fixes many if the confusing or annoying aspects of the original.  Love how when you finish a game you can look down at the board you built and actually see a city, complete with roads and parks (markets).  The guard mechanic and towers can really even out a game and keeps everyone within striking distance, rarely is there a blowout, despite the wife bragging she always wins by more than I beat her.
NOTE: Just introduced the in-laws to the game, neither of whom are gamers by any stretch of the imagination, but they both loved the game so much that they lefty house afterwards and went straight to the FLGS and ordered a copy.  I heart this game even more now.

RATING: 6
I hate to say it because the wall is a clever and beautiful addition to the game, but Carcassonne the City is by far the weakest of the Wrede-designed Carcassonne games.  The looser rules for matching tiles, where only the roads must match, suck most of the strategy out of the game.  Those rules worked okay with the constrained spaces and incremental emphasis of the Castle (Knizia’s Carcassonne), but I’m afraid they fail here.  There’s no sense of gamesmanship or manuever in the early stages of the game.  Very few points will be scored inside the city itself, since blocking any decent markets and roads is a trivial task.  The majority of the points will arrive rather anticlimactically during the endgame scoring, from the stewards (farmers) and the guards on the walls.  Once the walls start dropping, they dominate everything.  The ease of triggering a scoring, and the benefits of doing so, provide a disincentive for players to actually play workers to the city once the wall construction begins.  Starting a new task is just begging for one of your opponents to finish the feature, trigger scoring, and reap the benefits.  Or you may instead end up in silly deadlocks in which no one wants to trigger scoring because the second or third wall spot out in either direction is a juicy one. 

Rule changes that appear to have been designed to create a more gamer-friendly Carcassonne have instead made it more random and luck-reliant, with far less scope for strategic play.  The real deal-breaker, though, is that Carcassonne the City tips the balance too far in the direction of defensive play.  Because of this, it doesn’t work satisfactorily with more than two players.  It’s the same “you need to stop him” problem that some gamers complain about in multiplayer Attika.  I actually don’t find that dynamic to be problematic in Attika, but it drives me nuts in Carcassonne the Castle.  The blocking problem might come up once or twice in a game of Attika, and with good players it probably won’t happen at all.  In Carcassonne the City, it’s happening every damn turn.

Bump the rating up a point if you're playing strictly with two players.  The severe meeple shortage and zero-sum tactics make this a better game with two than with more.  But if you're looking for a two-player game, you're much better off investing in Carcassonne the Castle (or just playing regular Carcassonne for that matter).

Carc with an interesting time-arc to it. The base carc mechanics are mostly in place, but the scoring system and meeple options are much different.

This edition of Carcassonne seems kind of like The Castle for up to four players.

RATING: 7
Good "Carcassonne" variant, which copies ideas from Knizia's take on the system: the need to match only roads and the wall around the city. At least the wall is used in a different and interesting way, being built by the players during the game and providing two new ways to score. However, as it's built only when some feature is scored, it feels a little gamey when players see a good opportunity (often set up by an opponent) and just finish any two-tile feature in order to trigger wall building.

It seems most players like the production, which includes lots of wood, but I'm not a fan. The walls and towers certainly could look more like their real-world counterparts. The artwork is a bit dull and the choice of background colors doesn't help. The mismatch of markets against residential areas is ugly. This works in "The Castle" because the features are buildings with straight lines, but here the irregular shapes only make the mismatched tiles look out of place.

An excellent entry in the Carcassonne franchise.  I really like the dynamic the walls add to the game, and I appreciate the way some things from the original game have been simplified.  The tile laying rules make it much less likely for the game to hinge on a single lucky (or unlucky) draw.  And while the flavor of farms is still there, the scoring of them is not as frustrating.  The downside to The City is that it doesn't have the wealth of expansions that the original Carcassonne does, but comparing it just to the base game it is clearly superior.

Having played vanilla Carcassonne (or basic + expansions) many times in the past (i.e., 30+), as well as Hunters and Gatherers online at yucata.de, this iteration of Carcassonne is the most gamey one that I've encountered yet. Accordingly, while this might not make this edition the best one to start off with when learning to play Carcassonne, it certainly is a breath of fresh air should you have played many of them. There are multiple scoring opportunities to be weighed against one another, and more importantly, more reason to cut people out of features or restrict access to them. What's especially noticeable at the end of this game is how gorgeous the completed board looks -- the walls surrounding the streets and the markets really evokes the sense of having built something.

While I'm not sure if it's my favorite Carc yet, it might just be my favorite aesthetically and to play with folks with some previous Carcassonne experience.

This is the best Carcassonne for people who like a meatier game.  Take reglar Carcassonne and toss it in the blender with some additional Euro mechanics for a deeper strategy and this is what you get.  No annoying farmers, and the new options greatly reduce the random effect of the tile draws.

RATING: 7.5
This game is really interesting. It takes many mechanisms from the other games and combines them to make Carcassonne a stronger strategic and more importantly, tactical game. There is much, much more to think about in placement and scoring after the first stack of tiles is depleted. I think that this game is better than plain vanilla Carcassonne in many ways, but will clearly not take it's place as a gateway game.

Wooden game box is nice and the individual tiles are super thick.  All the wood pieces give the game a great polished feel.

So far this feels like a heavier carcassonne, but definitely not a more fun carcassonne.  the wall building is a pretty addition to the look of the game, but the wall scoring is only marginally interesting, and the added gameplay time predicting the opponents wallbuilding is annoying for everyone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a nice game in the Carcassonne series. It has a nice box, the walls are fun to play with, and guards give a good variation on scoring abilities.  I think that the origional game could use a little bit of this presentation wise (bags and border placement.)

The downside is that it is a lot like the original Carcassonne, but unlike the original, you do not have to always match edges.  This change is confusing when teaching newer players.  I think that it rates below the original for me because it is less addaptable (from expansions) to differing audiences.  It also feels redundant when placed near the others.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Carcassonne the city feels like a Carcassonne with extensions in a nice wooden box.

As it comes to gameplay, it is a bit more like "Carcassonne the Castle" because of the contained tiles. But this time you get to build the container, and that's a complexity that I'm no sure benefit to the gameplay.

I firmly believe that the Carcassonne series has long been done to death, but this is one of the more interesting stand-alone variants. Confusingly the colours are reversed from the standard game: markets (i.e.'cities') are green and residential areas ('fields') are brown. Great wooden pieces, although the wooden box is possibly overkill. I can't help feeling, though, that the extra ways to score actually diminish what's meant to be a light, relaxing game.

1st played 1/10/08. Taught in 5 min, played in ~45min w/ 4 players. Good strategy/luck ratio. Similar to regular Carcassonne w/ meeples on roads (thiefs), markets (goods trader), and land(farmers). Uncompleted roads and markets don't count at the end of the game however. Road segments count 1pt for 1-3 tiles, however count 2x per tile 4 . Markets are in 3 colors and count #of tiles * #of colors. Tiles also contain buildings. Grey buildings count as 2VPs (3VPs with words) for gaurds. Tiles are set in three stack plies. After you finish the 1st stack, the player drawing the last tile places the castle entrance. Each other player places a wall segment. After 2nd stack is used, each player places 2 wall tiles. After walls are placed, the start/finish player places a tower for VPs for each wall segment between gate/tower to placed tower. When placing a wall segment you may place a guard on top of the wall and counts 2/3VPs for each grey building in sight orthogonally at the end of the game. Gaurd can't be placed if there is a gaurd on the other end however. Farmers count at the end as 2pts for each market, regaurdless if it's finished. I'd strongly recommend this game if you know someone who has it and give consideration for purchase and playing on a regular basis.

Since we're Carc fans, this was an auto-buy when I found it on a back shelf at a toy store. 

The game looks great when finished. A few changes and some restrictions compared to regular Carc and Carcassonne the Castle. Although the basics are here, laying tiles, the new/tweaked rules and walls keep it fresh. I'm hard pressed to decide between the three.

I started with this game on my path to Carcassonne goodness and never really appreciated it's depth, but after seeing the light - I find this to be top tier in the line.  The ease in scoring and multiple ways of earning points, easily grant the title a trade up in control and downed luck factor.  In fact, this is one of the closest to score with even players, as the draw produces an amazing array of scoring options.  While the game may not be as pretty in the end, due to tiles not having to exactly line up except roads, the game does come off as visually stunning with the 3d aspect.  I would, in the end, highly recommend this as one of the best stand alone Carcassonne's out here.

Easily the nicest looking game I have in my collection.  Come on, if you're a Carcassonne fan, how can you resist buying this wooden box full of great bits?  Oh yeah, the game is quite good too; I think it's the best of the Carc variants.  At first, the game starts out like normal Carc, but then the game drastically changes once players begin to build walls.  When a player completes a road or city, that player can place a wall and a guard meeple on it.  Guards score victory points for its owner based on the buildings in the row that it overlooks.  Since *all* players get to place walls and guards once any player complete a city or road, sometimes it's a good idea not to finish your road/city to prevent your opponent(s) from grabbing a juicy row.  Great game!

RATING: 8
OK, this is a bit more of a gamer's game.  No quick pull a tile, play a tile scoring.  No screw your opponent forever tiles that lead to nowhere.  Its also the most beautiful of the Carcassone games.  The timing of scoring and the wall mechanism is definitely clever.  But, it is not the kind of game you would want to introduce to new gamers.  Its actually kind of heavy for a Carcassonne title.  The question is, does that weight mean that this game will not hit the table?

Great 'gateway' game for non-gamers.  Compared with the original Carcassonne, the addition of walls and towers not only improve the game (and change the dynamics from stack to stack), but are aesthetically pleasing when the city is completed :-).  Also the simplified tile-laying rule (only roads need to match) lessen the first-time players' disadvantage from not knowing the possible tile draws.

As with the original Carcassonne, player interaction is both competitive and cooperative, a dynamic which very few games can generate.

Owned this game for over a year before getting it to the table.  Arguably a better game than "Vanilla" Carc's, but less accessible to new players.  Hence the lower rating.  I will bring this to the table after I've introduced new gamers to Carc's and they are comfortable with the Farmers scoring mechanic.

Carcassonne: the City is more strategic than other Carcassonne incarnations. The walls and guards introduce a whole new scoring dimension. Keeping the right balance between permanently placed meeples and constantly scoring with them for markets and roads is key to winning as a higher percentage of points will come from permanent meeples than in any other Carcassonne variant. Potentially worrying: the importance of not letting others score something in the city to avoid giving them the chance to build a tower or put guards on juicy spots can lead to very defensive play up to a point where scoring in the city doesn't happen any more (see Glamorous Mucus' comment).
My favourite in the series remains the Castle and I usually will prefer plain Carcassonne or Hunters & Gatherers but the City is a nice change of pace.

Possibly the best Carcassonne variant I've played. Starts like regular Carc, but the road and market (castle) scorings are more interesting than in the original and also encourage screwing your opponent more, especially because graphical limitations affecting tile placement have been reduced. And after the wall building starts it becomes even more interesting and your followers start to get scarce. Props also for the nicest Carc tiles there are.

juego simple y, debo añadir, que cuanto mas juegas mas le encuentras el truquillo para putear a los adversarios.

El tema de las murallas esta bastante bien, aunque creo que solo hace el juego más bonito y poca cosa más.

Lo que no me gusta de este carcassonne es que no impide cerrar mercados con otra loseta cualquiera (no tiene porque ser un mercado), dando facilidad a que lo cierres, incluso la muralla puede cerrarlo. Esto quita bastante puteo, maaaaaal.

My rating for this game has slipped from a "10" down to an "7".  I still think this is the most polished gamer's version of the Carc system.  Sadly the gamers I play with have zero interest in playing Carcassonne anymore.

It opens like 'yet another Carcassone-type game', but when the walls begin to get placed the game really blossoms into a whole new creature. I love how you have to consider the length of the wall, the view from the wall, and who gets to place the watchtower.  Simultaneously you have to keep meeples in scoring positions to trigger the wall building, while placing meeples as stewards for the big end-game points. Lots of nice interlocking stuff.  Best of all, when done, you have built a very cool model city.

Carcassonne follow-ups have been hit-or-miss with me.  This one was definitely a hit.  The wall tiles added a dimension to the game play that does not appear in any other version.

It's the best variant of Carcassonne that I've played as I like the walls but ultimately in 2016 there are so many OTHER tile laying games that change up far more so I feel like I'd rather own/explore those and stick with the basic expandable Carcassonne.  Currently waiting for the new Big Box with the redone Carcassonne Artwork.  If your a huge Carcassonne fan though and bored with whatever is available for the base game then I would highly recommend this one.

REPLACED BY:  Carcassonne Big Box.

RATING: 6
Acquired 2005. Only played six times so far. It's the most strategic of the Carcassonne series but also takes longer and has been harder to get to the table. The city walls and guards add a very interesting scoring option that's beyond and quite different from Carcassonne predecessors. I think this will not get much play because it loses the simplicity that makes Carcassonne a fantastic game. (Update: Sold)

RATING: 8
Really nice standalone Carcassonne variant. There's some surprisingly agonizing decisions to make when the walls start going up.

RATING: 4
The 'City' adds more complexity to gameplay without actually improving it from the prior variants.  The addition of walls is more veneer than substance.  There is just not enough here to warrant a new publication.  It feels like the publishers are banking on the success of the original Carcassonne to sell more boxes.

Hunters & Gatherers still represents the best of the series.

Awesome -- it's Carcassonne, with a three-dimensional addition of walls, and better balance between roads and "cities" (here, markets, with three different types).  More choices means more AP for some, though, so watch out.  All in all, a solid, heavier version of Carcassonne. A little harder to explain than basic Carcassonne, so unleash on true newbies at your own peril.

Wrede has learned some new things from Knizia's Castle version and has made a fine new game where everything is a bit more complicated than in the original game, the walls add lots of strategy, while the game is still quite much luck-based (and this way this is the Märklin version of Carcassonne), although it's LESS luck-based than the original one. It's a bit like a gamers' Carc (well they should play it with two or three cards in hand). Which means there is a lot to think about and rules to remember but the luck of the draw may be still too much for a gamers' game; still it's fine.

RATING: 5
Two plays, once with three and once with four. I loved my first play, with three players, but with four the chaos increased significantly, and took the bloom off the rose a little. Still, this suits my tastes as a gamer more than standard Carc. The extra dimension added by the guards and the walls make this more of a "gamer's" game than a family game. It takes a bit to get your head around the rules differences and the "reverse" colour scheme (green "cities", brown "farms").

I'm not sure that I like the towers, though. They are obviously intended to add another dimension to the wall building, but they seem like a big bonus for completing a feature.

Chaos factor makes the three-player game more suitable for me than four-player. I'm curious to try two-player sometime.

My rating could move up or down depending on whether future plays are more like my first game or my second.

UPDATE: A few more plays, and I don't think the wall building as designed works for more than two players. I won't refuse playing if someone asks, but I'm rather let down.

I bought this because I thought Carcassonne vanilla was great, but I wanted something more whilst avoiding the endless expansions. City is stand alone, with arguably the most interesting strategic choices to be made of all, so I've heard. It's a bit jarring, if you've played Vanilla Carc. that the tile features don't have to match, save for roads. But otherwise, it's all good stuff. And the walls look great!

This seems to be a solid little game that sits well with regular Carcassonne and Hunters & Gatherers. The wall that closes in the game space is a cool twist that forces a few more difficult decisions.

05/07/06 Played a three player game, once. It is different enough from regular Carcassonne to make it worth playing. But not so different that strategies and tactics learned from the base game are useless (ala Hunters & Gatherers and The Castle). 
09/18/10 Played a four-player game. At an hour and 50 minutes its the longest Carcassonne type game I've played (and I've played every one, I think). But that's not to say the time dragged. It was enjoyable throughout. I look forward to playing it again, but not buying it. I'm sure that wooden box adds $15 to the price.

Not strictly true that I own this, but I bought it for my girlfriend's birthday. She's a big fan of the original and I thought  it would make a nice gift. We both like the nice wooden box, but the fat-headed meeples aren't as cute as the ones in original Carcassonne. I find the game a little less elegant, overall.

Game in a Nutshell: Takes the Carcassonne formula, juices up the goober, changes up the scoring opportunities, takes some restrictions off tile placement and surrounds it with a pretty wooden wall.

Played as: 2 player

Pros:  Clearly the main draw to the game is the visual punch of sweet looking components, wooden box, and framing your game board with the wooden wall.  I like the feeling at the end of the game as the wall closes in on the city adding a satisfying conclusion / completeness to the game that’s absent from vanilla Carc.

Cons:  The original Carcassonne was such an enjoyably vicious two player experience, and by now allowing tiles to be laid any which way with only regard for the roads, the viciousness was stripped out.  I miss the ability to attack people’s positions by laying tiles that made their project impossible to complete. The wall guards feel overpowered in the scoring and while gaining a point for being visually interesting, it loses two for being the most linearly boring part of the game-play.  I feel the slight additional complexity to scoring doesn’t add anything of value with the exception of adding a little more incentive for scoring roads.

Other:  I think what this game does is make Carcassonne a softer, more friendly experience. That would be great for more casual gamers but the added rules and more complex scoring makes it a more gamer-y experience. So essentially it’s sort of stuck in limbo land in my eyes: Too soft for hard-core gamers, but too convoluted for casual gamers.  Maybe I’m dead wrong, I’m going off one play, but I can’t say I’m really interested in trying again to see if I am. I’d rather be playing vanilla carc with casual gamers or with I&C and T&B for a more gamer-y experience.

Best Use:  If you’re a minimalist game collector who only wants the prettiest version of games in your collection.

Carcassonne collection. Maybe my favorite of the bunch. It has a cool wooden box. It seems to be more controlled that other carcassonnes. In others you lay tiles outwards, in this one you lay them inwards. Cool, you feel protected, or realize that you can be under siege.

carcassonne basic is easy and quick; this version is more strategic, you have to think more and save your limited number pawns (it would be better to put a pawn in a large field or save for the wall?).
Wooden components (walls and towers and box, of course) are very nice.

An amazingly beautiful and fun to play version of Carcassonne. Probably the "best" single version for 3-4 players, but also exceptional as a 2-player game. BUT it is more strategic, thus with more important tactical decisions to be made throughout, and thus it takes longer to player, esp. at 2-player. So for 2-plyr, if you want an equally great but shorter game, play C: The Castle, or C: The City for longer game.

A new game using the base mechanics of the original. A much heavier experience as the players must now also build the city walls  around the city, which brings new factors into play. An enjoyable experience but not  the place to start for beginners to the series.

There are some very interesting choices that need to be made in relation to wall building and the placement of historic buildings and guards. But the game does suffer from a slight 'right place, right time' element that makes it feel like the control over your destiny is not as tight as it should be.

Has the same problem of Carc: The Castle with placing tiles with non-matching sides, but to a lesser extent. Not being allowed to place meeples on just finished features is a huge pain in the butt to get used to and not really worth it to me, though I can see why that rule is there. I do love the components (by far the best of any Carc version) and how the city walls come into play.

I liked my first play of the game, but not everyone else at the table enjoyed it - this rating may improve with more plays, but it struck me only as a bit above average after one time through. This is coming from someone whose never played any other version of Carc, mind you. I also didn't feel comfortable that I was playing with all the rules correctly, the instructions are laid out kind of strangely.

UPDATE: After a few more plays, things have cleared up, and I'm comfortable raising this from a 7 to an 8.

I wasn't thrilled with Hunters & Gatherers and the seemingly endless vanilla Carcassonne expansions fail to excite me, but The City is a significantly improved incarnation of Klaus Jurgen-Wrede's shamelessly overmilked concept.  It's tougher to get screwed by the luck of the draw due to the smaller selection of tile features (no more cloisters, thank you), the stewards are easier to deal with than the farmers, and the walls and towers force you to be more selective when placing your meeples.  If you want a copy, trade in your old Carcassonne stuff or make friends with the staff at the blood bank.

I see what the big deal is.  The walls change the game significantly.  Glad to see they borrowed Herr Doktor Knizia's contribution to the game by allowing tiles to go anywhere - more decisions = more game.

**Update** continues to exceed expectations.  After a half dozen plays each session has featured significant differences in how things turned out.  Some games the residences are the big point getter.  Some games are a tactical battle over who will get the best wall space.  Some feature huge sprawling cities while others have small compact ones.  Excellent excellent.  By far my favorite of the Carcs, and I don't imagine myself ever needing to return to playing any other.

Getting to build the wall around the city of Carcassonne is such a great idea.  Makes for an excellent standalone version of Carc!  You now have two options for end game scoring because you can place meeples on the walls to stand guard over the city.  You can also score points without using meeples by timing your placements of the tower pieces.  And I like the rule where you can't claim a completed feature unless you already had a meeple in the feature before it was completed.  Road scoring is also really good.  Really good version of Carc!

I've never been a huge Carcassonne fan, but this version offers a bit more strategy and a bit more to consider than the other versions.  Because the only features that need to line up are roads, tile draws are less likely to favor one player over another.  It may not look as aesthetically pleasing for terrain types not to match, but the tactical and strategic opportunities are increased because of it.  And that loss in aesthetics is more than made up for with the walls and towers.  Followers have to be carefully managed as a new scoring opportunity is present which are the guards.  Guards are placed on walls and score for certain building types in their line of vision.  Farmers are replaced by stewards and are a little easier to explain.  I also like the rule particular to this version that if a feature is completed as a result of a tile placement, you cannot place a follower on that feature that was just completed; you can only place a follower on an uncompleted feature and thus can only score on a future turn.

Another fine Carcassonne game with a bit more backstabbing.  This game is much tighter than the others.  You must keep your opponents at bay more than concentrating on your own advancement.  The production is excellent with all of the nice wooden bits.

Still, you have to be a big Carcassonne fan to want to keep this one on the shelf too.

Probably my most played game primarily because it's the boardgame my son finds least objectionable. I've enjoyed all the flavors of Carcassonne I've played although I rarely do well at them. In this version I tend to do really well with the guards and I can't seem to get anywhere with the stewards.

Any Carcassonne fans will love this new version, I enjoyed it much more than "Die Burg". This is what "Die Burg" SHOULD have been. The new walls/towers/guards features are very cool and work as a nice balancing mechanicism.  The rules may seem a bit trickier at first, but they're not.  My one big problem though: The new wall thing REALLY slow down the pace of the game - however, I high recommend it to all Carcassonne fans, especially "Hunters & Gatherers" fans cause this kinda builds on that IMO.

Wooden box edition.

RATING: 7.15
Wooden-boxed 2-4 player stand-alone edition which borrows the wall elements from Knizia's The Castle edition, then adds some other things.

This is possibly the current definitive edition, with very nice components, although for 2 players The Castle may be the better choice.

I really enjoy Carcassonne but it rarely gets played. This is a fresh take on the game but adds another whole game. It is like a game within a game. I love it. Awesome wooden bits and a different way of thinking about the tile placement and how the walls might close in and effect your game play. Very fun!

Good looking pieces unfortunately it looses some of the beauty of the original version. The rules are more Advanced and has some very interresting mechanics. However I'm just not that fascinated by it even though I probably would prefer playing this slightly more than the original one.

Aesthetically nice variant, with the walls surrounding the city. (Though the more relaxed placing rules for the tiles decrease the beauty of the finished city a bit.)

Several rules for the scoring of the tiles are added, which in my opinion help to balance the game. Then, however, the walls are added, which I think introduce a big luck factor again. (Opinion after two plays, so I may yet be proven wrong.)

The placing of the walls disrupts the flow of the game, as well, and I often find myself forgetting it.

Carcassonne was the second game I played after Settlers of Catan years ago, and unlike Catan it almost holds up to modern strategy board game standards. Almost. Over the years they tried to update it with new rules and new expansions, often creating more confusion than modernization.

Carcassonne the City seems to be an effective answer to what a player like me is looking for. It's fundamentally Carcassonne, but it adds new elements of strategy without over-complicating the rules. Placing tiles is easier than before because the only feature that can not be interrupted are roads, and added to that is a new element where you build an actual wooden wall around the city slowly, and you may place a worker to stand on the wall and score points for the whole contiguous row. Very cute!

My boyfriend, my best friend, me and even my mother has gotten into it. Its an easy to learn game that provides a upbeat playing experience. There is enough risk involved to make it fun and always interesting. DEFINITELY would suggest this game and any expansion ( still kinda iffy if this one goes with the other Carcassonns ) But I am looking forward to getting my hands on some of the other additions.

This game is so much deeper than any of the previous versions of Carcassonne. It is no longer a light-Euro or bridge game, this game requires real thought. The 'steward' (aka farmers) rule may be too potent as many many small-but-equal (in final scoring) markets can be created. Terrific game though!

This was given to me by my sons so I'll never let it go.

Definitely the only Carcassonne-spin off I have enjoyed so far, which might come down to the fact that this is designed by the same designer as the original and it shows, not just some random company cashing in on the name. The game is definitely more complex and intricate than Carcassonne but not necessarily better. In fact, I still think the original is superior but this is a welcome spell of fresh air. The game takes a bit too long (with four players at least) for what it is, but never mind.

I've played this game once so far but plan on playing again this weekend. First time through I loved it and don't foresee that I'll like it less after playing it a few times. The only con I can see with this game is that it makes me want to take a lot of time to see the BEST place to place a tile and or meeple on my turn and that angers the other players. If everyone had some thing to do when its not their turn this game would be a 9 - 9.5.

Love Carcassonne, hate this variant: my poor little head can't take in the complexity of it.

Back page of manual is mysteriously mucky for some unknown (or just forgotten) reason, one of the meeples is without most of one leg but can still just about manage to stand upright and another has always looked like it has felt-tip pen on it but I think that's just a dark bit in the wood; otherwise seems fine.

Tile playing game similar to the original Carcassone game but with a few twists. The rules changes offer more options for placing tiles, but less opportunities for cheap points. In addition to playing tiles to create the city interior, players will build walls along the exterior to contain the urban sprawl with more opportunities for point scoring along the walls.

RATING: 8
A standalone game in the Carcassonne series.  In addition to laying traditional Carcassonne tiles, players can also build walls that eventually enclose the city.  A very enjoyable game that benefits the Carcassonne series.  And the smell of the wooden box the game comes in has an appeal all of it's own!

Gave to my wife for Christmas '06 because she loves Carcassonne.  After a few plays, I really like the fact that there's more thinking involved in "The City" version.  In the past, we've played the standard Carcassonne with the River and Inns & Cathedrals expansions.  The City, with its walls, guards, and towers, forces you to think in a few different directions at once.

Two drawbacks to The City:
1) The walls break-up the rhythm of placing tiles (my wife's complaint).
2) It's weird to see cities (really markets) sitting against fields in a way that isn't allowed in standard Carcassonne.

Update (Feb.'09): Wasted my money on this one.  Wife will probably never want to play it again.  Too many other games she likes better.

Played once with 4P. The production values are amazing, and it's much better balanced than regular Carc. It's perhaps a bit too balanced actually: every move seems equally valuable, so that there's no reason to choose a road over a market or a residential district. It seems a bit dry for a Carcassonne, so I don't know whether it's better than the original in the long run. Those wanting a dry game for 2-4 players have plenty of other options: Samurai springs to mind.

Tough decisions to be made as to how you want to use your pieces and where you want to lay your tiles - made interesting by the wall element. I'd play Carcassonne the Castle when playing with two and this when playing with three only. A step up from Hunters and Gathers and I like the rule disallowing the placement of a meeple on an element you're scoring - an end to the ultra cheap points. I wasn't that keen on the basic Carcassonne, but this and the Castle have rekindled my interest in the series. I've finally understood the power of residential areas - yey!

Despite having quite a lot of flaws, this is a seriously fun rehash of the Carcassonne mechanics. Particularly because this game shares something in common with The Castle (my favorite edition) which is that there is a lot more flexibility in how markets and residential areas can be connected.

Like The Castle, there are also a lot of different types of tile layouts to choose from. I like this.

However, this is one of the game's defects. There are times in games where we've had to redraw, in order to find a playable tile. In fact, one game started off with a tile that had an intersection of four roads. The very next tile had no roads. Neither did the third. We all rolled our eyes. Come on, we'd like to start playing the game already... (The Castle doesn't suffer this problem because roads can be parked against the castle wall. Also, there are, in effect, multiple starting tiles to choose from.)

There was a second problem we encountered with the walls, but I can't seem to recollect what it was...

At any rate, this is a fun one and probably just needs a designated starting tile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Essentially this is just Carcassonne with some extra things added in.  It's a bit disappointing that it's so similar.  Given the wooden-box presentation and that it's not just another expansion, I was sort of hoping for a completely different game.  Still, it's fun, and the new rules add in enough variety that I feel compelled to play more, even though I'm pretty tired of the original Carcassonne at this point.

I do want to know whose idea it was to color the markets green and the residential areas puttyish, though, which makes the coloration almost exactly the opposite of the original game (fields green, cities more puttyish, etc).

There are some ambiguities regarding tile placement near the existing walls, but consistent rules extrapolation takes care of such issues until they can be officially resolved. For example, it is possible to lay tiles such that the walls wrap around empty space(s), then touch a previously placed section of wall at its corner, allowing the wall to continue on and enclose the city. This results in an undeveloped "outside" area amidst city tiles, but separated from them by walls. [user=ekted]Mr. Ekted[/user] posted that this is not allowed, but he gave no source for this assertion. The rules make it clear that you cannot place a tile under an existing wall section, as this would place that tile effectively outside the wall, but the rules do not address walls wrapping around to touch at corners. Since walls can wrap around large incursions of empty spaces into the bulk of the city, thereby effectively hollowing out portions of the city, I see no reason such hollow spots can't be completely surrounded by walls, so long as the walls continue to surround the borders of the city tiles.

Different enough from the other Carcassonnes, but still the same tile-laying fun. The extra dimensions of the walls is a neat idea, and I like it, but at times it can slow the pace of the game. More tense than regular Carcassonne, but easier to finish things (you're not always waiting for that one tile to finish a city). A nice addition to the collection (and I love the wooden box).

In terms of complexity, this falls in-between vanilla Carcassonne and Carcassonne with traders and builders/inns and cathedrals. It's not overly complex but not very gamey either.

Tile-laying. After one 3p game: I like it. This is a slightly meatier version of Carc. More ways to score and tighter meeple management = a tougher version of the game.

My favorite out of all Carcassonne games. The mechanics are just like the base game, but there is some added complexity in scoring which makes the game more interesting. I also find that, with four, the game plays close which is a sign of good balance. In vanilla Carc, there is too often a run-away leader problem.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In some ways a more relaxing Carc, with the prevention of quick scoring features. A lot to think about, but sometimes the scoring of the best wall positions seems out of anybody's control (and they can often be created accidently).

Well at least it is pretty.  In my opinion, the best of the carcassonne bunch, but I was still miserable playing it.  There are more decisions, and perhaps there might even be a touch of strategy in this, but mostly the same old problems, of picking a tile and getting frustrated and bored.

This is a worthy Carcassonne variant. The walls and knights add extra scoring opportunities to stragegize about. The tiles and placement rules - simpler than those in The Castle - tend to be a little boring.

Best of the Carcassone games hands down though a little on the expensive side at ~$50. The strategy and mechanics have been tweaked to offer a really nice game. Amazing bits and beautifully printed tiles. My advice: If you don't own any Carcassone games or variants, pick this one up and forget the rest, you won't be disappointed.

...or Carcassonne: the Wall.  Like other Carcs, players draw and play one tile on their turn.  The tile edges in The City contain either Markets (3 types), roads, or residential areas (houses).  The only requirement for placement is that the roads must connect, so a market area may abut to a residential area.  Meeples may be placed on any of these areas on the tile the active player places.  Markets and roads are scored when complete, and the Meeples (sellers or citizens) are returned to the players.  The stewards in the residential areas are scored at the end of the game.  The tiles may also contain historic buildings and public buildings.  The tiles are initially arranged in three stacks of defined height.  When the first stack is exhausted, wall building begins.  The first player to score from the second stack gets to place the city gate, and all wall building occurs bi-directionally from the gate outward.  All players add wall pieces whenever someone scores.  Wall pieces can end roads and markets.  Any player placing a wall piece may place a meeple (guard) on the wall.  The guard looks straight across the entire city (one row or column of tiles), and scores at game end any of the public or historic buildings in his sight.  When the second stack is exhausted, the wall building occurs at a faster rate.

This take on the Carc franchise suffers from the same problem they all have: drawing one tile on your turn allows for very little strategy.  On the plus side, it does seem to have more going on than the other Carc I've played, H&G.  Also, it is the most beautiful of the bunch, as the wall pieces create a very photogenic city when the game is over.  There are many tense moments, but they all come down to dreading what your opponent will do, and hoping you draw the right tile.  I'm rating this below H&G, mostly due to the appeal of the simpler system (and theme) for turning newbies on.

An enjoyable variant of Carc that looks really cool when you finish it. I think I still prefer vanilla Carc with some expansions, but this is a nice twist with the walls and the guards over the city that closes things up pretty quickly.

RATING: 7.8
A great game based on the brilliant original Carcassonne tile-laying/worker placement game, but turned up a notch.  A standalone game, rather than an(other) expansion - yay!  Slightly revised rules in a number of respects, and so a tiny bit more involved than the basic Carc, but not so much as to be complicated.  Beautiful wooden pieces, that let you place walls and towers - because you are building a single city, not placing and competing over multiple ones.  Consequently, City is more tactile than the other Carc games, and looks fantastic by end-game, with the walls, guards on some, towers, and on the enclosed tiles - roads, and different areas of the city (3 types of markets, public and historic buildings and residential areas).  Can be played with 2-4 players.  Very highly recommended - especially the version with the wooden box as it just looks right!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The City can't replace Carcassonne the way Hunters & Gatherers can. It feels like a spinoff, rather than a remake or a re-theme. It distinguishes itself with deeper strategy, but that comes at the cost of increased complexity. This means that H&G (or the original) remains the best place to get acquainted with Carcassonne, whereas The City is for those who've already learned the basics. There's a lot to be said for both, though I must say that The City is without a doubt the most visually striking version. In the end, I couldn't justify owning both, so I stuck with the purer, simpler, and cleaner H&G.

It uses Carc pieces, but it's really pretty much a whole new game. Unlike the minor tweaks with the other expansions (Hunters, Ark) there are so many new rules here that it plays differently.

Well, my wife and I managed to kill "Carcassonne" (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/27391).  After picking up the base game and most of the available expansions over the years, we realized we had turned what should be a simple, quick game into a big, lumbering, lengthy beast.  So we traded all that away and picked up "Carcassonne: The City" instead.  And we're glad we did, because now this game is actually hitting the table again periodically.  It is pretty much everything we want in a game of "Carcassonne", and it has the added fun (and aesthetically pleasing) feature of the walls, towers, and guards.  I was just a little bit disappointed to find out that it is a slightly nastier game than the original - players find themselves finishing other players' feature much more frequently due to the fact that only 2 board features (roads and markets) score during game play, and both score exponentially bigger points if they are allowed to grow beyond a certain point.  But this game has revitalized our interest in an old classic, so we're pleased about that.  And how about that wooden box!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

This game has left Carcassonne as I know it in the dust.  Initially there are plenty of choices of tile play.  It slowly gets closed off however, but in a good way.  Nice balance between the different scoring mechanisms, and with the wall scoring closing off points for your opponents to get the tower is just plain old fun.  I'd like to play more.  Old school Carcassonne isn't dead, but I would prefer this anytime.   The wall bits are awesome.

Update: I'm just not sure the extra play time and rules improve the game enough to the major increase in time over regular Carcassonne.  Its better and deeper, but I normally go with Carcassonne in a quick game mood, and pass over this with a longer time frame in mind.

The production quality of the components was outstanding!  However, I don't think this is nearly as good as the original Carcassonne because it doesn't have the depth of the expansions, like the large meeples from Inns & Cathedrals and the builders from Traders & Builders.  Moreover, I just can't get used to the idea of not having the enclose the "city" substitutes, it just looks so wrong!

(2 plays) Very nice, probably the best Carcassonne I've played. My only complaint is that the opening stage of the game, the first 30 tiles with no wall, feels rather less enagaging than the rest of the game. Once the walls start going up, though, there's lots of interesting dynamics at play. However, (unlike the original Carcassonne) there can be some kingmaker problems with the wall-building if there is an inattentive player, having to look ahead to see what you are giving the next player. So, it might play better with only 2.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12902/carcassonne-the-city]Carcassonne: The City[/url] is more of the same and also more than the same. It has the Carcassone basics: lay tiles, connecting, in this case, streets and markets, while also trying to make rows of grey buildings that worth points if they are on the area that your meeple-guard is. Meeple-guard? Yes, in [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12902/carcassonne-the-city]Carcassonne: The City[/url] everytime a scoring happens, the players lay a wall around the city, and the players can put watch towers that are worth the number of sections of the wall from the gate or other watch towers. Also, it is possible to put a meeple on top of a section of the wall, and that meeple will score depending on the number of buildings in its row. So the game offered some differents choices while still being Carcassone in its core.

The addition of the city walls and the removal of the placement restriction (matching tile sides) make this version of Carcassonne pretty interesting. It's possible to cut people off much more easily, making it more interactive, which is almost always a good thing in my book. Unfortunately, the added complexity makes this harder as an introductory game: it's best if the players have played some Carc game already.

RATING: 4
If you compare The City with just regular Carcassonne, then this is certainly a more gamer's game. There is a lot more scoring and also a lot more opportunities for short term tactical planning. However, I really dislike curtailing growth of the city by walling it in. As the game progresses, the expansion of the city on either side of the growing wall grinds to a halt and I did not enjoy the constraints. Toward the end of the game, there are precious few places to add tiles that would benefit my scores. However, I do like that the steward (farmer) scoring is less of a game- changer than regular Carcassonne. Each steward scores only 2 points per market and also quickly gets blocked in by the city walls. I also think that this game is undeniably gorgeous. 

Overall, I am not sure I like this game over original Carcassonne. The fact is, if this is a gamer's game, I'd much rather play something else. If need a gateway game, then I'd reach for the original Carcassonne.

Take Carcassonne, and add a bunch of rules to complicate things.  This gives you Carcassonne: The City.  To me, Carcassonne should be a short, simple, fun game to learn.  This version of the game draws out the length of the game, and creates a number of alternative ways to score, making the result a bit more chaotic than I would like.

I like this game, even if it causes arguements in the house. I always have my wife tell me things like, " I want to put a guard on a tower now, is it too late?" or, " You can`t have that much land as a stewart! It`s impossible!" Regardless, we come back and play it again. Very attractive game, with clever use of wooden pieces.

This is my game from the Carcassonne family and I like it a bit better than the original. the city walls add a new strategic element to the game and make it more thinky. the only thing I do not like is that the cities only seldom look like real cities in the end.

This is a wonderfull variation of the original Carcassonne. One has to look far forward and as soon as the walls come into action this game changes very fast.

I really like it.

One difference from the original Carcassonne:  A player's score for some features (markets, roads) grows exponentially as they gets larger, so players have much more incentive to cut off opponents' areas... Keeping more meeples in play.

What a great version of Carc! The modified tile laying rules make it far less luck based and far more strategic. The walls not only add a great aesthetic but also an interesting strategic element.

RATING: 8
I really like this game's design elements,
but I think I must be missing something important:
the end-game scoring just invalidates the first half of the game, it seems...

What am I doing wrong...?

RATING: N/A
Players build up the old town together by placing tiles. While the town area grows, the town walls grow around it, starting from a wooden gate. The wall is comprised of delicately carved wooden parts, that create a beautiful rendition of the medieval town at the end of the game.

As well slightly modified tile-laying rules, players have the possibility to place their followers as guards on the walls, offering them a wide view of the town.

purchased 23.06.05..first play wasn't until 10.03.06!!! as a 2 player game against my friend Neil. The match ended being very close and we enjoyed it immensley. Perhaps with more players it will rate as high as carc the castle, Which I really enjoy out of all the carc series.

RATING: 8.5
Roughly the same game as Carcassonne, but has a different mechanic halfway through the game when the wall-building begins.  Probably equivalent to Carcassonne with the first two expansions in terms of complexity.  It's a nice changeup to the original game, but essentially the same idea.

Esta vez se trata de construir una ciudad, con sus murallas, sus edificios y sus vigilantes. No se trata de una expansión sino de un juego a parte basado en las mismas reglas, pero con alguna variante.

A little too many rules and fiddliness for a Carcassonne game in my opinion, but not bad. Similar enough where it's easy to pick up, but there are a lot of differences, including multiple scoring/game end avenues and seemingly less opportunity to block.

When we started playing this for the first time I didn't think much of it, as the tile-laying part of the game seemed limited. However, once Laurel and I started building walls and placing city guards, it really started to shine. The second play was a three-player game and was really enjoyable.

An interesting diversion from normal carcassone.  Fun with 2 players as well as more; when the group wants to carcassonne, I bring it out to spice things up.

RATING: 7
Wow!  There is a lot to pay attention in this one - scoring by roads, markets and residential areas.  Then you score on walls as guards.  Deeper than C:The Castle. 

My wife really doesn't like Carcassonne games.  We have tried several.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very impressed. Luck of the draw is clearly evident, but not as overwhelming as in some games as I felt I could still make good decisions and score well despite tile draws. I had trouble adjusting to the complete change of negative space assessment -- the dark space was now what the light green space was in Carc: Hunters & Gatherers, etc. I also really, really like the city wall element, of slowly but surely confining the playing area. It adds a bit more tension, another tactical layer and helps alleviate the biggest problem of standard Carc - the interminable end game.

RATING: 8
This is a wonderful variation to traditional Carcassonne.  It's comes in a lovely wooden box and with quite a lot more beautiful wooden pieces than any of the previous Carcassonne games.  The price is a bit steep, but if you're a fan of these games it's worth it.

As for the gameplay, it has the feel of basic Carcassonne with an extra expansion or two added in...  There are quite a lot of different ways to score, but tactically, it feels much like previous Carcassonne games.  One design criticism I have is that based on the way that the gameplay is structured, the markets get cut off rather abruptly by the residential areas in the city.  It just doesn't seem to look as attractive when complete as it would otherwise.

Still it's a winner for the Carcassonne fans.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A very nice variation of the great Carcassonne combined with the Castle-version for two players. It has some nice tweaks to the gameplay. In my opinion it's the best to play Carcassonne and The City alternately. This game is definitely played best with 4 players. A good second game or the game after your main game of the gaming-night.

RATING: 7.9
Great game, but the end game of putting down guards on the walls gives out points too stochastically for this game to get a 10.  That is the only flaw, but it is a big one.

The scoring of the walls and towers inspire some interesting posturing, as well as conservation of followers to put on the wall.  Additionally, the scaled road scoring veritably mandates action as your opponent nears the double-point length.

My fiance really likes this game, more so than regular Carcassonne. For me, I would probably play the original over this one, but I have no problem with this version. I do like the fact that there is a little more strategy involved. It still is a game that many will be open to learning and after a playing through a game the rules are fairly easy to understand.

RATING: N/A
The first Euro game I ever bought. A recommended-play for all scene newcomers due to the tile-laying mechanics; imagine that, a board game that builds itself! Wonderful components (wood, wood everywhere) and beautiful artwork on the tiles themselves. The gameplay is a little too light for my taste (the only dilemma will forever be follower role assignment and where to place your tile) which unfortunately affects replayability. If you're new to the Carcassonne family specifically, scoring can be a little confusing, but after a couple of plays (or looking around online a bit) it'll make sense. It plays just alright with 2 players, but definitely much better with 3 and 4. I doubt I'll be picking up another version of Carcassonne after this one. I do not consider this to be a true gateway game either. Anyway, you can check out my full review/overview [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/407038]here[/url].

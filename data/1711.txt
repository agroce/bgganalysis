RATING: 4
I've played this a few times in the past.  It was ok, but I never found it as stimulating as some wargames.  Maybe it was the record-keeping.  I did love the balloon-busting bit though!  

It has now been surpassed by Wings of War, despite the modesty of the creators of that later game, who once told me they were "standing on the shoulders of giants" (referring to RW).

Very good looking game. Game system is dated to say the least. The aircraft fly more like UFO's than airplanes and the MGs are overly powerful.

RATING: 4
This rating is based on the game out of the box and not the many variants that I have not tried -- and I would really like to try the maneuver cards, sometime.
I really do like the unique airplane specifications, but it was just a UGO-IGO, spin around/roll dice/hope you hit-fest.  I'd rather play [thing=4014][/thing].

RATING: 1
The only aerial warfare game I've ever played in which opposing sides get to alternate trading Firer tailing Target shot, because of the ridiculous I-move-I-fire You-move-You-fire mechanics.

Basically, it devolves into a dice rolling competitio n like the worst excuse for all war games: Risk and its demented step-brother, Axis & Allies.

Might as well play another monotonous game of Monopoly.

It's only redeeming values are:
1: Scenarios and campaign to use in other games
2: Raw aircraft stats in the "historical interest literature"
3: Interesting designer's notes (about the history, not the game -- I think if the designer had actually written out wht he was doing, he would have immediately realized that "I go, You go" just doesn't work if EACH aircraft in 1-on-1 fight are able maneuver onto the opponent's tail
i.e:
           A's move               B's Move
Turn N: A moves onto B's tail:   B circles back to A's tail
Turn N+1: A circles to B's tail  B circles to A's tail
Turn N+2: A circles to B's tail  B circles to A's tail

Do you see a pattern here?
And pattern  that's impossible in real life....

This was the game that got me into board wargaming. For several years I saw it advertised in Military Modelling magazine so I was primed when the Nottingham Model Soldier Shop started stocking Avalon Hill, SPI and GDW games. Happy days!

RW is a fun and simple game. However, I don't like the way you can easily out maneuver your pursuer.  So, in a One vs One combat I always use the following house rule :

An aircraft that is hit during his opponent's attack phase or during the defensive fire phase must fly a penalty move of six hexes straight before it may move as he wishes in his next movement phase (provided he still has any MPs left). Note however that the aircraft may climb, dive, accelerate or decelerate normally this turn -As a reminder for their next movement phase, players may use a dummy counter to mark the 6th hex to be entered.

One of my earliest games, played it loads at school. The wide choice of WWI aircraft particularly appealed. But even back then we realised that the movement was hopeless. Turns lasted a ridiculous ten seconds or so of game time I think, meaning that even the most unmanoeuvrable plane could turn in a circle and end up face-on to a much nippier opponent who had meanwhile stood still in mid-air, waiting for his turn. This was fixed by introducing a house movement rule adapted from Car Wars, with planes moving one hex at various points during the ten second turn depending on their speed. That seemed to do the trick. If I was rating this in 1980 I'd probably give it a 7.

I liked the game as a kid, but the game has some problems, especially in terms of the turn-based mechanics and too much manoeuvring permitted per turn.  These things can be solved with house rules, but all-in-all there are now games out there that do the job better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty much a cat and mouse game, and once you're in range it's all about who can roll for the most damage.  I've never experienced anyone "running from a fight."  It definitely helps to have a wingman.  As others have stated, with the flight simulations available nowadays, this offering is pretty archaic. I have some fun and will play occasionally if the notion takes me.  [Ebay $5.00 (1/4 of a lot)]

RATING: 7
Great campaign game and a simple combat system. Not always realistic combat, but tense.
Campaign game gives the game a boost. Beautiful map !
I also wonder (again) how many played the game correctly by the advanced rules? If used then "tailing and simply shooting" each other is NOT that easy. For instance the first movement hex always needs to be directly forward. Diving needs to be in multiple hexes and it influences the in-hex turn/movement costs. As an attacker at least your last 2 movements costs need to be straight ahead and with a direct line of sight to the enemy. Deflection rules and wind effects add further chrome. Add to this the 10 seconds rule to move and you have a very light but entertaining combat game for the real meat and patatoes: the campaign system where you manage the planes and pilots in a bloody campaign.
I began playing RW again after trying a few games of Wings of War and finding WoW so BORING. Perhaps one can use the campaign rules in RW for this overhyped Wings of War thing.
Campaign game could take at least 8 to 10 hours but is managable because the gameboard is only used to fight the 25 scenario fights (this number can vary). Like always 95% of the gamers never played the campaign and so AGAIN a good system is not recognized by the casual gamer. In this repect RW shares the same fate as that other great WW1 strategic campaign game from Avalon Hill: Guns of August. Also a jewell to play, BUT you need to play the full campaign system to enjoy these wargames. Instead present day players like glossy and empty games like Wings of War.

Fairly non-complex treatment of the air war in WWI.  After two games I'm not sure if I like it or not.  Maybe I should actually sit down and read the rules (so far I've followed other's lead) and played with the advanced rules.  I did pick up a copy at an auction cheap and will look it over in detail.

RATING: 9
One of the primary reasons I enjoy paying games today is my early love of Avalon Hill war games, especially Richthofen's War. Yes, there are other aeronautical war games with more complex/realistic movements, but when you consider the ease and fun of playing Richthofen's War it is hard to beat. I lost my copy through the years, but have been actively searching for a high quality used one that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.

Like so many AH titles this was a pioneering effort. It has good feel and good board graphics and it's easy to get into. It gets a lot of criticism for lack of reality, but I don't think any board game can come close to representing tactical-level aerial combat, which requires simultaneous movement and fast reaction. Sorry to say, but I think this is one area where computer games can do it better than board games. Still, RW is a good, playable game on the subject.

Great box cover as well.

I want to like it, but it doesn't work that well. Movement rates per turn are ample enough that, once engaged, each player loops around to shoot his opponent (who then does like-wise on his turn). Since it feels absolutely nothing like dog-fighting, what's the point?

The "Maneuver Cards" expansion was supposed to fix this, but it doesn't.

It was ok, I guess for the time.  However, even with the Advanced Rules, it still became a geometry puzzle to maneuver for a shot.  Played a few times, the campaign game is interesting-and I had a real-life analog as a squadron operations officer.  The designer, even though he allegedly visited "Planes of Fame" IIRC, didn't really incorporate any input from a pilot; certainly none from a fighter pilot (either from WW1 or in the '70s).  No design elements to show the critical use of the vertical plane in maneuvering; though the variant cards helped.  There was a decent showing on the advantage the Germans had with their twin MGs; though the accuracy of these weapons is overstated-a lot.

RATING: 5
MANY fond memories, but they are due to the fact that in the mid 70s THIS WAS IT if you wanted WWI tactical action on a table top.  Optional manuver cards required for anyone over the age of 10 to enjoy the "tactical choices" in the game...but the game never felt right and as I read a few books on the subject this fell out of favor LONG before any of the other Avalon Hill games that I STILL play today.  And I do love the subject matter.

My good friend during high-school and I wore through this game.  He introduced me to the game and I eventually got my own copy.  It was to me a lighter version of Dauntless/Air Force and it played very quickly such that we could have 2 or 3 air-craft per player and still be able to resolve combat missions in a short time.  I remember discovering the design flaw in the game where a player could dive, rush and shoot, and flip over to face the opposing air-craft.  I think we house-ruled that somehow; anyways, it stuck in my mind.

The simultaneous movement is cool, and changing altitudes gives some choice in how to maneuver, but lacking good solo options hurts it, and it isn't the best 2 player game.

RATING: 9
This is a nostalgic favorite of mine that truly captures the flavor of the era and that sparked a lifelong interest in the subject. But that is not why I give it a high score. This game does not deserve its tarnished reputation. If you expect "Richthofen's War" to accurately model all the minutia of aerodynamics, then you are sure to be disappointed. The RESULT, however, is spot on and historical tactics WORK; if you dogfight with a Dr1 in an Se5a, you're in for a closeup view of the trenches; use superior speed to boom and zoom, and you'll live to fight another day. And the game, unlike most that glorify fighters and dogfighting, gives the primary role of recon aircraft its due. Add in the campaign, and this gem truly shines. For my money, there has never been a better simulation of WWI air operations at the squadron/Jasta level. Period.

RATING: 10
  Great game; spent many hours playing this one in the 70's.  When your opponent is rolling the dice to determine battle damage to your aircraft... and your aircraft is being chewed up and you can no longer maneuver... comes the realization he's got you and you're not getting out of it. 

  The optional maneuver cards (from Avalon Hill's "The General") make this an outstanding game with interesting combat. 

  David Bottger, in The General, Vol. 11, No. 5 (Jan-Feb 1975), “Richthofen’s War Analysis” says “A look at the Aircraft Capabilities Chart reveals that most Allied fighters are more maneuverable than most German fighters…. …However, while it is relatively easy for the German to use his firepower advantage, the Allied maneuverability advantage is more difficult to exploit. Unfortunately, this is the one and only area where RW falls short. The simple but illogical sighting rule allows a fast plane to use its speed to compensate for a lack of maneuverability, rather than keeping speed and maneuverability in their proper places in the game. 

  Basically, the sighting rule requires that the firing aircraft spend its last 2 MP’s with the target in its field of fire. This requirement represents the time a pilot needs to accurately aim his guns. 

  But the rule as it stands implies that the time a pilot needs to aim his guns decreases as his aircraft’s speed increases. An example will best illustrate this point. Each turn represents 10 seconds of actual time. If a plane is travelling at a speed of 10 MP’s per turn, each MP represents 1 second. For a plane at this speed, the 2 MP sighting requirement converts into 2 seconds. In contrast, a plane flying at 4 MP’s per turn, so that 1 MP equals 2 ½ seconds, needs the equivalent of 5 seconds to sight its target. The same plane, at a speed of 8, would need only 2 ½ seconds for sighting. There seems to be no logical reason why a pilot’s sighting time should decline as his speed increases. If anything, sighting time should increase with speed. Of course, the designers of RW may have based the sighting rule on considerations other than logical symmetry, perhaps to promote ease of play. But logically, the rule is untenable. Admittedly, mere illogic does not make a rule bad. But the sighting rule unjustly favors less maneuverable planes (generally German) while harming more maneuverable ones (generally Allied). The advantage of maneuverability is the ability to change direction at a low MP cost. A faster plane can compensate for poor maneuverability by its speed. So far, no problem. However, when the faster plane increases it speed it should logically have to spend more MP’s to sight its target. In other words, speed should not be a substitute for maneuverability. Speed and maneuverability should each provide a distinct advantage, as each did in World War 1. Faster planes can cover more hexes per turn, allowing them to join combat faster and escape pursuit if necessary. In a dogfight, however, speed should be a relatively slight advantage. There, the more maneuverable aircraft should have an edge.
 
  The solution is to change the sighting rule from a fixed number of MP’s to a number that increases as speed increases. Sighting should require a fixed fraction, say one-half or one-third, of the firing aircraft’s MP allowance for the turn. Adopting this rule would restore speed and maneuverability to their proper positions.”

  So, a fast moving aircraft would need to sight its target for 3 hexes.  This is the single easiest change to make this realistic combat

This game absolutely sucks.  An air game where both players literally chase each other's tails due to a stupid game system...which has nothing to do with air flight or combat.  I've heard the variant cards made it better...but it was so bad without them who would want to take that chance, throwing good money after bad.  Tactics II, Luftwaffe and Kriegspiel were all better...maybe even Origins of World War II (yep).

Played the first mission of Focker DR1 v Sopwith Camel. Once you distill the basic rules down I am surprised on how similar Wings of Glory is to this game. Yes this is counters and hexes and WoG does not use elevation but the game play feel very similar. This is great because I love WoG. 

My only gripe really about a 44 year old game is the layout of the main rules. Just like in Luftwaffe it is one huge sheet that is double sided and unfolds like a map. What kills me is that they have a mulit page booklet in there with detailed pictures. How much would it have cost to produce another booklet for the rules.

Honestly if that is my only complaint then the game is doing great IMHO. Is it dated to younger generation that likes minitaures. It is. But unless you have a bunch of players you can not get the same large games in WoG as you can in this game. I am going to have to do a full campaign and I am looking forward that.

The campaign game really shines. You get a feel for being the guy in command on the ground having to manage equipment and pilots to achieve your goals. In the beginning there is plenty of everything but as you progress you begin to get squeezed due to pilot availability and you use different in-flight tactics to avoid ship and man losses - or even just satisfy yourself by inflicting damage on the other pilot on an otherwise failed mission.

The addition of the variant Maneuver cards is essential.  Extended campaign games with a variety of missions, airplanes, repairs, replacement pilots, experience, ack-ack, and balloons makes this a terrific game.

Fun but not very well balanced. Uses chits with plane description on a fold up board. Good for its day but now there are much better simulations (see Wings of War).

My first tactical air combat game.  Some people call it dated, but it's still a good easy multi-player wargame.

Trades realism for playability, and that's fine with me. Great for team play, and relatively short playing time allows for mutiple plays in one sitting.

Taking turns doesn't really work for WW1 air combat.  Plus the 70s technology resulted in a coloful map and drab counters, which is backwards.

I played this to death when it first came out in 1972. I was fascinated with World War I in the air because of movies like "The Blue Max" and "Von Richthofen and Brown". Although I have gone on to other things, it is probably still a playable form.

Fun game for the time,  see if you can get the maneuver cards, if you can find them,  adds flavor to the game.  Not Wings of Glory but still good even with it's age.

If you like moving small, flat cardboard pieces around in little circles, chasing other small, flat cardboard pieces, then this is the game for you.  It was certainly the game for me back in the late 70s.  But just like WWI aircraft, this game is now horribly obsolete.  Wings of War or the like does this type of simulation so much better.

RATING: N/A
One play reveals it to be an OK game, but more plays will be needed to determine its rating.  May never play again due to Wings of War: Famous Aces.

RATING: 6
An old classic.

The air model is a bit simple, but playability is high.  I think (even within the simplistic flying model) that it does capture the differences between aircraft.

RATING: 6
Although the plane vs plane stuff is simplistic -- perhaps too simplistic -- the game comes into its own in the Campaign Game, in which both sides have to manage their squadrons, including their pilots and aircraft, over two weeks of heavy fighting, at up to five missions per day.

Fun game. Can be short if playing a quick encounter or long if playing a campaign. Easy to learn and I love the board. The info provided about the different planes is great reading. Countless possibilites. Seems to flow better if one uses the optional timed move rule.

WWI flying aces. We had fun with this for a time. 3 dimensional air combat is of interest and after a time you get a feel for it. The complexity really was held by keeping a control sheet with height and a few other details while you were flying. The board gave a much more attractive ground view than did the SPI title Flying Circus, but overall, the two games are decidedly comparable.

I've played hundreds of hours in dogfights and campaigns. The game shows its age in aircraft turning but halving the turn length and adding the maneuver cards brings back the tense action.

I have fond memories of playing this with my older brother in the 70s. Hasn't stood the test of time as a simulation, unfortunately. Yaquinto's Wings replaced this as my favourite WWI flying game in the early 80s, and has remained so since.

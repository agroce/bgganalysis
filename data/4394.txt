Most of the time this is almost as good as the original settlers.  However this has been permanently banned by my gaming friends due to a single game lasting over 4 hours.  All 4 players were within 1-2 points of winning for over 90 minutes.  It's ironic that 3 of us had been wanting to play Game of Thrones, but the fourth had demanded a quicker game.  That game was probably 2 years ago, but it's still remembered like yesterday.

But the game just does not change as much as a classic settlers game does. The board does not vary enough from game to game, and this limits it greatly.

Not bad at all! Sure, I'm partial to the theme, but I'm impressed at how the game, while using the Catan mechanics, manages to play very differently. The exploring aspect, along with the limited number of camps and the desertification of the start area, make for interesting decisions. The game does have 3 downsides: its playing time (a bit too long), its fixed map (which can be remedied by using number chits from the base Catan game) and the awful art, for which there is no excuse (the culture tokens are hideous, as is most of the art, like "bow and arrows" in the Hunting Progress Chart). Maybe this game would benefit from having an Event deck, to add some variety. Or even special cards for each step in the progress charts.

One play. Found it decent, but a bit static and "ho hum." Was going to sell, but then decided to keep it around for some reason or another.

Teuber does something different with Settlers' base mechanics, again.  While not a great fan of the franchise, I've played this several times and quite enjoyed it.  The way in which the human migration out of Africa is simulated is quite evocative (even if the actual mechanics are entirely artificial).

RATING: 5.5
I bought this as part of my All Things Stone Age phase and my Collector's side (Catan). I actually do like playing it, and it inspires me for story ideas, but mostly I only bring it out when I want inspiration and relaxation without tv/internet.

RATING: 8.3
Another compelling game from Klaus Treuber.  I like the unique feel each of his games offers, and their simple yet deep game play.  My only complaint here is that this one might be a tad bit long.  Oh, and also the strong luck element.

I&#039;ve played this a lot and quite enjoy it. There are three straegies that tnd to play themselves out and the player who, mid-game, decides to commit to one versus the others tends to win. There&#039;s a good deal of timing to this version and often when you make a decision you have to follow through on later implications.

Gave away my Catan game when I bought this.  I miss the randomness of the tiles and the score of the original, though the exploration and migration part of this I like.  Still like Catan more though.  May have to buy it again.

this might actually bump up settlers for me.  the lack of cities and trading posts seems to materially harm the game.  perhaps it's more thematic, but the resource screwage didn't feel that way and everyone was trying to pick up the scraps collectively.  for no apparent reason, i emerged as an early leader and despite every attempt to target me i continued to coast to victory.  another commented, and i agreed, that it would have been better to clearly run away and end it or not run away at all.  what we ended up with was leader slowdown with no change in position, bringing the game to an agonizing pace.  i like the idea, but it just didn't play out very well.  the exploring action seems underpowered.

A fun Settlers variant. Several neat new twists in this game over the original: the introduction of explorers, the need to purchase advances to reach particular places, bonuses for settling in new places and exploring inhospitable places. Since the rules allow 3-1 trades with the stock, there's less trading than in traditional Settlers. Some decision making on what advances to purchase as well. The best players seem to follow a strategy where they would build a camp in Europe first before doing much in the way of purchasing advances. The two-hour play time seemed a bit long for a game of Settler's complexity, but not unusually so given that players expand across the whole reach of the board. If you enjoy all things Settlers, boost the rating a point or two.

Played this game first September 2004 at the boardgame marathon of the game club Incognito.  It appealed to me very much.  I even liked it a bit more as Settlers of Catan as you can move your "trunks" over the board.  This is nice in cases you are "blocked" and have no way out as could happen in Settlers.

A good twist on the Settlers system.  After two playings, I still feel like it has the same &quot;can&#039;t catch up if you&#039;re behind early&quot; problem present in Settlers; but it&#039;s not as bad because you can always get an explorer out and make *some* progress, unlike if you get contained in Settlers.  Should still be worth a few more playings.

A very good game. If you like the classic settlers you'll love this new version. The basic mechanics are the same but there is enough new stuff to make the game interesting. Anyway the board is fixed so there is less replaybility, i think.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Enjoyable and engrossing.  Beautiful board.  I recommend rerolling 7's in first 2 rounds and starting each player with 1 of each resource.   

This is not a game for people who love trading, because it doesn't happen nearly as much as in vanilla Settlers.  And it's easy to get behind and have a difficult time getting back into the game, which can be a problem during a game of this length (typically 2 hours or more, when we play).  I would love to see a variant in which the numbers on the resource hexes were randomized, rather than static.  A pattern that I have noticed in the past game or two:  one person gets ahead by going after lots of exploration counters, and another ignores exploration and concentrates on building lots of settlements and eventually catches up.  

When playing with new people, I try to remember to tell everyone that Africa is going to turn to desert over time, and it's a good idea to move out of Africa and create new settlements in Europe or Asia as soon as possible.

RATING: N/A
This purports to be in the Settlers family, but sufficiently removed from the base game to offer a unique experience.  In fact, once you play it you will realize that it is the same mechanisms and choices, just presented to the players differently.  For instance, the exploring element seems new and different, but if you look at the overall cost to explore (including working up the proper tech track), you will quickly realize that it is almost exactly equivalent to buying a development card.  The tech tracks themselves seem to offer interesting ways to develop your little tribe, but since they are more or less mandatory, they act more as a control on the pace of the game, rather than an element that defines or furthers a player's particular strategy.

Overall, I am not very impressed with the game after one play.  It seems to offer the same Settlers experience in a longer play time.  If you really like Settlers, this might be enough of a difference in flavor to be refreshing, but for me, I don't think the minor differences are worth the extra time spent.

This game has some of the original features from Settlers.
I think that game has a certain twist that makes it interesting, but the playing time for us was closer to 3 hours than 1,5 hours.
The strategy wasn't all that clear when we started, and all of us got stuck in a barren Africa, which may have prolonged the game.
Need to play it another time to see if there is something to like in this game.

Downgraded slightly with more play.  This is a really fun game.  I enjoy Settlers a lot and enjoy the exploration theme along with the desertification of Africa.  The main drawback is this seems to be one of the longer Settlers games and I'm not sure the theme makes up for the length.  I'd probably rather play 2 regular Settlers than one Stone Age.

My favorite of the Settlers variants, although I wouldn't want to play it all the time.  I'm not entirely sure why.  Part of it is certainly the concepting of exploring the world, and I suspect part of it is that you can finally do SOMETHING with a single resource.  At any rate, I enjoy it, but I can rarely get it to the table.

I liked this game, especially the movement mechanics, but had my first game spoiled by being the target of too many thieves (I was the only one producing meat, necessary for movement).

While I'm generally a big Settlers fan, I feel like Settlers of the Stone Age just goes on a little bit long. Like any Settlers game, you can get a bit hosed by the dice, and Settlers of the Stone Age goes kinda long without giving you many tools to mitigate the dice luck (as Starfarers and Struggle for Rome do). I still like to play from time to time becuase I think the re-theming works really well, but I think it's not as well-executed as other Settlers variants.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really nice Settlers varient. The need to move your "cities" over the course of the game really changes the overall tone. The feeling of exploration is well captured. However, it doesn't have a very high replayability factor, so I've marked it down a point. If you see it cheap (I picked it up for 10 euros) get it.

I'm also not a fan of the desertification or the migration of camps.  (2+0+2) (2 plays)

I actually think this game in many aspects is better than Settlers. The only problem with it is that there isn't a lot of variety to it. You pretty much play the same way each game. But it's got a set playing board so set up for the game isn't as drawn out as Settlers and it keeps your attention pretty well. Not overly complex.

I like the theme and the fact that you need to move your villages over the course of the game as Africa, where the game starts, turns into desert. Well balanced, although just like with the Original, if you're unlucky then skill won't save you. Downside is the long game time, you can easily spend over two hours playing and if you've fallen behind then you basically need to sit it out with little chance of winning. Trading away to make room for other games.

This game is fun in the beginning, but drags on, and towards the end, you are ready for it to be over so you can start another game.  Most of the same mechanics from original Settlers, but with the Stone Age theme.  Also, there is no variable map here (real world map), and there are essentially two robber equivalents.  Adds a few extra ways to score VP, making for some extra opportunities for AP at times.

This incarnation has enough mechanical similarities to the other Catan games that it was easy to pick up, however is different enough in focus and mechanic that it felt like a whole new game, which at a $49.99 price point is a good thing!  There are several ways to gain the VPs needed to win, which is to its credit, however keep in mind that the more you go after the exploration tiles the quicker Africa will become useless to you. Our first play took about 3 hours, but we had a couple new-to-Catan players who didn't pick up the rules as quickly as others.  I think most games will probably be around 2-2.5 hrs.

For the record, we think that one can play this with five or even six:  You&#039;ll need a few more pieces (little plastic pieces stolen from other games will do it). In set up each player places one settlement, then in reverse order each player places a second settlement and at the time of placing her/his second settlement can place her/his explorer.  Also, winning condition should be reduced from 10 points to 9 for the 5 player game, and reduced to 7 for the 6 player game.

I like the Settlers concept. But because it has only 4 resource types and almost everyone wnats the same on the same moment, my experience is that not very much trade will occur in the game. The black and white Â´FortschrittÂ´s required to pass pathways are fun. But bad luck in the begin of the game can be killing fotr the rest of the game. Poor men keep poor especially when the deserts are coming around your camps before you have good new camps outside Africa

Enjoyable Settlers variant.  Players begin with tribes (settlements) in Africa.  Africa will eventually become desert, so nomads must be sent out of Africa to form new Settlements around the world (1 vp each).  Bonus vp's are earned for a fast expansion, exploration, founding camps in all the continents, etc.

RATING: 8
Settlers of the Stone Age is different than the original Settlers of Catan. One of the big differences is the game board. In Settlers of the Stone Age, the game board and the numbers are always the same instead of always being different in every game. It's a bit more of a gamer's game than the original Settlers of Catan.

I find Settlers of the Stone Age a whole lot better and interesting than Starfarers of Catan which is another spin of the original game. I played Starfarers and hated it. Stone Age was different.

Another game might change the game's rating. Playing once or twice every now than is OK. Since the board is fix and all, I find that playing many games in a short time, the strategies would be more or less same in every game since the starting point is the same. The only varible would be the dices. What resources comes out at a given time.

Meh. Seems like a race to get out of Africa and to the other continents. Whoever does it first wins.

On the topic, however, Elasund is a Settlers spin-off that I actually like.

An improvement on the original game, this sits in a hapy medium between the simplicity of the original, and the complexities of the Cities and Knights expansion - finding that sweet spot just between.

Another good variation on the basic mechanism, the map is very good, but in all it seems to easy to progress to 10VPs. It's more of a sim of human evolution and works well as is.

I actually like this guy pretty well.  It's kind of neat stripping down to 3 resources and playing on a migration-focused board.  It's hard to get past the game not having a little more variety in the board setup, or maybe more chaos from the exploration tiles would be cool, but I actually am slightly more likely to want to play this version of Settlers than the others.

RATING: 2
Played 3 times. Originally a 7. Not a bad game for the first play or two, but obviously with a  set board, variety is lacking. I like the 'tech' mechanics a lot (well, for a Settlers game, at least). My first game was a bit underwhelming since I was playing with absolute newbies, but with players who know what they are doing, this game could get quite interesting: choosing how much to commit to explorers, and watching which tile have been checked out and knowing what the remaining chips in a 'zone' will be; balancing resource production with new sites, etc. A good 'big' non-gamer game, but long-term replayability...? Owned it, then sold it.

I like some of the innovations here.  The desertification of Africa provides a dynamic feel, forcing the players to migrate.  The advancement along the technology tracks makes for some interesting choices and tradeoffs.  There is also a nice diversity of ways to score (settling, exploration, technology, and beating the competition to Australia and America).

However, this game loses to basic Settlers in several other areas.  There are too many victory points, allowing the leader to race through the finish line with out having to fight the others for limited resources.  There is a much greater emphasis on pussing your neighbor, and less emphasis on trading.  The game feels a little too long for something with this much luck.  Finally, like any of the fixed-board Settlers variants, it will probably feel a bit "samey" each time you play.  On balance, good for an occasional play, but it's not an improvement on the basic Settlers system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This was a pleasant surprise. Still Settlers, although different. The moving plus the desertation mechanisms, make the game more dynamic. The only problem is that the players need the same stuff at nearly the same time, so trading suffers.

RATING: 7
Fun variant.  I need to play more to see if it becomes too predictable and repetitive, which I fear it might.  I think I&#039;d prefer a random set up to add more variety.  The game tends to be a two horse race with the 3rd and 4th player trying to catch up.

Played 5+ Plays just as well with 3 as with 4. 2 hours. I like the way your settlements move as the game progresses. Africa turns to desert and players use their explorers to pick out the best spots to build camps to populate the world *UPDATE* Dropped my rating a point because I realise that in every game someone gets stuck in africa and scores very few points and/or someone runs into an unstoppable lead. At 2+ hours there should be more position jockeying. Still a nice game but I don't see us playing it many more times. April 04

I enjoy this good stand alone from the Catan Series.  Though some mechanics are similar (resource production, i.e.), the game feels quite different.

Good "Catan" game with a nice element of exploration. However, there is little trading, as players usually want the same resources.

I bought this game as a shorter alternative to "Starfarers", but I found out that it may take the same amount of time.

This is a wonderful twist on the settler's system.  If you have bad numbers at the beginning of the game, don't worry, they can <i>change</i>.  That is refreshing.  Key thing, though....get thee out of Africa before it becomes a wasteland!  You need to settle in more fertile lands as soon as possible to ensure your survival.  Nice bells and whistles.  Have to wonder about the three pronged piece, though...I think they were on sale or something, that's why they chose that shape.

RATING: 7
Interesting implementation of the Settlers mechanic on a world map, set in the stone age. Players start out in Africa, and migrate across Europe, Asia, and eventually cross the land bridge into North America and South America. Seems scripted, as the map is fixed, but there seems to be plenty of interesting choices despite this. This isn't half as bad as one would think if they were burned out of Settlers. Still, the random element of number trends, like the time when we rolled nothing but 5s and 10s, for example, is still there.

After a while, I finally realized the Catan games weren't as much fun as they first seemed.   But this is the most poorly-designed.

The concept is extremely clever and the flavor is fantastic, I will give it that.   Unfortunately, the game has fully three power-protect mechanics and nothing to counter act them: in Settlers of the Stone Age, whoever gets ahead stays ahead and wins, almost without exception.

Out of Africa:  The first one or two players to colonize outside of Africa get the most fertile locations, producing more.  Later players must travel further or settle for weaker locations, putting them further behind.

Desertification:  Players getting a later start out of Africa not only take longer to find new resources, but the old ones in Africa they depend on start turning to desert.   So they are doubly screwed.

Discoveries:  Each of the discoveries around the board margins gives a bonus, but can only be discovered once.  Thus the players with an early lead get bonuses, and the players falling behind are likely to stay behind.

It is possible for a player who is behind on turn 4 to get lucky with the dice and catch up, but the game mechanics definitely give the leaders an advantage.  Catch-ups are much more rare than in other games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Different enough from Settlers to be worth playing now and again for a bit of a change. More luck in it than in Settlers - the difference between getting 1 VP and being forced to desertify a hex you are on is huge - and hexes can get desertified before the law of averages kicks in to counterbalance a string of poor early rolls.

We have played it only once but it was extremely rewarding. A Catan variation based in mankind exploration during prehistory. No lo jugamos bien la primera vez que lo jugamos, asÃ­ que nos perdimos gran parte de la estrategia que el juego tiene para ofrecer. El usual manejo de recursos que estos juegos ofrecen, ademÃ¡s mayor interacciÃ³n en la lucha por controlar territorios y expandir tu tribu por todo el mundo.

RATING: 6
If The Settlers of the Stone Age had been my first Catan spin-off, I might have liked it a bit more, but Trails to Rails took the same ideas and polished them a bit more, and made the game move along better, whereas The Settlers of the Stone Age bogged down in places. 

For anyone that hasn't played them, rather than roads and cities, you have a camp (stationary place) and an explorer piece that moves. You can convert the explorer into a camp. The other thing that's similar is how the starting area "times out" with spaces drying up over time, so you can't just stay on initial spots and have them churn out resources all game.

The Settlers of the Stone Age has a fun thing where there are 4 abilities tracks, and you can spend resources to move up those tracks. So, for example, one helps you to move farther on an action, and 2 of the 4 change what areas you can cross over. If you don't upgrade, you're limited in where you can go on the board. You also can't take the Roman numeral tiles, which are another possible way to get points. 

Trails to Rails has a "pity resource" when you wouldn't otherwise get something, so that one person doesn't sit there twiddling their thumbs (me) while someone else always gets stuff (Sam). So maybe I just need to borrow that bit from Trails to Rails and see if I can work it in.

Strangely, the fixed board setup does not affect the replayability of the game.  More paths to victory than standard Settlers which is nice.  One main problem is that this game takes forever with four people; it's a lot quicker with three.  The box makes cleanup very quick (it's a real pain to cram Settlers plus the two expansions and the 5-6 player expansions into the same box :-)

Just as good as normal Settlers of Catan and with a bit more complexity yet I rate it lower. Why? Cos it last longer and has the same luck element. But if you love settlers of catan then you&#039;ll love this (like me).

A good variant on the original game.  It&#039;s possible that the game places too much emphasis on earning exploration tiles and not enough emphasis on trading, but it&#039;s fun, you can recover from bad positions more readily, and in general I&#039;d say it&#039;s a winner.

Very similar to Settlers but not as good for a few reasons. One, this game takes much longer, actually seeming to drag at points. Two, static setup, the number and landscape are always the same. Three, I felt as if I had much less control over what happened to me.

RATING: 8.5
This is my 2nd favourite version of all the variations of catan that I have. Its only let down in my opinion is that it is a set board. The resources have a set position and the value of the dice needed for those resources is also set. This reduces variation in the game. Other than that I love the game.
Some people do find it a little complex, but the same could be said about Settlers and many of its variations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Probably my favorite Catan stand-alone title (as opposed to Seafarers or Cities and Knights, which I think of as expansions), though the resource shortfalls can be a bit too severe.  Feels more epic in scope.  The birth of civilization is always an appealing theme, and it's worked in well with the mechanics.  Even as rudimentary as they are, technology tracks are always welcome.

RATING: 4
This is a clever rendering of the expansion of civilization using familiar ideas from Catan. It is not an interesting strategy game however - optimal choices for a given circumstance are obvious (get the best dice rolls so you can explore faster and help desertify your rivals). There is a ridiculous runaway leader problem made worse by the length of the game. Play it once for the novelty but stop the game once somebody has a clear lead - it will only get bigger.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very fun settlers variant. The theme works well and the fixed board allows you to develop more specific strategies since the resource hexes never change. Usually runs longer than regular settlers, but you also have more to do. Otherwise luck still plays a large roll.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Do not play this game without a deck of dice.  In Settlers of Catan, a player can be hampered by unlucky dice rolls.  In this game, you can be out of it quick because players that get resources first can turn your hexes into desert so they never produce again.  Unlike basic Settlers which takes 60 minutes, this game takes three hours.  That is a long time to play when you knew after 20 minutes that you can't win.

This game has some serious flaws. If the desert tiles get picked early, some players will be out of the game very fast through no fault of their own. Stick with the original Settlers.

RATING: 5
There are some different and interesting twists added into this stand alone, Catan series game.  The trading and resource gathering remains much the same with different resources (only 4).  One pays resources to advance in knowledge in 4 different areas which allows for exploration of action tiles, move further with a nomad, or move the neandothral or sabre-tooth tiger which acts as a pirate.  Also, tribes (kinda like settlements) or another nomad (cylinder which moves around to find tribes and discover action tiles) can be built/moved.  Get the hell out of Africa quickly if you can since a number of the action tiles cause resource producing hexes in Africa to become desert!  My biggest issue with the game is that it dragged but that might have been because it was our first play?

Sold in the Lydia charity auction.  I'd just rather play Settlers instead with one of the variants.

Quitte Ã  choisir une seule boÃ®te avec cette mÃ©canique, je conseille fortement celle-ci.

Wow.  This goes-up there with Antike and Mare Nostrum with Mythology Expansion as one of the almost Holy Grail games of Civ in 2 hours time.  Sure, there's a lot of luck with the dice, but, with some attention paid to statistics, it shouldn't be too hard to mitigate that luck.  And even so, the game is so much fun to play,  regardless of whether you win or loose it.

Cool variant on the Catan base game. A numbers of the core mechanisms are present as to make this very familiar to players familiar with the original. However there are small additions that make this interesting, like 4 extra tech trees that end in victory points and other targets. Additionally, the board is set on a world map with the settlers trying to spread out from Africa across the world as Africa turns to desert as a result of their exploration/ expansion. This is a really cool thematic idea turned into mechanism to force expansionism. Very pleased.

I don't really enjoy this one. We found that the player interaction is much reduced, making it seem like 4 player solitaire. Our group much prefers regular Settlers or Seafarers. Wanted to like this but couldn't. High quality components and board tho. Willing to trade this game.

Our second game was not very close: I won with 10, second had 7, 3 &4 had 4 & 3 points, which turned out much differently than our normal Settlers game.  After another play, we've decided it has some nice mechanisms, but just takes too long to complete for us, generally around 2 hours.  I doin't know if we play too slowly, or what, but it always takes about 1/2 an hour too long.

I was surprised that the game was able to take many familiar Settlers features (if not exactly mechanics) and make it into a lighter-scale Civ game.  Strategies come into play in planning which of several routes to take in amassing the VPs needed to win (and attempting to do it quickly).  Trading doesn't seem to be as major a part as in Settlers, and the larger game board makes direct player interaction less of an issue.  Play time seemed a bit too long for the value, though, which could be improved in subsequent plays.

Lets see, I need food to move to go after victory points, but Im not getting any, and the folks who are getting it arent trading it cause they need it. So after sitting for 8 turns doing absolutely nothing, as the dice were unkind, I wondered "why the hell am I playing this?" 

But if you want to trade for it, the game is great and it will be very hard for me to part with it. Really.

This game takes the basic Settlers engine and plugs it into a "develop your tribe and spread across the world" format.  It's sufficiently different from the original Settlers of Catan that there's a decent amount of replay value here.  In a three player game, we've noticed that one or two people will typically pull in front, and one person (typically me, lately) will be left far behind.  

The most powerful play in the game is to get one settlement on each major continent, the first person to do that gets 2 bonus VPs.  That, coupled with that last settlement, is a 3 VP shot-in-the-arm.  That has changed the dynamics of several games we've played, where someone who was trailing suddenly pulled in front.

RATING: 6
Not too impressed with this.  Got off to a good start but seemed to die in the mid-game with certain resource types being very scarce to all players.  Also the carnivore move seems to limit expansion into america (though I guess it could have been a dodgey rules translation.)

RATING: 7
Uses the Settlers model and applies it to the dawn of man's expansion out of Africa. Skills are introduced that allow further advancement or benefit during play. An artificial deadline is created as Africa slowly turns to desert as the game progresses. Worth exploring as a game in its own right.

RATING: 8
Great game which I thought had a flaw with the ease of obtaining the VP chits. I re-read the rules and read reviews here to find that you MUST build a camp where the VP chit is to get the VP. We had wild games where people had plenty of food (meat) to move and scoop up several chits in one turn, until we READ THE RULES!

Lacks the differing boards of normal 'Settlers', still a very fun play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid game with obviously many similarities to Settlers except with a Stone Age theme. The board is fixed so re-playability and variability may be less so than in plain Settlers but that remains to be seen over the longer haul.

This isn't a necessity to own if you have Settlers (especially if you have expansions for the base game as well)... but the game seems to play smoothly and is entertaining enough. I think it's a 7 for me because nothing stands out and makes it a clear "must play" type of game... yet it's fun and interesting enough that it isn't boring either.

In the stone age, players move their cavemen across continents, building settlements like the orginal Catan game. As evolution occurs, parts of the old territory get destroyed. Players can also earn VPs by progressing along 4 different tracks, each track giving different abilities (more cavemen movement, for instance.) Klaus Teuber is milking the Settlers thing for everything, but this is an improvement over Starfarers. Exploration requirement is put in nicely and different ways to acquire VPs. Only drawback is that it is longer than normal Settlers, clocking in at about two hours, so you have to be in the mood for it, but it is engaging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the idea - settlers more for gamers, and it works well, with the exception that it seems to really grag on too long for it's depth. There also seems to be such limited numbers of victory points, come the end of the game everyone is counting up the last 3 or 4 on the board which kind of kills it for me.

It's a slow starter then gets really fun, but then dies a slow an agonising death for the last quarter of the game.

Still not terrible, I just think it could do with a tweak.

I am going to try a game with fewer VPs for victory, maybe 8 instead of 10.

It's official - I don't care for Settlers in any way, shape or form. I can't stand the luck or the rich-get-richer game play, which is even more present in this version with the bonus chits going to the person who gets ahead in resources and which allows that person to hose the players that have already fallen behind. Yawn.

I think the additional layer of theme and extra competition focii are worth double the normal time to play so I keep this in my Settlers rotation.

I have a feeling that the player leading mid-way merely extends their lead to the end. I enjoy the first half of the game - racing out of Africa, lots of different options to spend your cards on. But by the mid-game, once Asia is settled, your path is set and there's not much to do to affect the end outcome other than pray for good dice. The theme, art and bits are fantastic however.

I liked this as a change from vanilla Settlers, but it is just too long. I like the exploration aspect and the migrating colonies. But if you get stuck and stranded in Africa when it is shutting down, you are just fucked the rest of the game.

RATING: 8
Solid alternate of Settlers, but I still prefer the original a bit, probably due to the various setups and more need for trading.  Still, this is a nice game, with various ways to victory and MUCH more decision-making.  The huge droughts that arise, though, can really bring down a fun game.  I'll probably have to start playing the the deck of dice.

*Update* Good play, as in the original, tends to be rewarded, and poor punished, so I'm not so sure the deck of dice is merited. There does seem to be a point in every game, though, where in a mass of 3 people at 5/6 points, someone suddenly rockets to victory in the space of 3 or 4 turns. So unlike Catan, which frequently finishes 10 to 9 to 9, this one doesn't have such close scoring.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The fact that all resources are equally valued takes some of the fun out of trading and some of the tension out of deciding where to build.  The person who explores the most is going to win the vast majority of the time, so the first 5-6 die rolls (which determine how far you can move up the various charts) usually decide the winner.  In all ways inferior to regular Settlers.

RATING: 5
This one's interesting for me.  It's been met with a lot of love from my usual Settlers fans, but I'm not so sure it's got the replayability and variety of even vanilla Settlers.  It feels a little like the travel edition+ ... the board is always the same, it's just a matter of deciding what to do with each game.  I like the scenarios in Settlers where there is the chance that you won't get good brick numbers for the entire game (for example).  That's not the case in this one.

RATING: 7
Prefer 3 players as the 3rd phase of a player's turn can become long winded, and the people vp chips are sparse, so encouraging more advancement into Oz/America. It appears that there is an abundance of victory points available so any path that the dice results dictate will advance you to 10 vp.(Does this imply an expansion is inevitable)? So the scores may tend to be close and the game end within 75 mins, especially with 3. The fixed status of the board means everyone leaves Africa to Europe, then it's onto Australia and/or America, so each game feels scripted. The Siedler development deck has been converted to counters which can only be drawn when you advance to the relevant levels in clothing and shelter. This gives the game a nice narrative, and also less luck with development draws as distribution is area fixed, but randomised within that area. The game has strong negative intent as there are 3 ways of moving a robber, there are 2 robbers and there are the desert tiles to permanently stop African production. Trading rate with bank is reduced as are the number of commodity types, so less activity in the trading phase. One plus AM has over Siedler is that it is quicker to set up, plays a little like Starfarers, but is over quicker. Note that there is a translation confusion re:robbers actually blocking nomad movement.

I enjoyed this slightly more that the original Settlers. This one seems to suffer less severely than the original Settlers from the imbalance caused by the initial settlement selections.  The new technology tracks provide more play options which create additional flavor, decision making, and strategy to the game. Furthermore, there is less incentive for trading since you only need one or two cards for most play options. Depending on whether or not you like 'negotiations' and trading, this could be a plus or a minus for the game.

Never whinged so much playing a game. I really like Settlers variants, but this dragged too long and it was too frustrating early on waiting to build another camp. You're really hindered early on with poor rolls, and I found the alternative option of boosting technology dull. There's not enough trading either, which is half the fun of Settlers. I don't mind losing badly or suffering poor rolls playing Settlers or its variants, but not when it drags on towards two hours. Easily the worst in the Settlers line - although my wife really liked it! (She won).

A strategic catan boardgame that is a quite a bit deeper with different strategies to victory.  Perhaps a little too for my tastes and the theme of caveman spreading over the earth is quite silly.  I like the strategy and mechanics more than the theme and length.

RATING: 6.5
This game also has the typical Catan problems that you may not be able to  do anything for consecutive turns. In comparison to basic Catan this has an even bigger runaway leader problem, since the settlements in Eurasia are actually as good as the starting settlements (which is not the case in basic Catan) and with desertification the leader can really bash their pursuers. Takes quite a while longer than basic Catan, but is also more complex.

Picked this game up for only 10 Euros (just over Â£7) on the last day of Essen 2007!  Haven't played it yet but for that price, who cares if it sucks!  UPDATE - Played the game for the first time last night.  Not bad at all.  Expands on the basic principles of Settlers of Catan and adds some neat little touches (eg Exploration, Advances).  The neatest aspect of the game, in my opinion anyway, is the way players are forced to move out of Africa as the game progresses ... giving the game a degree of realism that is welcome.

As much as I like Settlers, this game takes many of the issues I don't like about it (too short, small board, no mobility, starting with points on the board instead of at 0) and improves them with a vengeance.

This is a fun game for people who are already familiar with or totally new to Settlers of Catan.  People who have played Settlers will recognize a lot of the mechanics.

This is an offshoot of Settlers of Catan, and as such is a pretty good fulfilling experience.  However, every time I think about playing this game I just go with Catan and/or its many expansions and variants.  One thing that hurts this game is that the board is not modular like in Catan.

I really like to try a lot of the games based on the Settlers system.  I think the system is extremely versatile and offers a lot.  However, there seem to be few implementations that are as good as the original.  This one is no exception.  I like the expansion aspects of this game and there are some things I like about the "wasting" of Africa.  However, the chits you can collect are too significantly different in value for my taste and seem to drive the game too much.  So, while I would happily play this one again, it is not one that I will be seeking out. [06/28/2009]

Settlers of the Stone Age -- Played twice; four-player.  While recognizably Catan-based, dramatically different game-play, and very good.  Luck of the dice is mitigated by the abundance of places to camp.  

Owl's variants appear well thought-out.  (These are available in the Files section under "Settlers of the Stone Age Ver.1.1.doc".)  We've tried eliminating the Exploration VP card, but we haven't limited movement around the Neanderthal and Saber-toothed Tiger.  I think the two variants would work best in combination.  Looking forward to finding out.

1- Remove from the game the exploration card that gives 2 VP. Exploration is enough rewarding that those two points made a player a runaway player. There is too many VP available anyway and it will force the players to get to America and Australia.
2- The Neanderthal and Saberthooth Tiger pieces block the terrain hexes they are in as in the original rules. As they want to avoid danger, no explorers may ENTER any of the 6 intersections adjacent to one of these pieces. The explorer can remain there if the piece was placed in a hex that is adjacent to an already occupied intersection by an explorer. The explorer can set a camp because he does not enter a new intersection. The explorer can only leave such intersection if he can avoid any entrance to another intersection adjacent to that hex. Also, no new explorer can be placed in such an intersection because it would mean an entrance. A lot of strategy is added with that rule. Now hunting (with many players) is mandatory to slow down a runaway player and a way ahead explorer. Choosing another playerâs card and blocking a productive hex is now confronted with the possibility to jam an explorer or a choke point or simply freeing your own explorer.[/q]
The original German instructions actually included owll's second rule.

RATING: 5
Not "better than Settlers" but a good way to extend your romance with the Settler system once you're burned out on the original.  *Update*:  This one did not have any longevity.  Dropping from 7 to 6.  *Update*:  Tried it again, dropping to 5.

I was very excitedly awaiting the release of this game, but unfortunately it didn't hold up. There's some great ideas here, but the distribution of resources needed for various builds makes everything equally valued and equally required for every player, which eliminates a lot of the strategy and also messes up trading.

An excellent game of exploration, settlement, development and using resources.  A variant on the Settlers of Catan series, but with new twists and a terrific Stone Age theme.  Very nicely produced board and pieces.  The rules are elegant rather than complex, and not difficult to learn.  There are a number of factors to watch for in order to win, which makes for challenge and excitement.  Made for 3 or 4 players, but can be played (albeit not quite as varied) with 2 using the 3 player rules.  Highly recommended.

This one is interesting. In my only play, I was skewered by bad luck so many times that my experience was slightly soured. But I may play this again one day, if only to figure out if I really dislike this game. Normally I don't mind a bit of luck in games, but sometimes you eat the bear...

This is the German version, with English rules and English copies of player aids.

I enjoyed this stand-alone version of Settlers considerably more than the original Settlers with all its expansions (although two other stand-alone variations, "The Settlers of Canaan" and "The Starfarers of Catan" - neither of which I've played - have both been ranked slightly higher than this one by the BGG community).  In my opinion, it takes the few fun elements of Settlers, adds a couple more of its own, and puts them all together in a more playable game.  It also takes away the somewhat static feel of the original Settlers (with the original's unforgiving punishment of a poor starting position) and forces players to move and expand as quickly as possible.  The game is well-themed, too, giving that sense of urgency to colonize the world as the resources in your starting point within Africa dry up.  It makes me curious to try the other two stand-alone versions that I mentioned above and see which one I enjoy the most.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7/10

[Mayfair Games 2002 edition] {Catan, Prehistory, Civilization; trading, development, dice-rolling, resource management; optimal 4p} Settlers of the Stone Age is a nice Settlers variant. It is thematic and tactical. It does not have a modular board but replayability is still good with the bonus chips and dice.  The 2-level resource management is good but resources are not very tight.  The 4 development tracks make very good sense and integrate with the theme well.  It truly emulates the development of a civilization and migration of mankind.  The desertification of Africa is a nice mechanic, which forces players to act quickly.  The new mechanics make Stone Age is more tactical game than its parent.  I think it is a very good candidate to advance another level of playing from the original game.

Not a BAD game, but hard to get excited over it. It has some really good elements, but if you don't get out of Africa soon enough, you're pretty much out of it. The game is long and painful for you if you can't get an explorer going. It just seems like the first explorer to go running around usually has control of the game. The desertification tiles are brutal. UPDATE: I recently traded away my copy of this game.

While not as "pure" as settlers, it offers several innovations over that game, not the least of which is reducing the number of resources to 4, and the trading rate to 3:1, which means that very few turns go by in which a player has nothing they can do, a major flaw in the original.

I lusted after this one when it came out, but perhaps my expectations were too high.  Sometimes the players just seem to be rolling and rolling and not coming up with anything and the game starts to really drag.  Or maybe that's me.

My favorite of the Catan games.  By removing the roads and reducing the number of resources to 4, this game removes the danger that a player is going to be stuck and bored the whole time.

I played this recently and I love Catan and I was very disappointed with the flaws of this that could of been easily fixed.

Good: 
This adds a nice new gimmick with the deserts and thats about it.

Bad:

There are three main things that could of fixed this game by a lot. The first would be the the spots are set. Unlike in Catan where you have the choice of picking any of the six spots on the hex this one you can only pick between three. So all of the spots you can build to will always be the same. Second would be the numbers are always the same and the board in always set the same. These would be very easy to fix and it would make this game quite a lot better.

What I got out of this is if you take every thing great about Catan out you get this. The main one would be the replay value.

Since I'm so sick of the original settlers, this one seems so much more fun in comparison. Decent, but not great.

It keeps the gamer friendliness, while expanding on the game.  Reduced my desire to play the original settlers, while still not expanding on the ruleset so big as to make the game unapproachable.  It takes the original settlers mechanics, adds a dynamic flavor to them, adds additional ways to score points and only adds 30 minutes to gameplay.  Well done.

I don't think Settlers of Catan mechanics really support more than 60 minutes, if I must play a "Something of Catan" thats longer, this would be my choice.

Sort of in between Settlers of Catan and Starfarers. The exploration/desertification are nice ways of showing the eastward movement, but in our one game we were continually resource-poor (moreso than usual) and especially at the beginning we had very little we could do. The fact that most VPs were very stable (only I think one card could be taken away) was sort of weird too.

I just played this for the first time, and maybe I should give it another chance, but it really didn't capture me.  I am usually reluctant to deduct points from a game because I like another game better, but based on this one play, there are other games in the Catan series that I think I would always prefer to play.  The game went a little long, so if I wanted to play a longer, meatier Catan, I think I would always prefer Cities and Knights.  If I wanted something a little different, and still meaty, I really like Elasund.  If I want to keep it simple, then I would just play Catan, especially with the event deck.

Aside my comparison with other Catan games, some specific complaints are that I don't like the board setup.  This doesn't have a random setup, and I really don't like the setup.  I'm sure it's setup this way on purpose, but Africa is the best area on the board and it turns into Dessert as the game goes away.  It is both one of the coolest parts of the games, and the part that irked me the most.  I never found any other areas that I liked as well, but you can't go home again.  There are also only two ways to get 2 point victory cards.  One way has some potential for passing back and forth, but once you start getting the bonus for chits, it probably isn't that hard to get more.  The other is a one time bonus for establishing a camp on every continent.  It seemed to me that those 2 points are crucial to a win, but only two people are likely to get them.

It's not a bad game.  My complaints are hardly killers, and they might actually be advantages for someone else, but like I said, there are other games that scratch that itch better.

A very catanish game, where the board is bigger and players move their camps as they are expanding to all over the world enacting the evolution of the human race. Basics are same, roll the dice, areas produce, make trade and buy stuff.

In general the players get more cards, because the area is larger, so most of the villages (camps) get production from three areas. There are also more things to buy and they are little bit cheaper, so there is usually lots to on your turn - if nothing else, but calculating how to use all the cards and prevent others from stealing them.

My only game so far was a 4 player game with all newbies (one was not familiar with Catan at all) and it took as 2,5 hours with the rules explanation. It was too long, may be the future games are closer to 1,5 hours, or this game won't see much action on my table.

You can give this a try, if you want some variation to the basic Catan, may be?

Good game, but really no need to own this if you already own Settlers of Catan.

One of the most cohesive themes of all the games I own though (parts of Africa turning to desert, forcing humans to migrate to other areas works to absolute perfection).  Still too luck based for my tastes, but a game I'll play with my wife.

A decent game from the Settler's genre, not spectacular, but fun.

pretty cool Catan variant, instead of a random map with set locations, you get a fixed map but you move your pieces around to new locations, exploration and "tech tree/bonus VP's"

In truth, I haven't played a full game of this yet.  My only one (4-player) got interrupted at about 65%.  That said, it still felt very much like Settlers which isn't my favourite anymore.  I don't like how the dice add so much chaos to the game.  I'd like to give it a try with my "Deck of Dice" sometime soon.

It's Settlers only different.  Haven't played it much, but the first time I played it, I thought that each settlement gave you one victory point (as in Settlers).  This is not the case!  They give you no victory points.

This is a great game.  I would give it an 8 or 9 if you could change the starting layout.  Since you can't, it is a 7.  You "learn the optimal" routes and this makes it a lesser game in my opinion. Great fun though.

I much prefer this over the vanilla Settlers.  With the addition of tech trees and the exploration aspect, the game transformed into a mini-civilization building style with dice.  There are still downtime when the rolls are not going your way, but it isn't as significant as the original nor can you be completely hosed by being blocked off from further expansion (and ways of getting more VP).

Rates higher (slightly) for me than original Settlers.  I like the whole development scheme and the myriad of ways to get victory points.  Plus, there's resource management going on (what to develop?) that makes it interesting for me.

Underrated.  I particularly enjoy how the mechanics simulate the forced spread of man from its beginnings in Africa.

Using some fundamentals of Settlers of Catan, some interesting game mechanisms to encourage migration of your limited number of camps (resource collection points), and some other incentives to explore remote regions and improve your civilization's "technology", this is a significantly different experience than SoC, while feeling familiar and comfortable to SoC players.  Though I liked it more than SoC, it seemed even easier for the leader to shoot ahead unstoppably.  (Fortunately, I was the leader ;^)

After 1 Play: Only play was cut short.  Seemed enjoyable enough, but I doubt I'd ever pick it over vanilla Catan, so what's the point?

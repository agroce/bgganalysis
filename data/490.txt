I recently got the Warangel 10 Years Edition box and the 2nd Generation. I
like Warangel, and also all gamers I use to play with like the game.
I found it a good mix between a light wargame and a fantasy game; it will be very interesting to experiment new tactics time by time, basing on the
different races used on battlefield.
Sure replayability is one of its bonus. My compliments to Angelo Porazzi.

Crap... don't play it

RATING: 10
It' one of the best games i ever tried.
Even if special abilities tend to repeat themselves among different races, each race has a unique combination of them. 90 races (in the Italian version) really means 90 different approaches to the game.And you must play it more than once with the same race to really appreciate that race's potential.
The game can be a little slow sometimes. Namely at the beginning of each game, when each player is usually afraid to attack for fear of exposing his own fortresses to retaliation. And the game gets even slower when you play it with more than 2 players. Anyway i don't consider it a fault of the game (i like long, thoughtful games).
The same 90 races can also be used with "Warbeast", another game by the same author (although i don't know if this latter game's rules have been already translated into english).
Overall a great game.

I liked this game very much. Plays quick and the different races have each their own "secrets" to play them well.Played a game of Undead (me) vs. Insects (friend), and although the Undead won it was more due to a lucky attack on a castle at the right moment. My forces were getting decimated.Overall its a good light wargame. Playable in under 1.5 hours. With lots of races and strategies to pick from.It will not see very much action with my playing group because they are not really fond of war games. I made a Cyberboard game box and I am looking to play by e-mail.

RATING: 8
It's a great game - and the worldwide success is the best witness to it; sure it won't be very complex - but who ever said that the more complex things are the better? Moreover, this game has the excellent merit of not hiding itself behind high-sounding names or very famous brands. Even if it was born from an easy idea without too much fuss, it reached an incredible and well deserved success - solid rules, open to many variants, easy to learn and easy to play. That's the way games should be.

As usual I have to make a judgement after just one play (because of very low play possibility), but Warangel is actually a game that "keeps". If not enough, Angelo Porazzi is really a great person, able to transmit his enthusiasm to everybody.
Coming back to Warangel, I founded it simple to start but, after that, I realized that you pay dear all the set up mistakes and that you have to learn very well what your race can do and what can do your opponent race, in order to use at the best that knowledge... Then you start asking yourself: what about playing in 3 or 4? And then you suddenly realize that this is a "mutant" game, with so many variables (think just at the available races) that, if you just want, can let this game re-playable to infinity. Now I am obliged to limit myself to an 8, until I will be able to justify an even better vote (that I am convinced Warangel deserves).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great game in which the balance of strategy and tactics are mixed wonderfully. The strategy is in the the placing which is different for every game and the tactics change from every games dued to the race that you are using and your opponent.

RATING: 6
I'll admit I had a blast playing this game once, and I am tempted to try it again with 2 other armies but...
- the components are not top notch unless you invest in the wood blocks
- the english rules are terrible to the extent that they are comedic
- the design elements lack elegance, clarity (garrisons are hidden/revealed, tracking moved units, tracking conquered fortresses, too many terrain types)
-  my first game was a 2.5 hr slugfest where the richness of decisions dwindled turn by turn

So while I enjoyed my game, I'm not sure I'd really want to play it again. In the end, it's likely more a matter of game style than game quality. It just doesn't match my tastes. For the same type of game, I'd likely prefer to play Heroscape.

Light wargame, simple to learn but very deep and engaging to master. 
Beautiful illustrations and maps and, if it's not enough, it has 120 different races to play with! 
Yes, 120 races, everyone with its own strategy and traits. 
Don't need to study a 5038721904 pages rulebook, don't need to spend 30billions in miniatures or to prepare dioramas... everything it's already here. 
And did I already mention the 120 different races? :)

RATING: 10
I started playing Warangel in 1997, attracted by the image on the cover: those two humanoids (an insect and an eagle) fighting while the Earth was torn by atomic conflagrations are still in my mind! Then I realized that Warangel was not just a game, because it really was an epic saga, a world where history took another way. Now, I am 26, I’m an international policy analyst and in Warangel I find some similarities with the dynamics of the contemporary world, with characters that highlight the particularities of specific geographic and cultural areas. To play a match, you’ll need to develop a large strategic view: it is not easy to win a well-done Warangel game, because you have to consider a large and complex scenario with many variables and checkers with a peculiar behavior. However, its rules are simple, sometimes automatic, and the variety of races available offers a wide choice. Each character has a well-defined design, with meticulous attention to details, so you could say a game starts right observing the references hidden in checkers images. And, obviously, don’t forget the designer and illustrator, Angelo Porazzi, who is first of all a great person, always helpful, generous and friendly. Send him an email or call him: Angelo will be available immediately! In few words: Warangel is much more than a game – it’s a life experience!

the one with more abilities, the most numerous, the most fun.
Good for 2 players but also for more gamers in a single battle.
Author gives an excellent and friendly customer care.

Solid light-wargame. The fantasy setting is intriguing and well developed, and the various races are fun to control and quite balanced (at least, for what is related to the first twenty races plus the ones from Warbeast). Very deep gameplay for two players, while it needs some adaptation for multi-player battles. Materials are a little disappointing (it is a self-produced game, indeed) but with some handcraft you can simply go around the problems. Raise the rating by a good 1 point if you mount the army tokens on wooden blocks AND if you own at least 4-5 more maps. High replayability.

RATING: 10
Warangel is not my kind of game: played some times, seen played many times, seen the reviews and comments, from biggest and reknown reviewers to simple passionates.
Arguments are almost the same: great artwork, simple rules, veriety of races and the high replayability.
I am enthusiast of other games designed by Porazzi. 
But.
The story of this game is in the great capacity of aggregation and creation of pure luding time.
Usaually games have a top time and then a fall.
Warangel is impressive because since its first publication, it is always at its top time! It is known by at least two, three generations of players.
Since 1996 first pubblication, up today, it always grooved, without stops.
Stepo by step it built solid rocks for a bigger reality: Area Autoproduzione (at the beginning started only with Porazzi, now there are more than 60 authors in over than 30 events), with their games in pubs, ludoteques, presentations in schools.
Through this game a large group of gamers meet and knew each other, creating their games and playing their games with public.
To see boys and girls 12 years old matching "boys" 46 years old, and see they have the same luding intensity and enjoy a lot, is pure fun for passionates.
Spectators are fans, comment the moves and tactics, partecipate: it is awesome.
Winner of 4 awards in 4 different luding cons, played along 12 National Tournaments, materials approved by majors (Hobby&Work, Pigna used the drawings for a school line, Hasbro for a Card Game, Spielamaterial furnishes the wooden bases...)
To know that you can "create your Warangel" choosing your favourite maps and races, is another great point for this game.
Excellent customer care, disponibility for interested gamers is outstanding.

The first aspect that I liked wile palying my first match has been the "literary" dimension of clash on the board. 
Actually the large range of races (whit their own particular differences)
and a fight system next to role playing, allows fun identification whit the race.
Every race-army is provided for a specific territory, each different in morphology but always whit 10 dimensional holes that allow you to carry
units into the enemy territory. 
By the way, it's important to think out 	about positions of the dimensional holes that allow to do challenges whit 3, 4 or more players at same time. In this case the game get also a interesting diplomatic trait.

A PIECE OF CRAP

This italian game is seldom played to italian convention except by his author and here is why:
Components are crude at best, different races are nice but the rules are awful, and you have to actually "cut" the bloody thing. To make things interesting you gotta get A LOT of maps. With the wooden pieces it's really nice to see, but the author advice YOU to trim the pieces and glue them to the wooden pieces.
If you are looking for a good fantasy wargame go for Wizard Kings (Columbia Games). 
I took the game out of the shelf in order to play it with some friends after a bit of a discussion with the game designer and I changed the vote from 3 to 2 and then to 1. This game is really horrible.
I was really happy to sell it to someone from Oz, for the same price I paid it.

Really simply to learn but so well designed it allows to play unique battles every time.  It is one of the rare games that lives of a development shared among designer and gamers: it shows it has been improved through the years like a good old wine.

I had the privilege to play with the author, that immersed me in this spectacular fantasy world... In front of me there were no more simple players but two well different races, that wanted to stay alive and WIN the battle!
Once understood the game's mechanics, you would be allowed to spend an hour of pure fun with your friends.
Really a great game; strategic and deep!

Conobbi per la prima volta questo gioco proprio nel 1996, quando le razze della 1^ generazione uscivano in edicola e per puro caso decisi di unirmi ad un gruppo di amici che vedevo fissare questi tabelloni con sopra un mucchio di pedine, perlomeno questa era la mia idea del gioco quando mi aggiravo sugli otto anni. Effettivamente non posso dire di aver preso con serietà il gioco a quell'epoca, dopotutto si era costretti a giocare per terra e non appena il gatto eseguiva uno dei suoi blitz, la partita andava immediatamente a monte, in parte anche a causa delle pedine troppo leggere, lo stesso per gli scudi destino.Da quel momento non riuscì a saperne più nulla di WarAngel, almeno fino a quest'anno, arrivando a trovare un sito di distribuzione del gioco, quello di Angelo Porazzi. Incuriosito, mi sono messo a leggere il link che porta alla sezione "Crea il Tuo WarAngel" e da lì capii quante modifiche sono state apportate al confronto dei primi anni. Prima di tutto le basi in legno alle quali sono saldamente incollate le nuove pedine, plastificate, finalmente una buona trovata per fare in modo che dopo poche partite non si consumasse la stragrande maggioranza dei guerrieri, nonché gli scudi destino stessi, poi un nuovo regolamento maggiormente dettagliato ed esplicativo, il portamappe ed infine un buon numero di buste plastificate per potervi conservare le schede delle razze. Insomma, avendo intuito che sarebbe stato ben più giocabile, mi sono deciso a fare un'ordinazione ed una volta ricevuto il tutto, ho potuto constatare di aver fatto una scelta corretta. Tutt'ora ho effettuato una nuova richiesta per altre razze, in quanto come fantasy wargame mi ispira parecchio, per il numero praticamente infinito di strategie che si possono mettere a punto per ogni razza, oltre alla grafica devo dire soddisfacente riportata non solo sulle pedine, bensì anche sopra le schede, con tanto di spiegazioni esaurienti delle abilità fisiche e mentali dei guerrieri. Sono un dilettante alle prime armi con questa tipologia di giochi. 
L'unico "contro" di WarAngel, se così lo si può definire, posso dire che sia il prezzo, comprensibilmente non alla portata di tutti considerando i tempi in cui si sta vivendo, ma d'altra parte per partecipare ad un torneo basta avere lo stretto indispensabile e 4 razze, poi si è a posto, quindi una piccola spesa per la vita ed a favore del divertimento, nessuno obbliga un giocatore ad acquistarle tutte e subito.

In conclusione, come voto assegno 9 e non 10 solamente perchè la perfezione non esiste in nessun gioco né tanto meno nelle persone, me compreso :) 

PS: Chiedo venia per aver brevemente esposto il commento in una lingua differente da quella originale del sito, ma reputo sia meglio attenersi ad una descrizione fuori dalle righe anzichè una esposta come di consuetudine ma malamente

So, bye to all!

RATING: 9.5
Oh wowzers.  I finally own my own set with 8 races!! Just got back to the States a few hours ago.  It was a complete highlight of my trip meeting Angelo, and putting together my first Warangel set.  My friend Mat and I had been trying to do that for years, but we were never sure how to completely do it.  He made it so easy.  And now it will always be easy to get more races and maps.

Angelo's art is brilliant.  Any lover of fantasy war genre MUST MUST MUST get this.  Complete classic.  

When you consider all the races and work put into this game, it immediately becomes addictive.  You can never settle for just a couple.  Each race has a great personality.

Update:  This went up.  There is no greater fantasy artist in gaming today than Angelo.  It would be hard to convince me otherwise.  Looking at every race and action shot is mind blowing.  His style is pure, driven by the world he's created.  Akin to early D&D work like D.A.T.  and others, when they were making a world BY HAND.  Angelo's Warangel is a world.

And this game is not just brilliant because of artwork.  When I play the game with a new race, it is such a joy to discover the special abilities my race can do.  As a designer, Angelo has crafted each race so their abilities really do build their character.  It's gaming magic.  The Ghosts have characteristics the FEEL like ghosts, the Flying Smokers of the Impossible play like they're real, and Warangel has 110 or more of these races.

You will want all of them.

RATING: 9
In my opium this is by now the best game from Mr. Porazzi.
Normally if you will play these kind of strategy games you must read a lot of rules and need at least 4 or more players to play it right.
But Warangel can you play with every number of players 2 to 6 will no problem.
Because each player has it's own game map. 
And for each player there is a perfect race to choose from Abyssals to Vampires 100 different races in total.
And the rules are no heavy weight quick to read and easy to understood.
On the playing field you have to made a lot of decisions which you pieces where to attack, where to place, what to defend and so on.
The gaming mechanics you will quick discover are very fine and because each race has it's own strength and weakness every game is different.
This game is a must have for all who love strategy games like that.

And the designer suggest that u buy wooden blocks that comes in one color..paint every block in two color with the colors of the chosen race, trim the card conters to fit the blocks, glue each counter to each block?
Well thats 50 blocks x race, there are 100 races so ive to trim, color, glue and paint 5000 wooden pieces?!?!
Well i think its better to buy wizard Kings that has "only" ten races but everyting is done for you!
And u will have alot more free time to play game instead of building them ;-)

One of the good things of this game is the fact that even "occasional players" may try it and enjoy it with no problems
Molto semplice e valido. Ha una marea di espansioni con razze diverse e questo lo rende longevo ma relativamente costoso nel caso si volessero acquistare tutte le razze. Le cartine personalizzate aggiungono giocabilità.
Recentemente l'autore permette anche di acquistare le razze singole e questo aiuta nel caso si volesse giocare una specifica razza senza comprarsi tutta l'espansione.

I've not played it yet, so I'm not giving a rate, but I read the rules well and I'm eager to try it. I am already in the position to say that it has a deep and involving theme, very good artwork, rules very simple for a wargame but strong depth and variety. I think the gaming experience can be compared to Duel of Ages (even if it is a quite different game, being a true wargame), which I like very much.

It's a fantasy wargame, very easy to learn but hard to master. It offers unbelievable variety with its 90+ different races and territories. No game is like the previous one, its replay value is very high and it's pretty fast to play for a wargame. 
In the end this is perfect (and suggested) both for the uninitiated and the veteran, it plays well at many different complexity levels.

Warangel is a wonderful, light and exciting fantasy war game with a hundred different races, each with it's own home board. As each race has it's unique strengths and weaknesses, the strategy lies in being able to utilise these to the player's best advantage. The boards and counters, which may be bought individually, are beautifully illustrated by Angelo Porazzi, the game's dsigner. This game should appeal to all fantasy fans and especially to those gamers who enjoy good strategy games.

Good wargame with very nice illustrations. An incredible variety of war races, well balanced, though it's impossible to test all the race x vs race y combinations.

Very good rules: easy enough to remember and apply, but not trivial strategy.

My comment is related to the Create Your Warangel edition. When I bought it I customized it: I chose my preferred maps and warrior races, and received them ready to use, mounted on wooden counters.

Only downside: high price for so little pawns and maps. But it's unavoidable for the low volumes of self-productions. This is partially balanced by the huge customization chances, as you buy the races and maps you like.

Ok, I played this just once, but I got instantly hooked by its simple but yet greatly various gameplay.
Many races, each one really, REALLY unique, and one map per race makes for almost ∞ possibilities.
I met the creator, illustrator and publisher of the game, Angelo Porazzi, who explained me the gameplay and ideas of WarAngel: I must say that he is the MOST enthusiastic person I've ever met, he just loves his games and even more the gamers. He wants to meet people, make them enjoy gaming and become a great gaming community.
WarAngel is awesome, Angelo is a great guy, I can't wait to play the game again, you should really check it out, at least if you go to ESSEN. Yes, he will be there :3

9 is a BIG number, but for now it reflects my thoughts: "Excellent game. Always want to play it."

EDIT 14/11/2009: now it's 8.8 because I yet have to play it with someone that isn't a newbie! To burn, a fire needs some fuel now and then. Looking forward the Ludica 2011 tournament :3

Warangel is a good wargame, which isn't too hard to learn. The different races, which can be bought seperately makes to game interesting for a long time. If you run into the author, a very friendly guy, he's always delighted to get you an introduction into the game.

While there are some clever ideas in the design of this game, my copy will probably not see much play. It is not really the game's fault. Indeed, I might rate the game as high as 7.5 if the materials were more pleasant and user-friendly.

Poor materials. The races are really unbalanced and i HATE the "destiny shield" damage system. Anyway, high longevity and a cool illustrations of the summary cards raise my valutation. To play in a decent way you need 50€ of wooden pieces (not included) and the boards for all races (not included).

How to comment Warangel? :-) Nice! First of all, all the people I showed it and then played it with just fell in love. After our little own mini-con (dubbed ArmoniCon, from our club's name, Armonia) during wich Angelo Porazzi, the author and our guest for the event, introduced us to the game, my son (8 years old) started filling the house with his drawings of the Saurians battling the Ghosts and/or the other races... and, of course, asking to play :-) There are a number of races (I believe > 100), each with its own pros and cons, which helps keeping the game fresh even after some time and it's a nice thing the author also sells them individually, without forcing some pre-made box down your throat, both in a ready-to-play form (with the warriors already mounted on painted wooden bases) and in a plain-old-paper way, along with each races' map and the other paraphernalia. Has a DIY taste, bought quite a lot of 'em myself :-)

RATING: 9.5
The rules are pretty simple, even a small child will be able to learn the game in just ten minutes.
But be careful, simplicity of rules does not mean lack of depth.
There are a number of things to be planned to master the game and a lot of strategy decisions to be made to let your race prevail.
You have to choose careful the displacements of your troops on the board and do it fast, because the first to place is the first to start.
On the other side a displacement can cost you the match.
You can bluff because you can displace your most important pieces, "the fortress" in such a way that the opponent can be fooled.
The combat system involve a bit of luck but you can mitigate it by using several tactics like attack groups and using at the right moment the special powers of your troops.
The setting is brilliant: the author has fullfilled our own world with a number of fantastic creatures which are drawn by him in an unique style.
There are more than 100 races up to now (actually 120!) each with its own strenghts and weakness.
And here comes the most valuable part of the entire game: balance. Every single race has passed hours and hours of playtesting, (some race has been out for 14 years!) and you can be sure that no race is better than the other. As if the combination of possible battle scenarios were not enough, each race has its own map that represent a part of our world and that is used as the board for the game itself.
That's another part of the game I really like: the replayability and the variety of choice that force you to think about different strategies to overcome different situations.
An important thing to mention is related to the fact that Warangel it's not just a game,it's more a great community.
The game itself could have not been like this without the huge work of its creator.
The author, Angelo Porazzi, is capable to keep in touch with the large playerbase of his game and like no one in the boardgames market take into consideration every suggestion made by the players to polish the game over and over.
He arranges tournaments year after year (14 years has been passed and the game it's still on the edge), he puts passion in its work, it's not about money (with the "Crea il TUO Warangel" you can just choose every single component of the game to be bought,you are not forced to buy what you don't want),it's about entertainment and fun in the old way,with a simple, but unique, boardgame.

RATING: N/A
Rules text too small, 2 races per page in tiny print, poor abbreviations - "wrs." is "warriors"? Huh? Information on the units is apparently a closely guarded secret.
 
[UPDATE 23-Jan-2006] Angelo is helping me get a soft copy of race stats! With proper play aids I hope to convince others to play.

[UPDATE 11-May-2006] Angelo lost touch, finally got back to me. 5 month wait has cooled the ardor for this (owned a year now). Must research the rules for the stats, since the soft copy stats are mis-edited and don't match the actual game stats. Lot of time spent, no pay off at all.

[10 YEAR EDITION JULY 2006] Unfortunately I cannot afford a new version, nor shipping from Italy. Even though I assisted in translations for the official website.

[UPDATE 8-Jan-2007] Spent too much time on this without playing. Its window of opportunity has closed.

WarAngel gives me some kind of emotions i can't get from other strategy wargames.
This new world is composed by 120 races all well balanced, even the most developed ones, and all looking for primary resources to survive. The background is gorgeous and well describes this possibly future. All warriors are extremely credible: their abilities respect both the original skills and the new acquired specialities.
The maps, representing real world's locations, are incredibly detailed and make you feel like a fantasy time traveller in this new geography.
Finally, using the service "Create your Warangel", you can customise your own game.
I love it

Excellent mix between a strategy game and a chaotic feeling of adrenalinic energy, similar to a race with a competitor that, at the end of the day, will drink a glass of whine with you! .) A lot of races, great mix of abilities, every single match is different :)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I own the 10 Years Edition of "Warangel," a fun, self-produced fantasy battle game that features gorgeous artwork on maps plus fun illustrations on chits representing scores of armies that populate these worlds. 

Your army starts with 10 points--the total value of 7 fortresses--and you must get 12 points to win. That doesn't sound that hard, but your Victory Point total reflects the number of fortresses you hold at the END of your turn. There are five 1-pt. forts, one worth 2 points, and one worth 3. 

Set-up is done using a screen, so you've no way of knowing where your opponent places his fortresses or warriors. Also, one warrior goes under each fortress as its "Garrison," which gives it additional attack and defense ratings. So one has to choose carefully how powerful a warrior he wants to Garrison his fort, as you only get so many warriors of a particular overall ability. So, you can lose one of your own fortresses on your opponent's turn, but come right back and reconquer your fortress or conquer one of his to get back Victory Points. Thus, 12 points isn't that easy to get. 

Each army has its own main warrior, which naturally has the most powers, so protecting one's leader is crucial in battles, which are decided based on flipping the numbers of chits matching attack/defense strengths of warriors involved in a given battle. One side of each such chit has a symbol indicated either a hit or a miss. Some don't like this 'chit' approach, presumably preferring the use of dice and perhaps a Combat Results Table. But personally, I'm okay with it.

Each army has different strengths and weaknesses, including special powers. Suffice to say there's a lot to learn to become good at this game, and with the variety of armies and maps available, replay is just about unlimited. Over time I've bought more maps as well as wooden blocks to mount counters on, because the different coloured wood blocks make it easier to distinguish sides. 

I rewrote the basic rules into 6 single-sided pages for my own understanding, checking with Mr. Porazzi on some points (revised, July 2013). 

The artwork and overall creativity and time and play-testing that must have gone into this game is jaw-dropping. The maps are gorgeous. For me this is one of those games that suits me well. I like the variety of races and maps, which are beautifully illustrated. 

Over time I've come to rate the game a 10 because I've played it to the point at which I feel like I can fully engage my imagination with how the game plays and what it depicts--and to me, it doesn't get any better than that. It's simply a lot of fun to play. It's not only a keeper; it's in the very top rank of my game collection. 

My son, who turned 14 in 2013, rated this game an "8" when he was 10, but moved his rating up to "'9' or 9 1/2'" and well he should, as he's really good at it. And even though he's a typical teen who leans toward video games, he'll play this on occasion. I think, with an adult teaching them, kids from ages 9-12 can learn this game without much difficulty.

Warangel is my favorite game.
Is a great game of war and peace.
It is original graphically (Porazzi is also illustrator of the game, Very great artist!)  and it has an amazing impact for anyone sit down for play a game!
Perfect for experienced players and also for beginners.
 You can play with his grandchildren or with grandparents, Warangel knows no age limits!
In short: Warangel is a great game and Porazzi is a great author, one of the best.

The best for a home made game.

I like much the perfect raport between simple rules, depth and implication. And I love the game design...
The interesting feature of this game is that it is never obvious: just because, for example, a race is very aggressive, it is said that the attack will be sent in advance, much depends on the maps in the game, to which race plays the 'and especially as the opponent plays.
Knowing also the long time typical of wargame, consider a further advantage the fact that a game 1vs1 ends quietly in one hour.
A praise especially for the artwork behind it: beautiful drawings of the breeds and their maps (all strictly by hand) and, personally, I find as a reference point for those who want to engage in such work.

Got it from the author right away after he made the "warangel 2000" edition... I went to his place to get a copy with several extra maps :)

As far as components go, it's amazing how far this self-produced game went over the following years ... the new counters are simply outstanding. 

About the system, the game is very old-school, and proud of it. It may not be everyone's cup of tea (for example, in general I don't like games that adopt this scale - with single units roaming all over whole continents every turn), but it sure is fun, it works and is endlessly customizable.

I never played the first edition, but was very intrigued by the reworked version. It sounded good and even played well for the first 1/2 of the game. Then it was you kill, I kill for the rest of the game. Not terribly fun - more a see-saw experience and too predictable. Also, worried about essential elimination of a player, but not literal elimination - i.e. you can't take a player out, but you can make them of no consequence. King-making can happen here too. If the game got off the table 25% faster, it would be better for it. As it is, it's only ok.

Juego de comerciar, invertir para mejorar, y sobretodo de combatir para defender tus barcos y ciudades, o sólo por debilitar al contrincante xD, muchísimo puteo asegurado, sobretodo una vez arrancas el juego. Muy bonito, curiosas y actuales mecánicas, a pesar de ser una re-implementación del juego del 1996. A espera de probarlo más a diferentes jugadores, pero es un juego muy bien hecho, original y viciante :D  Probado a 2 jugadores, y no desmerece, una lucha constante contra el rival :D

This was a fun time, playing the game.  Felt a little like [b]Antike[/b] to me.  Lots of different paths to victory.  Not too many rules.  The ship/play order wheel was fantastic!  So was the variable length.  I hope it isn't too long before getting this to the table again.

2012 re-make. Pro: In the 1996 edition you had to do bargaining to purchase goods from a port owned by another player; this has been replaced with a simple purchase (1 ducat) mechanic.  Con: bad reviews related to combat (see below).

Others say: combat is just wild and swingy. You have to fight, because the board starts to get crowded and it's the best (or only) way to score near the endgame--so the game degenerates into a whackfest where nothing is certain and the dice can easily hose you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played at FLGS out of curiosity about the remake. It reminds one of the original but there have been quite a number of subtle, as well as some not so subtle, changes. However, not enough to make it totally unrecognizable; and, as you near the end, you realize that it still follows the dynamic of the old game: explore, buy and sell goods in order to fill up your home port's warehouse along with a few foreign ones (which you then try to take over), while attacking your neighbors ships and other possessions as targets of opportunity present themselves.

The changes alter the details of all this but the general pattern is still pretty much the same. It has a few extra bits of chrome that regulate the game-turn track, the player turn order, combat and how extra bonuses are gained. There is nothing terribly wrong with either version. I'm not sure the new edition is that much better that I would buy it if I already owned the original. You might consider the newer edition if you've never encountered the older game, and you've had a chance to try the new and liked it. I've played the previous version and never got around to buying it and, at this point, I think I'll pass on the new one too...

Haven't played the first edition so I can't compare, but this is a great mixture of pickup/delivery and fighting on the high seas. Games generally start off very peaceful where everyone does some goods trading and occupies a few empty ports. However, sooner or later someone will attack and take over a poorly-defended port, and it all kicks off from there.

Having said that, attacking recklessly in this game won't get you anywhere. You need to choose your battles carefully and take advantage of any holes in other players defenses. Generally speaking, the shrewdest equal-oppurtunity jerk will be the victor, and the game's all the better for it :)

Finally played it at least. Bought the first version and for some reason it sat on the shelf for years unplayed. Sold it when I heard a second edition was coming out. Bought that and it also sat on the shelf for (not as many) years, unplayed. But the specific motivation for playing it last night was someone who wanted to play a game I hadn't played before. And it felt pretty much like what I would expect from a game with this age. 

It's sort of a pick up and deliver game. With combat. 

The rulebook is horribly written and/or translated. Extremely frustrating for a game that is actually pretty simple. I'd play it again if someone wanted to, but it's going to the sell pile.

I got this and then watched the Dice Tower review and immediately regretted buying it. 

Finally, a year later I got it on the table.

Why in the world do I still watch DT reviews? They are so freakin jaded! 

Serenissima is a fantastic 'pick up and deliver' with simple combat that moves really quickly no matter the player count. The rondel is brilliant and the mandatory order of load, move, sell/attack forces you to get really creative in the way you daisy-chain your turns and shuffle your resources. 

Most importantly it's really, really fun.

*Tentative initial rating of 8 based on one 2p session. This could easily go up with more plays/players.

*Yep, it's even better with more players. Now a 9.

*Combat system needs a tweak. I like rolling dice for three times CV then dividing by 3 to push it toward the mean. Better still would be borrowing Cyclades combat system.

If not the theme, I would say it's just an euro game. However due to fact, that there are very nice galleys and randomness (given by the dice) - i can live with that :)
Very pleasant game, where rules are the set of exceptions. Unfortunately, in the last rounds, where the ports are loaded with goods - passive game begins. Everybody prefers to guard their harbors with the ships rather than attacking the opponent.

RATING: 7
Physically beautiful game with interesting strategy decisions.  Tension and balances abound:  should I take immediate income for trade goods or take control of the city for long-term income?  Should I use my turn for trade, military action or to invests in galleys, troops and fortifications?  Should I build a basilica?  Is it more profitable to trade for spice or to attack and capture a spice-producing city?  If I attack, should I risk battle with exhausted rowers, or wait until next turn so as to fight when fresh?

Transporting sailors and goods with little plastic galleys adds extra fun.

RATING: 3
The early development of the game is pretty cool: The limitations put upon the capabilities of each port based upon the goods given to it make for a pretty great open decision space. Unfortunately, based upon the random length of the game, it is quite possible for the game to boil down to a random dice-fest at the end through combat when expansion is no longer possible. The unfortunate combat and especially how easily the game can come down to brainless dice rolling is very much a sign of the age of the design. Regardless, the possibility of combat is necessary as it forces players to shore up defenses at each port and pay attention to the goods they're carrying, but it doesn't make the combat any less frustrating.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2015)

I have played both Serenissima´s game editions but I don’t remember the changes between the editions. I played the first edition a long time ago :/.

Serenissima (second edition) has fairly simple rules, you can explain them under 20 minutes. The game components are from good to very good. I especially like the galleys, they look gorgeous on the board.
The game features interesting decisions (what to build, where to move, what goods to load, where to move, how many sailors to load, how many defenders to leave, which structure to build) and knowing when to do it is very important too. Besides you spent a lot of money when you build/recruit, but money is also the VPs so knowing how much to spend is another facet of the game I enjoy. Serenissima also features a high interaction between players, you can buy goods, trade in ports or fight with other players, sadly this con revert into “attacking the current leader” and I don’t enjoy this kind of game situation anymore, however you don’t need to fight if you don´t want to, but you do need to defend your cities or you will lose.

The theme isn’t exciting for me, but I don’t dislike it either.

I like that you don’t know when you will score or when the game will end. This is managed by a random deck. I’m not bothered by the luck of the deck. There is more luck in combat (a single sailor managed to kill 4 of my opponent´s) but you can also manage it (increasing the number of sailors or decreasing the number of spaces you move) so in general the luck of the game can be mitigated.

It is also interesting how the player order mechanism works. You can plan a lot around this.

Bottom line, I think Serenissima (second edition) can be a solid design for some people. Games in which 2 or more players gang up on the current leader aren’t among my preferred games (they were before, but not anymore) so my desire to play the game again is rather low. I already sold my copy of the game but I won’t oppose too strongly if someone requested a game.

RATING: 7
Based on first 2p game - very positive! I just love when warfare and economics meet. But I lost badly. Must be very careful about when to do battle - it's very easy to lose your expensive fleet. Feels like you have a razor sharp blade and no armor. Really want to try it again and undo my mistakes from the first game.

There are some negatives as well from being a grail game. For example having these meta rules to prevent player elimination, which one could easily exploit. I also wished there were more actual trading between players. With 2p game, It seemed pointless to deliver goods to opponent's port (unless it was clear goal to conquer it later). Another thing I missed was ability to retreat from battle.
---

After another 2player game, I no longer play it with 2. It  basically does not work with 2. It comes down to how dice roll when trying to control a key sector.

Wonderful pick up and deliver game with combat.

A little unbalanced in 2-player. If one player gets ahead, they can stomp down the other player with combat.

In 3+ players, combat has a "lowering tide lowers all ships" feature. Meaning, fighting only hurts the players involved. Others are free to keep trading and advancing their position. This is good if the 1st place player attacks (letting the others catch up), but bad if they don't because one player will have to pick a fight with the 1st place player (hurting their path to victory).

I was a little hesitant about this game after reading some of the reviews/comments left by other users on here, but my friends and I played this tonight for the first time and LOVED IT! I lost, and quite badly too, but I know what to do differently next time! This game reminds me somewhat of Merchants & Marauders, but with a much more "Euro game" feel. I love the combined mechanics of pick-up-and-deliver and area control with the option to attack and steal valuable territory or block other players from moving/selling goods! It is true that there is an element of luck involved (rolling the dice to determine the outcome of battles), but it's not enough to make the game unbalanced. You can avoid battles if you really want to, but fortune favours the bold, and those who take the risk are often rewarded for it! Another thing I like about this game is that you cannot be completely killed off, so there's always the chance to make a comeback and steal control of the game. Initially I thought the game would go by very quickly, based on the limited number of spaces the tracker moves after each turn. It actually took much longer! Our four-player game lasted 3 hours! Of course, it will probably progress more quickly now that we know what we're doing. If you like games such as "El Grande" or "Belfort", "Railways of the World" and "Merchants & Marauders", I think you'll LOVE this game. Can't wait to play again on Sunday!

It works and is not a bad game, but it lacks a little bit of energy and excitement. It ends up being a much drier experience than it should be, mechanically, and while it does some things differently to other games they're not special enough to demand returning to.

So, ok but dull.

I have also been interested in giving Serenissima a try ever since seeing the first edition when I walked into my first true hobby game store back in 2000. The ships, the map, the cubes, they all looked interesting and I wanted to see what was going on in that box. Unfortunately I never did pick it up, or get a chance to play it. Luckily with the new 2nd edition more copies are now floating around and I can happily report to you dear reader that I have finally had that chance to play Serenissima, and it was worth the wait. At its heart Serenissima is a pick up and deliver game, with some minor combat thrown in for good measure. There are about 5 types of goods that your are looking to deliver to ports that protest that type of good (each port produces one type of good). Certain goods are useful for other things (like earning more money when delivered, allowing you built forts, etc). Combat is resolved in a pretty straight forward manner with rolling dice equal to your available crew. The design is nice and tight on this one and I must say it was one of the most enjoyable pick up and deliver games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. The new edition looks beautiful, and the components are all top notch. The graphic design is easy to understand and straight forward. I had a blast playing this one and can't wait to give it another shot soon.

It's a great-looking game with easy rules. Sailing your fleet of galleys over the Mediterranean is lots of fun, but battles are often decided by lucky dice rolls.

I recommend this game to anyone who likes trading / sailing themed board games. If you don't mind needing a bit of luck now and then, you'll love this.

All in all, it's a very nice game that doesn't take terribly long to complete. It also doesn't have the wow-factor that greater games have, so I rate it a 7.5

It highlights the problems I have with direct conflict (from Risk to El Grande). Kingmaking; under-the-radar as the percentage strategy. Turn order by boat number was pretty cool, and the decision-making in terms of troops & resource allocations was engaging (although I prefer Sail to India's streamlined take). Still, there's something off about how easy it is to claim a neutral territory. No naval battle necessary? (Did we miss a rule?)

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

Pick-up and deliver game with combat and a few additional minor features.

-> Simple rules that make room for a wider public.
-> Some of the mechanisms are brilliant (5 cargo spaces, you can fill them with sailors; sailors dictate speed and combat power; the numbered boats that define the order of play).
-> The combat is too simplistic (just roll 1 dice for each sailor: 50% 1 kill, 50% do nothing).
-> Too long 2+ hours.

Conclusion: it can be a nice game to play once in a while, but not a keeper you'll find yourself willing to play frequently.

規則:
*主圖板放置，照人數放白色指示物到對應軌，洗勻五張公爵卡放右上，黑色指示物放左上轉輪，一開始決定金錢是要蓋著還開著，2-3人時起使用封閉卡封閉木酒石大理石城是各一座共4座
*根據人數2/3/4人拿 30/26/22個水手圓柱及5元，隨機起始照順位挑起始港口(拿對應卡片)跟船(2-3人不使用13~15的船)，上面各方三個水手，之後反順位在挑一次船放在起始港口旁，也是放三個水手(選擇戰船後把自己顏色方塊放到左上轉輪的對應數字旁)，兩人時輪流挑直到有三艘，上面都三個人
*遊戲進行數輪(5~11)，黑色指示物移動一格代表該船擁有者行動，一圈代表一輪，行動有兩個選擇
A 行動 有三個步驟可跳過但要照順序
>裝載 該船從當前港口上該港口產的貨，可跟同位置自己船交換水手或自己的港口換，每個方塊1元(別人的要給他錢)，自己的港少1元，船上限5個水手加貨，沒水手的船馬上移除，港口的水手上現等於方格數目，同港口的船可自由調度水手跟貨物
>移動同等水手數目的步數，如果經過其他人的船且水手總數輸，其他人可以擋住你(第一步不能擋)
>販賣或戰鬥 
1.賣貨到不產該貨且目前沒有該貨的港口，不能重複，放到最小數字上，如果不是自己港口拿對應金額(紫色額外兩元)，販賣一樣可以封鎖同移動阻擋，被封鎖的可選擇戰鬥
2.戰鬥 選一艘船打，進攻方直水手數減移動數骰，防守方擲水手數骰，每個骷髏面移除對方一個水手，每次攻擊前攻擊方可宣告停止戰鬥，之後戰鬥擲看水手數但是不能比第一次高，有人沒水手也結束，勝利者可搶貨物到船上(有空位的話)，戰鬥可持續與多艘戰鬥，打港口沒人的就放人佔領拿卡(除非被阻擋)，有人的要先清掉該區該玩家的船才能打港口，有堡壘的在戰鬥前擲兩顆骰結算一次，只剩一座港的不能被打
B 投資 地點只要在自己的港口就可以，1元一個水手，在自己港口的船可以放上去，船的價格為你現在擁有船的數目，放在自己的港口，堡壘2元要在有木頭跟石頭的港口(不用丟，倉庫跟生產都算)，宮殿兩元要在有大理石跟黃金的港口
*一旦港口有酒其港口卡就翻面
*當黑色指示物轉一圈，抽最上方的公爵卡執行白色指示物移動，然後棄掉，移動後過黃色區域進入計分階段(2-3人時看紅色)，之後少於兩艘戰船的玩家可執行特殊投資(買水手跟船)
>酒 所有有酒的港口拿3元，不移動
>沙漏 幾個動幾步
>洗牌 移動後全部公爵卡重洗
*計分階段 每座港口根據倉儲狀況拿錢5~20，每個你的宮殿5元
*第三次計分後遊戲結束，錢多獲勝，平手比港口數

Very good game, with alot of different tactical options. The rules seem very complex at first, but is very intuitive once you get started.

RATING: 7.5
Based on one play: Collect goods and bring them to other locations to get money or take over the location to get cheaper goods and points. Simple at first, simply move the boat whose turn it is, but once all the ports are taken, battles become very frequent. The turn order is based on the galley you chose so timing is important.

The is the second edition of this game. While they did speed up game play it is lacking on both aspects of the game. They should have stuck with either commerce or the wargame and not try and to both with the same ships. If you have someone with very little or no board gaming experience this would be a good gateway to better games. Experienced gamers will be sorely disappointed.

Not bad. Generally speaking it was a good game and I didn't mind playing it at all. However: it felt very much like an abstract game, there was no immersion into the theme. While player turns were quick, and the game wasn't that long, I think I would have enjoyed it more if it was a little shorter.

Amazing game !!

This game is deep, confrontational, tactical and very fun !! The artwork is great and the gameplay is smooth.

It's a euro-game but with direct confrontations !! You do not have to fight if you don't want to, but it gives you this possibility which is great from a euro-game. 

I've never heard of this game before, but after a few plays, this game is a pure gem !!

The rules are not too complicated (for a euro game) and the lenght of a game is perfect (1:30 - 2:00 at most).

You win by having the most money or the one having the best economy. All the strategies are viable. You want to destroys boats and steals their goods like a pirate ? You can do that !! You want to sell and buy goods just like in Merchants & Marauders ? you can do that, you want to combine both ?! You can do that too !!

Beautiful game !!

The components, and board are great. I also like the pickup and delivery aspect as you meet the needs of the locations, they start to produce what you gave them. I wanted to like this game really badly. The issue is with the combat mechanics that don't seem well thought out.

I enjoyed the first edition of the game quite much. But the second edition really improves it. It's smoother with more details, better components and a new player order mechanism. Especially this new player order "rondel" is what I prefer in comparison to the first edition. All in all: a fantastic game for all who like trading and battling in the Mediterranean region. Hard to master ... but everytime an awesome session full of diplomacy and player interaction.

Almost 17 years after this lovely game first hit the shelves it gets a full makeover via Ystari. The 1996 version was one of the best games of its time, but suffered from some well publicised shortcomings. Some of these didn't bother me as much as others. Players could be forewarned of any imbalance or knockout likelihood. The main problem I found was the immense military buildup and subsequent waring that went on in the last turn as if there was no tomorrow, because there was no... next turn. So a few solutions took shape. Gaming groups could pick and choose a few house made rules, like assigning victory points to ships and other pieces not sitting at the bottom of the sea at game end, and the game was well worth playing as a result. Ystari has gone one better with minimal rules overheads. Add a more sensible set of components and you've got a game that I think will make it to the table more often than it's forerunner.

Among the main tweaks are a completely new turn order system. (When you buy a ship it is numbered from one to 15 and this is now the turn order of each ship.) A reduction in fighting ability when sailing long distances. Multiple victory point stages and an overhaul of the victory point values.

After the Ystari treatment it's quite a different game to play than its older sister. The core ideas are the same, but there's less downtime as individual ship movements go by quicker than sailing whole complicated fleets. There's less crazy fighting and a necessary foggy uncertainty to the game's conclusion. I know you shouldn't choose which child is your favourite, and while I still have a soft spot for the original, I prefer this well thought out 17 years more developed younger sibling a little more. (I'm allowed to - they're not my children.)

作為一款1996年遊戲的美工重製版，寧靜之城算是經典大作了，但是在國內好像玩過的人並不多，極小客也是偶然在A社看到這個遊戲，而且又無人問津，決定嘗試一下。遊戲中，玩家扮演地中海沿岸的船民，要在商人和海盜兩個角色中自由轉換；當商人時，就去不同的城市買賣物資，獲得金錢；當海盜時，就要掠奪他人的船隻和城市，獲得大量資金。遊戲推薦4個人玩，個人覺得算是2000年前的遊戲裡很有趣的一款了，重製版的美工相當棒，小船的製作也很好，在此推薦一下

Just 1 play (with 3), but I don't like how it devolves into a battle game in the second half. I do like the olde fashioned look of the map, though.

One player imposed a combat dice variant which made play way too deterministic and basically ruined the game.

Overall this is a dated design and I have no desire to play it again.

Take that strategy game, yes please. I was first very excited about this. But it has problems. I'm fine with king making, because I mostly play with people who think leader bashing is a fun mechanism. However in this game it's mostly loser making. Others can just for some reason not deliver goods to your port (other ports closer etc) and if you do that yourself the whole game, you'll lose anyway. If you attack, then they certainly won't be arsed to deliver that wine to you. It almost works, but then it doesn't. At least for us. Maybe if it was shorter, it would be fine.

Second edition is not as well known as early 90s eurogame classic (which I had never played), but fixes reported problems with original.  Very fun and subtle blend of trading with fighting in Med--abstraction of trade routes excellent.  2 players is not enough (too zero sum game), needs 3 or 4 to really be worth playing.  Focus on money vice territory makes all the more interesting.

This new version (Ystari) fixes all the problems that the original game had. The galley mechanism, the deck for turns, sailor/galley mechanisms, elevate this game to its proper place. Very focused game play, tough decisions and interactions with other players, and it takes only 2 hours. Get your copy now. If you had a copy of the original game, just go and get the new version as well.

I think I like the game that this could have been, but I don't like the game that it is.  The game is a blend of Eurogame and Ameritrash, but it gets the bad parts instead of the good parts of both genres.  It's dry like a Euro and chaotic like Ameritrash.

The most unique thing about the game is that there's a seamless, organic progression of phases throughout the game.  Players take goods to neutral ports to get some money in the early game, then start claiming neutral ports in the midgame, and finally start a free-for-all combat in the end game.  The thing is, the different phases of the game are so disjointed that they feel awkward when put next to each other.  The endgame in particular is bad.  It's likely that there are no good places left to trade by the end of the game, and so there's a degenerate feeling of "hit them because what else is there to do" about the end.  Because everybody's doing it, it tends to result in the same ports getting traded back and forth, and the winner is probably the same person it was before everybody started beating up on each other.

It's a good pick-up & deliver risk-like game with a curious snowball effect. In the last turns, almost all ports are full and the game turns into a piracy scenario where you have to attack other players in order to get the best ports in terms of points and try to defend yours. Maybe a bit long than it should, no less 90 minutes in all my plays, but it's more strategic than it seems.

Let's start with saying this could easily be a 9 but it's just a 8.5. Everything is very good about this game except one thing: the influence of luck during wars. If there was a way to adjust war to something like in Antike, Serenissima would be a magnificent game.
Rules aren't simple and, most of all, i had a hard time during all the game remembering them correctly... but they are not overly complicated, they are just not too linear.
The working of galleys is absolutely fantastic: the varying number of sailors on a galley is enough to decide if the galley will be a fast powerful warship or a slow lucrative merchant ship: pure genius. You must manage your fleet and different crews but at the same time keep an eye on the defense of your cities. If u want money now, you give possible money to your opponents... but u can get them back with a war... absolutely fantastic. 
The game flow is quite good, the game lasts maybe a bit longer than i'd like but it's ok if the game is of such quality.
Once again, i'd really like to change war mechanism and then i'd love this immensely

[EDIT]
Ok, it's a full splendid 9. How ? with an house rule of mine on the mechanism of battle. Instead of throwing one dice for each sailor, i throw 5 dice for each sailor. I count the total number of skulls and I round, up or down, to the nearest multiple of 5. Then, I divide by 5 and this is the number of hits. Example: I have a ship with 3 sailors, I move 1, my combat strength is 2. I throw 2x5 -> 10 dice. All in all I get 8 skulls. The nearer multiple of 5 is 10. 10 divided by 5 is 2, therefore I give 2 hits.

In this way, the battle system is much less prone to wild fluctuation while leaving some suspence and the game works perfectly. It's rated 9 but it could still grouw a little. fantastic!

Fantastic game with neat turn order, great resource management sprinkled with some area control, some dice rolling and a good sized helping of player interaction. It may not reinvent the wheel, but this is supposed to be a reprint of an old classic. Only issue is the game can seem to slow down a little when there are 13-15 ships on the board.

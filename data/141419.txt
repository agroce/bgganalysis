deeper than at first glance. Can get a little slow due to trying to balance moves - particularly in the second and third rounds. The game's tactics change as it gets nearer the end. beautiful design.

Similar style of game to Fairy Tale perhaps, but with more interesting scoring, simple yet beautiful art, and perhaps easier to explain. Right now this is rated higher than Fairy Tale but it will probably alternate back and forth due to the slightly awkward scoring of the rivers which breaks up an otherwise very smooth-flowing game. Maybe once I learn to explain that part better it won't be much of a problem to me.

This is a clever and interesting card game that reminds me somewhat of a simplified Glory to Rome with a bit of Biblios thrown in.  Comparing Koi Pond to these two other excellent card games, I think, indicates that I am definitely intrigued by this game, and I do want to play it again. The art is beautiful, though a bit cryptic for first timers.  At a minimum, as I see it, this game deserves a wider audience on BGG.  Card game lovers should have this on their radar.

Loved this game. Unique gameplay - I don't think there is anything I could relate it to as it is different from anything else I've played. Wasn't sure how much skill was involved and didn't have much of a strategy until the second round. Drawing face-up fish out of the central "Lake" added another layer of depth. By the end I realized just how much strategy was involved. Well worth the purchase price!

The artwork / theme makes for a gorgeous game. My one minor nitpick is the suit and value symbols on the fish - it would have been nice if they appeared on all four corners of the card instead of just two. It would make it easier to see them all at a glance.

Only played a few times. Another very pretty Daniel Solis game with some interesting ideas. I like the way the players rivers flow into the lake and the tight feel of your choices on every turn.

There's a bit of a learning curve at first: the flow of the game is odd to get a handle on. But once you get used to it, there's a lot of interesting decision points that form around it. I have to get more plays in before I solidify the rating.

Based on one play, there was a lot more depth to this than I was initially expecting. Keeping track of what cards your opponent has played that will score off of your plays makes it more than competitive solitaire.

Purchased this from the designer at the first Tilt Expo

So far, I like this game. Lots of interesting strategy and interaction (though not confrontational). Had a couple neat "a-ha!" moments during the first game as I figured out strategy.

It's also pretty simple to learn, and the card design is excellent. Want to play this some more.

Excellent card game that really does feel like nothing else out there. Despite how unique it feels, I've found non gamers (my mom for example) catch on pretty quickly because it does somehow have a classic card game feel. Pick this one up if you enjoy clever and creative card games.

A diamond in the rough. This game is one of the best set collection games I've played, easily rivaling Balloon Cup and Jaipur (though not quite as good as Battle Line for me). There's a lot of back and forth, opportunities for bluffing, long term planning, good tactical choices, interesting scoring. There's really a lot to chew on for a simple game. Very surprised this hasn't been picked up by a major publisher

Best with 3-4

A fun quick filler card game.  The animals are powerful if held until the end and can be a game-breaker.  Because of this, my rating is only a '6.'  Expansions might make the game a bit better.

Koi Pond hits so many high notes for me -- it's a brilliant game.

Not only does it look great, all classy and understated and relaxing, but under the hood is an incredibly elegant, turn angst-inducing game that's fun to play. It's one of those games where you want to be good at everything and you just can't, which I love.

I also love the way it plays with scoring, and the interplay and bluffing and measuring up your opponent that comes into it (putting "coy" in its tagline is very appropriate!). It takes a bit to get the terminology and scoring down, but once that's out of the way everything hums along smoothly; it's an easy game to learn.

I've never played a card game quite like it.

A cute filler game, easy to explain and quick to play.  Also, great art and brilliant card layout!
I think it's best with 4, and pointless with 2.  Luck of the draw plays a big factor, and having to play three rounds may make the game outstay its welcome a bit, especially for players who are behind in scoring after the early rounds.

使用擴充卡牌好像會影響遊戲性
看起來互動很多其實也還好
能做的選擇性差不多就是那樣
沒有想像中好玩

--Mar2014-- Strangely slow (that is, the mechanics of the game seem designed to drag the game out longer in time than the decisions justify) random blind-bidding game.  With lovely art.  If that sounds like something that hits three of my unfortunate buttons, that's true; so my low rating is likely not terribly surprising.

An interesting print on demand game for card game connoisseurs should try. On the plus side it also features and original theme and artwork, on the minus side, it doesn't really feel like a finished design and could use some development. 

You get cards in your hand each turn and you try to arrange them into three areas: the tableau in from of you (pond), your hand (house) and your personal discard pile (the river). It a set collection of sorts - you get points for matches between tableau and hand, while the discards score according to majorities in every colour. And then there are also leeching cards, which are very powerful, if you manage to get them. In the second and third round of the game, discards from previous round for a new open drawing pool at the middle of the table.

Two problems of the game: 
-  first round with no central pond (should be an easy fix, just throw some cards in there)
- really big influence of the luck of the draw. The game demands of players to be aware of quite many things and balance them out, but the luck factor is currently too high and is probably the crucial factor in determining the winner. Some mechanism like drafting should probably be added to even things out.  
The game feels like a gem in the rough with a promise of some really neat and unique things, but doesn't deliver on its promise yet.

A fun quick drafting card game with very nice art.

Because of how great our experience was on playing Koi Pond, we decided to get the rest of Daniels' games from Drivethrucards.com. Can't wait to try suspense and nine lives.

First Impression, 2 games:
I like it.  Clever and well thought out set collecting mechanisms. The whole game is a series of decisions with each new hand.  To score Koi you must balance what you have on the table with what is in your hand.  Player interaction is in the form of a majority scoring with your discards and with animals that score for the other players sets, discards or hand.  All this is done with 2 card placements per turn.  Very fun and having the ability to play off of your opponents spread as well as having your own scoring area makes it a step above the rest.

There's even a few cards with a twist to make the decisions even more interesting.  These are double suited cards that are only determined at scoring and can be used as a bluff to your opponent.

- some push your luck
- majority scoring that stays interesting over 3 rounds
- appealing art
- a bit of bluffing
- many areas to score in that gives a sense of different ways to win depending on your opponents moves and the card draw
- lucky draw mitigation with a central pool of cards that builds throughout the game
- nice balance of cards that do something useful

update: really enjoy this one.  Enough think and player interaction without being too stressful.

Koi Pond is a very hard game for me to rate.  It is so close to being a brilliant design,  but for me,  falls short because of a sole mechanic.

There is a lot to like here.  The artwork is serene,  the game play smooth and there are many different ways to score.  It's the lake mechanic that bogs it all down.  Recycling the played cards from the rivers to a central pool is an inelegant mechanic in an otherwise elegant design.  It just doesn't work for me on any level and detracts from the overall experience in a big way.  Instead of using the same cards each round - I play without the lake and deal fresh each hand.  If the game is missing something significant because of it,  I have yet to discover it.  

In the end,  Koi pond is a game with great potential - but with the rules as written -  it is nothing more than a beautifully crafted ice cream sundae with a rotten cherry on top.

Nice artwork.

The random draw of the cards makes the game quite luck dependent. 

The 3 special animals, especially the crane and turtle, seemed very powerful. Players will usually play them when opponents have already played the corresponding coloured koi cards. The play of these special animals can be very situational.

This is the game I wished Jaipur had been.  Yes, it's light, but it has lots of meaningful decisions and even some bluffing and double think. It's amazing that this game hasn't been picked up by a normal publisher.  It's also far better than any of the card games I've backed so far on Kickstarter.  This is a little hidden gem.

The turtles, cranes and house cats are overpowered, in that order, and causes the gameplay to feel overly luck-driven. The normal scoring of having koi in your house and pond seems weak in comparison. The game feels like it can benefit from a lot more playtesting and game development.

The artwork is excellent, as is the card quality.

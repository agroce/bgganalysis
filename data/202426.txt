It borrows all/almost all its mechanisms, but combines them to make something that didn't feel familiar.  An interesting game that I'd play again, but I'm not crazy about it.

AKA One man and his Sci-Fi thesaurus.

This is a brilliant trading and negotiation game for 4-8(!) (Correction: 3-9) in which everything is tradeable but victory points.

It completely relies on great communication and observation combined with the ability to make relative value judgements across the table with time pressure.

It was played twice; I came second twice. Our first game had a points spread of fewer than 4 between first and third. John M won the second by over twenty.

I played the species that has loads of colonies, and in the second game I played as the species that creates wild goods. The experiences were wildly different but despite the second game feeling like it was constrained by a smaller supply of goods in the galaxy I probably enjoyed it more knowing the game a bit better.

For anyone considering it, it is incredibly pure in its form; if you don't want to be negotiating and renegotiating wildly under pressure you are NOT going to enjoy this.

I really, really did.

What a surprisingly engrossing way to spend a couple hours. I love the open information, and trading is properly incentivized where people want to trade. Unique asymmetric races that I want to both try them all out and return to them with deeper strategies.

Might be a little hard of a sell to get to the table as much as I would like. But that probably because I would like to so often.

10 is for a game I will always enjoy playing?  This is the best negotiation game I have ever played, bar none.  I can't imagine wanting to play a negotiation game and NOT wanting to play Sidereal Confluence.  

This is one of those rare circumstances where I can't possibly imagine what you could add to the game to improve it.  More races?  There's 9 in the box, and they're all wildly different, how could I ask for more?  More options?  Every game feels different, and if they start feeling the same I could switch races.  More randomness?  So much of negotiation relies on understanding what deals are worth, I can't imagine wanting randomness in negotiation games.  Maybe I could want slightly more wooden cubes ,we tend to have to use these awkward 5x markers in larger games.  If I'm down to complaining the huge bag of wood just isn't always enough but the designer already thought of an answer I suppose I can't really ask for anything.

Oh the player screens are a bit dorky, they could be slightly larger and higher quality.  There, my only complaint.  Now what are you waiting for?  If you want a negotiation game, go buy this!  You could be running converters right now!

Very, very cool. It looks almost impossibly obtuse at first glance, from the title on the box, to the unpronounceable race names, to the mountain of wood and cardboard. Even after a read of the surprisingly slim rule book, it can be very hard to grasp what actually is going to happen. 

BUT. Persevere, because the game is actually quite easy to grasp when you play a round or two. In fact, I would recommend reading the rules to get a grasp, and then just trying it out. I have found that I very much love games like this, that provide a framework for emergent game play that depends heavily on player agency and interaction. Each race is very asymmetric (providing TONS of replayability) and thus provides some sort of guide rail but there is an enormous amount of space left for creativity and clever wheeling and dealing. All trades are binding, this isn't a game about tricking people really, just maximizing your potential, and crafting deals that are beneficial to both parties, but ultimately more beneficial to you.

The game can be summed up quickly: trading goods in order to get what you need to power some of your converters, inventing new technologies with goods you acquire (that everyone will also acquire a turn after whoever invented them), running converters to get more stuff, and then blind bidding to attempt to acquire more tech and planets that provide static income. Repeat 6 times. But once those six turns are up, you'll find it percolating in your brain as you look eagerly toward the next play.

RATING: 7
Sidereal Confluence certainly stands out from the crowd.  In a world of solitairish cube pushers it is two hours almost entirely spent interacting with your fellow players...oh and pushing quite a lot of cubes.  I really like that about it.  I really like that there is absolutely no downtime.  But overall I don't love this game.  My reservations concern the trading.  In any trade you need to know the worth of what's on offer to you, but a sense of the value to your opponent of what you can offer is also important.  Without the experience of multiple plays or long pauses while you assess other players' capabilities to convert w into x,y and z, you are playing without that sense of worth to your opponent. It's possible to go by the exchange rates suggested on the player aid, plough your own furrow, demand better exchange rates from players who seem to be doing better than you and have an enjoyable time.  However, I suspect it's a much better game with that group of experienced players that I'm never going to find.   

Production quality is good.  The artwork is forgettable.  The rules make a tough job of explaining what's a mechanically straightforward game.

Pit VS Cosmic Encounter VS Euro-Cube-Pusher? So strange. This is an engrossing game (and a huge table hog). I think the rating could go up with more plays, but there was so much going on it was hard to keep track of. I also find that 'pure' negotiation games are not necessarily my forte.

RATING: 5
This game features an amazing collection of some very interesting terminology on all the technology cards, and a lot of cube pushing and conversions, all anchored in many long, and in some respects, pleasing trading rounds that, I guess, eventually after repeated plays of the game, reach the point where victory point advantages in the trades are shaved to the thinnest of margins, once everyone plays enough times to know the exact value of everything in the game.  Kind of fun I guess.

As a trading game, it has considerable merit, BUT for my tastes, it is actually spends TOO much time trading, since for me, a trading mechanic is not worth several hours of play time.  And for those playing this game for the first time, the opacity of determining just how much that cube is worth to that player, possessing that opaque special power, is essentially off the charts, and to the extent that you wish to win the game, deeply frustrating.  

In the final analysis, this game is a bit of a quirky messy masterpiece of cube conversions, differential valuations, asymmetrical powers, and trading sessions.  This is going to be right up the alley for some gamers.  It just doesn't happen to be an alley I want to visit again.

This game is a laughably bad production. The rules are not complete as printed. Also, pretty loose and questionable rules for a game of economic trading (although, it does mimic a real capitalist economy where lying gets you ahead). A player count that makes it not the best to get to the table, and at the top player counts it is a squawking mess. 
I don't even want to waste more time of my own to describe how much of shame this product is.

RATING: 8.5
After a recent game of Sidereal Confluence, one of my opponents remarked on the similarities between this game and Century: Spice Road.  I thought it was an odd comparison at first, but after thinking about it, it's true that several of the core mechanisms of the two games are similar.  In both, you use 'converters' to trade a particular set of cubes for a more valuable set of cubes.  In both, you use cubes to buy cards worth victory points.  But where Spice Road is a light game involving little more than those actions, performed one at a time, Sidereal Confluence is a heavyweight.  You might have as few as three to five converters to feed on the first turn, but by the end of the game you are trying to manage a ten to twenty converters, trading with the other players to come up with the resources you need to run them.  Or you can trade the converters themselves, trying to acquire the converters your resources can run!  And each player is playing one of nine very asymmetric races, so the experience is different each time you play.  Great game!

I'm not a fan of negotiation in general. This game is all about negotiation. Sure, there are resource conversion chains and special powers and tech trees and victory point bombs. But the heart of the game is in the trade phase, which is all about negotiation. And this is just too much of that for me.

The graphic design also left a lot to be desired - white cubes are represented by stainless steel-looking icons; ship icons are too small to be distinguishable from one another; the gift/trade hand icon is easily missed by first-time players; their are multiple races with similar colors - and the theme, although present, was subsumed by the obviously easier reference of colors and shapes, especially when trading on a time limit.

I like trading games, but it's a tough genre to do well. I think Sidereal Confluence really nails it. The 9 highly asymmetric powers, the wide-open trading, the fact that the game is 90% just one giant trade phase are all great. It's fairly daunting to get started with just because of all the stuff you can do - definitely pay attention to the difficulty ratings when picking a faction! -  but it's actually a surprisingly elegant design once you get your head around it. Lots of cool design work here.

Definitely read the play tips for each faction before starting - they're very helpful. And be ruthless about speculative investments; the game is only 6 turns, the last turn is more like a half turn, and resources are pretty tight. Stay really focused on whatever your Empire does best and try to stay flexible and open to opportunity while not being distracted. As slightly unintuitive as it may be, the big points are from tech - the early ones because of the Confluence bonus, the later ones just because they give VP. Your faction is likely to have a few other sources of VPs, and there are VP converters available. It's a trading game, but the goal is not the accumulation of stuff it's the accumulation of VP. Stuff is VP, but at a terrible rate. So don't lose focus on the VP despite needing to manage your economy.

This game is bananas. It's like a Euro cube conversion engine builder mixed with Cosmic Encounter, but all performed in realtime with negotiation and trading. It feels intensely thematic due to the social nature of the game and ties that wonderfully with asymmetry. First impression is one of the best releases of the year.

10 games in and loving it so far.  I like how each game feels like I'm learning a bit better how to play a particular race, or to catch the best trades, or best manipulate the table.  It's also so entertaining to see how my friends and family interact during the game, the ways different personalities negotiate and cooperate - just having a different set of people and relationships has changed every single game for the better.

Sounds like a really fun game. Reviews are solid, especially since I LOVE negotiation games. Biggest issue is the components (especially art). As my current group may not do well with this one, I think I’ll wait until there’s a reprint with better art, which is likely to happen in a few years due to the game’s growing reputation.

I was able to play this at GenCon presented by the designer and this became the highlight of that event for me.  I've never played a game about trading before where all of the people at the table were so willing to actually talk and make a deal.  Everyone had their own goals and ways of getting there.  I was playing a race I believe was called the Zeth that was basically the space Mafia, and while I had no real ability to make things myself, I could ruin other peoples day... unless they trade with me.  This extortion led to me having so much fun convincing each and every player to trade with me every turn or face the wrath of having their own economy ruined.  I had cousins who needed information, cousins who needed new spaceships, goods falling off of trucks, and a bunch of cousins names Larry who really needed a place to stay.  End result was 4 hours of playing my race in character and everyone at this table having a blast the entire time.  The designer was just the best and was able to talk about why everything was the way it was and really put it all in context, I really believed how excited he was to be playing his game with people and showing it off, it was so contagious.  My friends who were also there and I absolutely can not wait for this game to come out.

Fantastic game filled with negotiation.  I've played it a few times now and people get in to the spirit of the game almost immediately.  People who don't play games too often are also taken up in the spirit quickly.  Only one of the 9 factions being able to harm another in any way certainly helps keep people in a good mood.  I am shocked now at how quickly people learn this game, it looks like a lot but the simple rule of "trade for cubes you need to make more cubes," is plenty to get people going.

I only played 1/2 of a game at origins but liked it quite a bit.  Has a fresco level of cubes and probably is the definition of a CUBE PUSHER.   It would benefit from cube upgrades as it may help differentiate things.

There are so many different powers that it is hard to look at the table and figure out what the hell to do.  Repeat plays would help that.  The real time aspect of trading does not feel real time, there is no real rush to do trades.  It is more of a negotiation / economy game.

Very clever game that seems to be well thought out.

This is a lovely incarnation of the "turn things into other things" genre with trading at its heart: you can't do it alone (or if you can, it'll likely be a lot less efficient). Conceptually simple, though high visual complexity. The seemingly-abstract presentation hides a lot of thought that's gone into theme; see [thread=1869473]this thread for some examples[/thread].

For me, this game is a solution to the Five Player Problem ("you have exactly 5 people, all of whom want to play something medium-heavy, none of whom want to play 2p"). SC isn't just a game that [i]can[/i] play 5-6, but a game I [i]actively want[/i] to play with 5-6, unlike nearly every other game I'd propose in those circumstances.

My only major dissatisfaction is somewhat intrinsic to the trading genre: sometimes there's a potential trade between you and someone else that's fantastic for both of you... but due to inexperience or whim they decide to forego that in favor of another deal that won't be nearly as good for them (or you). Sure, you can push to convince them, but past a certain point that becomes badgering. Not an experience I enjoy... but as mentioned, I think it's more the genre than the implementation.

Other possible nits: There's a certain amount of information overload. (I like this.) It feels abstract. (See above-linked thread.) There's blind-bidding. (Not my favorite thing, and occasionally whether you're able to get a particular planet/tech can be a really big swing.)

But ultimately, the game's about trading and negotiation, and the core systems of "running converters produces value" provide strong reason to do both things in a fun way. Play is simultaneous, so there's very little downtime; I quite enjoy playing.

I really like the game and look forward to playing it again. That said, I think it’s the worst graphic design I’ve seen in a long time. Iconography is utterly opaque, which is usually due to an effort at language independence, but in this case some cards are all text. The rule book is likewise just bad. A simple turn outline could have made it clear and easily accessible —- it is not nearly as complicated a game as the rule book and iconography make it.

Overall it was an irritating first experience. It will probably improve with subsequent plays, if anyone will give it another shot. It will always be cumbersome to teach and off putting for first timers. 

A meaty game that plays high player counts with simultaneous turns is something of a grail, so hopefully my group will try to overlook the shortcomings.

Rated 7; -1 for unintelligible iconography.

A really innovative, unique and bold design.   This may be for 2017 what Vast was for 2016 in that regard.   The basic flow of play is fairly simple, so the structure isn't too hard to teach but each player has wildly asymmetric powers.   That part takes a couple of rounds to see how it interacts with the overall structure.   It's not unfair to say this is Cosmic Encounter meets Chinatown.   There is essentially zero downtime, so even though the game might take 2 hours, it is a very engaging experience.   Very impressed with this design.   To list some negatives, the color matching of the cubes to cards isn't very good.   There is precious little artwork in the game and what is there isn't very special.   That's probably the biggest miscue in this production.   With some more art and better graphics....  better presentation overall....   this game would get a bump or two in my rating.   I don't know if it will find a big enough audience to warrant another edition, but here's hoping.

After 1 play: While I'm not sure we fully explored the depths of the possibilities when it comes to negotiation, I had a hard time paying attention to my own faction let alone the other 4 players activities. I enjoyed running my economy (or machine?) every turn, but the negotiation and trading felt a little too sterile for me. I think I personally look for more urgency in my negotiation games, which typically involves more direct interaction. I still prefer the following games when it comes to negotiation games listed in order of weight: Sheriff of Nottingham, Cosmic Encounter, Tammany Hall, & Dune.

RATING: 7.5
One of the most unique games I’ve ever played. It has two of my least favorite elements in games: blind bidding and negotiation, and yet I enjoyed my one play and look forward to playing again. The caveat I have about the game is that to balance the table, it seems like a group will need to play repeatedly. 

But before I go into that, a brief description. Each turn you trade for the cubes you want to power your stuff. Then you power some of your stuff - the stuff with purple arrows ("stuff" being colonies or techs). Then you all bid for new colonies and techs. Then you power other stuff - the stuff with white arrows. That's a turn right there. You play 6 of those and then count points. 

The point of getting cubes and powering things is develop to techs and/or flip techs you've already developed to their more potent/different side. Same for colonies. Flipping might give you more cubes or a different type of cube altogether. While colonies give you in-game production, techs give you endgame points. So, build a bigger engine or go for points.

I don’t like negotiation games because I get worn down by people trying to impose their will on me and convince me about a deal they’re proposing, sometimes while the rest of the table is telling me to resist. I hate that experience. 

But the designer solved that conundrum here by making the alien races value the resources differently. I had no problems trading 2 or 3 of something for one of something else because they weren't that valuable to me and the listed equivalency chart told me I was trading equal value for equal value. I think there was only one case of "Don't do that with him! That's a bad deal!" as we were sorting out the values. 

I will say I don’t see this as an occasional pick-up-and-play game. It seems to require a group dedicated to learning the nuances of all the individual races. Complicating matters is the fact that some powers are simply harder to play than others. I had a level 1 power and it was very straightforward how to play. Others were not like that, and it's not like you can have everyone play the simple powers together than all move to the more complex ones. They're all uneven out of the box.

RATING: 9
A fantastic game that really pushes players to fill the roles of various unique races, and deal with other players. The wildly differing mechanics of the races really encourage cooperation - races that have extremely strong production engines tend to lack the resources required to make those engines produce reliably, and some races especially need outside help. The fact that deals can be struck over multiple turns and that a race can trade not just resources, but also planets, colony ships, technologies, and victory points, encourages interactions that would not be effectively possible in many other games. It shares the problem of most high-interactivity games that it is more difficult to find a sufficient number of players for a good game, but from my brief play of the game I absolutely loved the flavor and mechanics.

My one game-specific complaint is that there is one race that is unique in that it steals things from other players; in a game that encourages wheeling and dealing as much as this one, having this ability strikes me as being a surefire way to be viewed as either a thug ("nice resources you've got... It'd be a pity if something were to *happen* to them...") or a massive jerk ("oh, I see that you've got a resource you need to complete a deal with four other players. I can't really use that, but I'll have it anyway."); in short, I can't see a player who would like to play as this race being the sort of player I'd want in this kind of game, but I may be in the minority there.

Sidereal Confluence is a trading game, and a wonderful one at that. Trading here is the best I've seen. Each race is good A but poor at B, C, and D, or some combination thereof. This dynamic makes each player needed by all the others. Every trade is beneficial to everyone and everyone wants to trade. Sidereal captures that perfectly. It is a purely positive trading game. Unfortunately, there is quite a bit of "fat" around the trading. Every technology is named in unapproachable ways, and the game has such a large amount of information in front of each player, it becomes impossible to manage. The trading is pure, but I would love to see this idea presented with more editing during development. As of now, Sidereal Confluence has the feel of an artist who continued to add paint to a piece because no one was there to  advise them to trim off unnecessary bits, and now most of the painting is brown. Sidereal Confluence is a conflicting game. The trading is sublime, but held back by everything else the game offers. I anxiously await the games this inspires. If a future title is able to capture the joyous trading here without the extra fluff, it will be an incredible experience.

I don't much like taking coobs to turn them into other coobs, but man, this is the best of that type of game by a significant margin. The asymmetry feeds the trading, which is brisk and open-ended. The tech sharing is wonderful. The information overload is real, but can be managed given that you're likely to want to specialize somewhat anyway. Probably the best trading game I've played, and the ability to scale up the 9(!!) without much increase in game length is superb.

The euro version of Cosmic Encounter. I love this game, but it leaves you mentally exhausted after a play. I've played at both 4 and 8 and it works great at both. Set-up time is long and it is difficult to teach. The rule book isn't very useful and I think more detail is needed on the player sheets regarding set-up for each alien.

Me ha llamado la atención porque ando buscando un juego que sea para 5-6 jugadores con negocio, pero que no sea simplemente ponerse a verdulear como un loco ofreciendo y pidiendo.

En este caso se trata de un juego en el que por narices hay que comerciar porque es complicado que de entrada se produzca todo lo que se necesita. Tiene varias cosas curiosas como asimetría en las facciones del juego, una valoración de los bienes para hacer intercambios de forma "medida" como el wealth of nations (si bien no hay una fluctuación del mercado), todos los jugadores tienen un deck de tecnologías que son descubiertas durante la partida por alguien, al final del turno a ese jugador le otorga una puntuación y luego es "descubierta" por el resto.

RATING: 5
Too long, convoluted, and noisy for what you ultimately get. Generic resource conversion meets generic engine building with generic trading between asymmetical factions. It’s not bad in the slightest just nothing really worth note.

There’s lots of info to digest upfront but all you really need to know is trade stuff, make stuff, buy stuff. Your faction will vary on how you do this and therein lies the bulk of complexity. VPs are peppered throughout these phases but the big windfalls are in inventing the techs which increase in level of input required and points given as the game goes along. 

If you enjoy trading, negotiating, resource conversion, engine-building, a Sci-Fi theme, and don’t mind some noisy smoke and mirrors + the 3hr run time then Sidereal may be the game for you. Otherwise there are other games which do these bits in a more interesting or streamlined way.

Very interesting and exhausting trade game that succeeds at forcing all players to trade with each other. I enjoyed my first play but wasn't as enthusiastic about it as I hoped. The trades worked out, almost everybody was able to trade whatever he wanted each round but the end result was very spread out without visible explanations what the winners were doing better.

It looks like certain races shouldn't be allowed to trade goods of equal value or they will run away with victory. It's almost impossible to work out clever deals unless players understand the specific strengths and needs of each others races. Probably one of these difficult games that will shine with a dedicated group of players knowing what they are doing and playing this repeatedly. Chances for this instance to happen are converging against zero. Otherwise, an interesting experience falling short of its potential.

Rules could be better written and some of the iconography and card text could also be clarified further.  Took a while for my very experienced gaming group to get the hang of it during the first playthrough.  It is fun though and seems like it has a high ceiling in terms of replayability and mastery.  Has some interesting aspects, like the simultaneous actions and intersection of the variable player powers.  I like it.

A trading game like I've never seen. With five players this was two hours of unbroken wheeling and dealing; even players who normally couldn't make a deal to save their life were swept into complicated webs of multi-player deals. This is just a very clever design: it does so many things to both encourage trading and make players feel good about the trades the negotiate.

RATING: 10
I was a late-stage playtester for this game, and have played over a dozen times.  This one is an amazing achievement of game design.  The game works well with all of its listed player counts, and with any combination of its 9 races.  The amount of effort that went into this, both mathematical and through extensive playtesting, have resulted in a game that is something special.  What makes it particularly impressive is the level of asymmetry between the races.  It's not merely that each alien race is pursuing a slightly different set of resources -- rather, each has an entirely different logic and playstyle.  

Discovering these is a great part of the fun, and the learning curve is ideal -- most players will be able to play competitively after a single play, but each race has depths that can be explored over many plays.  And of course, as a highly interactive game, much of the skill is in playing the other players and not merely the system.  Even here there are many different viable approaches.  If you want to put your head down and just focus on trades that benefit you personally, you can do that.  If you want to broker complex and elaborate multi-party trades, you can do that as well.  There's no right way to play, and no single way to succeed.

I'm thrilled to see this game in print and am looking forward to continuing to explore and experience it for years to come.

A mad genius concoction of a game that has been described aptly as Chinatown meets Cosmic Encounter. It’s a trading and negotiation game built around wildly asymmetric alien races that need to trade in order to run their engine/economy. The factions are very dependent on each other because they can't produce all the resources they need to run their economy, which forces players to try to inventive trades, especially 3- or 4-way trades. I've played with 4, 5, 6 and 7 players and all player counts have been great so far, surprisingly being quite good even at 6 or 7 players because the trade phase is simultaneous.

Very satisfying and interesting trading game. I often find trading to be frustrating in games, as everyone is always looking for an edge, but this game seems to successfully promote finding win-win exchanges.

There's also a lot to learn in exploring the different factions. I've played one and a half games with the Faderan, and I could see playing them even more in the future, as there were many aspects I wanted to learn more about. And then there are eight other factions after that.

Seemed to be a hit for the rest of the table, too. Looking forward to more plays.

We tried this both 8 player and 4 player at BGGcon. I heavily preferred 4 player, though I ended up playing races both times that were way better with larger numbers. This felt like a blend between Who's the Boss and Cosmic Encounter but wasn't quite as fulfilling as either. You didn't really have enough control over your economic engine, given how research worked, but you also couldn't just rely on trading. I want to play it more because I did enjoy both plays, but they also both came down to like .344852 points between first and second, which just seems weird. It's very hard to tell how you're doing during the game, especially when the end is determined by like one big and one small cube, so a single slightly more advantageous trade somewhere along the way could have won you the game.

I want to play this more, and I'm fairly undecided overall how I feel about it.

Trade and negotiate in the Elysian Quadrant with aliens to acquire the resources necessary to fund your economy and research new technology. Scheming, dealing, and mutually beneficial agreements are key to success. While technically a competitive game, there's a uniquely cooperative feel as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you'll form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.

I liked this more than I expected to. Free-form trading requires a certain assertiveness which can benefit some players and hurt others. Finding the right combos could be fun, but may come down to a memorization exercise of the tech deck. At least the alien powers are quite interesting, reminiscent of Cosmic Encounter. Probably worth repeat plays but I'm uncertain whether I'd request it, especially because of its length.

RATING: 7
My introduction was a seven player game with only one veteran (Tom Vasel) and one rather slow player.  No time limit on trades, and yet we finished in three hours.  I think that could easily be slashed down to two hours or less with some experienced players and tigher trade limits and it's going to scale very well with player count.

The game itself is interesting and I'd need to play it a few more times to really get the rhythm down, but I really enjoy the extreme asymmetry of the game and it's not actually that hard to teach.  It does take up a ton of space however.

My second game ended up also being seven players with me the only experienced player.  Swapping races does change your focus quite a bit and we ran about 2.5 hrs with the teach and no trade time limits.  I still don't really have the flow of this game and would like to do it with a smaller player count of (hopefully) experienced people.

There is a lot happening all at once but it's not too hard to just focus on the things you need to do and to find ways to make them happen.  The different alien races seem pretty balanced though some are definitely more difficult to work with.  This game has my favorite type of brain burning puzzle where you have lots of great things you want to do but you just can't do all of it so you have to prioritize.

Such an interesting, asymmetrical trading game, where the optimal move is to constantly be looking for mutually beneficial trades.  The weirdness disappears after the first round, and from there it’s off to the races.

If I was a little less of an introvert I would love the hell out of this. I played once with 6 players. It's like Bohnanza but where you're trying to work out some stuff at the same time as everyone is shouting. Very interesting, cool asymetry. Realtime negotiation has that disadvantage, whoever shouts loudest is going to get heard and probably win. If, however, you're all extroverts then that's great, you can all shout at each other and have a whale of a time.

RATING: 3
Very unimpressed with this one. 

The game does manage to fit in quite a bit of trading, but surrounding those interesting bits is pile of complexity, and tons of fiddly conversion of cubes and bits into ever greater cubes and bits all in the goal of acquiring a few VP's. There are variable player powers which force each race to play quite differently which is neat, but it also adds another huge level of things players need to take into account while making trades. Then each player will also have quite a few technologies out that allow them to do various things, which adds another huge level of overhead to everything. 

If you're happy just trading things around focusing on your stuff and what you need, awesome. But then you're possibly making trades that aren't very fair, as you may be giving your opponents far more points than you're getting. But to realize what each faction is getting out of each trade involves a lot of time to analyze everything they have. 

Overall my main complaint is just that there is way too much stuff going on for the interesting bits to really shine. Instead most of the game is spent fiddling around with bits. I actually won my first game, but I don't know how--analyzing each trade is virtually impossible. As such I feel most of us were just trading for the sake of getting some cubes we wanted, but we had no real way to balance out the idea or concept of what we were giving the other person. 

Added on top of all this, and I don't really care for the graphic design, nor is there any appreciable theme. (Look, everyone is going to call them green cubes or blue cubes, not whatever resources they supposedly are). I don't have to have theme in my games, but it can be nice. This game never felt like it was telling a story though, instead I was just constantly converting ever more cubes into ever more things. 

In the end I'd have much rather just played say Bohnanza. Bohnanza is a great trading game where it's easy to analyze what I'm getting out of trades. It plays quickly and the majority of the game is focused on the interesting bits, the trading. The theme there is also weak admittedly, but the gameplay is great and it plays quickly while packing lots of interesting stuff. 

Sidereal Confluence manages to take a few interesting moments, the trading phase, and add tons of bloat on top of it with gazillions of components, rules, and cards. Personally I don't find all of these add to the gameplay or deepen the experience and instead serve to overwhelm from the good bit. The one major good part about Sidereal is that most of the player turns are simultaneous, so there is little downtime. Still, my complaint is that most of the things I'm doing consist of converting cubes around and attempting to make trades that are very difficult to actually analyze due to the overwhelming amount of stuff. 

I'm sure this is a game some will enjoy, and good for them. I personally will be happy to never play this one again as it's not for me. I'll go elsewhere when I'm in the mood for some fun trading.

It wants so badly to be more than a cube pusher, but alas, pushing cubes is what it does.  It also wants to be a negotiation game, but it is really just an appraisal game.  Players are usually not looking for the ZOPA; they are just looking for an approximately equal trade.  This is because, practically, the parties cannot afford to hold on to their goods; they are next to worthless unless traded.    

This is a fine game and I would happily play it again.   The space for creative play is very narrow and I'm afraid this will limit the replaybility to  ~9 games per person. 

I should add that is clearly a marvel of design, and perhaps it is a little overdesigned.

Played this at GenCon with the creator of the game.  This game is awesome.  It manages to mix a decently complex euro-style economy, with the fast paced trading  and simultaneous turns, which ensures everybody is constantly engaged with the game.  Multiple asynchronous race abilities ensure that no two games will ever look the same.  The basic goal of the game is to become rich, and the main way of doing that is by offering trade deals that make your competitors fabulously wealthy, and in turn, also makes you just a little bit more wealthy.  The lack of aggression makes for an awesome cooperative atmosphere, that makes one of the most fun games I've played in a long time.

A solid game.

You will likely not find another games this compares to, players have unique economies and negotiate with other in real time. It is fairly fast-paced, and is a genuinely unique approach on a trading/economic game.

There is very real burden from trying to remember and make the most use out of all your systems. New players will often be somewhat lost in their economy, just by the scope of it all, but after a play-though I believe that fixes itself.

More experienced players will transition from just managing their own economy into actually understanding others a bit, but this is really quite hard. Personally, I think it adds a lot of replayability, but your mileage may vary.

9/10 - A very solid game, but its combined complexity and ideal player count will always hold it back slightly.

I felt very strong positive first impressions, and feel a need to play more!
***

Upon playing this game five times now, and upon reading pages and pages of discussion spawned by the mere presence of this game, here on these very forums, I am convinced: This is a game that transcends the negotiation genre. It has set a standard of quality in design that most could only dream of achieving. TauCeti Deichmann has established something truly magical here, and it could only be thought of as a shame should anyone remotely interested in hobby boardgames not have played it yet. 

Every species has its pros and cons (or rather, its ebbs and flows). Each species interacts differently in the presence of other groups of species, and it is up to the players to realize precisely HOW they interact, and HOW to leverage the economy in their favor. In this sense, this game gives a tantalizing sandbox feel: everything is up for trade, everything has a price, and every player is giving up something they do not need for something that they so desperately want. 

If I continue to sing praises for this game, it is because no other negotiation game since Santiago has gripped me the way Sidereal Confluence has done. In stark contrast, the negotiation in Santiago is brutal, clinical, and decisive. Sidereal Confluence negotiation is free-flowing, adaptable, manipulative, and incentivizing. A triumph!

A big monster of a trading game with lots of little cube conversions, but it doesn't feel heavy or stressful or complex.  The theme is great, the trading is amiable, and running the engine is pleasing.  There is depth but you don't have to play it seriously to enjoy it.  The commercial version has some poor choices by the publisher with regards to title, box front, and terrible graphic design that impedes functionality.  But it's still functional enough to pass, even though it was been much better with the prototype art.

below comments based on prototype play:

A deep game with open trading that doesn't take forever.  And special powers on top of that!  Simply running the engine is pleasing, and trading is important but not intensely stressful.  That said, this is not a game where you can stop and think during the trading session while others finish trades and leave you with no opportunities -- so I'm often not in the mood for it, but it's a great trading game when that's what I'm looking for.

And the theme is extremely well done with wildly different sci-fi races interacting in neat ways over an epic history.

As of the prototype play, my biggest complaint was that the asymmetric race powers were cool but overall weak compared to normal actions.  As a result, the different races didn't feel as different as I wanted them to, and their powers often felt more like a trap than a strategic driver.  I believe that has been fixed since I played.

Don't let the theme fool you as the theme can be mostly ignored. It is a cube conversion machine with all its innards exposed. The game that surrounds that can be very enjoyable. You have to negotiate to get everything you want. Also, asymmetric powers really help each player feel different. The real highlight of the game though is that most things are happening simultaneously, so downtime is pretty minimal.

I haven't played too many negotiation games, yet upon playing this I feel intuitively that it must be one of the best.  How could it get better, as far as negotiation goes?  The entire game is a series of negotiation rounds that feel very organic, probably due to the fact that virtually any resource (including parts of a player's tableau) and any type of deal is possible.  

Also integral to the experience is the very well-executed asymmetry of the different playable factions.  I'm looking forward to trying more of them, yet I also want to replay the ones I've previously chosen, in order to improve my play and understand them better.  I feel I have so much room to improve at Sidereal Confluence, and that feeling is much stronger here than with most other games.  The game is definitely daunting to learn, but after an explanation, most players will grasp the concepts once the game is in motion.  Playing optimally, on the other hand, feels quite difficult; evaluations of trades will become far from trivial once players start to make more interesting offers.

As a player who doesn't necessarily need player interaction in order to enjoy a game, I don't even think I am part of the ideal target audience for this game... yet I love it, and I think that therefore a person who loves negotiation and interaction is very likely to rank Sidereal Confluence among their very favourite games.

Disclaimer: I was one of the test players (One of what is easily hundreds, possibly 1000+). This is literally my favorite board game (And I've played it ~100 times as a result), it has the perfect blend of competition and cooperation to make every stage of play feel good. Additionally it is more balanced than almost any board game I've run into, with the test-playerbase all feeling "their" favorite race is the "best", because the races are so divergent in their play styles that a playstyle that "synergizes" with yours makes that race feel amazing. Which is, I suppose, a result of how much time and effort has gone into the game and the amount of playtesting it's received.

Speaking of races: The factions are all extremely different, and play incredibly differently, in a manner that fits their fluff. I'd give examples, but literally the whole "this is how this race works" counts as examples, and I don't want to wax too poetic.

Additionally, the box isn't lying, assuming all races are in the base game*.. IT GOES TO NINE. Unlike most other board games it works at nine, and isn't appreciably longer. (Only adds about 15 minutes, the total playtime variation is mostly "is this player group slow?") 

Additionally I find it enjoyable at three players, however at that number it's more of a hostage negotiation game (Every trade phase is resolved as a single three way trade.) and I strongly recommend playing it at 4+ before you do a three player game, as the hostage negotiation only really works when all three players understand what's happening, and are approximately equally "invested" in the game.

*If it says 4-9 players this can be assumed.

Sounds awesome but I'm not sure how down my group is for such a big negotiation game.

The game is mostly trading, with some engine-building, and that all works quite well. The asymmetric factions are very well-designed, and that added spice makes the game great. It's a rare eurogame that scales well to high player counts, with virtually no downtime. However, its theme is weak (resources are referred to as cubes, mostly), and the components are mediocre. Also, while the rules aren't too difficult, there's a lot of stuff going on, so it can be an overwhelming game to introduce people to.

Initial impressions are extremely positive, though it goes pretty long, and it is hard to tell how much control you really have.  We played with 6, and it seemed like a good number.  I'll be excited to try it with other player counts, especially 5.  Accomplishing goals is really satisfying, as is making complex, interesting trades.

Assymetry is my cup of tea, and the fact that it has a depth of strategy while being very easy to teach (if a little annoying to learn from the rules) makes this a solid game. The name is awful, though.

I never thought I'd recommend a cube-pusher, but here I stand. Sidereal Confluence is wonderful. Its negotiations are preposterously open-ended, it's brisk, it's inventive, it's smart.

Sidereal is a resource gathering/conversion game with a negotiation/trading element going on. The minimum player count is four going up to nine players. Players have asymmetric powers, and the common bits that all players have are often slightly different.

My feelings on this game are heavily mixed right now. First off, I generally like resource gathering/conversion games. And I generally dislike negotiation/trading games.

Second, I feel like there are a number of questionable design choices in this game. There's way too much stuff to track, which makes it hard to learn the game. It doesn't help that everything is a generic resource that you'll never refer to by anything other than color. Why does an atomic destablizer convert large black cubes into two browns, a yellow and a ship? You will never know, or care.

My first play was largely overwhelming. There's like seven different types of resources and by the end of the game you'll have like 15 different converters that take a variety of inputs (or just one) to produce a variety of different outputs. You'll also have a bunch of cards that just produce stuff. Keeping track of what you're making, what you want to make, what other people want, etc. is a lot of mental overhead.

Especially if you start trying to rejigger what you'll make so that you can trade something you were otherwise going to use. That often has a cascade effect meaning everything you were planning to run now has to be reallocated.

Additionally there are auctions for "colonies" (a produce-some-good card) and research teams (a scoring vector that you should jump on early).

And everything in the game is upgradeable, which is another set of calculations where you have to figure how to get the stuff to upgrade the thing, and balance that against how the upgrade card will be better than the original.

The trading phases are hectic and you largely just hope someone has what you want and wants something you happen to have. Trying to think this phase through was just too much my first go around.

There's also a wonky leftover resource to points conversion at the end of the game that is horribly confusing.

I want to like this game. There's a lot of interesting stuff. I'm hoping that another play will go a lot more smoothly, now that I have a rough idea what's going on in the game. I really don't want to play the game at the higher player counts, as that's likely to be way too chaotic.

Engaging backstory, neat mechanics, a lot of negotiation and fiddling with little wooden cubes.

9 so far: Only played once. No one knew how to play just me reading reviews and the rules before hand. Whole thing 2 hours with 5 people we had a blast.  Well written simple and brilliant. I expect this game will probably rise in score as I play more...

My 8 may go up once I start playing with people who already familiar with it. My elevator pitch for it is "Cosmic Encounter: the Euro".

Whew this game sure is different! Only one play so far, so still wrapping my head around it.  A bit of a bear to teach for what ends up being a fairly straightforward trading game.  It's worth getting over that hump however.

The best trading game made. It has minor flaws but is unique and has good game flow and the actual free trading and negotiation is clearly the main part of the game. The euro cube-pusher analyzer will be able to find better synergies in the converters than others but he still needs to make good enough trades to keep that advantage. The asymmetric races are part of what makes this work with the different play-styles and different cube-converters creating different demand and allowing for mutually beneficial deals. It also has just enough guidance for evaluating deals so you should not be able to make bad deals but you will not win unless you learn to evaluate more than just the raw values.

There are only a few games that even try to do the same thing as SC. The one I know of coming even close to the concept is Chinatown but in comparison it has nothing on SC. Chinatown deals are too easy to calculate as the game is just too straightforward and already in the second game Chinatown fell completely flat and into an almost deterministic play. Sidereal Confluence introduces just enough opaqueness to make the game-state hard enough to read that it doesn't get solvable even if you have some guidance on evaluating a fair deal.

One of the single worst names I've ever seen in modern boardgames, but also one of the most unique designs I've played! It pulls influence from all kinds of games... Diplomacy, Cosmic Encounter, Millenium Blades, the intrigue of Twilight Imperium and the Game of Thrones game, countless Euros with trading and bidding... it all comes together in a surprisingly slick game that doesn't outstay it's welcome. 

Whenever I discuss this game, I do so with heavy qualifiers... I know that this type of game is NOT for everyone. Some people will HATE this game. Anyone not comfortable with real-time game stress, SIGNIFICANT social interaction, and having many options available to them at any one time will likely have a bad time. 

I am currently removing .5 due to having only a few "low complexity" aliens, which means that decent sized teaching games are going to leave 2+ people with VERY hard to manage powers, for a newbie. Something like Eclipse, that has a generic and easier to play race that is available for everyone would have gone a long way. I also think the visual design of a few parts is not great. The white cubes look A LOT like grey "wildcard" cubes and that caused confusion for multiple players. 

The box and name are really just very terrible though... I guess it makes it stand out... but not for any of the right reasons. That's not why it got -.5... it's just a nitpick.

RATING: 5
I love negotiation games, but this one seems too overwrought and fiddly for what it is.

What sets SC apart from other trading games are the variable player powers; they're highly asymmetrical and seem very well thought out. This is clearly the game's biggest selling point and has me intrigued. That being said, I can't help but feel it could have been done in a more elegant, concise way. As is the barrage of cube conversion is just too much. Just can't see playing this instead of my personal fave Sissi!: Die Bohnenkaiserin.

Space negotiating in the distant stars between a plethora of richly developed asymetric powered aliens to gain and convert universal resources into technology upgrades.  Centers around timed trading sessions that some times get frenetic and frantic reminding me of the old card game Pit worrying if it is smart to trade with a certain player and who is better off? ...but you must

RATING: 9.1
Man this game was a blast (4p) and I'm already aching for the next game night! I didn't even see 2/3 of my technology cards and we only saw 4/9 races. We used a 10min time limit on the negotiations which worked fine actually. At first I thought that it (trading) would be a chaotic mess but once we got the hang of what cards do and what resources go where etc., it was really fun. The races are really different and you have to use a different strategy with each race. I was playing Faderans and came in 2nd with only 1p difference, I should have traded away my special tiles just one more and I'd tied :P

Really interesting and different game, if you like Race/Roll for the Galaxy and/or Terraforming Mars, you might actually like this one a lot as well. It looks intimidating but once it clicks, you're off for a really great ride!

Something different. Really am enjoying it and repeat play is rewarding as you learn how to be more creative in trades and move the game further into technology faster..  But when getting a group together only play with people who like this or trading games in general as all it takes is one player sulking in the corner to drag the experience down.

This game is something else, it has a really unique feel to it. A must-have if you miss a negotiating game in your collection. A must-try if you already have one, this one will probably surpass it.

This is the full strength trading game I've been waiting for.  The open trading is very cool as everyone at the table values things differently and has different goals so its hard to put a perfect value on most things from the start to finish of the game (unlike Chinatown which has quite a lot of perfect valuing you can do).  Beyond the heart of soul trading of the game I found the engine building with all the converter cards to be really interesting too.  Its neigh impossible to build an engine that doesn't require trading to keep functioning... and on top of that there didn't feel like there was a clear way to easily transform your resource engine into a point engine leaving a lot of room to experiment with the best way to actually win. The experience is worth it win or lose all the same and I'm looking forward to exploring Sidereal Confluence a lot more!

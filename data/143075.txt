GAME: Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice
RANK: 2385
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In its basic form, this game has very few decisions (around one...) and the obvious fix is to give wrestlers special abilities. An opportunity missed but the second edition promises to fix that. There is a core mechanic here which could drive a really rich wrestling game.

This game is wonderfully stupid fun.

Fills the gap I think a lot of people get with King Of Tokyo. Maybe it is the 3D ring that swung it.

Some of the most tense moments in my board gaming experience.  After a dice roll, I have seen people cheer, and I have even seen some people cry.  Players get so into the battle and suspense of trying to kick out of a pin attempt.  I have constructed a whole league at my elementary school around this game.  The students love it!

Luchador is a solid, light dice game of duking it out in the ring.  Overall, game play is pretty light, with players tossing dice into a wresting ring, hoping to roll hits on their opponent.  The unique twist here is that the dice actually stay in the ring, so you'll often try to knock your opponent's dice out with your rolls to weaken them in the current bout.

Basically, it boils down to rolling unblocked hits on your opponent (or countering your opponent's hits), so you can roll a hit die showing whether you drop-kicked, elbowed, smashed with a table or chair, etc.  If you register multiple hits, you may even get to roll a luchador die to pull off one of your signature moves!

You can win by either reducing your opponent's life to 0, or by executing a pin once you've weakened them up a bit.

Overall, just a light, fluffy way to have a few laughs with friends over a nicely themed dice game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.65
Rating/comments based on 2nd edition.

This game is damn good.  Between the boisterous bravado inspired gameplay, the dexterity element, and the smooth tactical options of how you spend your dice - this game rocks.  It fits into that King of Tokyo niche but this embraces the brinksmanship and drama quite a bit more.  We played seven tag team matches the first time pulled this out and didn't want to quit.

me, my partner and son played this at uk games expo and loved it. Just another one of those games you can just pick up and play. We have a lot of friends who don't normally play board/dice games but are willing to try, so this is a perfect one for those who don't want to spend hours learning rules (which lets face it, is what puts most people off). Cant wait for this one, might even pop my kickstarter cherry with it lol. (May even have to buy four luchador masks to add to the fun) Viva Luchador!!

[b]Kickstarter - Christmas 2014[/b] 
Very silly dice chucking game.  The Kickstarter version comes with a cardboard cutout of the ring with standees and an elastic chord that you can fling your standee at other's standees.  That doesn't have anything to do with the game, but it's fun to play around with.

This game does play very well.  Each Luchador has their own special ability and the flavor texts are hilarious.  We've played it as a two player and four player.  I prefer two player, but playing tag-team style can help you heal from your wounds.

It's a good filler game: quick set-up, 15mins play. Will probably find more support from people who have an affinity with Mexican Wrestling. A few minor tweaks would have made this a more interesting game: 
Wrestling Characters with slightly different profiles/damage to give variation, or characters that have special abilities. 

Would agree with the dice comment, the cheap production of the dice will mean they won't last. It's a little over-priced, although I am sure there are people like me who will pay up just because it's Lucha Libre!

A crazy, fun game themed on Mexican wrestling.  

Players simultaneously roll four dice into a small game board representing the wrestling ring.  Any dice that fall off the board are out of play.  Any miss results are removed from the board.  Any pin results may be rerolled before dice are touched, or set aside for an end of turn pin attempt to end the bout.  Players then line up their hits, blocks and counters and roll green hit dice to try and damage their opponent.  Two hits may be converted to the large Luchador! signature move dice, increased risk vs increased potential damage.

A bout ends when an opponent is reduced to zero health, or a pin is successfull.  

Very fun game, easy to get into, and actually is better as a four player tag team match.  Some tactics involved, with a weird dexterity element as you try and roll to knock other dice out of the ring (and out of play).  

Has no right to be as fun as it is!

RATING: 7
Fast, silly fun.  It captures the theme very well.   The ring in the 2nd edition is well worth it.   The rules could be a little more clear in a couple of areas, so you might need to adopt a couple of minor house rules or styles, but it's not a big deal.   Having played both the Basic and Advanced Game, I'm still not sure which is better.   Not sure the added complexity of the Advanced Game is really worth it, but on the other hand, it is a little more interesting trying to lock the combo dice for the big moves.   Yeah, at the end of the day, you are just chucking dice and matching up results, so there isn't a ton of choice to be made, but I've had a lot of fun playing it so far.

If I was rating the KS edition of this game based only on components(2nd edition) it would be a 9 (minus 1 for dice that are not engraved). I am very impressed with the high quality I was delivered. Sadly, the game mainly felt like it played itself, which left me feeling pretty Meh about it. Perhaps if there was more of a push your luck element instead of the roll and match that the game currently is, it would have been more fun.

This was unexpected. I didn't see it at a game store first, or at a major convention. I did Kickstart this game and it arrived before their estimation.

After looking over the components, I am disappointed in the fact that the dice are screen printed and not etched. I hope they have an easy replacement policy. I don't want to hear from the company that these dice should last hundreds of plays, Rolling Freight was played twice with similar dice and those dice are in need of replacement...

Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice is a two-player dice game (with optional rules for four-player tag-team play) based on the popular world of professional Mexican wrestling, or "Lucha Libre" (a.k.a. free fighting). Players start with 21 points of health (or 18 in a tag-team match) and roll custom dice to try to either reduce the opponent's strength points to zero to win by a knock-out (KO) or hold the opponent down on the mat for a "count of three" to win by a pin.

RATING: 6
Luchador! comes with several different wrestlers you can pick from. You'll want to consider which one you use carefully, as it will be one of the few decisions you'll be able to make. I'm sort of kidding but sort of not. You don't have too many options on your turns. Unlike King of Tokyo, there isn't even much of a push your luck element. You roll the dice once and just deal with whatever comes up. 

Nevertheless, I don't have much of a problem with that, since whatever comes up is usually fun. Assuming the players are engaged, they will yell and curse as their luchadors throw table slams and choke holds on each other, attempt to pin, and sometimes just strut around giving the audience a show. It's a dumb game, but it buys into its theme to the point that you can't help but play along. I'd of course like there to be a little more for me to do than there is, but I wouldn't want to bog it down with a bunch of fussiness for the sake of "realism".

I played this but the one time but I really enjoyed it. Much of the enjoyment was, perhaps, due to the format in that It was part of a competition throughout a day of open gaming. My poor wrestler âel Tigre Estupidoâ lost his first match and was eliminated as his opponent seemed to have an endless supply of office furniture with which to wrap around my head. By the end of the bout I was fully expecting to get brained by a coffee maker or filing cabinet!

Overall, the game itself was really rather fun and has some nice components and there are a few choices around how your wrestler will compose himself. Well worth a try and one I may pick up as I rather suspect the Little Fish will like this in a year or three.

Really fun theme, but lacking in gameplay. All the luchadors are identical from a gameplay perspective, which I found disappointing. Also seems pretty unbalanced. Why go for the big special move when the best you can do is 1 extra point of damage? When tag-teaming, it seems to encourage tagging-out every turn.

A dice rolling fest for those who like WWF style banter. Unlikely to appeal to those who don't as there is near zero decision making after rolling the dice. 
The game can be summarised as 2 players rolling the dice and then seeing who has rolled the "highest", which makes the game feel long.

What a great game! 

Mexican Wrestling combined with dice rolling action creates a game that is ripe for trash talking and come from behind wins. 

Sure this game is less about clever mechanics and strategy and all about the enthusiasm of the players and their ability to ham it up and revile in the action - but I love that about a game.

The time frame is spot on and the ability to play tag-team is really fun.

But the game shouldn't be totally discounted as a luck-based filler either. There are some decisions to make and the theme of the sport is incorporated nicely. 

Well worth a look if small dice games are your thing. I certainly rate this over Bang! The Dice Game and Zooloretto: The Dice Game.

2014 Edition Update - Now this is really excellent. The 3D ring may only be a visual addition but it really adds to the spectacle of the game and looks great.

This edition also adds some new characters and each character has their own strength, weakness and special move that is unlocked by attaining a certain combination of dice, which is great. 

The game also offers up some new modes of play. 

All in all this is excellent and makes the 2013 edition redundant for fans of the game.

Super-charming dice game. However, I was disappointed that the signature moves don't have special abilities, such as stunning the opponent and taking damage.... was hoping for that with all the characters in it... still, fun little game...

In the end I'm really somewhat disappointed at this game. I will play it now and then but it won't see the table as often as I hoped. A lot of potential has been missed out in this design.

RATING: 8.2
Fun quick hitter..pun intended.  Better every time we play because gameplay quickens, allowing for more trash talk, acting out of maneuvers, etc.  We track each wrestler's win/loss record.  Despite the fact they are all equal, La Cobra is winless while La Tormenta remains undefeated after 6 matches, with 4 KO's via The Twister Finisher.  Such a blast!  Easy to learn, thematic.  We may provide each wrestler with a unique attribute in the future.

RATING: 4
This rating is for the 2 player game (although I haven't actually played it). We only played the 4 player free-for-all and it was a little too chaotic. The theme of this came through pretty well and the ring all set up was pretty fun to see, but I don't think there is a whole lot to this. The dice were nice and the standees were pretty fun to see, but they were superfluous. 

I'd play it again, but wouldn't ask for it.

RATING: 5
Played a 4-player tag-team demo game at UK Games Expo 2013. 

Kind of fun, but the game consists only of rolling dice with a simple dexterity element and virtually no decisions - the main one is whether to try to tag out or not each turn in the 4-player game. Totally setting- and group-dependent - the game designer, who was running the demo, was great at stirring up the atmosphere, and you really need to crank up the trash-talk for this to be worth playing.

RATING: 4
25 euro for a very little box with little material in it! The dice are clearly from China: they weigh almost nothing and aren't engraved, so after a while, the pictures on it won't be visible anymore.

The game itself: boring! You throw dice and that's it: no choices to make, just compare results and do the maximum damage you can. 

And why create 6 different character figures that all do exactly the same? Just add the 3 special moves onto the overview card and save yourself 6 cards.

This game really doesn't have much going for it. Battling with dice, trying to see if you can push the opponent's dice out of the ring, is about the most fun part of the game.

Would be a stretch to say I'd ever play this one again.

RATING: 4
Dice game similar to "King of Tokyo" with the difference that two players through their dice simultaniously. Then the opposing dice may neutralize or invert each other. Me not being a wrestling fan, I see it as a luck game with some propability calculation and a little bit tactics.

This is a great, underrated 2 player game with fantastic components! It has a similar feel and weight to King of Tokyo, but I think it's a better 2 player game than KoT. The game is admittedly weird with 3 players and I've yet to try the 4 or 6 player tag team versions, but so far I really like it! I would definitely encourage fans of light, dice games to check this one out. I'm hoping for expansions! :)

RATING: 8
This wrestling themed game allows for several types of matches including one-on-one, free-for-all, or tag team. Players roll dice looking to score hits, blocks, counters, pins, or a miss. Hits vary in damage and come in the form of wrestling moves like backhand chop, forearm smash, drop kick, choke hold, chair smash, and table slam. When rolling only the dice that stay in the ring count. Each wrestler has a set of signature moves that can be performed if they score 2 or more hits. In the advanced game wrestlers have a strength (bonus) and weakness (penalty) along with a special "killer combination" move. The winner of a match is the first player to pin or KO their opponent. This is by far the best wrestling game I have ever played and fills a highly desired niche in my collection. I strongly recommend that players use the advanced rules, but most importantly make certain that you only play the 2nd edition version of this game (1st edition is not as good).

I appear to be in the minority here, since the other three players all enjoyed this, but there really are no decisions to be made in the game.

Let's be clear; black die > 2 green dice.

Knowing that, there's really nothing in the game beyond rolling dice and matching up your results with the other person. There's zero strategy, zero difference from play-to-play, zero thought required.

I suspect this is following in the vein of Zombie Dice and will probably be similarly popular. To me, it borders on ceasing to be a game at all.

Awesomely fun Dice game! I love playing this game and it is so much fun and ironically it does get me into the luchadoring spirit.  I love how each thing you do has different dice, and the different mechanics in the game that feel very thematic.  Like, if dice fall out of the ring they don't count, or if you fail to high five it counts as a failed tag and you have to stay in.  Also, every time it leads to a pin we are CONSTANTLY screaming the count down.12-15-2016

Excellent for what it is. A rollicking fun, dice rolling, smack talking game. Made even better with the 3D ring. Yes, it's luck of the dice, but you do have some choices to make and if you use the advanced rules, you can play to your strengths. Good fun value for money ratio. Even better if you liked Nacho Libre!

When you get really into this, this can be actually pretty fun, despite its overwhelming amount of luck. There's absolutely no skill involved with this whatsoever, but games are over in a matter of minutes, so it's okay to play a 2 out of 3 match. Can see this being fun at a bar or with a bunch of drunk friends.

RATING: 2
This is a very basic dice game with hardly any skill to it. The only control you retain is when to tag your tag-team partner in a tag match, and how to roll the dice, that is in how to attempt to knock your opponent's dice out of the ring and make them not count. Sadly this will lead to a bit of cheating as you are actually supposed to roll at the very same time, but get the advantage if you roll slightly after your opponent and can target their dice.

I love the look and theme. I've always loved wrestling games. Sadly they decided to screen-print the dice, instead of etching them. If you don't already have a bunch of dice games and really want a wrestling game, then go ahead, but if you have some of both already, there's sadly not much to find here.

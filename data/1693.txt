In my opinion the problem with this game is that it just takes too long.  A hex-based boardgame is just the wrong format for a fast-paced gladiator game.  I'd like to see this done in a card game format, as I love the theme.  I feel that a card game format would allow players to take their focus off game mechanisms and concentrate their imaginations on the fight and the atmosphere of an ancient Roman arena.

One of the best games in its time.. the simultaneous moving made it exciting.. I had a dorm full of non-gamers playing for a full semester.. and I think only 5 gladiators made it to retirement... my favorite gladiator won his freedom fight.. but was mortally wounded in doing so.. ah.. memories.

Dense rules and excruciatingly plodding play sap all the fun out of what should be a gritty visceral brawl.  This game is simply too much simulation and not enough fun.  I give it points for the theme, but as a game, it completely missed the mark.

I had an unpunched copy for the longest time but decided to punch it to play after my friend expounded how great it was.  Probably could have gotten some good cash selling it, but I buy games to play ....  really

It's a good system not without its flaws.  But I understand they didn't want to over-complexify the game.

High fun factor.  Not sure if it will wear with plays.

Don't like the cagey dance around hexagons.  Silly you can be close to a person and can't attack them.

An excellent game and the best of its kind ever IMO.  This is the only Gladiator themed game I have seen that *ever* succeeded in making a good simulation of the fight instead of simply using a "game mechanic" such as tossing a handful of dice or playing a card to score a 'hit'.  

In this game you pick your move and attack in detail.  Thrusts are directed at body parts, armor only covers certain areas and your opponent responds simultaioulsly and does not just stand there and toss a dice to defend.

IMO, this proves to be much more enjoyable than another dice and card game with a "Roman Theme".

Reaquired after many decades.

Juego entretenido y que es una buena base para un juego mas realista si trasladamos los gladiadores que trae el juego a las clases de gladiadores que se conocen. Aumenta la diversion si nos inventamos unas reglas de campaña y con un poco de documentación variamos el equipo de los gladiadores en lo relativo a como defienden las diferentes partes del cuerpo. Muy interesante la lucha entre el reciario y el mirmilon o el secutor una vez que adaptemos estos dos últimos gladiadores buscando mayor veracidad. En esta web tengo incluida una lista para recrear el armamento y las defensa de los distintos gladiadores, asi como un método alternativo de crear gladiadores.

Hand-to-hand fighting to the death – great fun!  I especially enjoy playing Gladiator with teams.  Rating includes the Billings and General magazine rules additions.  Minimal components and cheap cardboard gladiator figures, but this game should really be played with miniatures.  Games can be quickly decided by a lucky hit, but good play will improve your chances of victory.  I like the detailed hit and wound rules.  Pre-plotted movement rules are the weak part of the game.  Movement system can yield some unrealistic/silly situations as you try to out guess your opponent and gladiators move about in what can appear to be an almost random fashion (close your eyes, move to the chosen location, now open your eyes and see where your opponent is).  Sometimes just getting within striking range can be a problem.  The game could be improved with additional reactionary movement rules.

This is one of those Avalon Hill titles that reminds me of how far game design has come in the past twenty-five years.  There is a good game in here somewhere but the dice rolling and CRT consultation becomes more than a bit tedious.  I made the mistake of playing a four person game which resulted in more than a bit of downtime as the various battles were conducted and the endless charts were consulted.  I actually like the basic idea behind the movement and combat mechanisms but the structure of one chart sending the players to subsequent charts which might require further dice rolls after that becomes draining.

Lovely little game of death and mayhem in the Roman arena. Suprisingly easy game from Avalon Hill means that you can teach it to kids and they'll pick it up quite easily. Lots of dice rolling and table look ups (but I like that sort of thing) gives a really nice 'narrative' game play - 'you've parried with your sword and it's knocked out of your hand - you try to pick it up and I collide with you, you're stunned and knocked off balance and I despatch you with a critical hit to the leg (ie chop it off)'. Great stuff!!

Back before all game mechanics were printed on cards that filled your hand, and before GW invested 10s of trillions of dollars into the miniature dice industry, games were played with things called "tables", "charts" and "plotted movement". Slightly abstract but very engaging, me and my nerd herd played the ever loving unholy shit out of Gladiator through late grade and high school. Great game.

We played this a few times and it was fun for a while, but the plotting of movement and the constant guessing game of where you thought your opponent might move got tiresome. You plot out the movement, and then your character goes charging off like some sort of automaton completely oblivious to the changing circumstances. The game really falls victim to the notion that all tactical combat on this scale happens simultaneously when, in fact, sword fights are more often a matter of action and reaction. There's more Hollywood than history in this one.

"Gladiator" is a a good example of an Avalon-Hill game of that time period--namely, tons of rules to break down what really was pretty simple: man-to-man gladiatorial combat. Now if somebody could take the essence of this game and streamline the rules, I still believe they'd have a contemporary game that could have a wider appeal than the original. (On that note, I think Knizia did a nice job designing "Clash of the Gladiators."). 

At the time I played it (1980s), I waded through the myriad rules, enough to actually play out some combats, but man, it was as complex a game as I cared to play at that time. I could never see myself wading back into that morass again. When I think of games like this from this era, no wonder computer games won out.

Interesting game system, valient attempt to capture the split-second interaction of period combat.  Especially elegant side-effect when having to track how aggressive your gladiator has been with respect to resources committed to attacking versus defending.  The game design probably deserves a higher rating but the subject matter just isn't all that interesting to me.  I'll probably end up ditching this one.

I used to play this game a fair amount.  I particularly remember having one retarius in the campaign game who received a fatal wound (one of the wounds which kills you after the battle but not right away) on his 10th match and the resulting questions about whether or not he would get the gold bonus for dying a free man!

Fun game and I spent a LOT of time playing it.  Can't think I would ever dig it out these days, though.

I picked this game up years after I played Circus Maximus when I found out that it goes hand in hand with it.  It actually was sold with it years ago but when AH bought the rights, they packaged them separtly.  I had very high expectations for this game but I just found it to be harder to understand and keep up with than Circus Maximus.  On its content, I'd rate it an 8 but because it didn't meet my unrealistically high expectations and I continued to compare it to CM, I have to knock it down a notch.  I would still recommend the game, especially to those who don't have the expectations of CM and can enjoy it for what it is.....a bloody game of hand-to-hand combat.

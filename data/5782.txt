Great little game, ideal as a filler, but fantastic as a game to play a load of times in a single session. We play 5 pence ($0.10) per point, which makes you care about every single point.

Update:  I am now completely addicted to this game and try to get people to play whenever I can.  I introduced some people to it last night and they loved it.  One kept saying "this is a GREAT game".  And they were already gamers, so they knew what they were talking about.

OK as a light filler at the end of the evening. Some interesting decisions to make - they are probability (luck) related but this is not the type of game to go working out the maths so just rely on judgement.

150909 A great design.  For a 2P game try some of the alternate scoring cards, the standard one doesn't work great 2P. I think the one that maxes out your points when you get three or four of a kind really creates a nice tension.

130929 I really do respect this game a lot.  Its just such a clean simple mechanism.  That said I'm now open to the idea of playing Zooleretto or Aquaretto just to see what he did to expand on it.  Maybe I'm in a good mood lately or something.

121231 Still the best of the family.  I don't think any of the extra crud adds anything to the gameplay.  Not even interested in trying the other stuff, would rather just play a few games of this.

100419 It just clicks.  Its just an elegant fun game, I'm happy I tried this game before buying Zooleretto...much prefer this.

This is a perfect information game, where everything is displayed for all to see. The only randomness lies in what cards get drawn, but the crux of the game is deciding where to place drawn cards in an attempt to damage other opponents, or to take one of the piles.

Simple rules, straightforward mechanics, and quick play time make this another gem (even if it is an older title) from Michael Schacht in our home.

A nice game for the level of simplicity. I've only played once but want to again... that must be a good sign! UPDATE: this game works so well with non-gamers. I played it a few times with some friends who rarely game and they all had a blast. It's a lot of fun to make the agonizing decision of who to help the most... and the surprise when they choose another stack is great too. Schacht does it again!

Coloretto a game with an interesting honors position in my collection: it is the game I've given away the most.  It's a light, packable card game, so it's great for travel.  I've given a copy to my parents, to friends, and to a scouting troupe while backpacking the Long Trail in Vermont.

I like Coloretto mainly due to the high level of interactivity and screwage in the game.  You're constantly looking at what will benefit you and others, and trying to take the things you simply can't let someone else have.  Because of this, you're always looking at the cards in front of yourself and the cards in front of the other players, constantly scanning and analyzing before choosing which pile you're going to pick up or where you're going to drop this particular card you turned over.  There's a lot of "pissing in your opponents Cheerios".

It's a bit too simplistic somehow over all, but I'm going to keep it because of that fact. Make sense? No? Let me put it this way: I keep games because of the variety of people I encounter: some are gamers and some are not. This is a game for the latter and not the former. It will pass the time and it kinda fun - certainly easy on the mind and easy to carry along. But not great - not in my opinion.

It is a huge understatement to call Coloretto just a nice little filler. It is true that Coloretto can be taught in 3 minutes and it is super fast and simple to play. But what is astonishing is that every turn you are facing decisions with no obvious answers. This is what sets Coloretto apart from lesser games.

Your decisions have a big impact on the outcome of the game. Luck also plays a recognisable although not always decisive role in the game, so that less experienced players have a chance as well. Thus Coloretto fits the bill for most gaming groups. It is not the meatiest of games so you cannot expect long learning curves or years of analysis, but despite this apparent simplicity it can be throughly enjoyed by hardcore eurogamers as well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A little gem. You cannot imagine how many interesting decisions the players have to face in the game, until you did not try it. So give Coloretto a chance. Its cheap, the rules are simple and the gameplay is tremendous. Recommended to EVERYBODY.

A pretty light, fun filler card game.  The cards are really nice and I like the set collection aspect and the place the cards so as not to benefit your neighbour bit - a bit like San Marco in that respect.

Wow, what a simple but fun game! My family and wife's family couldn't get enough of this during the holidays. You can only make 2 decisions (with a third possible if you choose to take a card), but those decisions are so critical every turn. Definitely a bit luck driven, based on what cards are turned over, but playing 4 games in a match makes the luck even out quite a lot. Tons of fun for all ages!

Chameleon coloured cards. You look at a card, place it face down on rows (maximum 3 cards per row), everyone does the same, then collect the row you choose. Objective is to collect the same coloured cards to score big - only the top 3 scoring colours for each player is considered.

Very random game. Need some luck. And sometimes it's fun trying to stop other players to get their specific colours. Short and sweet.

A fun game to play with non-gamers and children.  Play color cards so when you draft a pile, it's one that you want, while at the same time, you are screwing with piles the others may take.  You get points for 3 colors and lose points for any others.  The point values grow exponentially for the same color.  It takes 5 minutes to teach and 10 minutes to play and fits in a jacket pocket.
Take it for what it is and enjoy.

I picked this up only recently to take on a family trip. It was around $11 and I figured it might be a good investment. I bought Zooloretto for my sister this past Christmas and my family has enjoyed that game. I enjoy it as well, but I don't like it enough to own a copy for myself. This game will scratch that itch when I am away at school and not able to access my sister's copy of Zooloretto. The gameplay is fast and interesting. I also like that it comes with two different difficulties built in (the gold/easy and the grey/difficult side of the score cards). This is a great little game and definitely one I would recommend any gamer has in their collection.

An incredible little game! So simple, you can start playing in less than 5 minutes. One of the best filler games I've ever played. Although you always know what your opponents' have, you're never entirely sure just what they're going to do; and therefore you're sweating as to whether to grab a row of cards (and bow out of the hand), or stay in, and possibly lose that precious row. Highly competitive.

I definitely appreciate the speed and ease of playing Coloretto over its cousins Zooloretto and Aquaretto. This is growing to be my favorite Retto game because of how well it executes the push-your-luck set collection formula with a small footprint in both playtime and physical space. It's doing what a light filler game should do.

Tienes que especializarte en tres colores de los 7 de la baraja a través del set collection. Todas las cartas que no pertenezcan al grupo de tres colores, te restarán puntos al final de la partida. De 2-6 jugadores y aunque es mucho mejor cuanto más amplio sea el grupo, a dos también luce bien ;)

A quick light card game. I really like the decisions you have to make when placing a card down or whenever you decide to take a row. I also like how the scoring works in this game. I've only played Coloretto with two players, and we both had a good time with it. I'll be pulling this game out the next time we have four people over!

A simple, elegant game with interesting decisions and interactive, multiplayer tension. For a quick 20 min game, this is as good as it gets. The only detraction for me is the uninspired art.

A fantastic filler. Simple gameplay but leads to some interesting decisions being made. Almost like RA in the sense that different sets of objects are worth different amounts to different players, but without auctions and less complex scoring.

Played (3/11/07) using the freely printable 'expansion' with the extra deck of scoring variations and this really mixes things up in a good way. How you thought to play best changes greatly and really adds to the fun.

After the first explanation of the rules: "Huh?" 

After the second explanation: "Okay, but I don't see the point or any strategy." 

In the second round: "Oh...heh heh heh" 

After the three games were over and scored: "I liked that game!"

After another game, this is showing definite possibility to become a favorite.

UPDATE: After 15 games, definitely a long-time favorite. Quite relaxing, which is surprising, given how nasty the game can be.

RATING: 8.2
Light beautiful card game that's fast and easy to play.You must get, from the number of colours available (depending on the number of players it changes from 7 to 5), the more cards you can but only in three different colours that will provide you with certain points depending on the number of cards for each colour. The colors you get different from the three you chose to collect will subtract points from your account the same way the other add points to it. I love playing it with three or more players, but the two player version works fine for me too.

FAVORITE FILLER CARD GAME RUNNER-UP

2-5 Players (Best: 4) / 30 Min / Weight: 1.29 
Type: Family

One of my favorite filler card games. I used to play it a lot with my non gamer wife and friends. Easy to learn and quick to play. I used to own Zooloretto since I like this game a lot, but trade it away. I prefer Coloretto to Zooloretto.
Two major thing I really like about this game are
1. I-cannot-get-the-card-which-I-just-revealed mechanic
2. Scoring method.

I think both are pretty unique mechanics which is not used in many games.

This is my favourite filler.  It is taught easily, understood easily and played easily.  Overall, very easy!  

There are some tough decisions here as well, set yourself up for a nice row or try to ruin someone elses.  Pick up the row with two cards or go for broke and turn over a third.  Ok, not tough decisions, but at least you feel as though you have to put some thought into it.  This also scales well between 3 and 5, though I prefer it with more.  Highly recommended!

[i]Posted: 4/11/06, Rated: 7[/i]

[i]Coloretto[/i] is a fun, light filler game.  It is easy to teach, and plays very quickly.  It has elements of strategy in the card drafting (creating piles of cards that your opponents may select) alternating with a "push your luck" style if you are the last person to select a row.  Do you fill it up completely, hoping for something good, and risking an extra card that you don't want?

My sons (ages five and seven at the time of this writing) were playing well right off of the bat.  Probably closer to an "8," but I'm taking off a point for the lack of official 2-player support.  The score might creep up there after I have an opportunity to try one of the 2-player variants listed here on BGG.

Quick and easy and oh so mean little game.  Quite a gem.  I like this as much as I like 6 Nimmt!, and more than Typo!---which gives you numbers, colors, and letters.  :)
  
I keep this game around for much of the same reasons as 6 Nimmt!, plus it is different from 6 Nimmt! in strategy and scoring and provides variety.  Also, the chameleons really get people involved, and I like owning a game that uses color, yet is very friendly and usable for the colorblind!

Great little card game.  This worked well to play at work during lunch.  I think it works best with near max players because of the ensuing table talk.  I don't think this would work as well with a quiet group.  The mechanics are still sound.  The quiet group would turn the game into a lot more cut throat experience that I don't think works well with a game that is partially luck based (cards).

When people talk about movies one of the classic comments that someone will always make is that sequels are never as good as the originals.  In the board gaming world I believe sequels (completely independent games, not expansions) aren’t quite as common as they are in the movie world, so I don’t know if there is enough evidence to support the same theory for sequel games.  One of the most notable sequels in the board gaming world is Zooloretto because, despite the fact that it was based on a game that already existed, it won the Spiel des Jahres award.  As a result I came upon Zooloretto first and had already played it quite a number of times before ever checking out the original.  Now that I’ve played Coloretto, though, I must say that the whole concept of “sequels aren’t as good as the originals” might indeed hold true for board games.

What Coloretto pulls off is giving me a similar feel to Zooloretto but without all the unnecessary extras.  It hits you with tense decisions early and never seems to stop.  When should I take that row?  Can I afford to wait and add one more card, or will one of my opponents snatch it up before my turn comes around again?  The strategy just seems to have more depth in this game.  The problem is that collecting animals for a zoo is a much more compelling theme, so Zooloretto holds more attraction for my family and friends.  The lack of theme (collecting colors of chameleons) is definitely the weak point of this game.  The art is brilliant, and I was surprised that the game worked as well with 2 players as it did with 4.  Unfortunately, the fact is that I really don’t have room in my collection for every -etto game, so I doubt this one will be added.  Even though I might prefer to play this version it just can’t compete with the sequel for my family’s attention.

RATING: 8
Among those "filler" games this one is a bit special although simple.
Firstly it can easily develop into a night session where everyone at the end of each game will just add up points they have and set a goal for winning like for example 100 points or 200 and then you just play every game and try to get as much as possible and getting everything even more interesting as you know that every point you score will help you getting there, so it matters.
Otherwise really nice game. Woul have maybe wishes for a bit better components ( cards) and perhaps a bit more of them to enable easier integration of the 6th player. But none the less. Coloretto is among those filler games really a nice shining example on how with a few mechanics you can make it work!

I once thought that this was a great gateway game, but it has since lost a bit of its luster with me after more plays.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Interesting card game, but at this point, I think other games have taken the same idea and made it more interesting.  I had fun, and would play again, but it does show its age.  I think If this was one of the first games I had played when getting into the hobby, I probably would of liked it more, however I played games like this before playing this, so it just wasn't as interesting.  Need to still try the "advanced" game, which actually should make it a bit more interesting.

First playing.  It's fine for a quick game while waiting.

This one can get tense.  You have to decide if what is out there is a) gonna come back to you and b) if you think it will, will it get sullied by something you don't want.

I don't play this as much as I should...I think I need to drag this one out.

Well, after 7 years I pulled it out to play.  Bumped the rating up .5.  Great game that needs to be on the forefront of filler playing games for game night.

After 4 players game, I upgrade my rating from 7 to 7.8 because it's more chaos and you start to share same positive points colors with other players, it raises the strategy.

Great replayability, so great purchase.

My whole family loves it.

* Update * 

Coloretto was my first filler when I became a boardgame geek and I loved it but after later have discovered hundreds of other games Coloretto start to look more on the average level so I downgrade it an keep it with a deserved 7.

*update*

Owned for 9 years, played last time 8 years ago. That alone justifies its sale. But, now that I have kids they would play Zooloretto Mni over this always. Keeping Coloretto would mean only that I have had emotional reasons.

An average push-your-luck & hurt-your-neighbor card game. Coloretto has more randomness and luck-of-draw than I like... especially if people don't shuffle the cards well. When it comes to games that penalize you for collecing a rainbow of colors (i.e. you get positive points for 2 or 3 colors and negative for the other colors), I prefer the game "M".

This probably deserves a higher rating, but I'd always rather play Zooloretto as it provides more flavor, more options, and more opportunity for strategic play.  And Zooloretto plays in under an hour as well, so no sense in not playing it instead.  But, prior to Zooloretto's development, I'm certain that Coloretto's great mechanics stood out and gave an otherwise ordinary set collecting card game an honored spot in a game collection.

10 plays:

Very catchy, elegant and satisfying! Light but with a nice touch of tactics and subversion of your opponents. 

There's something deeply satisfying about the depth of play achieved by such a simple set of decisions, where the turns flow easily but a good strategist will find plenty of opportunities to take an advantage. 

Unfortunately, kids I have introduced this to haven't taken to it as much as I would expect. I think the lack of theme keeps it from coming off the shelf more.

Instructions are incredibly bad!

I want to play this a couple of times with adults before I review it, but played with the kids, this game is fantastic!  Both of my 7 year olds immediately got the game (well the mechanics if not the strategy) and pretty quickly got the strategy as well.  It is a card game and there is a significant amount of luck based on how the cards pop-up.  However, there is enough skill to keep the game interesting and it plays quickly.  Also, it doesn't take up much space at all.  Right now, this is my favorite game to play with kids after homework, although I suspect they may prefer Bandits.

Have played a few times with adults -- strategy seems pretty quick to figure out.  The only good thing about this game is its a quick filler (5 - 10 minutes) that goes up to 5 players. I still think its a great game to play with kids and it is very portable.

Have burned out on this game unles playing with kids but with kids I'd still recommend it.  Plus its compactness makes it a great game to travel with.
Adult Play = 5; Kid Play = 10;

Mar-2015: purchased the extra-cards expansion from the BGG store last year and it revitalized it for me.  Although they only introduce small changes, it's enough to keep players from always playing the same strategy.  Rating back at an 8 and happy to play with adults.

[i]Colloretto[/i] is a light little filler game for 3-5 players.  Basically, you collect cards in multiple colours.  You score for the three colours that you have the most, and lose points for all other colours that you collect.  Collecting more than three colours is very hard to avoid.

I thought [i]Coloretto[/i] was fun the first dozen times I played, but the game really has limited strategic choices, so I found that the game has become very repetitive.

This game is so extremely light that at first it seems almost childish, but it has enough going for it to hold your attention for the duration of the game. You can see how aspects of this have found their way into other Schacht designs (Zooloretto obviously, but also Hansa and even Mondo). I prefer the "grey side" scoring which penalizes large sets to the normal version. 

This is a great game to play while someone else sets up a real game, or if you just have ten or fifteen minutes to kill and want an entertaining and mildly engaging, non-confrontational experience.

Our two-player game felt very dry. I basically lost because I took on a fourth color; my fiancee was wise and never even risked taking anything other than the first three colors she chose. Repeated plays might reveal deeper strategies for two, but this game probably benefits from more players.

UPDATE: 4 -> 6. This game has become more fun. I think we might be carrying over some emotion from Zooloretto.

This is a very good wee card game, full of tricky decisions.  While some of the painful outcomes can be down to luck, more often than not you only have yourself to blame; you and that 'friend' who just landed you with a handful of garbage.  Great fun.

The cards are ugly and the theme is a joke, but this game is very easy to pick up and teach, scales well from 2 on up, and requires real thought to play well.  Not to mention that it fits in a jeans pocket.  For less than $10 on-line, no collection should be without it.

A good take on a pseudo of "I cut, you choose" type of mechanism.  Game play is very very simple.  On your turn, you either draw a card and add it to a set, or take a set.  So, there's a push-your-luck trade off between trying to get more for yourself versus setting up your opponents with a good set.

A very simple and good filler that is accessible for everyone.

While I rated this game a 6, keep in mind that I played this quite a bit (only started to record game since the end of 2013) and still grab this when playing with people relatively new to the board/cardgame hobby. It's easy to teach, quick to learn with enough room to make some interesting choices during the game, once you know what you're doing. That said, after 20+ games it lost a bit of the challenge for me personally, making it a bit less enjoyable.

Another good, fast, easy, small card game. Rules are really simple and give enough to the gamefun. I like when you choose to wait or take fewer cards and make other players take cards which give them minus points for to many colours. Works with 2, but it is much much better with more players. All that in like 15 minutes of single game makes it not bad choice for a filler game.

Purchased while waiting for a seat at Outback.  (5/8/10)

Played just 2 days after buying it, which is shocking for me.  Why did it take me so long to buy this game though?  I love Zooloretto and Aquaretto, and this is such a fun little family friendly (when your family will only play card games).  I can't wait to play it with my inlaws.  Such a lot of fun.  We played it 3 times in a row the first night of playing it.  This is not like my wife at all to want to do this.  Tagged as a 7.5 but may tend a little upwards if it doesn't end up getting overplayed.  Much fun.  (5/10/10)

Played last night with the in-laws and they love it.  I was worried about both of them during the game but we played 3 games in a row and both said they were glad we had found a new game that they liked too.  Raised to an 8 because of this and the fact that I seem to do quite well at it.  (5/14/10)

This seems like a good filler game. I like the game, but there doesn't seem to be a lot to it.

Grant Rodiek really likes this game. I guess I haven't figured out its charm yet.

We haven't played the advanced scoring side, yet. We also probably don't have enough plays under our belt to really understand the strategy, either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like how the tension is all about how competition is bad. My scores are higher if I can avoid competing for cards with the other players. Conversely, my opponents will have lower scores if they are competing for cards with each other. And during the game I do my best to make those two things happen.

However, if there are enough players at the table just hoping to get lucky by filling up their boats every time, then all the skill in the world won't help you as odds are good that one of them will indeed get lucky. At which point the game feels a little silly.

As for the graphic design, I marvel at how they made a game that is all about colours, colour blind friendly.

I guess my hopes for this game were too high, because I got quite disappointed when I played it. I like it better than Zooloretto/Aquaretto because I don't think there's much game in this system and they should have kept it as a card game. Nevertheless, I don't think it offers that interesting decisions. Sure, you need to think what to do; where to place your card and which row to take when etc., but it kind of fell flat to me. However, that's probably also because I don't care much for super light filler games. My familiy likes it a little bit, but that's still much more than I do. I will definitely play it again when we're having a few minutes to kill, but I would probably suggest other games instead. Nevertheless - it's colorful, transportable, easy to teach and does offer some "ok" decisions, so I will keep it and play it occasionally.

My personal recommended number of players: 3, 4, 5

Coloretto is one of those games that just "hangs around" in my collection. It is one of the most portable games I own, and so it gets some play because it's easy to bring along.

It's a set collection game with very straightforward rules, and it does do a very good job of creating tension in your choices (play a card vs. choose a row and end your turn). However, after about a dozen plays, I found myself playing this on "autopilot," and so my interest has diminished a bit.

Light card game but it has that special something that makes it a lot of fun. Its always fun to gamble on getting the right cards. There is room for some tough decisions on when to stay in and when to pull out.

RATING: 8
Simple, light, fast and fun, perfect mix of luck and strategy but with some tricky choices to be made in deciding how to get the cards you want while denying other players theirs. Works great as a four or three player game, not so good with two but still fun.
Good travel / camping game for families.

Picked this up after playing Zooloretto and realizing the most interesting part of that game was the tile drawing and shipping mechanic,  The game is simple, easy to teach and plays quickly.  But there are lots of meaningful decisions to make.

RATING: 6.9
Good game to play with those who aren't big game players.  Easy rules to explain, and they give surprisingly good interaction (in an indirect "screw you" kind of fashion).  

I enjoy this more than Zooloretto that came later.

An excellent filler. It poses interesting decisions, both in placing the card you just drew and in waiting for the best time to select a row of cards. The scoring variant in which the optimum number of cards is 3 in each colour adds another layer of optimisation.

Upgraded to an 8. The kids are really enjoying this and it's a great game that they request and can play quite well.

This is a simple, yet good game.
Kids love it and are starting to understand strategies after only 3 games. Max at 4 can understand the mechanic and plays well without much strategy, but the girls are really thinking about it. A good fun family filler.

Fun filler card game.  It's okay with 2 players though better with >2.

The fight to do well with certain sets and avoid other sets, combined with guessing what your opponents will do keeps this one interesting.  The bell curve side of the score cards is a whole 'nother story!  Suddenly, wild cards are bad!

First play with 5 players was some fun, as it was everyone's first time.  The draw and play to a pile OR take a pile, feels like a game mechanic that spawned card drafting.  After the game, players commented that it is probably more fun with less than 5.
Also, I've heard this compared to 6 Nimmt! (Slide 5, Category 5, etc.), which is one of my favorite fillers, but it's not even close - absolutely nothing alike!

This is a really simple filler game. I have to say I am not a big fan of the lack of theme. Theme isn't most important to me in games, but I do prefer if it exists!!! I don't mind playing it, and admit that it is a good mindless filler, or for when you are pretty tired and looking more for something to do while visiting.

RATING: 9
First plays with 2 players - good game, but 2 players didn't seem to be the ideal number.  For our 2nd game, we took out one of the row cards in the center so that there were only 2 rows to choose from (the 2 card and 3 card rows).  This worked much better.  I've now read some variants here that recommend taking out 5 of the +2 cards and only scoring 2 colors per player -- this sounds like it would work well too.
Edit:  Much better game with 4 players - worked great with my kids.

RATING: 6
For some reason I do not understand, I am very good at this game. At my gaming club (which by the way I stopped frequenting when I moved to a different city), I'm at best an average player, but put this on the table and I beat everyone without even trying hard. I also think why: my opponents tend to play very conservatively and often stop at just a single card, for example a chameleon or +2-bonus card. Such cards are valuable, but only if you have [i]many[/i] cards. And chickening out early simply makes you lose on that front. But I'm not going to explain all this to my opponents, of course... Coloretto is simple to explain, quick to play, and has a mild and fun 'take that' factor. Even after dozens of plays it remains a very attractive cardgame without hassle; it is also better than its boardgame offspring Zooloretto&mdash;at least in its basic form, for I understand that there are some expansions which give the boardgame some bite.

Light filler that is nice to play when we don't have the time or desire to play Zooloretto.  I like that it's very fast and takes almost no time to teach to new players.

The 2-player variation is not too bad - it does work.  But this works better with more players.

Repeated plays has shown this to be a devilishly clever game, and I had to bump up my rating two points.  Really a strong choice for when you want a quick game for any group.

Components: Simple artwork with vivid, distinctive colors on high-quality cards. My recent playing companions have had trouble distinguishing the colors on the cards, but I find them perfectly clear and enjoyable.

Experience: Quick game play with press-your-luck tension, crossed with set collection, crossed with the divide-the-pie mechanism. Easy to break out, and plays quickly.

I enjoy backing out of an auction early, to stick my opponents with an undesirable mixed bag.

Very simple, and a bit on the bland side. I count each hand as a separate game.

051123: After several plays (including some against Matthew Marquand's bots on his website), I find I am rapt with this game. A group of players aged between 13 and late forties all loved it and wanted to play again and again.
And I'm not sure why. There's not much to the game, with a lot of luck involved (in particular, I'm not sure the jokers are a good idea), but it's a truly charming little game, very simple and highly replayable. I'd play this pretty much any time, at the moment.
060403: The gloss has come off a little, but I still like Coloretto as a simple game to wind down at the end of an evening's playing.

This game fits in the following category:  We have 20 minutes to play a four-player game.  None of us have ever played Coloretto before.

On top of that, it's fun to play as well.

I haven't actually played this game in a long time, but I remember enjoying it as a fairly quick and somewhat tactical filler game. It does have some depth to it, and it's not just luck of the draw. When you can lure people in so they grab cards you don't want, you're doing well. When you lure them into grabbing cards neither of you should actually want, then you're doing great. -- Just don't take the orange cards from me, or I will end you.

RATING: 5.5
Card game in which each player scores points for three rows of colored cards. If the player has more than three colors the rest of the colors leads to a deduction of points. Every round the player does 1 of 2 things: draw a card and put it up for grabs in a row of maximum 3 cards OR grab a row of maximum 3 cards and put those cards in his or her scoring area. There are some special cards: +2 points, cards which can be used for any color, and a card which announces the end of the game...which could thus be during the first round. Light game with superfluous chameleons. The colors are all that counts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A style of game I especially like is divide-the-spoils, where a player has to organize things that other people get to choose from.  This game is a slowed down version of this; each player adds one item to a tableu of options until people finally decide that their options just won't get better.

Pros
- good card quality
- critical but simple decision on each turn
- scales well, plays fast

Sons
- Not deep enough to hold my attention
- card counting isn't much fun

Set collection with push your luck. Neat little filler game. Pasted theme.

This is a solid little card game that has scaled well to all player counts. We have played and enjoyed two player games and have found it easy to teach to non gamers. Sinple mechanisms but tense and interesting decisions make this a lot of fun. We like two player a bit better since it is a little less chaotic.

Coloretto is a game killed for me by its young brother, Zooloretto. I love the mechanisms of the game, but the version I had was bad looking and the zoo theme works perfecty on the game. I still appreciate Coloretto for what it brought into aming, but I prefer playing better games.

Simple rules and complex interaction make this a great warm up for gamers and a wonderful, easy to teach game for non-gamers.  For me, this game has a nail-biting, press your luck feel.  Timing is critical; do I take the pile with 2 cards I know I can use or see if it makes it around the table again?!?  More game Haiku from Michael Schacht.

What I Liked:
* Easy to teach and play. More so than Zooloretto or Aquaretto.
* Very portable, just a deck of cards.
* Felt like there was more strategy in this than Zooloretto.

What I Didn't Like:
* Wild cards way too powerful
* As it is a simple game with no theme, if I'm in the mood to play a interesting game, this probably wont cut it.

Overall
I think it is a must have for both gamers and non-gamers. In my opinion, overall it is better than Aquaretto or Zooloretto, I wouldn't bother with them. There is the same amount of game in this for a fraction of the price!

RATING: 5
Good, simple filler. A number of rows equal to the number of players is placed on the table. Each turn, a player can either take a card from the hidden deck and place it in a row (with a maximum of 3 cards per row) or take a row of cards and place it in front of her. In the final scoring round, each player is scored based on the the number of each of  the three colors for which she collected the most cards. Additional cards from the remaining colors the player collected are subtracted from total. The player with the most points wins. Probably good for kids, as well as adults.

Fast paced.  I want to buy this one.  Because you have to keep track of so many color selections while at the same time not collecting too many colors yourself three players is about all I can track with this game.  Not sure if its possible to play with only two, but it wouldn't be nearly as strenuous.

[January 2018 - 7.9]
A great, quick drafting/push-your-luck game with simple rules but some deeper strategy, particularly in gauging what your opponents will take and managing your own stock as to not take too many cards of too many colors. The latter is a mechanic more games should employ -- hitting that sweet-spot score... not necessarily the highest.

This is a nice little card game that has a nice push-your-luck mechanic. It goes very well with my non-gaming friends but it's still interesting enough for me to enjoy a game or two of it. I just wouldn't want to make it the main course of the evening.

[04-08-2008]
Bought the game for 6,49 Euro at a toy shop in Oldenburg and played a two player-game the next day. Still waiting to play it with more people since it's a little dull in the two-player-mode and I know from playing it online against the AI that it's actually a fun game. So consider this rating temporary.

This is a good, abstract strategy card game. It's very difficult to decide where to play your cards, which cards to hold back, and when to take a pile. It's a careful balance of maximizing your points, minimizing your negative points, and screwing over your opponents.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A short filler.  It is a nice game to play once in a while - it does get a bit boring after a while though, because the game almost plays itself, except for the push your luck element of chance.  If you take the game for what it is, a light filler, it turns out to be a pretty good one nonetheless.

"Let's Make a Deal" on steroids . . . .

Great filler game that scales remarkably well for different numbers of players.

Rules Modifications: We've played the "Screaming Castle" card four different ways: (1) blank, per official rules; (2)  anti-wild card--it allows you to immediately cancel an existing single card from your collection; (3) same as (2), but you can wait until the end to determine which card to cancel out; and (4) a "block" card--it allows you to block any other player's single color collection, thus forcing that player to begin collecting a different color (additional cards of the blocked color count as negative count cards).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It's tough when you play enough games that you can have one just directly clobber another.  Money! is just better in every way for this game's exact niche.  Just not really worth mentioning how each and every rule is done better there.

Quality filler.  Players take turns either flipping a card off the deck and placing it on a row, or claiming a row of cards for their set.  Points are scored for sets of like coloured cards, but positive points can only be scored for three colours, the rest are negative.  It's so simple, but very engaging.  One of the better fillers to appear recently.

It works, it's pretty, it's quick; it's just not much fun.  The press-your-luck aspect is frustrating, and the strategy of making all piles equally unattractive to your opponents is just not very appealing to me.  And what exactly is the artwork on the "row" cards supposed to be?  Are the rows of 3 cards meant to be collections of paintings?  Paintings of chameleons?  Either the theme should make more sense or it should just be totally abstract.

This is a fun one.  Simple to explain, tough decisions to make, and opportunities to screw over your opponents!  I also appreciate the fact that they accomodated colorblind players by using visual textures on the card.  Looking forward to introducing this to my friends and family.

A fun, quick game.  I can even get non-gamers who find Carcassonne or Settlers too much to play this.  Plays in under 10 minutes, so it's easy to whip through a bunch of games.  It is fun try to put cards down where it will help you and hurt your opponents, and always challenging to know the right moment to pick up a row.  I haven't played the larger decedents of this game (Zooleretto, Aquaretto), but it seems they fill a different, longer, slightly more complex space.  I like Coloretto right where it is.

RATING: 8
This is probably the best filler-game out there since it is accessible and agreeable with the most amount of people.  It is an abstract game (yet with beautiful artwork!) so it won’t chase more “serious” people away with a cartoony look (I’m looking at you – “For Sale”!) or theme (like “Blood Bound”), nor does it come across in the rules explanation as intentionally confrontational (like “Coup”, “Love Letter” or “Lost Legacy” can).  Oh, but it is confrontational - indirectly; and that slow building push-your-luck tension is what makes the game exciting.  Small card game fillers such as For Sale, Coup, Love Letter, Lost Legacy or Blood Bound only go over well with their respective themed-audiences, but Coloretto seems to go over well with EVERYONE!

Fun game, super easy rules. I think it's REALLY important to play with people who really understand the game. Part of the brilliance is to play a perfect row that only YOU can use and then to continue playing cards to screw your opponents. A poor player can just randomly wreak havoc. This game made my fiance cry, read the session report.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played with 3 and 4. Deciding which row to put cards in is surprisingly interesting due to the possibility of other players taking a row early. I'm a little unsure about tension lasting until the endgame for each player. I'd like to explore it more. There are several official variations that look interesting, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This was a great filler! Really have to balance the desire to get greedy and grab more cards vs playing it safe and not getting the negative points. Usually play as many rounds as needed till full game group shows up - usually 2, so added flexibility makes it a great filler.

Coloretto is one of the rare card games which I enjoy playing. It's simple, fun and it plays fast. Good filler.

Replay value is not as high as I would of thought. Basically the same thing each turn. Play once in a while is enjoyable. Play too much in a short period of time, you easily get bored playing Coloretto.

Strategies are not deep in Coloretto. Interesting when deciding which row to put the cards. Something that a non-gamer would enjoy playing.

I think it's a bit confusing at first to understand why you want to take a pile & how to avoid unwanted colours. There are simply better games that play in a similar manner.

Great filler game. Easy to teach and very fun. You have two options on your turn: put a card into a pile or take a pile. Try to collect sets, but anything after the first two sets count as negative points.

It's one of those "this shouldn't be good because it's so simple" games.

My most played game (At least since I've started recording plays - Parade might be in the same ballpark as I had that quite a while before I got Coloretto).

Anyway, a fantastic, easy, fast and fun game. Some great official variants and mini-expansions out there for it too. 

Highly recommended - Huge value for a small, cheap game.

A quick and light game, but not actually that light as the open display of cards encourages card-counting and brain-burning mathematical calculations. So in terms of the 'fun' level of a light filler, the game doesn't seem to gel. Too dry to be any fun, really.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I own both the Chinese edition and English Edition.

I really enjoy this game. It presents some surprisingly tough decisions for the player to make every round. Instead of only trying to see which pile of cards benefits you most, you are constantly trying to also place cards that don't benefit other players in piles that otherwise would.  This creates a great tension in the players decision making process.

[6 plays] Fun, lightly strategic filler.  We most often play this in just one round instead of the prescribed four, which is too bad.

This game takes two minutes to teach but offers quite a bit of replay value. You want to get as many of three colors as you can while avoiding any others, or the extra colors will subtract points from your score. The tricky part is that when you draw a card, you have to place it on a row for someone else to possibly take. There's a fair amount of tension when determining on which row to place the cards drawn; you ideally want a row of your own colors while denying your opponents their favored ones. 

One of the best things about Coloretto is that it really shines when players get nasty with each other. And since a game only takes about 20 minutes, it's easy to go for seconds or thirds. Coloretto exemplifies the "light filler" category, but that shouldn't put you off from playing it.

Based on dozens of plays. 
+ For some reason, almost all people enjoy playing this game. Is it because of those cute chameleon figures?
+ One of the best quick and light games I've seen.
> The more players, the more chaos. The two-player version is ok, but I like chaos more.
> In case the basic game starts to repeat itself, we can always use some alternative scoring tables.
> We use a variant: players must name a color for joker cards immediately they acquire those cards. This way jokers are less valuable on average.

Updated in 2008 after dozens of plays: 7 --> 8 (this game works every time)

* Played 20 times. Best filler ever. 20 minute game with interesting decisions. Can be taught in 45 seconds and anyone can play it. The artwork looks great too. A variation on the whole "I cut the pie, you choose the slice" mechanism. Wonderful game. A "Must Buy". Perfect for families and non-gamers but lots of fun for gamers too.

SEP/09 - My enthusiasm for this game quickly waned. Doesn't work all that well with 3 players, and game can be quite lucky with the +2 cards. As a light game, it's good, but I'd prefer to get the gorgeous and more board-gamey Zooloretto.

I actually like this with 2 players but better with more.  The game is so simple, but for some reason I always love to play it.  I think the game plays best when everybody plays to get the highest score for themselves otherwise it becomes total chaos when people start taking cards that screw themselves just to screw you.  

I'd choose this any day over Zooloretto.  Zooloretto feels like even if you get stuck with cards you don't want, you can just buy your way out of the problem later.  So a conservative game almost never pays off.  Everybody, just get as many animals as you can, sell, or just put down any you don't want and somebody will win by an animal if you're lucky.  It's a light game, so I want it to play fast.  All the fiddly tiles slow the game down way too much.  I can finish a couple games of coloretto in the time it takes to play one zooloretto. The baby animals are super cute, though, and if you have kids this is the only reason I'd see to get zooloretto over coloretto.  Aquaretto seems like it might bring back the tension I feel in coloretto.

Zooloretto and Aquaretto are loosely based on this, and all three games revolve around the same mechanic. Out of these, Aquaretto is my favorite. Many say Zooloretto is a better and more grown-up version of Coloretto, but I prefer this one. Zooloretto has more bells and whistles, but this plays quicker and I like the geometric progression scoring.

Coloretto contains pretty much all of the game in Zooloretto without 75% of the excess baggage (both rules and components) and is about as much shorter. I've always liked the selection mechanism from Zooloretto but couldn't really warm to the game as a whole. This works much better. As quick card filler games go this ranks up there with the best of them.

PRO - Fun card game.  Moves quick.  Simple to teach.

I don't know what it is about Coloretto but I just can't stop loving it. More astonishingly I enjoy the 2p game more than at higher player counts.

One of the best of the "mechanic as game" games.  There's a nice tension, nearly beautiful, and one can blast out a handful of games in no time.

Only fun if you're playing to thwart your opponents, instead of just minding your own cards. It helps to have at least one aggressive player in the group, as he will easily win unless the other start playing offensively as well.

RATING: 7
This is really a good little card game. By little I mean it is simple to play, no components other than cards, and is over quickly. But it packs a wallop! It is just plain fun to play. We had 5 players, all trying it for the first time. Every single player loved it. My "C" ratings are ratings for card games. An 8C is about a 6 versus Board games (which I prefer) - but as a card game, it is an 8.5.

Likes: Quick game play. Great looking cards.
Dislikes: Theme, or lack there of.

Overall it's a fun little filler.

RATING: 7
A set matching game. The thing that sets this apart from Rummy is the row mechanic where players may either draw a card and place it in a row or take a row and forfeit further action in that round. This forces you to concentrate on what color groups your opponents are attempting to score and decide whether to take the safe row, or draw another card try to sweeten a row for you or poison one for your opponent. 

Pros: Very fast, very light, simple mechanics with deep strategy.

Cons: For me the extreme lightness of the game is a negative. Your mileage may vary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
Simply a ton of fun.  Easy rules, and it never lets us down for some light game time. We've played many times with mostly 4 players, but 3 as well.

Had to bump score slightly above other classics like "for sale", as this one just still feels so timeless.  I may actually get a second copy in case we finally wear this one out.  Very few games will ever reach that level in my collection.

RATING: 7.846
Based on a single quick play; looks like a nice end of session filler to close the night (14/12/08).  Updated: After a few games of Zooloretto, the desire to play this game decreases - would tend to go for other games rather than this (rating decrease to 5). (25/10/10). UPDATE: Strange; still don't like Zooloretto, but played this as a recent filler, and it was quite fun.  So, probably a prefered filler (but not probably 'the' filler - - rating raised to 7) (23/10/11). UPDATE Solid go to filler game (Rating 7.846 Jan 17)

One of my favorite filler games.  It is quick, with easy to explain rules.  The draw a card to put on a pile OR pick up a pile choice each turn makes for interesting decision making, yet it is so frequent that no single one feels like it is make-or-break.

Coloretto is a very nice filler card game that is good for "between game" moments, on the go, lunch periods, or playing newbies who don't know much about games.  You have several choices of piles to place cards and can choose any one of these piles in your turn.  The balance is collecting cards that you want and not collecting cards that you don't.  It's not hard to make decisions, and for the amount of luck in the game, Coloretto doesn't try to be anything bigger than it is, and the luck management in it is satisfactory.  I can definetely see this getting play with lighter gamers.

This is such a cool little game despite not sounding like very much when you read about it. Once you realise that certain combinations are good for some people and bad for others, and learn how you can play so as to optimise that for yourself, you're amazed how much richness can come from such simple play.

I always play this as just one round, which takes maybe 15 minutes. It can be played as a series of rounds and total scores compared, but then you've got a game that takes an hour, during which I could be playing something more substantial. Fillers should be quick! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun card game that manages to implement "changing colors" concept with clever rules (you only get positive scores from 3 colors, the rest will net you negative scores, so since you can't avoid taking 4 or more colors, this forces you to change colors that you want to score with). I prefer Take 6 and Biblios as filler card games though.

This is Zooloretto and Aquaretto, stripped down to their most basic strategies--do you grab what's already available, or try to set yourself up for an even-better payout?  (Realizing that if the payout's good for you, anyone else playing might reach the same conclusion and take the payout before you get the chance.)  The lack of pretty graphics makes this less of a gateway game than either Zooloretto or Aquaretto.  Then again it's cheaper, so it's the better bang for your buck if you're not looking for a gateway game.

[Original comment] Good family game; popular in our game group. (as of October 2004; January 2005; April 2005)

May 2009 -- We haven't played this recently, but I still think it is a good game and worth keeping in the collection.

October 2009 -- Have played again and still enjoy it.

October 2011 -- We don't play this very often, but got it out recently to introduce a new player. It's a good game itself, and a great introduction for Zooloretto and Aquaretto.

2013-November: We have played this a couple of times recently, and still like this game.

Rating based on official 2-player. Perhaps not as deep as with more players. Custom version using Slamwich cards: Slamoretto. And a racy version using Las Vegas hooker cards: Holoretto. And a very portable 2-player version using Probe cards: Alphabetto.

Update: Still decent enough with more than 2, though unpredictability is a powerful force in this.

Absolutely love playing this with friends and family. I have had so many night where we started with this as the beginning of the night, and then just kept playing it. I love that I am constantly changing my strategy and still the games swing from veterans to new players. Simple rules always make me happy, I find that less and less will I tolerate 15 mins of rules before we can start playing. This game can get new players going with one round, but usually takes a full game for them to get the flow, but by then they are ready for another round.

This is a fine card game.  I particularly enjoy taking a row when it is the only match for an opponent.  Only wish there were more cards.  Seems the game ends a little early but I guess that's why you need to be aggressive right from the start.  Not optimal with 3 players.  Two players tend to tag team and bash one.

I only have a small collection of fillers but this might be the best.

Rating is because I think it is one of the better fillers I have. Would rather play this than No Thanks or Tsuro. Can't say I would ever find myself prefering this game over a meatier game, though, especially now that I have played it so often.

5-15-2010: Opinion has grown. I still don't grab this game as the choice over heavier, meatier games as it is still a light card game. But I think this card game is pure genius. Amazing design. Simply amazing game. I take this with me almost everywhere I go.

Simple card game with a twist. It leave me somewhat cold, but a good filler anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Easy to play, yet with meaningful decisions. That's typically a recipe for a good game, one that I will enjoy. This has been a good next step for my kids learning to consider a bit more of the consequences involved in a press-your-luck approach. It doesn't have the cute animals of Zooloretto, but that also means that they can more easily see the impact of their decisions without the distraction of varied wildlife.

Cool set collection, push you luck game with a simple rule set and a small box. A great balance between amount of rules vs fun.

One brilliant idea, pared down so far that it's quick to play and easy to teach non-gamers (though when games manage to last half an hour you might wonder if there are more satisfying things to do).

Preferred variant: +2 cards count as one of your three stacks if you want positive points for them. (Whether positive or negative, they're 2 points per card instead of triangular scoring like the other colors.)

Also, too easy with 3. (Maybe if you took out even more cards than the rules suggest...?)

It's light, fun, fast, and with just enough tactics to make you feel smart when you screw an opponent.  It's surprisingly nasty, non-gamer friendly, and dependent enough on figuring our your opponents as to not give experienced players too much of an edge.  One of my all-time favorites.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very coloful and light push your luck game. Beautiful cards, quick play and some neat screwage factor between players. Can be played by both kids and adults. Recommended for all ages.

If you get tired of the base game, make yourself "Die Extrakarten" (see entry below) to spruce it up each round. The cards give a new interesting twist on the basic scoring in the game, which makes it even more enjoyable and keeps you on your toes even more.

A simple set collection card game, which spawned a host of other 'retto games.

It's a light filler, plays very quickly (10 to 15 minutes in our group), and there's a fair amount of screwage too, which keeps the lunchtime game group interested.

That said, I personally prefer the theme and added extras of Zooloretto.

Retto, retto … kaméleonokkal
Ha már ismered az Zooloretto vagy Aquaretto játékokat, akkor sok újdonság nem ér ezzel az aranyos, színes kártyajátékkal történő megismerkedésed során sem. Az alapok azonosak, kijátszol egy lapot vagy elviszed az egyik sort (maximum 3 kártyát). Három szín pontértéke után minden egyes más szín mínuszban számol neked a játék végén.
Könnyen megérthető szabályok, kis taktikázási lehetőség (a másikkal történő kitolás előre megjósolható, de abszolút nem fájdalmas), ráadásul kis helyen is elfér. Kipróbálásra feltétlenül ajánlom.
Érdekességképpen a 2 játékos változat is jól játszható.
Az általam az egyik nagynevű társas szakáruházban vásárolt 10. évfordulós kiadáshoz olyan nyomtatott magyar szabályt kaptam, ami nem tartalmazza a játékban lévő arany kaméleon kijátszásának szabályait, valamint a 2 játékos verziót. Szégyen.

This is a terrific family game. Simple enough for even small kids to play, and just the right amount of thinking. Plays quickly, with elegant, yet easy to grasp scoring.

Everyone who hadn't played was able to pick it up with ease.  The game requires some thinking and strategy on your part to also see what your friends have to prevent them from winning.  

A short game to play to cleanse the palette or to kill some time while waiting for other games to start.  One I should add to my collection.

One of the best light filler games I've played.  Can be quickly learned, but involves some subtle and deeper strategy that comes out with repeated plays.  It can be mostly about reading and adapting to the style of your opponents (are they risky or conservative, how highly do they value the 2-point cards?), making it much more interesting than it would appear at first glance.

Basically the card-collecting phase of Ticket to Ride stripped down to the essentials, without tickets or track-laying. I would not normally enjoy a game as simple as this, but I played it with my totally non-gamer Mum and she enjoyed it, so it gets a lot of points for that.

A great little card game, and a good choice for when you want something quick (although playing a bunch of games in a row is fun too). I like the scoring mechanic and trying to deduce what your fellow players need (or don't want). Simple to figure out the rules, but contains a lot of unique strategy.

La simplicidad de la tensión. Un juego divertido que te hace sentirte más listo que los demás cuando ganas. Ligero, rápido, simple. Disfruta todo el mundo. Realmente es un juego familiar. Pegas: muchas decisiones son obvias y tampoco hay que tomar demasiadas. Le doy esta puntuación porque me gusta como juego de iniciación. “Padre” de zooloretto, pero el “hijo” es más cerebral.

Right up there with Love Letter as being a very solid filler game.  Easy to understand, plays fast, and offers some good decisions.  All packed into 20 minutes or so.  I can see Coloretto having a place in many people's collections.

Gioco di carte geniale, essenziale e semplicissimo, ma anche intelligente e mai banale. Se non riuscite a far interessare il vostro interlocutore - almeno un po’- neppure a Coloretto, è inutile insistere: avete davanti una persona, che i giochi da tavolo non li apprezzerà mai. Compatitelo e andate oltre.

RATING: 6
Neutral - a good filler.

A little bit static for such type. I admire its elegance: extremely simple but still some meaty choices. Yes, the outcomes are decided about 80% by luck (or at least it feels like that.), but that's 100% OK (even desirable) for a little filler.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The rules are easy to remember, and it feels like there are several different strategies to win. I really like how you have to concentrate on only three colors due to the negative scoring of excess colors. The official two-player rules work extremely well, and my wife has been beating me by a wide margin.If this played with 6 (one more row, one more color [9 cards], and two more of both jokers and +2s [4 cards]) it would be a perfect filler for our groups.

Nice filler, containing the resource-drafting aspects of Zooloretto (but with no money and more limited options for messing with people).
On the other hand the game takes 15-20 minutes as compared to Z's 60-90, so seems like an improvement.

Coloretto is a simple little thing that should really be titled "defensive drafting: the game."  I like the brevity and number of choices presented turn to turn for such an uncomplicated two-rule game, but I wouldn't exactly jump head over heels to get into a playing.  With that said, this is probably one of the better fillers out there.  -Good, clean, straight-forward fun.

The lizards are pretty and colourful. That's pretty much what this game has going for it. Oh - and I like the scoring card with the picture of the single light bulb in an empty room. It conveys an active silence. I want to be in that room with that light bulb and those lizards. 

I don't understand why everyone likes this game. I find it boring and a bit annoying.

RATING: 7
A simple card game that is press your luck set collecting at it's most basic.  You can play a game of this in about 30 minutes including rules, and about 15-20 without rules.  Basically on your turn you can either turn over a card and add it to a group(one for each player), or you can take one of the groups of cards that have already been revealed.  You get points for the 3 sets you have the most cards in, but you get negative points for any sets you have over 3.  Knowing when to stop and take a group as opposed to being greedy and gambling for more is key to doing well in this game.

A very light but good filler game very similiar to Lost Cities with some familiar elements, push your luck, set collection and a very good dose of luck. This plays 3 - 5 however and also has a small touch of screwage possible.

Really like this game. I love how you want to stay in to sweeten a given pot, or poison others, but never can tell if someone else will take the pile you're looking at.  

The game can be very tense.

Can be a bit dry though, and I find myself trying to do a lot of calculations in my head as all information is easily trackable.  I don't have a problem with this at all though, as there seems to be just too much information to do this very efficiently...  In my group, you'd get yelled at if you were taking too long in this game.

Coloretto is a simple luck-pushing game that greatly simplifies Zooloretto: The Dice Game (which in turn simplified the best part of Zooloretto). It's a game where players constantly debate whether to set themselves up for a big score or try to mess up another player, making it an amusing filler game.

I discovered this game online at Marquand.net and played it obsessively for a while. I've since gotten the real version and played it a few times; it will be interesting to see how the strategy is different when playing with humans instead of a relatively predictable AI. I think this is going to make a great quick and portable game.

I never seemed to get Colretto to the table, so I traded it and  Knights for Quoridor in October 2009.

I really like Coloretto but I have played it so much that nowadays I don’t feel the urge to play it again. Great game to introduce people to our hobby, it´s short and has many interesting decisions during game play.

I will play it again with the new score cards soon.   And by the way I recommend it as it is cheap and a worthy addition to a gamer’s library.

Current rating: 7.0

Coloretto was one of the first games I ever played. I respect it for that reason but I cannot, in good conscience, giving it a 7.0 rating. Nowadays it is much more closer to a 5.5. I will play it sporadically.

My main grippe about the game is that you can reach a high level of competence very quickly, but then it is just luck if you win or not. So I feel Coloretto doesn’t have many plays in it. I have not played with the new score cards and I hope to do it soon. On the other hand, as it plays so quick, the luck doesn’t bother me as much and I will play it again I’m sure.

Still a game I will buy and have in my collection, it is a great game to introduce to new gamers.

A super light filler game.  It's made our club's top twenty list for two years in a row.

Lots of fun and it can be a great gateway game too.

However, now that Zooloretto has been published, I doubt that this will hit the table too many more times.

I played Zooloretto first and I think it kills this game.  That being said, Coloretto is an excellent game that if I need my Zooloretto fix, but only have 15 minutes, Coloretto fits the bill.  In the future, should I ever introduce these games to new players, I'll start with Coloretto to teach the mechanic and move to Zooloretto for theme and some more thought to be added into the mix.  "loretto" games rule.

This is a nice set collection filler. You weigh the options of which set to add to your hand. The other players' sets are face up so you know how valuable the cards are to everyone. Another consideration is that you also get penalized for more than three sets. This game is simple enough for kids, but offers enough strategy to keep adults interested.

Online play at the author's website. One of the best filler card games around. The basic idea is to collect as much cards as possible from a limited number of 3 sets. Every set more counts negative. This reminds me of Lost Cities where you also have to limit the number of sets collected.

Set collection meets screw your neighbor meets push your luck. The mechanics are so simple but the player interaction is so high.

Didn't really get hooked on this, though we've only tried once.  The first time I read the instructions I was baffled - they were actually too simple.  I had to get on BGG to figure out how to play!  I know that this game deserves a few more chances.  Perhaps its rating will go up over time.  Edit: I've played some more and there just aren't enough decisions to interest me.  With obviously silly games, this doesn't bother me, but to me Coloretto is just dull.

Card game where, when your turn comes around, you hope to be presented with random handouts rather than random screwage. The whole game feels stupidly simple, but it works, as long as each player understands one basic rule: [i]never[/i] let the guy who plays the purple chameleons build the racetrack in any of the first three turns.

In the online version it doesn't help that the advanced bots make moves that are strictly worse for themselves in order to hurt you or help another bot when you are not in the lead.

Based on 50+ plays.  As fillers go, this one is second only to "Money!"  Like that Knizia game, Coloretto is quick and simple game with ample room for interesting decision-making.  Of course, any game of this weight loses a bit of its glamour after 50 plays.

One of my favorite small games. It is quick, you can teach it to literally anyone and seeing people realize the tactics are very satisfying. When they realize they can block you or make all the rows good for them so you are forced to make decisions that benefit them is where this games becomes much more satisfying. I love this game and see myself never getting rid of it. Highly recommend this one!

A game where you either place a card in a row or take a row. Three colors of cards count for you, while any others you collect count against you.

This is a short, fun card game. There is definitely some push-your-luck in deciding to wait one more turn to take a row. You also have to decide which colors to pursue as things progress.

The lightest of the 'oloretto' games, it is still one I enjoy playing (even 2 player).  For a simple game there are a lot of decisions to be made.  There is certainly an element of push-your-luck in whether you take an unfilled group of cards early or in whether you try to stack up the perfect set for yourself at the risk someone else takes it and you get stuck with a far worse choice, etc.  I've also always been fond of the you want a lot of stuff but not too much stuff scoring mechanism.  I still like Zooloretto Dice the best but Coloretto is sufficiently lighter and different to keep it around as well.  Also a very accessible game for kids and non-gamers that's still fun for gamers to play.

Acquired 2003. Total number of plays ~40. This is a funny combination of tactics, push-your-luck, and keep-your-opponents-guessing. The first round for a new player is counter-intuitive and then folks pick up the game quickly. There's a decent range of interesting tactics for a small, fast, colourful game. And it has chameleons.

I played this a few times one night.  Fun with the per se "screwage" aspect.  I like how the choice of column selection for a set of colors can be messed with by other players.

This game seems simple and there is no point in hiding it. But it can be a very fun pastime, as the tactical decisions that it offers keep players engaged.

The key in Coloretto is gathering cards of the same colour: the more you gather, the more points they are worth. What makes this game interesting is that you only score positively for three colours, the rest subtract you points. This forces you to play carefully, as if you go bananas and start picking cards randomly you can end up with a negative score. Flow of play is dead simple, yet quite hard to explain in a few words, so I suggest that you read the rules online, which are short and concise, and then try Matthew Marquand's fantastic [url=http://www.marquand.net/index.php?topic=coloretto]online implementation[/url].

The meat of the game resides in forcing your opponents to be interested in the same colour combination, while trying to score a combination for yourself no one else is interested in. Despite not having any sort of direct conflict, there is a lot of indirect interaction. As other players are the primary sources of chaos, not card draws, the push-your-luck mechanism the game sports is very satisfying.

The card quality is nice, but what is top notch is the colour choices: very recognizable, even at distance, and with drawn textures, in case someone is colourblind.

If you want a filler for people fond of traditional card games, stop searching and give it a try! Ten bucks will not hurt your wallet and you may be pleasantly surprised.

Is the simplest also the best? In case of the -retto series, that seems to be the case.

Egy perc alatt megtanulható teljesen nyelvfüggetlen kártyajáték, szóval nagyon egyszerű, és nagyon gyors is: sokat mondok, ha tíz perc egy játék belőle.

Külsőre csinos kis játék, szépek a színei. :) A játék célja, hogy minél hosszabb színsorokat gyűjtsünk össze magunknak. A játékosok felváltva húznak egy-egy lapot a húzópakliból, és azokat rögtön beillesztik az asztal közepén lévő néhány oszlop valamelyikébe. De úgy is dönthet a játékos, hogy nem húz lapot, hanem kiválasztja valamelyik meglévő oszlopot, és a benne lévő lapokat magához veszi. Ezekből építi fel a saját színsorait. A nehézség az, hogy csak három színsorért jár pont, a további színsorokért pontlevonás jár. Minél hosszabb egy színsor, annál több plusz/mínusz pontot kap érte a játékos.
Mindenki folyamatosan látja, hogy kinek milyen színű lapjai vannak épp, azaz hogy ki milyen színsorokat gyűjt. Ez azért jó, mert segít eldönteni, hogy a pakliból felhúzott lapot melyik színsorhoz illessze az illető: ha az egyik sorhoz illesztve nagyon jó lenne valamelyik játékosnak, akkor inkább másik sorhoz érdemes rakni, hiszen nem akarunk az ellenfélnek kedvezni. A pontos szabályoktól most eltekintek, de a lényege az, hogy minden cselekedet előtt meg kell nézni mindenki lapjait, és az asztal közepén levő sorokat is, és ennek függvényében dönteni arról, hogy lapot húzzunk-e, vagy elvigyük valamelyik sort. Nem egyszerű, mert el kell dönteni azt is, hogy elvigyük-e most a nekünk kicsit jó színsort, vagy várjuk még vele megkockáztatva azt, hogy valaki belerak nekünk nem kellő színt, esetleg elviszi előlünk valaki más azt a sort, és valami teljesen rossz sort kell majd elvinnünk, vagy - mert ez is lehet - kockáztatva bejön a sorba még 1-2 nekünk jó lap, és majd akkor elvíve a sort nagyon jól járunk.

Habkönnyű játék, kevés gondolkodással, kis gonoszkodással (berakni teljesen rossz színeket a másoknak eddig jónak tűnő színsorokba). Tetszik. Esélyes, hogy egyszer megvegyem (fillérekért árulják), de 4-5 játékossal jobb, mint kettővel lehet, és nekem jelenleg fontos szempont, hogy egy játék csupán két játékos esetén is jól működjön.

Everytime I play it it gets better, it's not only a good "filler", it's a great game with (sometimes) nail biting decisions. If you play it with the right group of people it becomes really strategic and fun. I've come to love this game and I take it to the table as a "full game" (4 rounds) instead of just a filler. I also have Zooloreto in my collection, but I much prefer this.

See comment for [thing=22652][/thing], as we haven't tried it with more.

Update: we ended up getting this as a Secret Santa gift last year. After trying this out with the family, we found that Coloretto definitely improves with more people. There's more tension in the choices and it's easy to teach and get started. We'll probably not play this with just two again.

Towards the end of the night at a family gathering, variety of age groups, too much food consumed, one too many bottles of wine opened, at last its your turn on the stereo (Yo La Tengo most likely) break out Coloretto.  The perfect family game, less than five minutes to set up and explain the rules, can play anywhere, enough choices to keep everyone stimulated and an open scoring system which encourages direct competition. A beautiful family game, if my parents were to request any game it would be Coloretto.  Do not use the f-word (filler) Coloretto stands on its own merits.  Coloretto is a lo-fi classic.

Now if only they would set this game in somewhere like a zoo I am sure this game would take off . . .

RATING: 7.5
Played this for the first time recently and really liked it - have played both its themed versions "Zooloretto" and "Aquaretto", which are good, but the lack of set-up and quick play makes Coloretto perhaps a more attractive proposition for a game of this weight.

Will look to pick this up at some stage, as excellent and highly portable filler.

I think of this as “Ra-light.”  It’s an excellent game of knowing when to run with what’s available, and when to hold out for the big take.  Even more so than Ra, this is also a game of knowing when to accept bad cards along with beneficial ones.

This is hard giving a quote. It's a simple game but very enjoyable, and surely had a lot of success.
You can play it in family even with children.
I was hesitating between 7 and 8, but the point is that the game in itself revolves and is decided, for thinking players, in the first few turns (early/mid game) and ends up way too quickly.

This is a brilliant game. Complex enough for regular gamers, but simple enough to serve as an introduction to the genre for casual players. The rules are so easy to explain and people grasp them almost instantly. The strategy takes a little time to figure out, but a child can play easily without worrying too much about the strategy - a good starter game that we take anywhere gaming might happen.

RATING: 6
This is basically a themeless color set collection game. However, there are some interesting choices of if you have low counts on a certain color whether to switch over to some other color in a row that has some other cards you want, and a little bit of push your luck valuation of whether to take what's available or continue revealing cards. In fact, the valuation of when to just take the cards and run makes this game a lot deeper than it initially seems. Also, it's neat that there are two scoring methods, either trying to get the most of your 6 colors, or trying to get the sweet spot number. (In one, getting enough cards is important, while in the other you will basically want to take as few cards as possible, and the +2 points cards are very powerful). Nothing to write home about, but it does its job as a travel-sized filler with some depth well. The only gripe I have about it besides lack of theme is sometimes where you sit can really benefit or screw you over based on people's play styles.

Haven't tried with 5 players yet, but I like this game more with 4 than with 3 (at least for the scoring method where you want to get 6+ of 3 colors, as with 3 players it is much easier to get 3 sets of colors. With 2 players the different number of cards per row adds a neat twist but having only 5 colors makes the negative points aspect not that much of a big deal, and so while I would play it as 2 player if I didn't have any other game with me I generally would prefer to play something else.

RATING: 6
This is good, faced-paced multiplayer card game. It is high on the luck factor. Its strong point is that it has a screw-you mentality. You play cards to hurt others. When someone in the game makes a bad play, they usually get yelled at. I've enjoyed this game the few times I've played. Its a filler. No deep strategies.

This is a great filler set collection game. It's great online and great in person. The cards are pretty, and it's easy to teach to people.

In this game, you're trying to collect sets of colors and score points for them. There are as many rows as there are players, and you either add a card to a row or take a row on your turn (which removes you from the rest of the round). The catch is that only your three best colors score, so you want to take as few extra cards as possible since they're negative points at the end of the game.

Coloretto is a fantastic little card game. It's much better than your average little inexpensive card game. Indeed, Coloretto is one of those "it foils my every strategy and causes me to make agonizing decisions" games. Most importantly, it does this in a light, jovial, and unfrustrating manner. Overall, it's a fun game. It's fun and it plays well and everyone seems to like it. A great filler.

Simple filler game were you can add a card to a set of cards or you can take a set out on the board.  Once you take your set you are out of that round.  You then score for sets.  The value increase for each card of the same color you get for a set.  But you score negative points for every set beyond 3 that you acquire.  Very simple but has surprising depth for a small filler game.

This is simply the mechanic from zooloretto without the theme so its very familiar. 

I previously questioned whether the other players needed the theme to enjoy this, and as it turns out they don't.

This starts off with not knowing what to collect and then develops into a scrap at the end, which unfortunately does not really last long enough (1 or 2 rounds really). Anyway that part is really fun and you can always play it again. Becoming the out and about game of choice.

This game was re-worked as Zooloretto, which expands the mechanics used here and makes them into a rather fun and thematic game. In Coloretto, there's no theme to speak of, though it's also quicker to play with less set-up time, and considerably more portable. While Zooloretto makes a good gateway game, I'd consider this more of a filler or end-of-night game for hobbyist gamers.

Fun, simple, light card game that has a surprising amount of strategy.  It uses the 'xxxloretto' strategy of picking things (in this case cards of certain colors) out of piles of 3.  Your goal is to have large amounts of up to 3 colors, but anything over that (which you inevitably get when picking piles) costs you negative points.  Fun game for the whole family.  Should appeal to all types.

RATING: 7
Very quick and straightforward filler.  Not particularly deep so it likely won't be pulled out over and over.    However, I like to have a bit of variety in my collection so this will stay in the filler rotation.  It is pretty fun for the short of amount of playtime.  

Don't think I'm really a fan of the advanced scoring variant.  Seems to encourage players to not pick up big piles.  It ends up being who can grab the least amount of negative points or who can grab the most +2 point cards.  Not particularly compelling to play for me since it seems more luck dependent.  The normal scoring version seems to offer more decision making choices while playing and more opportunities to stick it to your opponents. 

You know what I think would be fun - mix Coloretto gameplay with something like a Bohnanza deck distribution.  It'd still be set collection with push your luck, but now not all colors will be equal and would be worth a different amount of points depending on how many you get.  Maybe there are 5 reds and 10 blues in the game, you'd need more blues to score comparable points to red.  That kind of thing.

A deviously simple and incredibly cutthroat game. I don't usually enjoy 'Press Your Luck' style games, but this one incorporates that mechanic brilliantly.

I do, however, think the advance scoring rules have some issues. It encourages taking as few cards as possible, which significantly elongates the game, and severely punishes players that 'push their luck' and search for more cards.

A good game of cards. Every turn you can do one of two actions, they're really simple, either draw a new card and place it in a line, either take all the cards from a line, but it makes you think about your strategy and also try to not let your opponents pick up good card combinations.

Easy to learn and fun to play, a good family game.

I came to Coloretto after Zooloretto, and I like the purity and efficiency of Coloretto more. Every decision is consequential, most are delightfully agonizing, and the entire game is a spare, lean, crouching beast devoid of mercy. It's a beautiful thing.

I found the organization of the rules a bit fussy on my first go-through. but having playing it a few times I don't think I'd need them at all going forwards. A minor quibble.

The cards are gorgeous, and I absolutely love that it's a real, meaty card game in a small package with no BS at a great price point. So far, I'm terrible at it -- but it's fun for me to suck at, which makes all the difference. There's a nut here I want to crack.

Rating based on 2-4 players.

A spiffy filler. The first time I played this (rather early on in my gaming "career") I was not that enthused by it because it seemed rather simple... but I found myself thinking about it months later and picked up a copy. Having played it again, I find the simplicity is what makes the game! It's a plain tug-of-war between "what's best for me?" and "what's worst for them?", mixed with a little push-your-luck. It's extremely easy to explain, plays quickly, and was a hit with my (non-gamer) family. The colourful cartoony 10th Anniversary art is beautiful, so if you've got a choice go for that over the bland, muted version.

If you're playing two-player, definitely play with the advanced scoring option. I think I prefer that option in general as it adds an extra dimension of timing to the game, but with 2 it improves the game dramatically.

It's okay. I certainly don't plan on playing again in the near future.

Update 6/1/14: I thought that this would be a perfect game to play with non-gamers. More specifically, those who like games, but aren't into any kind of heavy strategy. Unfortunately, I found the opposite to be true. In retrospect, it seems like this is a game that a lot of gamers appreciate because it's light and quick. Despite that, it doesn't necessarily turn into an "accessible" gateway. I think it really boils down to the lack of theme, and non-gamers have trouble connecting/appreciating it because of that. Incidentally, I also own the 10th Anniversary Edition, and I'm not sure why...

Played 30-35 times. Down to a 7, which is still good. Nice balance of playing time, complexity, tactics and attention. The rules suggest you play four games. I would never do that. We usually play two these days, or three max. This is a longish filler, not the main course.

Coloretto is a quick little set collection game.  In it players are attempting to score the highest point total.  You do this by collecting lizard cards of different colours.  You score positive points for the three colours you have the most of, and negative points for the rest of the colours.  Whomever scores the most points wins.

The game is very simple, but not unenjoyable.  It's easy to learn, and great as a filler, or to play with non-gamers.  Yeah, nice little game.

I love Aquaretto and Zooloretto so this immediately became a favorite.  Easy to teach, quick to play, good strategy, good interaction but not too confrontational, and a colorful and appealing theme.  I plan to buy a few of these as gifts for friends and it's short play time may ultimately unseat Bohnanza as our go-to card game with new gamers.  I can't think of a good reason not to own this game.

Update: After a few recent plays with the Limit and Extras expansions, I really enjoy them both and love what they add to the game, especially in making it feel fresh after several plays of the base game.

RATING: 6
Game in a Nutshell: Collect cards. The more cards, the more points. The three piles with the most cards are points in your favor; everything else in your collection is negative points.

Played as: 3,4,5 player 

Pros: Good simple premise makes for one of the best multi-player set-collection card games I know of. The luck, while unavoidable, does have some things set in place to help mitigate it a little and is complimented by a reasonable playtime. The luck factor in a way often comes off as a press-your-luck experience. This should have no problem getting non-gamers, at the very least, interested.

Cons: There is that heavy luck factor when turning over a new card, so prepare for it still to have an effect on the game. While there is some strategic decisions, I doubt it's enough to keep a brain involved or excited for too long. There's a significant drop-off with three compared to four players. While it's still playable, the colors seem to distribute themselves more evenly which reduces the amount of competition. 

Other: I eventually ended up with this after some plays of the online version (which I highly recommend). So far it's played out pretty well and worked with people who normally don't like lighter games due to it's generally quick but interactive nature.

Best Use: A fast non-gamers game to play when you just want to squeeze something in.

Set collection with a small push-your luck element. I'm not a huge fan of set-collection type games, but this one plays fairly fast. I like how you try to make piles that are both good for you and bad for your opponent; however most of the decisions are often obvious and the game could almost play itself. 

Update: I now see the charm of the game, although playtime (30-40 mins) is a little too high for game weight, so I will keep my rating as is for now.

The colored gecko card game where you get a positive score for your top 3 colors and a negative score for any additional colors. Good strategy for a simple little card game. You want to place cards so that you don't make a stack that is really good for your opponents while hopefully making a stack that is good for you.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Seems quick, easy and fun with 2 players. Want to play with more.

Better with 3 players.

WAY better with 5.

The fundamental flaw is that sometimes a player draws a card which the next player obviously will take regardless of which row it is placed in. This is only really a problem with the grey side of the scoring card as it's better to take fewer cards with that scoring in place. It's a shame because I think that scoring system is more interesting, being rewarded for getting exactly 3 rather than just trying to grab as many as possible.

Still an excellent filler.

Nice filler card game where each player must choose to take a set from the table or draw a new card and add to one of the sets. Sets have a max of 3 cards giving the game a finite time frame. At the end each player earns points for cards in a given number of sets. Sets in excess will cost points. Plays in 10-20 minutes which is perfect for what's on offer.

This a fun, light card game.  You try and collect sets of matching colors.  The more of a color you have, the more points you get... up to a point.  More than three colors and you lose points.  

The mechanic consists of placing cards into piles in a way that's advantageous to use and detrimental to you.  Of course your opponents are doing the same thing to you.

Coloretto is a game that I really enjoyed as it was simple to teach...very simple in fact. The game plays quickly and there is just enough strategy and tactics that everyone can see the tricky decisions that must be contemplated. I think after a few plays though...unless you are a very casual gamer...there just isn't a whole lot there. It's an interesting little filler game to play with non-gamers and kids or even just to start or wind down a session but a 6.5 is about as high as I can realistically rate this game.

Coloretto is a really excellent filler because it requires a lot of thought, but still plays very quickly.  It combines strategy, randomness, and push your luck very well.  Plus, it is a simple game that plays well with a wide variety of people.

Luck can sometimes determine the game, especially if the last player continues to draw cards and gets exactly what they need.  It can also be hard to get back into the game if you fall behind, but since games are quick, this doesn't feel so bad.  Overall, the pros far outweigh the cons, and for a 15 minute game, there aren't much better than Coloretto.

Fun game from Michael Schacht. Players are collecting sets of chameleons. Trick is that you score points for your three largest sets and lose points for any other sets. Easy to learn, decisions are tough. There are junctures in the game where one has to decide to bail out, or add a card, which in a way reminds me of Ra. Can be played as a tight defensive game, or can be played lightly depending on the crowd. Very good design.

Interesting push your luck with set collection, like TTR but faster and simpler. Enjoyable, though I wish there were more animals than just iguanas.

Plays: 2+

Was briefly thinking of getting this in the past as a filler but not sure if itd be worth it...maybe it would at least be a better incan gold...I feel like the math and decision point is semi interesting honestly.

With more plays, I can definitely see the amount of thought possible - its actually fairly thinky/deep for a card game this short and of this calibur. That said, I think its still too light with too much luck of the draw to have enough of a worthwhile long term strategy. I am hopeful Animals on Board provides the same experience but better themed/pictures. The colors on some cards is difficult to tell apart, and I have to carefully look at the background, and the lid of the box falls off semi easily/is too loose.

Plays: 5+

RATING: 7.9
The central mechanism here, which allows you to either add a card to a set or take a set leads to a game where every turn is potentially agonizing. There's a push your luck element, made more interesting because your bad luck often becomes an opponent's good luck. A superb, approachable card game that beats out Zooloretto, its board game brother.

RATING: 8
Quick, with plenty of interesting choices (many of the "lesser of two evils" variety), this puts a lot of the more complicated and dull Essen releases to shame. Unless everyone playing is a serious gamer, though, take the results with a grain of salt because one bad player can mess things up by randomly giving out gifts in the form of juicy rows or by taking the wrong row (i.e. there are two rows that help him equally, but if he takes one in particular, it will be better because the remaining row hurts the leader a lot more). ***UPDATE*** I think we've been playing this one too often. I still like it, but the shine is fading. I also notice people starting to analyze things a bit too much, especially later in the rounds. This game MUST be played quickly and instinctively or it's just too painful, because then EVERYONE will start analyzing every card placement and turn this fun, 30 minute game into a 90-minute event from hell!

Turned out to be the family card game hit. Easy to introduce to my card playing family - easy to understand but different enough to the run of the mill card games to stand out. I had to leave them my copy!!

Quick play easy game to learn.  Great filler material.

Decisions can be tough, but your goal is to collect big points in three different color categories.  Sometimes opponents will make your decisions tough by throwing in a crappy color you do not want in the group of cards you were eying up, but you must weigh the benefits of gaining two good cards vs. the one bad card.

Simple but deadly.  There is a delicious tension with each turn - do I cut my losses/gains now and draw a row, do I draw a card hoping to improve my chances, do I add that +2 to a row I think I can take or tempt my opponent to pick up another color?  I downloaded the 2 player rules (thanks BGG community!).

Why this is not a 10:
-> After a few plays, starts to feel too methodical for me to want to always play it
+ For me, this currently fits the BGG description of an 8

My favorite filler. Right balance with (pushing your) luck and decisions. You must try to optimize cards in such way that they favor you but at the same time trying to keep them unattractive for others. Simply an excellent filler.

Update (6.10.2007): You can play with 6 players without any rules changes and game is still an ok experience.

Update (29.3.2008): Tried with official two player rules. There are many better two player games. Coloretto is at it's best with 3-5 players, possibly 4 players being the "ideal" number but only so slightly.

Update (20.4.2008): Since for last 4 years I've played Coloretto a lot every year and there is no sign of me getting bored playing it I realized I could as well rise it's rating to a 10.

Nice idea for a portable, quick family game. It's especially recommended for three or four players, the variant for two is a bit thin (no wonder it was pasted afterwards) and five players are too many -the distance between moves lead to defensive play and on the long term monotony.

Coloretto is crisp and replayable; though, expanding it to Zooloretto resulted in a still relatively lightweight game, but fleshier and more balanced (here joker cards are too important for appearing at random as they do).

A little remark: since at the end of each game cards of the same colours are gathered together it's heartily recommended to shuffle them VERY well at the start of the next one.

[b]Coloretto[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I finally played the game that came before the Zooloretto series. It was fascinating to see how designer Michael Schacht too the game play concepts from Coloretto and expanded upon them for Zooloretto. Zooloretto Junior actually plays almost the same as Coloretto, with a few minor tweaks and using the zoo theme. Coloretto is an excellent push your luck set collection game that is compact, easily taught and perfect for younger children too. After one play I decided to add Coloretto to my collection since it is just varied enough enough from the other Zooloretto games and easy to travel with and play at restaurants and cafes.

[i]We've played a lot of the games in the Zooloretto family and I would currently rank them as follows:[ Coloretto -> Zooloretto Dice -> Zooloretto Junior ->  Zooloretto -> Aquaretto. (We own the first three and traded away Zooloretto and we use some of the Aquaretto animals in our copy of Zooloretto Junior).[/i][/i]

I really like this game! It is pretty good as a 2-player game, it has interesting things that can happen in each game! It is however best with more players! A nice quick filler game that seems to prep everyone for more gaming! I love the whole theme of the game, it works perfectly with the chameleon changing colors and the fact that you can change your mind about what colors you will collect during the game! I still cannot put my finger on why I don't like zooloretto though. To me this game is far superior (we'll see what happens with further plays of both games)!

This is mechanically very similar to Zooloretto but a third of the cost and occupying a tenth of the shelf space. The rule set is very simple and the card quality is good (at least in the Abacus Spiele edition that I have). So that's all good.

My experience of the game was very disappointing. I should say that the group I was playing with didn't really engage, but the response to it was poor. We had played TTR and Love Letter, both of which were a huge success so perhaps Coloretto was suffering by comparison. The biggest problem was that no-one really felt like they had any traction on the game; I am not entirely certain that the guy who won even really understood the rules. 

I will try it again with a politer crowd but at the present time this is looking like a Bieber.

Great short game!  We played it with four a few times and loved it.  This is the perfect way to teach Zooloretto (received both for Christmas)-- just play a quick round of this and half of the rules are already explained and experienced.  

Used the official two-player variant tonight in three quick games and enjoyed that too.

50+ plays. This has proven strong as a 15 minute filler as the years have passed and my rating has climbed. It has a nice watchfulness required - whether to take a decent set now before it collects damaged goods, or if you add to it, will someone else take it before your turn comes around again. You need to be careful not to create sets too attractive for other players. It has a positive groan element as good/bad cards emerge and a small push your luck aspect to be chosen when you're the lucky last and there's a spare card slot to fill. Scoring is easy and intuitive. Nothing but a simple draw and collect sets game, but nicely done and fills its niche well.

A bit of strategy and a bit of luck as you collect cards of different colors but don't want to get more then three colors since any color over your third is worth negative points. Cards are played in rows and you must take a row at one point (max three cards per row) while everyone else can see what colors you are collecting. A great filler.

RATING: 8
Simply one of the best 10 minute quick card games out there. The rules are dead simple, but the game manages to pack in tough and meaningful decisions. There is some luck, but I think a bit of luck is a good thing for a game that is meant to be this accessible.  If you and your family are sitting at the table in a restaurant waiting on your food, it would be hard to find a better game to fill that time than this one.

RATING: 5
Mechanically, I think the game is actually fairly clever.  The actual play experience is dull, though, and always feels like making the best of a bad situation rather than actually doing anything worthwhile.  I feel like I can play at near-random and still end up with a reasonable score... which isn't great.

RATING: 7
This is a super-light set collection game that's based on taking lots.  You're trying to take as many of three different colors, which avoiding taking all other colors (and especially duplicates of those colors).  Because different players are going for different colors, the value of the lots varies between players.  With strategic play, you can make lots more valuable to yourself or less valuable to your opponents.  This game plays very quickly and is a lot of fun.

Juegazo de cartas, rápido y sencillo. Funciona bien a cualquier número de jugadores. Su mecánica de "set collection" es la clave del juego y la puntuación que elijamos para la partida será decisiva a la hora de elegir con que cartas quedarnos. Su única pega pueden ser sus ilustraciones pero aun así para mí es una auténtica joyita!

Coloretto is about the perfect light filler game for me, especially with 4 or 5 players. It's great to introduce non-gamers to as possible strategies become clear very quickly and they start to see how it can be interesting making decisions based on a combination of estimating and pure guessing. There isn't a lot of depth, but there's so much to like it doesn't matter too much.

So easy, yet delivers so many hard decisions, it's a very nicely crafted card game. You only do two things, draw a card to add to a row of 1-3 cards, or take one of the rows. But will you make things easier for yourself risking someone else taking your cards, or mess with the other players? It's set collection, but only three colors in your tableau are scored, the others are worth negative points. Very fun, quick, and delivers a lot of tension.

Not logging plays.

What a surprise of a little game! 10 minutes a round, plenty of nuance, scales fine between 2 and 5, and it has some very cool advanced settings. As with any little card game, it feels as tough you're getting ripped off at retail price (12 dollars for about the same number of cards as a standard deck? And they're just colored cards with a lizard on them?!?). Nonetheless, this game will get played again, and again, and again - and that makes this game a bargain.

Has the similar feeling to Ra in that do you go for what's on display or draw a card in the hope to either contaminate another player's holdings (which are visible) or improve your options or takings on your next turn. So part of the sit-com fun is from drawing a card which dramatically stuffs your opponent(s)or benefits yourself. (Unless you do the maths of each player's holdings, card flipping becomes meaningless; there are more meaningful "push your luck" games out there such as Exxtra and Message to the Czar). Played once with 5 so maybe with less the following complaint won't be valid (and my rating may go up): the card drawing and subsequent options after looking at tabled holdings is enforced evaluation on your turn, which isn't good for game pace nor for those who have pulled out early. (At least with Ra, you draw, simply place and evaluate during other player's turns). There is no theme so it is strictly an escalation of numbers game.

In this game players are trying to complete sets of cards, trying not to wind up with too high a variety of cards, as only a certain number of sets will be positive points, whereas the other sets will count against you. On a players turn they either add a card to one of the card piles (which can only accommodate a certain number of cards, so they don't grow forever) or take one of the piles and add it's contents to their tableau. This continues until all players have taken a cart. This core mechanism has been re-used in many many games. Zooloretto and company and Imhotep for example. 

I'm in a bit of a strange spot, since Zooloretto and Imhotep seemed bloated to me compared to Coloretto, yet Coloretto is just too simple to keep my attention.

Wonderful light filler with colorful chameleon cards.
Plenty of tactics to increase your scoring and to piss off other players as well.
[Tip: to make the game even quicker, we just don't take the row card when taking the cards in that row (so there's no need of putting it back in the middle of the table the next round either) but we simply tap the row card to indicate that row has been taken and untap all of them and the end of the round]

Pas un jeu spectaculaire mais un bon jeu. Se joue rapidement selon le nombre de round par manche. Les règles sont simples, se lisent rapidement et sont facile à comprendre. Bon jeu de fin de soirée.

This is a neat little game. It will keep you thinking. It seems to me that the game is more luck than skill overall, but I don't mind it because it is interesting at every stage. It seems to be better 3+ players than 2 players. The additional scoring mechanisms make it feel like a different game each time.

My group didn't like the collecting/set aspect of the game, but it was such a cheap (price) and light game that I don't feel like it matters all that much.

It was pretty fun, easy to play and teach. It seems like it can play like solitaire but also have some interaction as people cutthroat each other for cards they need.

Very casual/light game and thus you should use it at the beginning or end of a gaming session.

One of my very favorite games, and I'm not joking. Yes, there's possibly some nostalgia at work here since it was one of my first purchases. But this game is great. It's simple to teach, comes in a small box, and is a really wonderful intro to incentive management and the hilarity of being a big jerk. 

Unlike many other games that may be more refined, this one actually gets played and requested by loads of different people. Very versatile, attractive, and clear. My wife and I even enjoy the 2p variant.

I've played this probably close to 100 times, just as a filler and time waster for when we had 10 minutes to kill while we waited for a "full-size" game to start, someone to show up, or had to get out of the place we were in soon. It does precisely what it needs to do, and not much more, and that's quite alright.

RATING: 7.75
A neat little cardgame which takes up more place than your usual cardgame. Basically a trick taking game with two severe differences. A. There is more than one active pile of cards in on the table B. You can "choose" which colours give you a bonus and which ones a minus.

Two little elements which make the Coloretto experience unique. There is enough tactics and strategy to make it engaging but not too much to undermine the basic idea of a swift card game. Colours work better than numbers anyhow and Coloretto does that right. 

Nice Filler.

A family favorite - we really like this game.
Simple, quick, affordable (less than $10), family-friendly (young and old!), yet interesting with constant decisions and ramifications. Fantastic [url=http://www.marquand.net/index.php?topic=coloretto]online version[/url], too - a must-play. There are quite a few print-and-play expansions that vary the gameplay quite a bit. This game is a masterpiece of simplicity. It's almost like a toolset, that Michael Schacht has added variants to that totally change the play.
If you have the version with the Castle Gate, a variant is to have it be able to "eat" 1 card of the player's choice at end of round.

Colloretto certainly took me by surprise.  It's awesome!  There is a ton of tension, but it's light and fun and doesn't overstay its welcome.  There are a lot of decisions to make and each decision feels important.  I was not prepared for the press your luck aspect, so it certainly surprised me.  Colloretto may become my new purse game because it can be played quickly, but it's got something meaty to it.  The only reason I may decide not to carry it with me is that I would be nervous to damage the pretty cards.

Great card game.  Simple and quick.

It's the card version of Zooloreto....the fundamental mechanic is the same: you decide whether to take one of the 3 trucks, or to add to the trucks by random draw.  If you decide to add, you decide which truck to place the new resource on.  The trick is to place the resources such that you are guaranteed to get something you need and minimal of things you don't need/want.

When there is only one truck left, it becomes 'push your luck' as you decide whehter to take as is, or to add add'l resources (which could be positive or negative for you) up to a max of 3 resources.

This game is recommended.  Good travel game as it's just a deck of cards.

----------

I hate the total randomness of this game.  Why even make a strategy when card draws have such a large impact on the outcome of the game?  There's nothing more frustrating than when you draw a wild card (rainbow) and your opponent has a high string of 5+ cards.  To no fault of my own, I just gave him a ridiculous amount of points... and I can only do that a few times before I just get completely fed up with the game.  

It may as well be a spiced up Uno.  Sure, there is more strategy in Coloretto, but don't be fooled -- your decisions can easily be trumped by the order of the cards... making this game slightly more advanced than mindless nonsense.  Actually, you know what... Uno is a way better game.  No contest.

--Dec2003-- Fun.  Simple mechanics - the 3 year old can play, even if she doesn't usually win. The 8 year old set seems to take to it readily, and make good choices too!
--02Sept2004-- They're 4 & 9.  They still like the game, and most of their friends do too.  Bumped up to 8.
--Oct2006-- Back down to a 7; not much play recently.

Igaz, időrendben ebből fejlődött ki a Zooloretto dice game, de ez gyakorlatilag igazából ugyanaz. (Azt ennél előbb ismertem meg.) A kaméleonokhoz éppen annyi köze van az egésznek, mint mondjuk a szivárványhoz (totálisan tematikátlan, ennek legjobb példája a +2-es bónuszkártya).
Rém egyszerű kártya felhúzós, sor választás mechanika alapján működik. Ennek megfelelően sok szerencsével és rövid játékidővel, nagyon lapos játékmenettel. Erősen túlértékelt játéknak gondolom.
Egy strandon kb. elmegy kategória, hiszen a helyigénye minimális, de arra a célra ennél vannak jobb játékok is.
Azt hiszem a továbbiakban érdemes lesz kerülnöm Schacht játékait.

I like this a hair better than Zooloretto. It is the same game, but without the chrome. And because of that, it plays faster and simpler. That's a good thing. A good time, and can be played competently by younger kids (8+).

loads of &quot;turn angst&quot;. Simple game where every single
card is critical. The first game in my group where even the non-gamers start analysing their options (which ain&#039;t a problem since there are only 3-5, and usually takes 10 seconds or so).

Love the way the players interact in this very simple game.  

This is what a "German" game is supposed to be -- a simple ruleset that isolates the point of contention and magnifies it, presents variability that needs to be actively managed to excel, forces players to consider the nature of the people sitting with them at the table when making their plays.  Social, quick to learn, rewards good play, doesn't manage the score with a heavy hand.

Zooloretto and Aquaretto generate Mr. Schacht money on this core concept and I don't begrudge him one dollar of it.  But this is the game -- this is the one that you'll be playing 30 years from now.

Only ten bucks!

Very cool little card game I've been wanting to play for years. It was much different than I thought, but I really enjoy the mechanic of scoring only your highest three sets, and getting negative points for anything after that. It really creates some tense screw you moments, which I normally don't like, but in a game this quick and light, really enjoy.

Fabulous little game with lots of replay value, including "normal" and "evil" scoring modes, good for casual and experienced gamers alike.  Much better than its successor Zooloretto, which adds a bunch of extraneous junk to an elegant base game.

However, with an even number of players, it plays better if the person to start the next round is to the right of the last player in the previous round, instead of the last player in the previous round, or you wind up with people getting stuck in a one-person-draws-a-card-the-next-person-takes-that-stack pattern.

Played two games in a row once. 

After a reasonably enjoyable experience I played Aquaretto again and found one that Aquaretto has too much chrome, grinding a light-ish engine to a halt. This one is better at what it does. Sets other people collect are immediately obvious to discern, scoring is simpler and you have less to think about. Might be more luck involved, but it's a filler, so why not.

A nifty filler game which has held up well over the years. The best part of the game is that players often have to poison other sets in other to do well. The included variant, in which the value of sets cap out after 3 cards and begin declining from there, is also recommended. The dynamics change considerably in the variant, with jokers becoming deadweight and +2 cards gaining more utility. The slight downside is that the game is abstract, and gets mathy towards the end.

RATING: 8
[11 plays] This is quick and fun, with plenty of tension if you want to take it a bit seriously. Can be played as a social time-killer or as a quick competitive card game depending on your mood. The selection mechanic reminds me of 6 Nimmt/Category 5, the mechanic of scoring of only 3 groups positively while the others hurt you is clever, and the score progression is the infamous 1-3-6-10-15-21 sequence. Artwork is decent (although the theme of the interrogation room/chameleon escapes me) and the card quality is very good.

Great, quick, simple to pick up set collection and push your luck game. Introduces the central mechanic of Zooloretto games, so makes it easy to teach as an introductory game before moving on to Zooloretto. Though during the time you play one Zooloretto, you could hammer out ten Coloretto games, so I may prefer it even more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Sure it works.  Kind of cold and clinical.  There are elements of Medici, that are just too reminiscent.  I'd rather just play Medici.  I have only played this with three.  Perhaps this game is better with more people.

This best describes how I feel about this game.

Imagine, you get to go to a nice restaraunt. Now meals are lain out and you can choose one. You love Fillet, you like Chicken, and you hate Fish.

Now you can put other things on each plate like different side dishes that you like, or you can urinate and deficate all over each piece of food.

After everyone has released their innards, you get to choose which one you would like to eat.

UPDATE: It is better with 4, but the control feels thin and the frustration is about the same.  Nonetheless, I get why people like this now.

A nice, quick set-collection game. It's the core of all the -retto games, but I think I prefer having the extra stuff that was added to Zooloretto. Still, this is a pretty nice little filler.

--- Summary ---
The deck has cards in several colors (9 each), some wilds, and a bunch of +2s. An "End of Game" card is shuffled into the bottom of the deck.

Each round, on your turn you either draw a card and add it to one of the n rows (max 3 cards/row) or take a row and sit out the rest of the round. The last player to take a row will have first choice next round. If that End of Game card comes up, this is the final round (draw a replacement card).

When you take cards, place them in your display sorted by color. At the end of the game, the +2s are each worth 2VP; the 3 biggest color groups score points; the rest cost you points. Points per set are based on size (triangular progression: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, max 21).

The player with the most points wins!

One of my new favorites, I love the simplicity in it as much as the tough choices. It appeals to my "gambler" side where instead of taking an easy pile I want to know what the next card brings. Great with 4-5, a nice 2 player variant also. There are 2 different score systems you can play after, still have to try the gray side. It is quick, super easy to learn, very fun; sort of a filler game before or after the big game but soooooo good you might not switch to the next game.

Superb, elegant set-collection filler with simple rules and plenty of screwage. The randomness is acceptable in a game of this length.

[RGG 2003 edition] {Animal, filler; set collection, luck-pressing; scalable} Coloretto is a fantastic family card game.  It's very easy to learn and teach. It will be even better if the theme is better fit to the game.  It's fast-paced and has adequate player interaction with mind confrontation. Decisions are easy in Coloretto: players only need to calculate the risks of staying and the loss of quitting. It's a kind of game that the results vary vastly with the styles of players. When playing constructively, each player can get high scores; playing destructively, most players will have low scores.

5p game is more interesting - usu. it's to disturb colours of other players because one has less control to develop one's colours. 3p game is more tactical because one can control colours more easily - one sometimes can collect 2 sets of 6 cards. 

I don't mind collecting some 'bad' cards; usu. I can still have net gains. I try to take a row with at least 4pt gain - either net gain or gain from disturbing others.

Coloretto is my favorite filler.

What a great little 20-30 minute filler game.  Like Carcassonne, it lulls people in with its bright colors and friendly-looking chameleons, but this is a harsh drafting/screw-your-neighbor set-collection game.  The game is MADE by the scoring mechanism, which penalizes you for spreading yourself across too many colors; any sets you have past your best three are negative points at the end.  While the rules suggest playing several rounds in a row and adding scores, Lost Cities-style, I find that this functions well as a single, stand-alone game (in fact, it's a decent enough length that usually once in a row is enough).  It's incredibly quick and easy to teach and catch onto, so that new people have a decent chance of playing well their first time.  Easy to introduce family and non-gamers to.

COLORBLINDNESS NOTE: I avoided this game for awhile due to its name, but great news: it is totally and utterly colorblind-FRIENDLY.  All the cards have some background "texture" (gravelly-looking, wood patterning, etc.) that make them easy to distinguish even when colors are similar.  Kudos to the makers for this smart move.

Played 30+ times. Good game. No theme :) but some subtle tactical play for a good quick filler.  Easy to learn and play.  Colorblind approved, because each color has a different background (girlfriend approved) 2010/01/15

RATING: 7
Never quite know what to make of this one. Usually just think of it as an in-between filler, but some games can be really deep in strategy. The complete lack of a theme though makes me realise what a sucker I am for some kind of story behind my actions, no matter how lame it might be.

This is a fast game of collecting sets of coloured cards.  When the game ends, 3 sets of colours give you positive points and the remaining sets give you negative points.  There are two scoring systems, a beginner and advanced.  I highly recommend the advanced system as it makes for a much more interesting game.  The game is very fast and is a great filler game.

The online version convinced me to pick up a copy.  Very impressive.  It's definitely a psychological game.  In a way, it reminds me of Diplomacy. I know that will confuse many people.  But the connection I'm making is the decision to put cards in particular rows. Do you WANT someone to take a certain row, and thereby sweeten the pot?  Or do you put a poison pill in there instead?  In Diplomacy, you have the same kinds of decisions to make...only it makes people angrier. =)

MAY 2008 - This was my first request and purchase in the non-standard gaming world. I was introduced by a co-worker gamer with a few other co-workers when at a convention and really enjoyed it.

Okay, my five year-old niece (whom i have never seen really interested in anything except Barbie and throwing temper tantrums) loves this game.  It has almost replaced Time's Up as the go-to game for family gatherings, and it plays fast enough that I don't really mind.  In the end, though, it is a pretty simple card game, with very little actual thinking required.  The cards sure are pretty, though.

I prefer this to Zooloretto, not because of the theme (Zoo has color beat there), but because of the straightforward presentation. The concept works well as a card game, and I appreciate that it eschews any fluff. Otherwise, the basics are all there. It's a push-your-luck style game, but with some room to tempt the other players by arranging the various batches "just so." The extra mind-game dimension is one I appreciate compared with other push-your-luck games that tend to rely exclusively on dice and operate largely as multi-player solo experiences. The quick setup and play time are icing on the cake, and ensure that player focus solely on the mechanics and want to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Coloretto is a nice quick card game that provides some tough choices with regards to staying in a particular hand or bailing early.  However, it seems at the important moments, luck plays a large role.  You can calculate odds, but since you add points for the right colors, and subtract them for the wrong ones, the key card at the end of a hand can really swing things.

This is a very quick and light card game, but it has worked very well with non-gamers. I can see it working as a filler with gamers as well though - there are meaningful decisions and delightful chances to be nasty to the other players. Much like in Ra, a single player can sometimes play the last part of a round solo as a 'push your luck'-game.

Conclusion: Coloretto is a fantastic light card game that offers a large amount of table talk and laughs.  I end up playing to mess up the other players and eventually lose.  But even in a loss, I enjoy myself.  For something with a bit more strategy and theme, I like Aquaretto.

This speedy (and, yes, dare I say it - colorful) little card game shines when players of equal ability are not only playing to maximize their own points be keeping an eye on what other players are working toward. Both in seeding the stacks of cards and in selecting stacks, there's plenty of opportunity to play defense, which makes this game shine.

RATING: 7.5
Very portable.  It has a very narrow scale of players (3-4), so it is not as versatile as I would like. 

Still it has gotten a lot of love in my house. 

I like press-your-luck games and this is a fun way to do it with something besides dice.

I have all of the expansions, but have never bothered to play them.  The original is really good.

Update:  Goes from a 7 to a 7.5.  I still haven't played any of the expansions as the original is still too much fun.

I like how some games you are playing to take rows that you want and some games you get into a "take that" battle of taking rows others would love.  



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 4.5

This game is so light,   that it wouldn't surprise me,  if at some point while playing,  the cards should suddenly begin to slowly ascend towards the ceiling.

One of those great games that are so streamlined that they have been stripped down to their core essence.  Super-simple rules, plenty of tough choices, opportunities to screw your neighbor, and the chance that you'll screw yourself instead.  A splendid filler.

I like the creamy fillers.  Oh wait.  Anyways, fast paced game with great interaction.  Incredibly light, but thats what its for.  Yummy.  The decisions of help me or hurt them are always fun to make.  Our game group always tends to go with the hurt them choice, which actually makes it more enjoyable.  I wouldn't want to play this game nicely.  I probably would play something else with 5.  Downtime starts to creep in as the number of choices grows larger.  Downtime is a killer of any filler, especially this game.

Great great filler.  One of the best fillers on the market.  Maybe the best, its what any filler wants to be.  Simple, strategic, and fun.

A pretty cool little game. Fast and fun. Nice to have for that filler time. 

I've always been delighted with this little game as it's decisions can be rough to make. With 2 players it's just as tense which is a good thing.

This was a fun little card game, but not one I necessarily need to buy any time soon.  It actually reminded me a bit of a lighter version of Ra, and I'm not sure Ra needs a lighter version.  It was interesting, but the scoring system seemed to require always aiming for a set of 6, worth 21, at the expense of everything else.  There are some interestind decisions to make, considering how simple and quick the game is, and the price tag is appealing, but it didn't wow me like other fillers (e.g., Can't Stop, For Sale, Liar's Dice, StreetSoccer, Hey That's My Fish, Travel Blokus).

A lot of game in a little box.  The ratio of game to components is one of the highest.  I really enjoy this game of tough choices.  The first game that made me wonder if I should have sleeved it.  But I'll probably just buy another copy at some point.

The 10th anniversary edition includes the Russian artwork, which I consider a vast improvement on the original somewhat ugly game.

I already played many times [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34194/aquaretto]Aquaretto[/url] so I wanted to play the one that started all: [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5782/coloretto]Coloretto[/url]. I wasn't disappointed.

The game plays fast (20 to 30 minutes) and revolves around set collection. In your turn you have two options to choose from:

a) Take a card from the deck and put it in one of the card rows;

b) Take one of the rows to yourself (with all the cards that are there).

In the end, you will score points for the three colors you have the most cards. All the others colors will make you lose points. The scoring can happen in two ways: the basic, where the points always go up with more cards of the same color (up to 6 cards), and the advanced, that the value of the color goes up, but after a given number, the points will start to go down.

The game accept up to 5 players and even with this number the playing time usually don't cross the 30 minutes. It is easy to teach, to understand and is friendly enough to be a family game, while also being interesting for gamers as a quick filler. Coloretto is easier than [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34194/aquaretto]Aquaretto[/url] by a considerable amount, but also provides interesting decisions along the way.

For its price tag, [b]Coloretto[/b] is a good addition to any collection, especially fit for those that like card games. I'm probably going to get a copy for me!

RATING: 8
[Rated 2005/04/20 based on 3 plays]

Easy to understand for those familiar with Rummy, interesting decisions to be made in how far you can push your luck, and tempting other players to take cards you don't want.  It's possible to concentrate on either benefiting yourself or hurting others, and neither seems an obviously better strategy.

One hand is quite quick, but carrying the scores over mean it's a good filler for "until we're bored / more people show up / pizza arrives".

it is a very slight game...a card game based on one main idea (collect sets, but not too many sets). but the more I play it the more I enjoy it, instead of tiring. 

i love that this little game has the most amazing decision trees in it. predicting what you will get by the next turn, predicting what your actions will do to affect the decisions of others. it seems to be a perfect player interaction system, where the simple mechanics get out of the way.

Played 10+ times, and before my first game of Fairy Tale I thought this to be THE best lightweight card game I had ever played. There are only a few rules, so it is very easy to explain. And yet...there is definitely more depth to it than is apparent after the first couple of games. Games tend to last only 15-20 minutes, but we never stop after one play. Fantastic combination of bluffing, guessing and a "push your luck" mechanism. Highly recommended (especially considering the price).

My comment to Hacienda makes a disparaging comment about triangular scoring, which I've somewhat burned out on due to its power in my semi-frequent plays of 3- and 4- player St. Pete games.  And yet I somewhat enjoy Coloretto, despite the fact that triangular scoring is all that it is.  I would say that it's appeal is that it is just so pure and distilled (and also very unpretensiously light).  Also, you're unlikely to get very far up the ladder, which helps.

Coloretto is a nice filler that works well for two to four players, as a fifth player makes the time between turns drag a bit. It is easy to learn and teach, and it has some clever mechanics. The last turn card buried in the draw pile is a great idea. Coloretto also has a press your luck element with respect to the sets on the table. A player can take one or two cards he needs, or draw one more and risk getting stuck with an unwanted color. The scoring system is also clever, as points are deducted for cards other than the three colors of a player's three colored hand.

Fabulous game with deceptive depth.  The press your luck aspect of taking a column or drawing and getting stuck with a stack that hurts you makes this one a favorite of mine.  Great stuff!!!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Simple but well designed small box filler card game. Players add cards to rows and try to collect them in up to three colors - cards in additional colors are worth negative points. On their turn players make a simple but sometimes tough choice: either push-your-luck by drawing and adding a card to a row or collect an entire row. Each row can only have up to 3 cards so a player may sometimes be forced to take a row. The game can be played as a single round or score can be tallied over 4-5 rounds which should average out some of the luck.

Very clever little game.  It looks very simple, and dull, but has some deceptive strategy and push-your luck mechanics.  As the game gets going you really need to try and judge what your opponents are going to go for by their hands.

Great with 4 players, wish it was more enjoyable with 2.

Simple and quick card game, easy to learn. Rated after 12 confirmed games. Easy to teach and learn, good game for casual gamers.

Updated after 18th game and dropped the rating to 7. One round can be too much luck oriented, it needs to be played 3-4 rounds to get the luck factor quite even. After that the game is not a filler anymore. The idea of the game doesn't necessarily carry that long, that's why the drop in the rating.

19th play and the rating is 8 again. I seem to have difficulties with this one... Now we played 3 rounds and it felt good. But yes, it is not a filler anymore, but may be it doesn't need to be?

Add two more one-rounders, not at it's best then. Let's see couple of more plays, but I'm thinking about to drop the rating to seven: One round filler is not that good and multiple round play is too long compared to content.

We tried the variant scoring in the latest play, everyone was within 4 points, so it was quite tough. Don't know yet, if it is good or bad.

This is a nice set-collection filler game with a few more decisions to make than the average filler game.  It creates a nice tension from a simple rule: Draw and add a card to an exisiting row, or take a row.  Are you going to add a bad card to a row to keep someone else from taking it, possibly hurting yourself if it comes back to you?  Or will you add something good for you to it and hope that it makes it back around to you?  Or will you take that row with only one card on it, since you're not ready to risk taking cards that will hurt you?  I can see it growing repetitious over many playings, but it offers a nice alternative to the more mindless games that hit the table often.

Filler one of the best card fillers I know. Have to lower the score here  (but only 0.5) because the rules are not clear how to play this with 2  players.. There is mention of some variant rules where in every pile you could add 1,2 or 3 cards but for me after reading the rules it was not clear when to use what variant. OR even which of the scoring methods need more tactics? I have allways played so that you aim for certain amount of color cards but there actually might be more starategy in the variant where you want as much as those cards as you can?! I may need help with playing this one the correct way.

Game play in Coloretto is simple: Either draw a card to play to a row, or take a row of cards to add them to your collection. A row can have at most three cards, so at some point everyone is forced to take a row. Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again.
Once only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you. Each color is scored using a triangular number system: the first card in a color is ±1 point, the second card is ±2 points, and so on. The player with the high score wins!

Bought this on a whim because I loved Zooloretto and this was more in line with my budget, and I'm glad I did. I think I like Zooloretto a little bit more, but there's something to be said for the simple elegance of this deceptively deep game. One round can be played in as few as 10 minutes, which is also nice. This and Carcassonne are the only two games in my collection I'm comfortable introducing to any non-gamer. If there is a downside, it's that the game does not work with 2 players (even with the PnP rules), but I highly recommend it to nearly all gamers.

A fun to play light filler to wind down after a tedious gaming session. Everything is straightforward and the game is pretty fast paced. The game mechanism for this game was used for the 2007 Spiel de Jahre Zooloretto.

2016 Update: Now that my son is almost six this has become his absolute favorite from my collection of games! My little one who is three and a half can't quite figure it out on her own. She keeps on going after the "pretty colors" (mostly pink).

Set scoring, excess = negative points.

This is a fantastic game for what it is, such simple rules and a really clever challenge to the player in whether to take cards or draw and place one. I'd love to get experienced players together some time for speed matches to see how they go.

If you're amping for this, get either the German 10 year anniversary or the Russian edition as the art for them is a squillion times better than the standard art.

My star importer stocks this whenever they can and I couldn't pass up on it. While the art for the original game is serviceable, I prefer the more vibrant and detailed art for the anniversary edition. I may find a new home for the standard Rio Grande print that I have so if you want it, my only requirement is that we play it together at least once!

A fun and easy game that doesn't try to be anything other than that. It is a game that is not simply a matter of the luck of the draw, but a game about the luck of the draw and what your opponents did with that card. And then your choice, do you take one of the piles before you, or do you draw and play. I don't win very many games of this. I either am just not wired to choose the right path or I am too cautious. Either way, win or lose, this is a good filler game to play.

Fun little filler game with a unique strategy.

Thanks to [url=http://www.geekdo.com/user/LanaDove]LanaDove[/url] for helping me acquire the beautiful Russian edition of this game.

RATING: 7.5
The game has a simple game mechanic and is therefore easy to teach. However, there are a couple of tough decisions to make in the game, primarily revolving around when to push your luck and when to grab and run. 

Artwork is below average but very colourful (jubilee edition). Game components are just cards and their quality is average. Player interaction is very high, which makes it very suited as a family game.

Actually preferred this over Zooloretto. Good mechanisms for a quick card game. Had a fun time playing this as a closer with 5 players.

Clever small game with colorful artworks which I really love. Usually I'm not much for abstract games. But this is the one of few exceptions. Simple and beautiful.

Delicious, deceptive, tons of fun. This simple card drafting game has a lot going for it -- it's easy to learn, offers some interesting push your luck elements, plays quickly and has great replay value. A favorite!

I played an online version a number of times before purchasing this game. It is a fun, quick and light game. I recommend this as a filler for any gaming group - unless you have color-blind players. While the game features some fun decision making, I feel that Coloretto has been supplanted by Zooloretto and Aquaretto.

Marvelous card game that balances luck and strategy.  The rules are easy enough so that anyone can play, yet the choices are deep enough to engage your brain.

Bumped my rating up once I tried it with a larger group.  5 works just great.  3 players always left the game feeling flat for me, but more players adds a lot to it.

A great set collection/push your luck game.  If this isn't my favorite filler its 1B behind Piece O Cake. Easy to explain with surprisingly fun decisions almost every round, its always in my game bag for when I need it. 

My sister in law had all sorts of trouble hunting me down the 10th anniversary version with awesome artwork (I think the German store she was working with sent her the wrong edition three times...) but she managed it for a great Christmas present!  Thanks Gina!

You'd think that a game as simple as Coloretto wouldn't make you pause as you agonize where to put the card you just drew, but it does.  To me, that in itself is amazing.  One of the best filler games I've ever played that I would play any time if asked.

Great filler. It's so simple yet it's depth surprises me, I have seen different strategies that work really well; there may be some dominating ones but the random factor can keep that under control.
Really love it as a filler.

Nagyon jó kis kártyajáték, igazi filler. Gyors, pörgős, szórakoztató, de némi agyalás azért van benne. Az ár/érték arány kiváló, minden társasjátékos háztartásban kell legyen egy ilyen!

After 2+ Plays: One of the best fillers I've played in a while.  I really like fillers that are played in rounds, as that allows you to extend the game or cut it short, as time requires.

After 5+ Plays: I still really like this game, but it's hard to get to the table.  It's actually a bit long to play as a filler, and other people are reticent to play when we have time for a "real" game.  For me, I think there are more interesting and strategic decisions in Coloretto than in a lot of 90 minute games.

Elegant but extremely light. I like more theme in Zooloretto implementation of the same mechanic but it can't beat the simplicity of Coloretto. I rated both games at 7 but tie-breaker goes to Zooloretto for cute animal tiles.

Always quick, attractive, and functional. An elegant game in its simplicity. There is plenty of interaction and some push-your-luck elements. Its abstractness does hurt it a bit, though, as it can tend to be a hard sale to those that simply see the colors.

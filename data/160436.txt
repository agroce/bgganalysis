Love letter plus. Its much more tactical than Love Letter but also more confusing and harder to teach. A good upgrade if you love Love Letter but are looking for some variety of play.

The best lost legacy game yet. Better than love letter (for gamers). Japanese edition.

I enjoyed Love Letter quite a bit and Lost Legacy is even better! I'll play any of the Lost Legacy sets anytime someone wants to! They're all really fun, but I think I'd rank them the same as the order in which they were released. This one being the third release means it is my third favorite, but don't take that to mean that I don't enjoy it. The mechanics get a little more tricky with the playing of cards face down, but if you're familiar with the previous sets it shouldn't be anything difficult. It just adds a new layer to an already fun game! Enjoy!

The best Lost Legacy set I've played so far. Orb of Seduction has a real "detective" feel to it due to all the leads and the powering-up of characters due to them and Eternal Grail uses discarded facedown cards in a nice way.

Quick and fun card game. A bit random, but it's ok since there are still some tactical and smart plays to be made. Also, each game is very short.

I like Lost Legacy as Love Letter with little more to it. It seems to work better with just two players. It also have additional layer to it thanks to ruins deck. I also like possibility to mix various decks together.

Solid minigame.  I've only played the Orb of Seduction set.  Introduces a new aspect in that certain cards are more powerful if a certain number of "x" cards have been played.

Lost Legacy is Love Letter with decisions and game. Not sure yet which set I like best.

Casual players seem to find this game more confusing than it is.  I think it is a good concept and well execute but the cards could be drafted in a more clear manner.  Overall, I would stick with Love Letter.

Rating is for the Orb of Seduction set.  That was is really fun, and I think my favorite.

I didn't love the original Lost Legacy; it just felt like Love Letter but less fun. But I rather enjoyed Lost Legacy: Binbo Tantei to Inbo no Shiro and Lost Legacy: Hyakunen Senso to Ryu no Miko. They seem to play much better 2p than Love Letter does and they expand the game system in some interesting ways.

RATING: 8
Very similar in structure to Love letter, but the card actions aren't as geared to player elimination. To compensate, there is an additional "investigative round" where you attempt to guess where, or who has the "Lost Legacy".

I believe these subtle changes make the game much more interesting than Love Letter. Arguably, if you play Love Letter lots, the gameplay can wear thin (much like playing Euchre with your co-workers 3x/day, every workday, for years)

But this game offers more: it comes with an expansion deck, with the same number of cards. If you tire of the base deck, you can play the expansion deck using the same rules, or you can build a blended deck (following the rules), or finally, play both decks (removing one of the Legacies), and up to 6 players.

That's kind of awesome. I'm still keeping Love Letter but it's clear to me that I'm going to prefer playing this a lot more.

Take Love Letter and change the focus from holding the highest card at the end to trying to know where a certain card is and you have Lost Legacy. For more fun include two different sets of sixteen cards and the ability to mix and match cards to make your own customization.

All (Japanese) sets of Lost Legacy count as base sets, so you can buy any sets you can get your hands on. That said, I reccomend purchasing vanilla Lost Legacy first, but that's only because the two sets included are some of the best two and it could be hard to go back and play The Starship or The Flying Garden after playing these two sets.

If you're trying to figure out what this stuff is in English once AEG releases it, this set will be Chronicle 2. Welcome to 2013, North America!

Of the three Japanese sets of Lost Legacy currently out, I prefer this one to the original two.

There seemed to be much less of an emphasis on eliminating players and much more on the deduction.

It's still only decent, but it's the best of the Lost Legacy group to date.

Decks (#5) The Orb of Seduction, and (#6) The Eternal Grail.

I rate the previous sets of Lost Legacy perfect 10s, and this is no different, except it's even better. The cards that do unique things based on the number of Xs that have been played create a game that does a big "thematic" shift at a certain point, and is lots of fun to explore.

I love how in this Lost Legacy set they didn't just give you two decks of 16 cards, but also two variant setups combining the two decks.

I'm just as thrilled with Lost Legacy as I originally was with Love Letter, but Lost Legacy is more satisfying to my gamer needs. I can tweak decks to get different versions of gameplay, and even then each of the six decks which I own play differently. I just love Lost Legacy!

The Lost Legacy series is basically an evolution of Love Letter. They both feature 16 cards (per game, but in the former you can play with more cards to accommodate more players), and similar mechanisms: hand size of one card, draw one, play one, and discard openly in front of yourself.

The difference is that Lost Legacy has become even more of a deduction game. If the deck runs out, you take turns, in ascending hand card order, to guess where the Lost Legacy card is in the game. This can include a new area called the Ruins, which starts as one card off the top of the deck during setup, but can grow from there during play.

The additional deduction aspect is great. I love this game so much, it is now firmly cemented in my top ten games of all time. However, this is just the introduction to the system for me, the decks keep getting better. Decks five, and six are incredible! Please give this a try.

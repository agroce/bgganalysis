Theme: 7 The theme is ok works well with the sandstorm game mechanics. I thought the small backstory could be better. When comparing the game to Pandemic, which if you lose the whole world dies of horrible disease, in this one just you and your team die.
Game Play: 9 I love the cooperative game mechanics. the Sandstorm and rotating board is great. The discovery of Machine parts is also good, and blocking the movement tiles is smart. 
Strategy: 7 
Fun Factor: 7

Replay Ability:9. The alternating board and the adjustable difficultly make this game one you could play over and over again.

Really enjoy this one, the storm movement adds a really nice twist to the co-operative mechanic and keeps it all a lot more unpredictable. The water management also adds another interesting danger and serves to really increase the teamwork, as well as make you plan out your moves to prevent getting caught out in the sun.

It was a 9 for a while, and I kept on playing it solo (Over and over and over again) to the point that I didn't want to play another solo game (and haven't asked to play multiplayer in awhile, I really should, but there's so many other games!) I like it better than Pandemic (less downtime) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I think it's my first real Coop, and it was a fun game. The 6 rating is because while I enjoyed the game, it is not a game for every time I want to play. The mechanics are solid, and the theme is actually believable.

The game is tense and its a good puzzle. We had a good time talking about what to do, and when to do what. But perhaps we missplayed somewhere, because we actually won our first game. Granted, it was down to one sand, and one person almost died of thirst, but we won. (We played on normal)

Great the first maybe 5-10 games. Starts to loose its magic after a while. I'll keep it though because its a great game to introduce to people - they seem to really enjoy it! And I mean its still fun - Just not like it once was.

may up rateing afer a few more plays.

We are just getting into co-op games and we loved this one, trying to find the difficulty level that is a challenge for us but only 3 plays in so may change rating up or down depending on if we can find that "challenge"

A really clever game with good mechanics, everything moves well and quickly and (between our friends atleast) easy for you to make your own desicions if you disagree with the group.

Also perfect for kids and easy to tweek the rules if you want to. Even on an educational level without them realising it (addition, take away (sand), co-ordinates, team work).  My wife used it with an intervention group at school.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A very well developed game. Definetly one of the best coops. In expert mode, it really depends of your special abilities. 

Unlike Forbidden island, where the Pilot negates almoust all of the strenghts of a diver (who is acctially a very fun adddition to the Island game!), in the Desert, you dont have a Pilot so the climber is very important and he can also take one of the other figurines with him to the mountains of sand! 

This ability is great because it makes the game more tactical and also it can save action points for other players (they save on movement). I use a combo of the climber and the Archeaologist where they both move onto a mountain in the climbers turn, and then the Archeaologist can spent all his 4 action for a very efficient sand removal operation! 

Also the explorer is a lot more important than in the Island game. He is excellent for early game exploration, where the starting sand tiles are diagonally arranged, so he may reveal 2 city tiles in one turn and may continue to do this for the next 3-4 turns (this means revealing at least 6-8 city tiles by himself).

[I]tl;dr A necessary improvement on Forbidden Island, a solid overall co-op from the designer of Pandemic.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

It's pretty clear to me that Forbidden Desert is a much improved version of Forbidden Island. There's lots more to do, and the system of locating parts of the aircraft is pretty genius. I'm glad this one is in our collection and not Island.

Basically, you are all explorers who have crashed in a desert, and must recover all the pieces of a buried aircraft to escape the desert before you run out of water. The board is made up of tiles which you will explore by excavating sand from and flipping. 

Overall, a solid co-op that is very enjoyable. Very tight with four players, we found it easier with five. It's a good game, but ultimately I found that Matt Leacock's 'alpha player' problem has dogged this one as well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Easy to teach and play. There is a good amount of luck in the card draw, but there are still ways to play intelligently. I appreciate the difficulty adjuster, which I found actually does make a difference. Play can get monotonous, so making it more difficult is what keeps me interested. Can be a good co-op experience with the right people. I'd definitely recommend this as a casual game to play if I need to kill an hour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
If Forbidden Island is a streamlined Pandemic spinoff, then this is a Forbidden Island spinoff where water is replaced with sand. There is more going on in this game than Forbidden Island, which is nice, and I like the steampunk airship in the desert theme.

Forbidden Island's evil cousin! I played this game with a full compliment of players and we lost 6 games in a row!!

I think the Sun-Beats-Down cards are a bit unbalanced. The hydration mechanic makes sense, but if you're the last player in the turn order you could be dead before you ever got one turn if all the Sun cards are revealed! That just isn't cool! The likelihood is probably supposed to be extremely low, but it did somehow happen to us twice!

Forbidden Desert is a fantastic co-op game for these reasons:

-It is simple and streamlined
-It presents the player with tough choices 
-There is beautiful art and a clean design
-The random board set up makes for a different experience each time
-Variable player powers and difficulty levels also keeps the game fresh
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I think this is the most tense game that I own. Every turn of Forbidden Desert is a nail-biter and it only gets more critical as the game goes on. The nice thing is that the game offers only a few decisions, so that analysis paralysis never really sets in. Especially because there is rarely any way of knowing what the best course may be.

I love the way the sand piles up and the way the tiles move with the sandstorm. The theme really comes alive in this game, as players get more and more desperate to clear sand and the missing valuables become more and more buried in the ever-changing heart and heat of the desert. The deck of cards that determines whether the sun beats down upon uncovered survivors or whether the storm picks up its intensity is a cruel and feisty mistress. Eyes always go wide and passions ignite when its time to draw from it.

Forbidden Desert, while by no means an easy game, is a simple one and I would wholeheartedly recommend it for families and non-gamers. It's a perfect gateway game for those who enjoy abstract classics or puzzles. By no means should this be forbidden from your collection (especially at that price!)

Great light co-op.  I'm not sure if I enjoy this or Pandemic more.

I've played it enough now that I'm thinking of getting rid of it.  The main problem with a coop like this is that it will mainly get played with non-gamers.  I have to bite my tongue hard so that I don't become the 'alpha gamer' and ruin the experience for them.

Get this game. Just do it. Imagine a streamlined, simplified Pandemic with great bits/pieces and unique mechanics. You can teach it to newbies within 10 minutes, and they'll feel empowered and involved due to the co-op and collaborative nature of the game. Since each role is useful and needed, even brand-new players feel like they were critical to victory.

The game has chance elements, but even so, you can trace back your plays and see where you could have made different decisions. Agency is a big part of this game, and it works wonderfully.

This is one of my go-to games for new folks to get them into the hobby. It's light enough to learn quickly, but dynamic and clever  enough to keep coming back for more.

It's not a bad game, just average. 

It seems fairly simple to win at the easier levels, so unless I am playing with children I am always playing at higher difficulty. Even so, I don't get the sense of tension as in other similar co-op games.

It is a good game with children though and I'd give it a higher rating if playing with them. It is also fun with a lively group.

If you want to introduce friends and family to higher-caliber board games, this or the four-player Forbidden Island is one of the best places to start in my book. This one is definitely harder than Island, but I still adore both. Beautiful art and presentation (who isn't a sucker for games in tins?), terrific action-adventure movie concept, and each player playing the good and evil side of the game every turn adds to the tension and thrill.

Like with Forbidden Island, I like that the layout of the board is different nearly every time, but Desert takes it up a notch with the tiles moving every turn thanks to the sandstorm and the hidden treasure pieces also being in different locations every game. The unique player powers provide a lot of opportunity for strategy and interaction under a challenging objective. I've won plenty of three-player games, but something about the max five-player games has made victory more elusive. But we always have a blast and want to try just-one-more-time.

One of the best cooperative games ever played. You have to find the missing parts of a steam punk airship in the desert and fly out. It seems easy but the tiles of desert (dunes) re constantly moving and filling up with sand blocking your movements, and even the sun can drain your powers and leave you dehydrated (unless you find the well). Easy to player and hard to master. What I did really enjoy is the fact that the difficulty of the game can be adjusted by the means of the cards drawn to move the dunes and fill them with sand.

One upside is that, if you're teaching people who aren't really used to board games, Forbidden Desert seems a bit easier to teach than Pandemic.

Yes, there are similarities between this and Forbidden Island, but Forbidden Desert is nevertheless a fairly different game. Forbidden Island now feels to me like the unfinished prototype of Forbidden Desert! If you don't own either game, get Forbidden Desert. If you already own Forbidden Island and get Forbidden Desert, be warned: you'll probably trade away Forbidden Island! Although I do kinda miss the rapidly shrinking island aspect....

Although it's not my favourite co-op (Space Alert), it's probably the best co-op I've played. What I mean by that is in most co-ops, each player is assigned his or her own duty, and they go off and do it. Not so in Forbidden Desert. In Desert, you MUST be working together very closely (and usually closely on the board) since each player is very much dependent on the others for survival. That in itself makes Forbidden Desert unique, and truly cooperative.

A most beautiful game, and a considerably deeper game than Forbidden Island, while nevertheless remaining family-friendly.

RATING: 8
Based on many of the comments I expected this game to be a disappointment and a replica of Forbidden Island, but I was pleasantly surprised.

While the game has a number of similarities to Forbidden Island, it also has enough to differentiate it.  I particularly liked the hidden treasure aspect and the innovative way the treasure moves around as the sandstorm blankets the map.  Thematically, you do feel exposed and frustrated as the sun beats down and you race to find the treasure before your water supply runs out.

In many ways, I feel Forbidden Desert is a better game overall, but a few more plays will tell.  Either way, it is definitely enjoyable, tense and very accessible for non-gamers.

You cannot really compare this game to many others. It is nice, colourful, intriguing, almost whimsical on first sight, but it is really hard and takes a lot of foresight and strategy if you want to win against the sandstorm, find the pieces of the artefact - an ancient aircraft - under all that sand that keeps accumulationg and threatenig to bury your thirsty character under so many dunes, and fly away to safety and civilization. Clever and exciting!

Es un buen juego la verdad, lo encuentro mejor cooperativo que Pandemic por ejemplo, es divertido y desafiante, la búsqueda de pistas está muy bien lograda, sobre todo con el tablero cambiante.

No engancho mucho con los cooperativos, pero este tiene buena mecánica para quien gusta de ellos.

Very entertaining light coop game, when you're not in the mood for something more heavy. It plays fast, it fits the theme and it's fun.
Maybe the tiles are a little fragile, and they will eventually be damaged, which will be a nuisance in the future.

We have to disagree with what most people seem to be saying about this one. All we read or hear is how much better this is than Forbidden Island. But we think it's too complicated for what it is. Whereas "Island" was a step-child of Pandemic with much easier mechanics, "Desert" reaches Pandemic's complexity but in just a bit less play time.

This was my favorite game for a while. The ever changing board is an excellent mechanic and keeps you on your toes. The cooperative aspect of the game is well done and it always gets tense and exciting at the end when you're trying to get everyone on the ship to leave the desert. 

My only gripe with the game is the difficulty. There are four difficulty levels: Novice, normal, advanced, and legendary. My group has only been able to win on "normal" a small fraction of the time we've played. Unless you get the perfect roles and everything goes perfectly, I just don't see how casual gamers are supposed to go above the normal difficulty. 

Despite the difficulty, there is a lot of fun to be had here. If you like super challenging games, then this one is for you! Even if you're not, stick with the novice or normal difficulty and you'll have a blast. 

Pros
-components (the ship!!!)
-ever-changing mechanics
-variable roles
-strong desert theme
-excitement in flipping tiles

Cons
-almost impossible difficulty on advanced and legendary tiers
-possible alpha-player who decides everything for the whole team

This only recieved a few plays in our family and just never seemed to click as a cooperative game that we would return to. It's only marginally more complex than Forbidden Island without the nostalgia of being a game that brought us into the hobby.

This might be the best cooperative game out there. It has the right level of difficulty and has plenty of things to think about. The theme is tied so well into the gameplay. Everything about it is so clever, from the shifting sands slider puzzle to discovering the coordinates of the ships' missing pieces.

It builds upon the mechanics of Pandemic and Forbidden Island but deserves its own spot in anyone's collection.

Definitely a step forward (in terms of complexity) for the "Forbidden" line of boardgames. The added complexity means that it looses some of the really-super-simple-ness of Forbidden Island when it comes to introducing brand-new players, but for experienced boardgamers I think it is the better game.

RATING: 9.2
It's no surprise why this is considered the superior of the 'Forbidden' games, it takes those tactile and elegant mechanics of 'Island' and adds a little more depth and strategy, with the sand tiles, the wonderful hidden city, the variable character powers, and the high level of challenge. An excellent game, I for one wouldn't mind if Leacock would design another 1-2 titles in the line. 'Forbidden Moon', 'Forbidden Planet', 'Forbidden City', 'Forbidden Glacier', whatever man, do it!

Love the theme, the variable player powers, and the equipment cards.

It really does feel like the character powers are imbalanced though.  When I play this game (as with most variable-player-power games) I prefer to let everyone pick their character.

I can see the strategy getting samey after more plays, but this still feels very fresh atm.  After three plays, I have yet to beat it on anything higher than novice difficulty.

Edit: Just CRUSHED this game 2p with climber + meteorologist on normal difficulty.  Almost full canteens and only 8 sand tiles on the board at the end.  I have a feeling that could have been a clean victory even on legendary.

I know the classic gateway games are Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, and Settlers of Catan, but in my very humble opinion this is the best gateway game out there. I love, love, LOVE the theme matching mechanic. I haven't played a game with a better "thematic mechanic" than the roving sand storm. It's relatively easy to teach, because most of the information in the game is hidden and randomized there is virtually no "quarterbacking" and actually, though the game feels strategic, and there are strategic elements to it, it actually plays out more tactically. I love the type of teamwork it induces in a group, again, thematic. You really do feel like a team of adventurers struggling to survive. All this and the game wraps up in 45 minutes. As for replayability, the game is hard to win, and harder the more people you add. I've yet to beat a 4 player game on novice, though I've come close enough not to be discouraged.

UPDATE: Although I still do like this game very much I'm usually not in the mood to play. There doesn't seem to be enough strategy to keep me engaged.

A fun and moderately thematic family weight coop game that does not have the replayability of say Flash Point with an expansion or so but is great value for money.

Seems more random than Forbidden Island, as there are several mechanics that can TPK, at about a 50% win/loss ratio and the deciding factor seems to be do we have the jockey (navigator) and rider (climber) combo? if yes then we win, if no then it's close, but we lose. Water carrier is not very useful, somewhat affected by where the tunnels/oasis are.  Meteorologist hasn't seen much game time (due to randomly assigning roles), so can't comment on that power.

I've enjoyed nearly every game I've had of this, but the difficulty variability loses it some points. I've had games where we've won easily and wondered what all the fuss was about, and games where we were buried in the desert within a handful of turns without mercy... but the tense ones where we only-just win or only-just lose are pretty great.

Matt Leacock has created a very unique and creative co-operative with Forbidden Desert, but the game remains familiar to his fans.

The shifting sand is one of the most original mechanics I have seen in a game. It keeps the game board dynamic and challenging to conquer. Forbidden Desert highly rewards working together and using everyone's unique abilities, and I believe this is essential in co-operative games.

This is my favourite co-op game. It has a similar feel to the ever-popular Pandemic, but all the differences significantly improve the game in my opinion.

It is lighter, but not detrimentally so.

This is the only game I will ever give a full 10 to. Why? To skew the average rating so more people will play this game and experience its wonder. The concept of assembling a ship to escape the desert was pleasing and the fit of the components was neat. My only complaint was, why does the ship need a core and a engine? Really broke the immersion for me. 
The sandstorm mechanic can be tricky to master. It took us several playthroughs to fully grasp it, but then again we were probably drunk, thus giving us the minds of small children. Therefore, small children will enjoy this short game, assuming they don't choke on the pieces.

(KIDS) I'm impressed with how this game brings a lot of familiarity with Forbidden Island along with a lot of new ideas.  I've played just once but I have to assume that Leacock tested this enough to ensure that the chances of me getting too much respite from the storm is not too high.  His ability to provide a quality cooperative game experience for the family without dumbing it down too much or making it overly complex is really impressive.

After two plays, I'm rating this game a 7.  It's decent, but I am concerned that it could get more samey after a few more plays than its wet counterpart.  If it does, the rating will drop.  We'll see....

The more sophisticated and popular brother of Forbidden Island.  Another Pandemic derivative, but this time with SAND!  Clean mechanics, simple to explain rules and a nice aesthetic help make the game palatable.  It's just not that exciting of a co-op.  I also found the constant addition and subtraction of sand to be annoying.  A middling co-op that I'm not really enamored with.

I love that the board shifts as you're playing - very thematic for a game set in the desert. I also like the row/column mechanic for locating the ship parts, and the way sand piles up to block your path. Presents interesting challenges, including keeping your characters hydrated, but gives you lots of ways to solve/mitigate them.

// Solid yet light co-op that we don't play often enough.
It scratches the adventure/exploration itch while 
requiring impactful (typically) decision-making. The game
scales well enough at different player counts and is 
simple enough to teach to most anyone.

I’m a fan of these team vs. environment board games, in the family of Pandemic, etc. This game is the brother of Forbidden Island, and between the two, I actually like this one the best, although I’ve heard many of my friends have the opposite opinion. I love the game mechanics. Not a big fan of the Meteorologist's ability, but sometimes I just throw that card out of the random character draw before the game begins.
I can only come up with one con for this game, which is that the game difficulty can swing pretty dramatically depending on chance. If the last three tiles you discover have the tunnels, for example… the game can become pretty impossible, no matter how well the team uses strategy. Or ridiculously easy, a time or two… Those games are statistical outliers though, most of the time this game is super!

This is not an easy coop game,and I like that.  There is a lot of hidden information so it's difficult for one player to boss the others around.  It has a very clever system of locating the parts on the board.  Components are amazing!  Good game.

A fun co-op where you've crash landed in the desert and must search for the pieces of a mythical flying machine to get out. Each player has a differt roll. The board is made up of tiles, laid out in a 5x5 grid with one missing to represent the area with the sand storm. Players clear tiles of sand and flip them to find gear or clues to the parts' location. Players can lose by thirsting to death, getting buried in sand or the storm intensity reaching deadly levels. Game can be very tense and exciting.

1 play:

There are a few problems with this game that limit it.

First, the sandstorm cards are less than totally clear about which way is up, and we often found ourselves having to redo the last set of sand movements because the card was upside down.

Second, the discovery mechanism feels arbitrary. I get that we are supposed to pretend we are finding clues about where the artifacts are buried, but this doesn't feel convincing because the locations aren't set until you uncover both location markers. Same thing for the tools you can uncover: drawing them from a pre-shuffled deck of cards makes excavation feel more like a chore than a thrilling risk.

The first time my daughter and I played Forbidden Island, we were enraptured. Not so with Forbidden Desert, even though we were looking forward to it.

Quick and relaxed coop, that offers slightly too obvious problems. It has very simple rules but offers still some game complexity, which is a great plus, since you can pull it out and start playing after 3 minutes.

I'm a big fan of cooperative games and think this game is one that is fairly accessible to new gamers, especially ones with little to no experience playing the genre.

I enjoy Forbidden Desert even more than Forbidden Island. The theme is more prevalent here and it gets rid of the annoying mechanic where you have to trade cards. It is difficult, but somehow not as tense as forbidden island can get (except for when you are about to die of thirst), still a great game!

RATING: 3
A painfully tedious co-op where the optimal decision every turn is glaringly obvious. There is zero tension. I would say it has a serious alpha-gamer problem except all players can easily see the optimal play so there's no reason to dictate. Might be a decent game for small children, but for adults it's pure misery.

Adds more elements than the game's forebear, Forbidden Island. It's also less punishing - tiles don't disappear, they just get buried. This makes winning more possible, and in so doing helps a bit with the "player-dictator" risk (e.g., someone always looking out for which tiles will permanently vanish), which is still present but a bit more subdued.

Teamwork is key with this one. Every game I`ve played, only a few me and my crew have won. The odds are against you and only the smart and lucky will survive.

Wonderful co-op game! I love it as it has enough differences from Forbidden Island til keep it fresh - and very difficult to beat when playing 2-4 players.

The game is surprisingly easy to beat if you play solo with just 1 character though.

If you fear that you will get "Forbidden Island 2" then don't worry. It has two similarities: the storm tracker works the same way as FI's water rise, and you are racing against time. Besides that it is a total different gameplay and is just as intense as FI, especially when running to the ship at the end. I have lost being only ONE tile away from the landing platform; I got burned from the sun and died of thirst a few meters from the finish line.

Two BIG thumbs up for Matt Leacock! Keep making games! I love you, man!!

Pandemic is my favorite game, and I really wanted to like this. Several plays later, and I'm still not enthused. The exploration mechanic really annoys me because, whereas in Pandemic your planning has a distinct purpose based on the board state, in FD you just flounder around until you find what you're looking for. The result is that I always feel like we just got lucky whenever we win, and were simply unlucky if we lose. I'll just stick to Pandemic, which, with the expansions, blows this out of the water both in strategy as well as in replayability. Sold.

Eh. I was the water carrier in my first, and likely only game. The reason I say that is, while the mechanisms are very clever, not only my actions, but the actions of every other player in the game seemed obvious and scripted. As with some other purely cooperative games, one experienced alpha player can inadvertenly sully the experience for everyone else. I'd rather make my own decisions, thank you very much.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Good, simple, light weight co-op game, with a great blend of gameplay mechanisms that fit the theme.
++ Good replayability from the different character cards and the variable storm movements.
++ Great insert that easily fits everything in its place. 
++ Variable difficulty is really easy to set up.
++ Easy to teach, fast to set-up and fast to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- The gameplay somewhat always seems like the same.
-- Even though necessary, the sand tiles takes time to always stack up correctly and it can look a bit messy (our sand tiles are a bit curved so it may be worst for us than for other people).
-- Too light for us (even though you can play at a higher difficulty, choices to be made during the game always seems light).

Forbidden Desert is my group's favorite casual game. It usually sees play as a desert game, either after the main event game, or actually with desert following a dinner party. It's clever. It's dynamic. And it's just a lot of fun.
"How did the sand hose run out of sand?! And why does that mean we lose?"
The most memorable plays are those in which we've died the most horribly.
"I don't need water. I can make it to the tunnel on my turn. What are the odds that the first card of the reshuffle will be a 'Sun Beats Down.'" These were the archeologist's last words.

Based on 1 play with 5 players:

It's really hard not to compare this to Pandemic. This is different enough to justify its existence, I suppose, but only just. If you already have Pandemic, it's probably not worth owning this too (especially if you have Pandemic's excellent expansions).

It's hard to tell whether there is more or less luck in this game, compared to Pandemic. There's no hero deck, so you can't, for example, continue to draw "useless" cards, but the Deck of Bad Stuff feels far more random. Sometimes you get cards that don't do anything, much to everyone's relief, but it's 100% luck of the draw. It's similar to drawing an eradicated color in Pandemic, but there it was a reward for skillful play which made it much more interesting and meaningful.

Also, it just feels like there's less to do in this game, full stop. There's less things to think about. And the theme is cool, but there are hundreds of games about "exploration" in some way so it doesn't exactly wow me. The flying ship is a rad idea, but it looks pretty ugly when built frankly. The colors of the different parts just don't come together in a nice way.

We played our first game on Normal and beat it without TOO much trouble. I'm not sure if it's easier than Pandemic (which took our group a few tries to master on normal) or I'm just better at these types of games now.

The way the game scales its difficulty makes me disinclined to try it on harder settings - I'm sure it works fine, but it's just not very interesting. The epidemics in Pandemic have a narrative and emotional weight to them that "start with less turns" just doesn't replicate, even if it makes things more tense.

It was engaging while playing, but if I happened to never play again I wouldn't feel like I'm missing out.

I like Pandemic quite a bit but never really felt that Forbidden Island was a good game. Forbidden Desert is sort of a sequel to Forbidden Island, but it’s much, much better! Like FI, FD features a pretty simple gameplay in which you have 4 actions and then flip over some cards which do bad things. You win if you find 4 part of an ancient flying ship and get to a certain tile before any player loses all of his water, the sandstorm track reaches a high level or if there aren’t enough sand tiles left. I like coop games in which you can only win in one way but lose in several. What makes FD so much better than FI is because of its slightly more “game-y” gameplay; FI is a light family game, but FD is a little step above. The genius idea of the moving sand tiles is what I like the most about the game as you never know where you’ll be or where the tiles will be on your next turn. 

The variable player powers, the items you can find and use as free actions, the tunnels in which you can “teleport” and hide from the sun are other very cool features as is how you actually are able to pinpoint where the ship components are hidden and the fact that they can move (which can really hurt you!). It’s an easy game to teach and play, and if you think it’s too easy to win, it’s very easy to adjust the difficulty level. I’m sure it’s going to be a hit with my family as well as some of my friends who aren’t really gamers. Any game I play about 10 times in a single month is definitely a good game! So why do I only rate it a 7 you say? Well, it’s a bit too simple for my taste. It’s quick, but I would rather play Pandemic for the same kind of feeling (although the two games are certainly very different).

Between the two Forbidden games (Island and Desert), I tend to like this one better.  The card exchange from Island is eliminated, replaced with a "triangulation" style method of finding the components needed to escape the desert.  The game also puts the players in peril with the "Sun Beats Down" cards.

Rated 7 after one play. I picked this up mostly for the benefit of having a quick playing solo game on hand. In the past, I had played Pandemic solo a few times as a nice winter diversion. But having played Pandemic Legacy, there's probably no going back to the vanilla game :)

Compared to Pandemic, Forbidden Desert is different enough, slightly shorter and an interesting little puzzle. It's worth setting up to play again.

Update: Check that. It's fine, but felt a bit samey after a few plays. Sold off.

This is an awesome cooperative board game with excellent art, mechanics, and game components.

Great design of the rescue ships.  Much better implementation than the Forbidden Island.  Plays tensely but enjoyably every time I played. The game is simple and easy to learn.  It is very suitable both for kids and non-gamers.  Good gateway co-op games for family.  Highly recommended!

Although I took a long time to be convinced (on the basis of Forbidden Island, which I didn't really enjoy all that much), this game is very different, and better in every way. Shifting sands, searching for parts, balancing water and ensuring the land isn't completely buried all works well. Vasel likened this to Tobago, but I don't think it is comparable mechanically - but a fantastic little title at a pricepoint that cannot be beat.

I assumed that this would be more or less a variation of previous Matt Leacock creations. It is however, almost an entirely new game. Yes there is some resemblance to its relatives (Pandemic and Forbidden Island), but it does stand alone. It is challenging without being overly complex. It is clever and fun and makes a great family game for older children. The components are fantastic and the flying machine is fun to assemble. Its a small thing, but this provides a much more satisfying ending to the game than either of the other relatives.

This game has really impressed me so far. I had wondered how it could be all that different from Forbidden Island, but it really is. 

Recently we played with friends and some of us were kind of too tired and didn't massively want to play but the game ended up reeling us all in - after not too long we were all invested in the game and enjoying it, and I think that is very telling in and of itself.

[b]What this game has taught me: [/b]If your helicopter crashes in a sand storm your best chance of survival is to dig in the sand dunes and hope to find scattered parts of an ancient flying machine that you can build to take you home. None of the helicopter parts will be of any use to you - leave them.

In fact - last time I took an airplane this was covered in the pre-flight safety demonstration. "In the event of a crash landing please form teams and start digging for ancient artifacts that can be cobbled together to make a new way to get home."

Hopefully this isn't just a reimplementation.

Now *this* is a different game than Pandemic. Obviously inspired from it, but the presence of two ticking timers (the ever-rising sand and the ever-dwindling supplies of water) make this game even more of a thrill to play. Even better, the tiles don't disappear after being buried under heaps and heaps of sand, which means that you never feel so overwhelmed as to become desperate. And then you lose, of course, but that's just how life is, right?

I really enjoyed my first play of the game. Enough to go out and buy it (ooh boy I get impulsive with my board game collection). The components are fabulous, the theme is fun, I like the different player roles (although you HAVE to have a waterboy (name?) or things get pretty...dry). At the end of the day I just really don't love cooperative games. This one is no different. When I play this game I feel like I'm going through the motions of dramatically reacting to the bad stuff and dramatically playing up the good stuff, but I never really feel genuine tension or achievement either way. In fact, the funnest way to play this seems to be with great exaggeration. Not really my type of game.

This blows Forbidden Island out of the water.  (pun intended)  The way the storm moves around the board adds great variety to the game.  Also the different trackers of the storm's movement and each character's need of water is great.  You really need to coordinate with the other players to refill your canteens at the same time being on the same tile as the wells are one-time uses...and one of the water tiles is a mirage...  Great game!

The best bits of Forbidden Island with the worst bits (such as being able to lose the game on the first turn) removed.

RATING: 9
Its a very approachable cooperative game.  It is one of the fist games I take out to teach people a coop game.  The only problem is it seems like one of the players is the leader and it kinda becomes a solo game with other people just going along for the ride.  I try to temper this so that everyone feels like they have equal input but after many plays there are things that are the best play and thus even with good coop I typically nudge people to a certain strategy.  Sometimes the game is more exciting for a group of people that have never played before. You can see more tension for survival.

RATING: 6
Really wished I had gone with Pandemic, got this idea that is was some grander, complex game. It isn't, Forbidden Island is just watered down, Forbidden Desert a step up, of the two Forbidden Desert is the better pick.

The problem with Pandemic is the MSRP and the base game isn't that much more over Forbidden Desert. Pandemic needs that In the Lab expansion to make it shine above the Forbidden series. Problem here is that is another $40 MSRP and the Lab Challenge is the only useable part, the rest expanses On the Brink, yet another $30 MSRP.

The Lab Challenge does away with the 5 card by one player collection cure, makes it a multi co-op step action. Basically makes it a little easy to collect the cards, but adds multi steps. It is a nice mechanism.

It is a shame Z-Man when it reissued the new 2013 edition of Pandemic it didn't include the Lab Challenge given the retail price and the base game needed a boost.


If you can pick up the 2013 Pandemic base game for $20, On the Brink for $25, for $45 I guess it is OK, for way less Forbidden Desert will do you.

What's impressive here is Matt Leacock was able to take one of his existing games and twist it enough that it truly feels new again.  In a nutshell - if you own and like Forbidden Island, there's no reason not to get the "sequel" as well.

This time around the tiles move due to a sandstorm, and pieces can get increasingly buried under the sand.  So you can't just ignore certain tiles anymore.  Also new is water rations - if anyone runs out when the sun beats down, you lose - so knowing where the wells are is crucial.  Lastly, the pieces of your ship aren't found in one place - you have to reveal the two matching tiles and then find the piece and their intersection.

So this is a winner - I definitely will want to play it regularly.  The art theme is steampunk which is cool, but it lacks the visual wonder that I thought was so great in FI.  Other than that, as usual Gamewright has top-notch components and packaging.

RATING: 7.5
This game is quite similar to Pandemic (from the same designer), but it is nice to have both in my collection. Again, it is coop (or solo) puzzle game to solve the goal before the game eliminates you.
Here you are some adventurers wrecked on the desert and trying to find the pieces of mystery ship to survive the heat and leave the desert.
Again, you will control different characters with different powers, having four action per turn so you can move, dig a sand, excavate etc. By excavating you will get useful tools to help you with your efforts, but also some clues where the four missing parts of the ship are located.
Your goal is to find those parts and pick them up to the leaving point before you die by thirst, bury in sand or swap away by heat. 
You will find some water wells to fresh yourselves and also tunnels where you can travel through and cool yourself from devastating sun heat. 

There is some comparison to Pandemic:
- the difficulty (to win the game) is harder than Pandemic. On normal difficulty I will more often die than win
- On the other side, I believe the rules are more simple having just a few characters, just a few helpful artifacts and only one way to move. Although Pandemic is also elegant and simple by rules, this is even more newbie friendly.
- Theme is nice there. Instead of disease spread through the globe, you will try to survive on the desert full of sand dunes and sun heat. And believe me, you will feel like you are on the desert praying that the sand storm doesn't hit you and bury you under the sand. The feel of the game is pressing there again, in similar both slightly different (more personal) way. You are trying to survive yourself instead of saving the world.
- There is no board, instead of it the game takes place in 5x5 grid of game board tiles allowing to randomize the starting setup for each game. This forces you to excavate the ground finding the needed clues for the missing pieces of the plane - each game will be different.

What I like
- the way you need to find and pick up the pieces of the ship is original and funny. You will have to excavate two pieces of clues for each part of the machine and then they will tell you where the part is. Then you will need to move there and pick it up. This is like finding the cure in pandemic, you need four parts to be able to leave. Slightly different, but similar principle here
- The constant pressure. You will be dying on thirst, sand will be growing and growing so you will need a lot of time (or some nice tool) to dig some places. If there are a lot of sand, you couldn't move through, but you desperately need to move there to pick that part or to hide to the tunnel to save your ass.
- The way the sandstorm acts. Again, as in Pandemic, the desert storm will act as in real desert. Moving from there to here, leaving more sand behind and maybe even bury yourself in sand. 
- I like the puzzle aspect of the game. You will have to risk sometimes leaving your fate in hand of the destiny (pack of storm cards), but in most cases you will have to find the best way how to handle the current issue out of several possible ones.

What I dislike:
- I would prefer normal (Paper or cartoon) game box instead of the Tin one with weird shape. It is original, but it looks strange in your game shelf. The storage could be better done.
- As in Pandemic, this game can suffer from alpha player issue when one player could take control of the game telling other what is the best way what to do (I am guilty of this behavior sadly sometimes). 
- some games are just one big frustration as the luck is not present and you will just die no matter how hard you try.

A fantastic Co-Op Game. I Highly Recommend for 2-5 Players. Great as an entrance game. But gets a little stale the more you play it with the same people. Way more fun when you play with people who are playing it for the first time or are new to board games

Replaces Pandemic for me and my family. Shorter, faster, same itch getting scratched. Forbidden Island felt like a re-theme of Pandemic, but this game's movement of the storm and finding the pieces of the flying machine make it much more unique and interesting.

RATING: 8
Excellent co-op game!  This game totally replaces Forbidden Island.  This is Matt Leackcock's true alternative to Pandemic.  Forbidden Desert is much more of a gateway game then Pandemic.   One of the few cons of Pandemic is you HAVE to play with experience gamers once you get good at it.  Forbidden Desert solves this by creating a much more random game while still retaining the same fun and survival feel of Pandemic.  It's hard to quarterback this one when you need to explore every tile anyway.  Highly recommend this game for someone looking for a light co op but is also "gamer's game" friendly.

I went in expecting this to be another Pandemic/Forbidden Island rehash, and was pleasantly surprised. It has clean, simple mechanics which work well for the game (I especially like the double-clue mechanism), but equally important, it [i]feels[/i] right for the premise - the sand piling up, the raging unpredictability of the storm, never being quite sure how difficult it will be to get from Point A to Point B, and the constant worry over water supply.

I like the little "upgrades" from FI.  Especially the way the parts are found.  It still plays very tensely, but enjoyably.

This game is just fun.  It's light and interesting, as the board potentially changes each turn.  It's fair to say that it stands alone among Matt Leacock's other games.  Forbidden Island really feels like a light version of Pandemic.  The ability to increase the difficulty in this one is a must, as the tension that was present in Forbidden Island when you faced losing an island tile completely is not present at all in this one.  However the scarcity of water does replace that in a way.

This has replaced Forbidden Island for me, though my wife laments that I traded that one off.  She doesn't really like this one.  Doh!

If Forbidden Desert costs $40+, I would not recommend it. However, you can regularly find it for sale at $20 or less, which makes it an amazing value. You get a slightly less complex but arguably equally fun co-op game compared to let's say Pandemic but for 2/3 of the price or less. 

The theme is a highlight of the game. You are a group of steam-punk adventurers trapped in a desert sandstorm and must scavenge parts to rebuild your airship to escape before the sand buries you. The game mechanism lets you do exactly these things: move around to clear sand and excavate for the four required parts while the sand tiles shift around in a random fashion and accumulate more sand. It is a race against time, just like Pandemic, but on a more personal level. And it is also a difficult game, just like Pandemic; you (and your friends) will not survive often. But when you do, you feel an incredible sense of satisfaction. To add to it, you will get to assemble a mini airship with the parts you find. These are high-quality components (the engine, for example, is actually cast in metal) that are much appreciated in such a budget-priced game.

So the value of Forbidden Desert is through the roof. You get a tense, thematic game with high-quality components for under $20.

This is a very fun, fast, and challenging coop game. I enjoyed forbidden island but after playing desert.. I probably wont play island again! Desert is more in depth and difficult. It requires more teamwork and thinking than island. The only reason I kept forbidden island is because it is a little more "kid friendly" and easy to learn for beginners than desert.

This is the first time I wish the rating systems was different. This game could be easily an 8 or 9, but since is Co-op is something I would only play if in the right mood. So it is a 7 since I am usually willing to play.

I played pandemic but for the price point I felt that it wasn't worth it. Also the card mechanics never really satisfied me.

Forbidden desert has a similar feel with a much lower price point which I think is perfect. The game play is fun and difficult and quick enough to give it several tries in one sitting. It has been a great hit so far.

The sequel to Forbidden Island, Forbidden Desert puts you and a group of adventurers out in search of parts to fix a broken airship to fly out of the desert.A lot of the key mechanics return from the previous game and adds some new ones that make the game a lot of fun to play.

It's a light, co-op game that has a lot in common with Pandemic. Needing to discover two tiles in order to find the parts at the intersect makes the game more challenging as more tiles need to be explored. The addition of the water supply per player also adds a bit more to think about but it isn't that hard to work with. It's a fun game and one that I added to my collection specifically because it can be played with non-gamers. The co-op design takes less pressure off the inexperienced since they'll be playing on the same team as the gamers in the group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An interesting variation and divergence from Forbidden Island, which I have owned for quite some time. I think Forbidden Desert is better for playing with people who have played at least one or two modern board games, whereas Forbidden Island is better for teaching non-gamers. I am not a big fan of cooperative games, but this one I enjoy.

Excellent cooperative game with high stakes and highly customizable difficulty level (though even starting out on the easiest level is no piece of cake). This gives off the same vibes as Pandemic, i.e. you always feel like several things are working against you and pressuring you into quickly & efficiently completing your objectives, which is the key to making a great cooperative game. The flying machine components themselves are uniquely cool--in fact the quality of all that you get is incredible for the affordable price. The excitement, range of options, and accessibility to new players makes it one of the best cooperative games out there.

This game is one step further removed from Pandemic than was Forbidden Island. The latter retained Pandemic's mechanism of aggregating cards into one player's hand in order to capture a treasure (or cure a disease). Forbidden Desert dispenses with hands of cards in favor of moving to tiles and then flipping those to discover the parts, water, and gear you need to survive and flee the desert. I find this to be a more satisfying process and thus Forbidden Desert to be a better game than its predecessor. I think Forbidden Desert is more difficult to win also, but it's close.

My first cooperative game, and I have not been disappointed.  It has definitely increased my interest in this genre.  The components are amazing. The gameplay has a decent amount of tension. The multiple defeat conditions create a fun balancing act when deciding what to do. The unique character powers foster teamwork because using them wisely is key to survival (although some of the powers seem a little contrived). The storm cards allow for a bit of randomness/luck that adds to the risk taking nature of the game. All that being said, I feel this game might lose its luster over time (but not any time soon).

Per my usual, I can't really rate too many cooperatives too high - I have trouble hitting the middle ground between oppressive alpha gaming and complete non-engagement with the game. I tend to settle for just focusing on carefully acting on my own turn, without contributing to others' turns unless queried.

That said, Forbidden Desert has a lot to enjoy in how its theme comes through in game-play. I adore the gradually piling sand and how it slows movement and, eventually, traps you beneath it. New people have trouble with the idea that the treasures aren't hidden at a specific tile until we find them - normally just have to encourage them to 'go with it.' Tends to click during the game.

Shuffling around the tiles and adding sand can feel a bit fiddley, but overall this is a solid coop game that is a bit simpler and more approachable than Pandemic.  The limited ways you can moved combined with how there are only a few simple actions makes it a great coop game for kids, but the variable starting difficulty makes it still interesting enough to play with adults.  You can't beat it if you are looking for a budget coop game.  Picked this up for $14.

An improvement over Forbidden island. Hasn't converted me to loving coops, but this is a solid short coffee table game. Unlike Island, the positions and identities of the tiles in this game really matter. The desert storm movement is also far more interesting than the Islands flood, and the searching mechanic beats waiting for cards.

This game is actually a lot less like Forbidden Island than I was expecting.  About the only thing they have in common is that the jobs are very similar, and you all have to end up flying off together at the end.  The first thing you will note about this game is that its MUCH harder that FI, and you will be required to move around ALOT more.  This I think is probably what makes the game the hardest, it plays about the same number of turns as FI, but you are required to "waste" a lot more actions just moving around trying to find things.  However, after playing FD, FI seems a bit too easy and simple.  FD will probably replace FI on most people's game shelves, even though they aren't as similar as you would think.

Lots of fun. Really appreciate the quick setup time, and because of that, I generally prefer this over Pandemic. The sandstorm mechanic is great (though it can also be frustrating because based on how lucky you get on this, it can be a big factor whether you win or not). Great components. I'd rather not have it in a tin.

Fun co-op game. Family favorite. Gets an 8 because this game will angervate even the most serene of people. At any given moment you can be overwhelmed with sand or the tile you were working to uncover can shift far from out of reach...in a flash. 

When you win...you feel like kings...When you lose most likely you will always do so with your fingers just out of reach of winning.  

It is fun. It has great game mechanics and is a beautiful looking game. But holy crap can it make you hate the desert and anyone stupid enough to travel there!

A nice step up from Forbidden Island. However, I double and even triple checked the rules to make sure we had been playing right, because we beat the game twice in two plays. Granted, we started playing in the easiest level to learn it (It was a gift I gave to my 8-year-old nephew so I don't want it to be frustrating for him at first), but I lost Forbidden Island in easiest level before and Forbidden Desert wasn't even close. The components are great, the art is beautiful and the added mechanics make sense (digging sand? yeah!). A great game to play with young kids and maybe not so young...

This is a pandemic-style cooperative game that expands on the ideas of Forbidden Island. It's gorgeous, inexpensive, and has some reasonable tactics. That said, I had a really horrible experience with the game since I played the Meteorologist and was mostly giving up my actions to avoid drawing storm cards, except for key junctures. I would need to play it again to truly evaluate the merit of this game since I mostly tuned out on my one play. That said, I can't ever see myself wanting to play this over Pandemic + Expansions due Desert's lack of variability by compparison.

Sept. 2013 (9.5) ... Great Game!  More layers (literally) than Forbidden Island.

Why not a 10?  I might bump it up someday, but what it gets down to is that it has the same formula as most cooperatives out there: you get X number of actions and then some bad stuff happens...next player.  The choice gets down to a)work toward victory condition or b) do something to buy some time. (compare Forbidden Island, Pandemic, On the Brink, Flash Point, Red November...ultimately they're all they same).

It's still very very very good.

Leacock's middle child?

It is interesting to see how Matt Leacock's game design evolved into Pandemic, because it's so transparent in the forbidden series.

Desert clearly improves upon Island, which for its part is a fun enough game, if not a little easy. Desert has more ways to murder you, but also adds curious mechanics like the storms movement, and steampunk themed gear cards.

The art work again is beautiful, compelling, but disappointingly superficial since there is no time to explore in this smash and grab game. 

Difficulty is very easy to ramp up. My wife and I went from being pretty cocky, to dead AF every time we play with just one bump in level. This may be owing to the layout of the tiles, the vulnerability of our characters, whatever. Dead is dead. Victory will be that much sweeter, I suppose.

I enjoy this more than [the android version of] Pandemic, and look forward to playing it with my kid when he gets older.

Still have yet to beat this game, are we just missing something? Pandemic is more popular with my group than this, and when playing with players who haven't done a co-op before, is frustrating. Forbidden Island is a better choice. It looks like it should be a kid's game, but it does have a punishing level of difficulty for kids.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Great game, still suffers from the fact that there's nothing that makes it necessary to have multiple players, making it seem kind of silly to have all these people sitting around watching everyone else's turns. Rules are less overwhelming for newcomers than Pandemic without all those bizarre movement options of discarding cards. Really at its best as a solo  game.

Pure co-ops are not my cup of tea.

Gear up for a thrilling adventure to recover a legendary flying machine buried deep in the ruins of an ancient desert city. You'll need to coordinate with your teammates and use every available resource if you hope to survive the scorching heat and relentless sandstorm. Find the flying machine and escape before you all become permanent artifacts of the forbidden desert!

In Forbidden Desert, a thematic sequel to Forbidden Island, players take on the roles of brave adventurers who must throw caution to the wind and survive both blistering heat and blustering sand in order to recover a legendary flying machine buried under an ancient desert city. While featuring cooperative gameplay similar to Forbidden Island, Forbidden Desert is a fresh, new game based around an innovative set of mechanisms such as an ever-shifting board, individual resource management, and a unique method for locating the flying machine parts.

-------------Original rating 30/5/17 Score:7
[b]Rating based on - 5+ plays, 2 player[/b]
The sequel to Forbidden Island, this game takes you on a survival mission in a burning hot desert where your helicopter has crashed. You will need to survive thirst, the blazing sun, a merciless storm and the resultant shifting sands. The Forbidden games use math in a really clever way to deliver thematic, exciting and [-]sometimes[/-] usually brutal experiences. It's probabilities all the way from the ratio of cards in the deck to the adjustable difficulty levels of the Storm Meter. 

Having played and loved Forbidden Island, I was very satisfied but my gaming partner was curious as to what this had to offer. Production quality is on par with that of Forbidden Island – high quality cards, tiles and plastic/metal components for the ship, and I heartily appreciate the fact that they included a stand for the Storm Meter as I'd had to get my own for the Waters Rising in Forbidden Island. It's quick and easy to setup and I love games in tins! The insert is great and holds everything perfectly, and the rule design is attractive yet functional. However, we came upon an ambiguous rule and that is to do with the use of the Solar Shield. It can be interpreted in two ways but the official ruling is that: [b]Solar Shield cannot be deployed after Sun Beats Down has been revealed![/b] 

Initially I was unimpressed as we won our first game on Novice quite easily. We then ramped it up to Normal and we were on our way to a decent level of difficulty, but still quite easy. We beat Elite on the first go as well which was very surprising. Our default starting setting is now Legendary. Maybe on future plays we'll try controlling two characters each as well and see if that ups the difficulty... It was easy to learn and play especially since we were already familiar with the system, but I feel it is easier than Forbidden Island where you also have the hand management aspect and have to decide which treasure clues or equipment to drop and then you curse when you finally get the last of a set....aargh!!! Here there is no hand limit so you can collect as much equipment as you'd like to help you without the agonising choice of whether to get rid of a clue or your sandbags. I also don't feel we do as much talking/co-ordinating here as most decisions seem quite obvious. You get a genuine feeling of exploration as you need to dig sand and excavate tiles to find the location of the missing ship parts, but it's also tedious working the entire grid. A hit and miss approach would not be very effective. 

Although the way the storm moves and the sand builds up is very cool and unique, I don't feel that this does anything better than Forbidden Island. I also love the Forbidden Island artwork much better plus the variety you get from all of the different island layouts. We don't need to start on anything higher than Normal as those layouts are difficult enough! I think this lack of variety would hurt Forbidden Desert and make it feel a bit same-y in the long run. This title is one that my gaming partner and I are in contention about – the exploration/discovery itch is scratched for me by Dead Men Tell No Tales, and the triangulation of the lost equipment itch is scratched by Crashland so I see no need to also have this one in the collection. Under evaluation.

Itch: co-op

For me, the good:

- The theme permeates everything in an amazing way
- Clues offer an interesting alternative to Pandemic or Forbidden Island's set collection
- I like coops

The bad

- Finding the clues feels like an exercise in "flip all the tiles before you die". While I initially liked the clues approach, its started to make me question my purchase.
- I grew up in the dessert and loathe them, so I'd prefer the look of Forbidden Island but it felt too easy and too close to Pandemic.
- I tend to prefer more real-world themes, so I probably would have preferred Flashpoint for my non-Pandemic coop.

Forbidden Desert is a good gateway game into the co-op gaming universe.  The game could easily be played with families and older kids (maybe, 9-10?) and has enough substance where adults can quite happily play it.

The game has a nice cohesive theme, interesting mechanics and doesn't suffer from a fixed board layout, so it has solid replayability.

Things can get tense in later game when it comes down to the wire, co-operation and co-ordination is must!

The game may be a bit too simplistic for some, or may hit the perfect balance for lighter gamers; either way, it's one you can easily pull out to play with non-gamers.

It's... meh? I love the component quality of the ship pieces and clever theme, but the unusual method of locating ship parts and too-frequent finding of helpful survival materials/locations to the point that they just sit in our hands for sooo long not being used totally takes us away the theme and has no nail-biting tension. Game's up for trade.

Not usually a fan of co-op games (with gamers) due to Alpha gamer syndrome, but in general I like this game better than Pandemic.  Have had some great experiences playing this with out of town friends.  I'm sure I'm going to be hearing for a long time how I lost the game because I didn't get water when it was offered.  Which is a note to how differently this game plays/feels with 2 vs. 4-5 players.  2 players seems easier at the same difficulty level.  4-5 players, there is a lot of time sweating it out (figuratively and literally) as all the bad stuff comes around and your poor little pawn just sits in the desert getting pounded by the elements.

Ez egy nagyszerű családi játék! Elkerülhetetlen, hogy összehasonlítsam a Pandemiccel. A szabályrendszere egyszerűbb, mint a Pandemicé, könnyebben befogadható társasjátékokban kevésbé rutinos játékosoknak is. 4 egyszerű akciót hajthatunk végre a körünkben, amit – a játék menetét erősen befolyásoló – megfelelő számú viharkártya felhúzása követ. A játék egyik legötletesebb része a homokfúvás, amikor is a lapkáink a viharkártyának megfelelően mozognak (és temetődnek be homokjelölőkkel). A feszültség is kisebb, mint a Pandemicben, ami nem azt jelenti, hogy nem rágjuk le a körmünket idegességünkben! Nagy pozitívum, hogy öten is játszható, bár az ideális játékoslétszám szerintem 3-4 fő. Ami elsősorban családi játékká predesztinálja, az a nagyfokú szerencse a játékban! Ez nem negatívum, csak tisztában kell lenni vele, hogy ez egy a szerencsére nagyban építő játék. A véletlenszerű lapkaelrendezés, illetve a felhúzandó viharkártyák elrendezése nagyon kedvező, illetőleg kedvezőtlen helyzetbe is hozhat bennünket pillanatok alatt! A különböző tulajdonságokkal rendelkező karakterekkel tudjuk nemileg kordában tartani az ingadozó szerencsét. Könnyű tehát elbukni a játékot, de akkor jöhet egy újabb menet! A játékidő nagyban egyezik a dobozra írttal, azaz kb. 45 perc alatt megy le egy parti. Hacsak nem pusztulunk el hamarabb a sivatagban. Szép játék, viszonylag gyors, kooperatív, élvezet minden perce!

Forbidden Desert might have the strongest theme/mechanic coupling of any game I've played.  The shifting tiles/piles-o-sand mechanic really makes it FEEL like you're in a desert.  This is a favorite game to play with newer players.

I will say that it seems like there's less replay value and less long-term planning than Pandemic (due to the hidden information), but this is still an outstandingly designed game.  I also feel like the hidden information makes this game less prone to quarterbacking, which can be nice.

Resisted getting this game because thought it would be too similar to Forbidden Island.  It's true that knowing Forbidden Island is groundwork for this game, but the games are different enough that I am delighted I also own this.  

Forbidden Desert plays 5, instead of 4.  It includes features in  the game very apropos to the desert theme.  Sandstorms occur with shifting dunes, water is an issue as the sun beats down.  The metal box is a problem on my game shelf, but the components are quality & add flavor to the game.  It is harder to win and employs a different strategy, and lasts longer even though the game moves right along.  I found that more communication & cooperation between the 5 of us occurred than with Forbidden Island.  The game adjusts nicely to fewer players.  Easy to teach & remember game play.

Forbidden Desert 禁忌沙漠 2-5(4)
Our group we always play 5P, we played it four times; twice with navigator, twice without. We lost both times without the navigator and that makes me wondering - best not jump to the conclusion too early. Regardless, we love this game, people have requested to bring this game henceforth for the rest of year, because it's that challenging! The tension gradually picks up around mid stage, and I think that's where the fun starts. The rule is not 100% clear and has some small things you might want to check on the forum first. Luck in this game is totally acceptable because the short play time and constant shift of sands fits the theme very nice. Some games you may have it easy on you with the quick-access tunnels or the dumb eye of storm that constant hitting walls, but that is all part of great fun about this game.

I enjoy this game but feel like the puzzle doesn't changed enough to avoid getting stale. Even on Legendary difficulty, I find that I am not using all my moves every turn and whether I win or not comes down to which statue cards come up.

Bought at UK Gaming Expo after a really fun play-test. I think every copy at the Expos was sold out within an hour of the trading floor opening so I was lucky to snag one!

Really looking forward to playing this with the children.

*update - after a couple of plays with the children, they both really enjoy it. But it hasn't changed my wife's negative view on co-op games.

 When you no longer find Forbidden Island a challenge, or maybe just have 5 instead of 4 players. This is the game. Similar to Forbidden Island in execution but a new host of thematic tiles. A clever Sandstorm card mechanic that ramps of the randomness and difficulty as well as the need to work together and maximize your moves will provide you some nice challenges to return to in this familiar world.

A good upgrade to forbidden island. Quality was high, and the gameplay was good.  Im just not sure at this point how many of these kinds of games I need to have in my collection. I thought it would replace forbidden island for me, but I think I still like the clean game play of forbidden island.

Probably my favorite co-op game. The theme is excellent, you really get the feeling of being in the middle of the desert, trying to excavate this ancient city. The roles are very well thought-out and balanced. It scales really well from 2-5. All the equipment makes sense and each is very useful, usually game-saving (tip: save the equipment till it's absolutely necessary to use!). And my favorite aspect is the storm itself and how it moves around; cool mechanism that makes sense thematically and adds so much to the tension/difficulty of the game. Very fun game and one I highly recommend!

A great light game for families, friends who are not really into games, or experienced gamers looking for a simple play. The biggest downside to the game is that it may be unbeatable depending on how the cards are shuffled, starting positions of tiles, and starting game level, but the uncertainty allows for the players to feel they stand a chance, and the game is built well enough that most run-troughs to come down to last last few turns. If played well, most games will be very exciting down to the last turn or so. Overall the game is very entertaining.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable cooperative game.  The mechanics of finding the pieces based on the uncovered clues is interesting and the storm mechanic and drought cards certainly ramp up the pressure.   I won't be buying it myself as I prefer Pandemic and there's enough in common that I'll stick with what I already have.

This feels so much a skin for Matt Leacock's other cooperative designs, that I am tempted to simply refer you to my other reviews for them.
The games are cooperative, but players of varying skill levels break the game immediately, as a skilled player will either take the game over (since that player makes the best decisions) or must sit back and host the game.
The dangers that appear between turns do not feel quite so random in this particular title since they all center about the storm, but the fact that the storm cannot wrap around the board makes the game no less of a crapshoot than other similar titles.

PROS:
-Es un juego muy bien calculado para huir del desierto en el último turno o muy cerca de él
-Permite graduar la dificultad en función de la curva de aprendizaje de cada persona
-Mayor dificultad que "La isla prohibida"
-Cada partida es diferente gracias al uso de distintos personajes y a la disposición cambiante de las losetas en el tablero
-Se puede jugar en solitario
-Relación calidad/precio muy buena

CONTRAS:
-El efecto líder es alto
-La cuna no permite guardar bien los componentes, es necesario quitarla
-Si el dorso de una loseta de desierto sufre un arañazo o marca, podrá identificarse y esto le quitará emoción al juego, por lo que es necesario enfundarlas

Always wanted to try this since it came out. Never played Forbidden Island, so this was an interesting place to start working with this series of games. FD is a fairly neat co-op, with easy-going mechanics and usually tense game play. Out first game of it kicked our assess like nothing but we won our second game, which people around said is still a difficult thing to pull off. Nice to know we made the best of it by a second go-about! Really not the most engaging co-op made (would choose Pandemic every time over this) but still a very nice production (over-produced, really) and something I'd sit down to again.

RATING: 8
While I'm finding that I am starting to dislike the "quarterbacking" of co-op games (I want to be 100% in control of my actions), this is a fantastic solo game! Unlike some games that have awkward rule exceptions/addendums for solo play (e.g. Imperial Settlers) this one plays smoothly.

The artwork and theme are both highly tuned. I typically don't like games with lots of fiddly little parts, but I make an exception for this one (and it's still far better than others in this respect, like Small World, which I refuse to play any more). It comes in a very nice looking and feeling tin can too.

The rules and gameplay are surprisingly easy to pick up quickly given it's decidedly not a "light" game. It's good game design: everything is logical and well thought out.

It's clear the creators play-tested this game. On a solo run (playing as two players) and a multiplayer run of four players, the games were close. I just barely won the solo game, and we just barely lost the multiplayer game, when both were set on the "Novice" initial storm level.

Not as good as Forbidden Island. At first it feels more deterministic, since there are fewer random elements without the cards, but the storm can get stuck in a corner one game, and rampage all over you the next. So it feels like the difficulty swings too far from game to game.
And the endgame is much less compelling than Forbidden Island. Nothing really beats the actual board falling away.

An improvement on Forbidden Island in every way.

But the mechanics are great, and I love the tactility of the components.

I have to rate this about the same as Forbidden Island. It's definitely more difficult, which is good, but also not as accessible. It's pretty neat how many of the mechanisms from Forbidden Island are essentially 'reworked', and they fit the theme quite well. I'm not sure there is more strategy to this than Forbidden Island though.
For the price the components are really nice, and the artwork is pretty mysterious/intriguing as well.

None of the two would replace Pandemie for me.

I love Forbidden Island, and this is a bit heavier of a game. Thus, that makes it a must have. Plus, the production value is superb.

This works well as a 2P game, although it can be really, really hard if you get characters that have somewhat redundant abilities (Climber, Navigator).

I like the added dangers here, and makes for a more challenging game. This is Forbidden Island on steroids, and more game-y than FI.

I like this one a little more.

Played a solo (2p) game on Novice to learn the rules.  It's a very well thought out, thematic, clever game design.  It's more straightforward than Pandemic, but it still has the building tension vibe going for it.  It's also quicker than Pandemic, too, because sometimes you want cooperative, but you don't want all the overhead of something like Robinson Crusoe.  This is a great game for playing with younger kids.  I'm glad I traded for this.

UPDATE: 5 plays and we still haven't survived.
UPDATE: Won on the 6th play. 
UPDATE: We win almost every time now.  It's lighter and simpler than Pandemic.  While my wife and I might not choose this regularly, it will serve as a good stepping stone when my son gets old enough to start playing with us.

My first ever co-op game, I really enjoyed this upon first play. The interesting mechanic and steampunky theme really appealed, and it provided just the right level of challenge that it wasn't possible to beat on first go, but you knew with a bit more practice you could do it. However the novelty factor wore off very quickly, and after beating it on my fourth play nearly a year ago I've not been tempted to go back to it.

RATING: 9
An amazing piece of design work. Streamlined and easy to learn, but very difficult, with trickier decisions than Forbidden Island or even Pandemic.

One caveat is that the players have no private information at all, so a bossy player could potentially try to dictate everyone's moves. As with any purely cooperative game, a collaborative spirit is necessary for proper enjoyment.

Impressions on roles after many games: Navigator, Archaeologist, and Climber are all amazing. Water Carrier is also very good. Meteorologist and Explorer are weaker than the rest.

Excellent art and theme, you really feel you are trapped in a desert.

Forget Forbidden Island. This game buries it in a sandstorm of better mechanics, refined ideas, and brilliant design. I'm surprised how well this game works, and how ineffective Forbidden Island is in comparison.
GET THIS GAME!
Tense, action packed, and it doesn't suffer from the issue that plagues other cooperative games: it's not always obvious what is the "Next Right Thing To Do." It keeps you guessing, and prevents "bossy" types from dominating the choices of individual players.
The end game is a little fiddly.
I think they left out some essential "what about this?" questions that, as designers, they were blind too, but even then, it's still fun and you can house rule the ending anyway you want.

This was again a recommendation by a fellow board gamer/geek, who happens to own Forbidden Island. 
I wanted a co-operative game where it is one VS. game and he said blindly go for this one.

Oh man, did we enjoy it... but damn! this game was tough. We lost twice due to dehydration and some bad decisions we took during the gameplay and once we played on a very high difficulty level. Need to play this again and beat the bloody game. 

I cannot recommend this enough to people who want an easy to setup, easy to teach, mid-level game to enjoy with friends. And it's ranked 217 on BGG which is a big deal in my opinion.

Go for it, don't hesitate. Trust me you will love it. Just start at a lower difficulty level that's all. $@#! those Sun-Beat down cards.

I think this game is technically better than a Forbidden Island, but I just prefer Island anyway. The sand tokens in this annoy me. If I want to manipulate dozens of cardboard tokens, I'll play Space Empires 4X or something.

RATING: 6
Very tense at times, I've played only with 4-6 people (Six players doesn't feel like it breaks the game). The adjustable difficulty and changing field of play make each game unique even when we're playing with the same classes. 

I don't like it quite as much as Flashpoint because it does tend to feel a bit (really minimally) more random in its conclusions on higher difficulties. You end up being very close to losing by all different conditions and more often than not you don't quite make it. That being said the high-intensity of the rest of the game and the hope that I'll one day beat the legendary difficulty keep this entertaining.

A worthy sequel to Forbidden Island. I might like this one better. As before, the board is made of tiles laid on a grid, and you must explore the tiles to find what you need to escape. This time, however, the board shifts and changes, and there's more variety in what the tiles do. It's feels like a different game, and things get increasingly desperate in the face of the tidal wave of sand that pours down on the board. It a fun, thematic co-op that may be the new gateway game I use for introducing new gamers into the fold.

A great cooperative game that builds on the gameplay developed in Pandemic and Forbidden Island. Each player has a unique ability that the team must use together in order to find the pieces to assemble a flying machine and escape. The desert is constantly shifting and piling sand, the threat ratchets up quickly.

Difficult but not impossible, this game really does rely on teamwork for success. The nice production values and artwork complement it nicely.

Nothing about this game really interested me. It was a serviceable coop game that kept everyone involved and talking across the table, but we completed it easily the first time I played, and I really had no desire to play again. The mechanics to me were as dry as the setting, and though many were similar to the kinds of things you'd be doing in Dead of Winter, it never managed to solicit the sort of emotional response that that game frequently does. Not bad, just not my cup of Darjeeling.

RATING: 6
It's bigger and more complex than "Forbidden Island", but that doesn't make it better (or worse). It's also much less visually appealing. The artwork on the tiles cannot be really appreciated, as they start face-down, showing only desert, and are often covered by sand tiles after revealed.

You are again doing a couple of simple actions and using your character's special power, trying to get some stuff and moving to a given location to escape. Clearing sand is analogous to draining water in its predecessor. Otherwise, however, the two games are not too similar. The "Pandemic" deck mechanic is gone and the pressure comes mainly from surviving with the scarce water. Also, in order to get the items you need to win, instead of collecting cards, you actually have to determine their location by searching for a pair of coordinates. The game is not something I need to own, but still a worthy addition to the series.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Forbidden Island's big brother. Visually, at first, it didn't appeal to me equally as Forbidden Island. The sand tiles had an odd shape I thought. But, having played the game, I realize the shape is essential to the game and it doesn't bother me at all anymore. Quite the opposite really.

The small but essential change in mechanics from Forbidden Island to Forbidden Desert is what makes the latter, thematically, a better game to me. (And I already thought he theme in the former was great...) Now finding the parts of the airship really feels like discovery, it's no longer just set collection.

A Pandemic játék alkotójának másik remeke. Kalandorok keresik az ősi városban az Elveszett Hajót jutalomként, azonban egy szörnyű viharnak hála a jutalom egyben az életben maradásuk feltétele is, mert csak a segítségével juthatnak ki a tikkasztó, veszedelmes sivatagból. Minden erőtöket összeszedve egy csapatként kell küzdeni a túlélésért (minden csepp vízért) kihasználva speciális képességeiteket és „plusz” feladatként – ha ennyi nem is lenne elég – meg kell találni az alkatrészeket, hogy a hajót összerakva „elvágtassatok” a naplementébe.
Egyszerű szabályok, jó téma, többszöri játékra is kellemes kikapcsolódás. Visszatér a Pandemic-effekt: ha nem nyert a csapat, azonnal felhangzik a „na még egyet” szlogen :)
A kártyák minősége nem a legjobb, viszont a tároló fémdoboz szuper!

I was very luke warm on Forbidden Island. It is a great game for beginners and kids, but there is not much substance there compared to say Pandemic. This game, however, is superb. I love the fact that they have gone away from the set collection mechanic. To win this game on elite is quite a challenge with 3 characters. It requires you to really utilize each player's ability to its fullest. This is something that I also find with Pandemic on harder difficulty, while I can beat Forbidden Island on elite most of the time regardless of which character I have in play. 

There are two elements that can break you in this game - sand piles and lack of water. Playing with more people actually makes the game harder because you can die between turns easier by running out of water. As you play with more characters water management becomes very important. Sand management can be more difficult with fewer characters because you have less board coverage. This adds another layer of complexity and replay ability, especially solo as you vary the number of characters that you use. 

I would recommend this game to anyone who likes co-ops regardless of whether or not you like Forbidden Island. The games are substantially different. It is still simple enough to break out with kids and newbies, plays great solo, and can be brutally hard for your advanced gaming group.

Haven't played it much yet, but I'm coming to love coop games and this has all the elements of a great one.

I've found that Forbidden Desert is the best game to introduce to people that don't normally play board games. The mechanics are simple enough, but what really blows them away is that everybody cooperates. That simple fact seems to be something everyone can get into, plus it makes the game not as daunting.

That's not to say it's easy. After introducing it to new players, what you've still got is a very good cooperative game that always elicits many cheers as well as cries of agony as the storm never dies down.

Better because more thematic than forbidden island. Steam punk meets desert works great.

A very simple game with some Pandemic type elements.  The theme definitely works its way throughout the game.  A bit more random than other co-ops, as the sandstorm can either get caught in a useless corner making it too easy, or have a nasty path that makes it too hard to come back from.  A few of the gear items such as the jetpack are very helpful to have and help smooth things out.

Definitely fun, and is pretty easy to setup and play through.

Forbidden Desert takes us back to the coop world of Forbidden Island, as players try to reclaim 4 items, then escape a deathtrap, in this case a very lethal desert.

The neat thing is that Leacock has reimagined how his game punishes players again, by using the shifting sands to limit travel, and also to make getting to the target space more difficult by moving sands.

The player abilities are similar, but desert focused, and the items to be recovered are the pieces of a fabled flying ship that will (hopefully) take the players to safety.

This is as strong a game as Forbidden Island- possibly better- so on a 1st play of a favored designer, I'll jump to a 7.5.

Leacock hits another co-op out of the park.

Not sure which Forbidden ____ game is more stressful, this one or Island. You definitely feel the time crunch as you run out of water. All the strategy in the world won't save you if you get the least useful jobs and a bad run of luck with cards/tiles but it's a fun intro to co-operative gaming and the moving tiles/desert sand build-up is a fun mechanic. Doesn't get as much play as Pandemic, though.

With much trepidation, I bought this game for my 7-year old.  He loves Forbidden Island, but I was worried that this one's mechanics were going to be a bit much for him.  I'm glad to say I was wrong; he picked it up just fine.  Now he loves this game as much as FI.  In fact, for his 8th birthday, he wants to play both games back-to-back.  I chuckled and said we didn't have to wait for his birthday, but I can make sure we pencil it in.

The game is similar to Forbidden Desert, but different enough that we enjoy playing both.  For us, it doesn't completely replace Forbidden Island, but I could see that it could for many people.

The shifting sandstorm mechanic is great.  The threat of the sun is very real, too, and definitely adds a lot of tension to the game.  Hide in the tunnels too much to avoid the sun and the sand starts to pile up.  We've definitely lost before because we ran out of sand tiles.

This game is another hit from Matt Leacock; I can't wait to see what he does next.

An easy to learn co-op game that has a lot of fairly high amount of mean randomness to it. Tough to win.
I think if I want mean randomness I would prefer Flashpoint though or if I wanted something more straightforward, I would go with Pandemic. The ship bits are nice for no reason--might appeal more to younger kids.

A Forbidden Island like cooperative game. I arrived in time to join in as the Water Carrier. Even though Jo warned us about the sand we preferred to move and dig. We found all the bits and were close to the ship when the sand finally overwhelmed us.

RATING: 9
A definite improvement on Forbidden Island. Much harder, more ways for things to go bad, harder to find a clear good strategy, and more need to cooperate - all of which are great things in a coop. It does run longer and the artwork isn't quite as visually appealing, but on the whole I like the game a lot more.

This is slightly more complex than Forbidden Island, and I think it's a little more interesting.  I like the search for components, which is determined in a two-dimensional way rather than giving them specific locations.  The need for water makes this tough.  Probably my favorite of the three Leacock co-ops. (1 play)

I like [b]Pandemic[/b], but it can be a little much sometimes. [b]Forbidden Island[/b] scratches some of that same itch, but it's a bit light. [b]Forbidden Desert[/b], though, can be like Baby Bear's porridge: juuuuuuuuuust right. The "sandstorm" and piece-locator mechanics are awesome, the game builds smoothly, the component quality is stellar (particularly for the price point - how do they do it?!), and every game I've played has ended with everybody saying "just ONE more..." Really good.

Blows Forbidden Island clear out of the water (and into the sand dunes). I enjoy Forbidden Island, but I really loved how this game built on it's predecessor's elements and developed something truly unique. This is not just Pandemic Lite anymore, but a dynamic and highly unique experience. 

Perhaps the only thing I preferred about FI was that it allowed for a variety of board layouts, whereas this pretty much has just one.

Family found this game on a flee-market, we played it and it wasn't a great success so it sat on the shelves for about a year. Now I can appreciate a play of this every once in a while. It's easy to play, harder to master and has adjustable difficulty levels for any gaming group. This is a game you can play with both occasional gamers and seasoned players.

RATING: 5
Beat the game 2 player relatively quickly on every difficulty. The idea of playing the game again doesn't sound appealing--I feel done with the game after ~5 plays.  It's not particularly compelling in that it just kind of happens, although it has its occasional tense moments. It's well designed for what it is though, so if you find the concept interesting I'd recommend it.

(As an aside, there is a legal 2 player class combo that kind of trivializes the game.)

RATING: 6
Cooperative game in which you're all trying to escape from a desert in which the sands are rapidly rising, and you're all at risk of succumbing to the scorching sun.

Very similar to its predecessor Forbidden Island, and that's perhaps why I have given it not such a high score (although I enjoy this game thoroughly).  I just don't think there's room for both games in anyone's collection, they're too similar and both are played in the same sort of way.

The other reason I have not scored this particularly highly is that it's a little too formulaic.  By this I mean that you will basically be on auto-pilot after a few plays, and there isn't a huge range of googlies that the game can throw your way.  I believe Pandemic is better at that, and I prefer the card mechanic in that game to this one.

All that said, this is a strong game - it encourages discourse with your fellow players, it can often be tense (especially towards the end), and it is simple to teach.  Recommended for families and for playing with non-gamer pals.

This is the game that got me into board gaming. It is a great buy for anyone interested in the hobby or looking to introduce their friends to modern gaming. It is relatively simple, but has a lot of replayability and does a great job of creating a fun, tense atmosphere. The only reason I don't score it higher is because the higher in-game difficulties require a great deal of luck to win, no matter how good you are. Still, this is one of the best games for newcomers and I'm sure you and your friends will have a blast playing it.

This is one of the absolute best Cooperative-Set Collection games out there. It's very intense as you try to collect your items and escape from the sinking island. Many of plays of this game result in shouting and wringing of hands followed by cheering when we've snatched victory from the soggy hands of death. It's simple enough to be considered a kids game, but deep enough to be enjoyed by adults. This is not just a "younger" version of Pandemic. It's similar, but more intense co-op game with amazing art and fantastic components.

Great game design. Quality components and a challenging endeavor for all ages. I don't love it as much as Pandemic, for instance, but I certainly respect the game design.

My first impression is that it's better than Forbidden Island.

The way the sand works seems both more reasonably mechanically and more interesting thematically.

I really like this game, but I do feel that the game is wildly unbalanced if you have 5 people. Due to the number of cards drawn between turns, and the amount of water lost during 'sun beats down' cards, it seems like it's FAR too difficult with 5 players. Perhaps this is user error on my part though. In any case, it's a great game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
One of the best puzzle style game I played along with Pandemic. But unlike Pandemic, this one had much stronger theme - with each sand storm moving about, it gave very desperate feeling of being buried alive in the desert, and dying of thirst compared to move around clearing cubes off the board while discarding 5 same colored cards to find cure. 

The game is not easy by any means - it seems a bit luck dependent with what storm card gets flipped. But the randomness is welcoming challenge in this one. Very nice co-operative game that definitely deserves a praise. I can easily recommend this game out to everyone.

Parted to my good friend's birthday present. Hope they won't find it too hard to beat it!

In Forbidden Desert, a thematic sequel to Forbidden Island, players take on the roles of brave adventurers who must throw caution to the wind and survive both blistering heat and blustering sand in order to recover a legendary flying machine buried under an ancient desert city. While featuring cooperative gameplay similar to Forbidden Island, Forbidden Desert is a fresh new game based around an innovative set of mechanisms, such as an ever-shifting board, individual resource management, and a unique method for locating the flying machine parts.

How does Matt Leacock keep releasing the same game over and over again and still manages to make it feel interesting and compelling? I have no idea but this one is another hit! I still like pandemic more but this one is a solid production that is definitely worth the money. The production quality is amazing and the game is still pretty darn hard so don't expect to beat it on your first game which means you'll definitely be playing this one a bunch.

What an amazing development of the Forbidden Island (read: Pandemic) mechanics. Amazing components, tense gameplay, low entry level. At first I was disappointed that the tiles weren't named (as in Forbidden Island), but I quickly realized how much more immersive the game became without silly names on the tiles. I felt like I was there at the lost city of the desert! It brought back memories of the amazing Uncharted Series for PS3. We just played with 2, but I can hardly wait to try it with a few more people.

After five plays I would say it is too easy for 2 players and too hard for 5. I will probably enjoy playing this with 4 or 5 players. For 2 players I prefer Forbidden Island.

I think it suffers from balance issues that were less strong in Forbidden Island. Even that, the game is very good.

I found this game simply boring. The fact that the sand accumulates doesn't feel like a real threat.

And the only real way we lost, was because of multiple water-stealing cards coming out of the deck at the same time, which felt really unfair.

I would recommend any of the other games I've tried before this one

Decent coop that seems to be pretty hard to beat. Slightly changing game board is an interesting mechanism that could have been used more aggressively. Piling sand creates an interesting clock mechanism, but it also could have been more aggressive like in Ghost Stories where ghosts create a similar clock, but you have to take care of most of them while here you can ignore most of the sand.

Rating might go up. I was really excited for this game and kept pestering my FLGS in the weeks after the release date. But the plain truth is I haven't been having as much fun in sessions of this compared to Forbidden Island. There's something that feels thematically off to me about the oasis tiles being 2-time-use only. The mirage tile is a great idea. There's a lot of stacking and flipping of chits when it comes to the sand storms and it feels like a chore that takes away from the gameplay. The roles are good.

I (Keith) really like co-op games and this is one of my favorites. The components are high quality, the art design is great, and the gameplay is fun. Despite being made by the same game designer as Pandemic this game feels different and new. Don't expect an easy win when playing this game, especially when playing with 4-5 people. We have lost far more than we have won. It's not so hard that you feel cheated however, as every loss has been very close and every win has felt very satisfying like you really overcame a challenge together.

Meh.  I don't feel the need to ever play this again.  I suppose I should at least give it the benefit of the doubt until I experience a game that involves collecting some parts and at least trying to build the ship-thingy.  However,  the mechanics and presentation just don't appeal to me.  The artwork is unappealing; the actions (ooh, draw some gear - ooh, a dust buster) are boring.  I might be convinced to give it another try at least but I'm more likely to try to avoid this again.

This is just enough deeper to still work as a Pandemic lite game that's not just for kids and non-gamers.

It takes the modular board from Forbidden Island, exchanges sinking pieces with the storm shifting them around and heaping sand on them, and also replaces the less thematic set collection with triangulation to find the pieces.
It's predecessor is probably easier to teach, but Forbidden Desert is the much cooler game.

I LOVE any game that plays differently each time, plus, it's a nice change of place from competitive to cooperative. In this case, the game tiles always lay out differently every time, and your roles always change, so replay value is high.

It gets a higher score, because it's HARD. You really need to make as few mistakes as possible to win, so the incentive to play is always high, because you WANT to beat the game, knowing you've tasted plenty of defeat in the past...

The sand mechanic is awesome. I just can't buy into the theme at all. I'm okay with you looking for something in the desert and your helicopter crashes, but your only way of escape is finding this fantastical flying machine, putting it back together, and hoping beyond hope that somehow it really can fly? Give me a break! I just tell myself they're trying to find the parts of the helicopter and trying to put it back together, but it's difficult when the parts don't at all look like a helicopter.

Bah! Pandemic might be my favourite game of all-time so I feel like I should at least like this game too, but I just don't.

So close to perfect, i just wish that there were a little bit more "danger" like forbidden island had.  This is a wonderful, inexpensive co-op/solo game.  The only flaws are that it is a little too "lucky" sometimes.  where you just find everything too soon, or the final tile is the one you need. all depending on the shuffling.  It's rare, but still annoying when it occurs.  Other than that the game is fast paced, fun, and easy to get people into.

Slightly simpler than Pandemic, but as unforgiving for new players. Engrossing game, fun to introduce and play with non-gamers and gamers alike. Despite its simplicity complex strategies can arise, especially towards  the less forgiving higher difficulty levels.

RATING: 7
A challenging game with superb artworks and well balanced characters. One of the good sized games you can play with anyone and it's nice that each game is fairly short. The concept of an ever-changing board is awesome, but it doesn't work out all that well since the sand mainly builds up in the edges (especially on turned tiles) and the storm often gets stuck in corners. It also lacks some strategy, since you barely need a idea of where you're moving. I think the equips could have been more powerful and unique by replacing a few equipment tiles with bedrock. One of the downsides with it being a co-op game is that the most experienced players often decide what to do. All in all, 10 for being the best co-op game I've played, but only 7 for the game overall.

I've been waiting for this game and am really glad I finally got it.  It has the simplicity of Forbidden Island with the sand twist.  Granted there is a lot of luck involved here, but the game is really fun to play.  As much fun as Island, maybe more.  Components are of course great and the gameplay is really fun.  I slso like that because of the randomness it makes it very challenging to predict what will happen next.  If the tiles move where you want to go, you could be in trouble.

In Forbidden Desert, a thematic sequel to Forbidden Island, players take on the roles of brave adventurers who must throw caution to the wind and survive both blistering heat and blustering sand in order to recover a legendary flying machine buried under an ancient desert city. While featuring cooperative gameplay similar to Forbidden Island, Forbidden Desert is a fresh new game based around an innovative set of mechanisms, such as an ever-shifting board, individual resource management, and a unique method for locating the flying machine parts.

I'm not keen on abstracts and I'm not a fan of co-op games, so this was never going to be a winner.

I like Pandemic a lot, though it doesn't get much table time. I've been curious about Forbidden Island for a long time, but never got a chance to try it out. So I was glad to get a shot at this one. Like Pandemic, it's a co-op that seems like it shouldn't be a big deal until you realize you're about to fail in several different ways, at which point you scream, "How is this even possible?" We ended up playing (and failing) twice, which is pretty good considering one guy hate hate hates co-op games. I liked this well enough, but if you have Pandemic or Flash Point I can't see where you need this as well, as it's pretty much just more of the same.

I rate games high, and I rate them high because I rate them  according to niche. For instance as a light family move and find, i.e. "action point allowance", this game shines. I enjoy the mechanics and I enjoy the co-op, and the pretty tiles and I enjoy the moving tiles and the character abilities and how everything just makes sense. I didn't care for losing tiles in Forbidden Island (although I never played, just watched it played) and Forbidden Island just BURIES tiles, but with a dune blaster card it's easy to get your card back. My only gripe, and one that should drop the rating down is how cheap the construction is. My cards at play through three look like they took a beating from many game nights. Likewise the tiles are already chipping on the sides. This might not seem so bad but the goal is tile secrecy - you don't necessarily WANT to know what's under a tile because it's supposed to be a surprise. That being said the price was good, i like the tin box, everything fits well, the ship is fun and overall it was a good value. I looked forward to it and I was not disappointed - except for the wear, that was sad.

Now, co-op games are not my favorite, but I love this one. It fixed several of the issues that I had with Forbidden Island, and the theme is better (though I miss the diver).

In this game, you've crashed in the desert and need to build a legendary flying device before you die. You have to unearth the coordinates for the four parts, collect the parts, and make it back to the center tile before you die of thirst, the storm picking up too much, or even being buried by sand. The catch? There's a roving sandstorm that shifts everything around. Spoilers: You will die of dehydration like half the time.

As far as light coöps go, this one succeeds well.  The clues mechanic, storm mechanic, and general steampunk-y flavor go far to make this a lot of fun.  It's pushed well past "Pandemic lite," to its benefit.  The Desert suffers none of the flaws of its cousin, the Island.

Intriguing little game with 2 timers (water and sand)
The core system is an insane race game against the upcoming sand storm combined with a challenging spatial puzzle.
Almost impossible to win above novice level with 4 characters - never won with 5 characters.
Acceptable randomness with the distribution of sand tiles and 6 different characters ; in the end the luck factor is evening out in most cases. The most unpredictable factor is the distribution of the tunnels. 
Beautiful streamlined euro game with cohorent theme. No rule exceptions.

This game is a big winner for me as a short game

The 2nd cooperative board game I've obtained (the first being Pandemic).  I decided to buy this game after watching the episode of Wil Wheaton's YouTube series 'Tabletop' that it featured in and I have not been disappointed.  Players have to work together to search the titular desert for the four critical pieces to a legendary flying machine in order to escape before they either die of thirst, are buried alive by sand, or swept away by a quickly intensifying sand storm. 

For a hobby that can get quite expensive, Forbidden Desert provides a nearly unbeatable return on investment due to it's low price point (currently $19.99 on Amazon). And by no means does that mean that the quality of the components suffer - far from it.  The game comes in a sturdy metal tin (that's right a tin), features quality cards and thick game pieces.  The game art is gorgeous and features a fun, steam-punk theme to it.  The rules are straightforward and easy to explain and the core rules fit on the back of a playing card for easy player reference - plus being a cooperative game there are no barriers to experienced players helping new players along.  There's a ton of replay value as the board is different each time, and like Pandemic there are several different roles for players to choose from that each confer their own special advantage and the difficulty level can be set from Novice to Expert. And the game itself is no slouch - even on the novice setting it's a struggle until the bitter end.

I honestly don't know why this game isn't as popular as Pandemic - although I suspect what gives Pandemic the edge is the theme - admittedly saving the world from global deadly diseases is a bit more appealing than trying to assemble an anachronistic flying ship before choking on sand.  I'd actually argue that Forbidden Desert is more challenging than Pandemic given the variable board game that rearranges itself after each turn and that spaces can become inaccessible if buried by sand (as opposed to Pandemic where the board is static and you always have the same freedom of movement throughout the game).

Regardless, if you like cooperative games - Forbidden Desert will be an excellent addition to your game collection/closet/Rubbermaid tub - and at it's low price it's an easy pickup.

This game is basically a re-fiddle of Forbidden Island and for that reason I'll keep the rating to an 8.  While it definitely adds some complexity to the game, it still feels pretty familiar.  Also, the beautiful tension that FI provides through its mechanic of the island sinking around the adventurers is not as palpable in the Desert version.  That said, the game is still an enormous amount of fun, and is an absolutely fantastic introduction to co-op games. 

UPDATE:  5 games in and the thing keeps getting better and better.  There is a NOTICEABLE jump in difficulty even between Novice and Normal, which adds considerably to that "tension" that I missed from FI, and the Meteorologist role is a great idea with a GREAT ability that can come back to bite you later on in the game.  Upping my rating to a 9.

Great for multiplayer or solo. Cooler mechanics than Forbidden Island - not the same amount of crafty plays are possible, but there's much less tile-flipping and it's much harder to screw yourself out of an artifact or a win, as hand limitations won't hinder you as much. I'd say Forbidden Desert feels more skill-based, while Forbidden Island seems a bit more reliant on luck.

La movilidad de la tormenta lo hace aleatorio y difícil de vencer. Desgraciadamente me parece muy repetitivo, aunque divertido y sencillo de entender. Creo que es un buen punto de partida para los juegos cooperativos. Al igual que Pandemic, creo que se vuelve monótono. 

6 - Fair. Some fun or challenge at least, will play occasionally if in the right mood.

A very solid entry from Matt Leacock. My own issue is that the mechanics feel a bit more convoluted and less slick than Forbidden Island, though it makes up for this with the added intrigue.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating based on solo play only.

This is a game in the same vein as Pandemic (using limited action points to control a spreading danger while working toward a win goal), but simpler, faster, and with more luck elements. The moving storm mechanic is very clever, and I really like the feeling of piling more and more sand on.

For my solo-ing tastes, it feels a little too out of control as there are many unpredictable elements... however this is also the same aspect that I think would make this a good co-op to actually play with other people! Unlike Pandemic, in which the logistics can be complicated to the point where I don't see how you could win without hands being open information and someone taking charge, FD is more straightforward and action-y, where each person can make their own decisions and yet they are still *good* decisions (which isn't to say it's an easy game to win; it's not). This would likely be the game I would use to introduce co-ops.

------------------------------------------------

Gave to my sis-in-law, who I think would really like this, plus I generally only want to play co-ops with family anyway (Pandemic would be my solo choice for this type of game).

Co-op game, semi-sequel to Forbidden Island. The mechanisms are enough to make this a different game than Island, and overall plays well. Be careful when playing with Alpha Gamers. HATE the tin box though.

RATING: 9
A GREAT co-op. Plays great at all player counts. All of the components are super fantastic. Plays in just the right amount of time. Is a complete and total game, not requiring any expansions (or pieces of garbage extras). It's just great. It can be hard or unlucky at times, but both of those ideas somewhat fit into the theme of the game, so you never feel cheated. Overall, a great co-op. Much better than Forbidden Island IMO.

Forbidden Desert is a definite improvement over Forbidden Island. The base mechanisms are the same and the game flows in much the same way, but the added level of complexity also adds to the fun factor. It is by no means a huge leap from its predecessor, but worth a try none the less.

RATING: 5
Decent coop game, but after multiple plays it lost its lustre far quicker than pandemic. I think this is because it is much more simplistic/repetitive:
1) Geography is straightforward, and
2) One type of resource (e.g. versus various types of diseases and trading off what to keep/discard in hand)
Thus every game feels too similar/using same process.

The difficulty gradient also seems off: I have no losses on the easiest 2 levels, and no wins on the highest difficulty level. When I lose at hardest, feels more luck-based / impossible than something I can get better at.

Maybe better for teaching people new to the hobby, but other than that I'm thinking not really worth owning if you have pandemic (too similar, but more simplistic).

Forbidden Desert is Forbidden Island with needless fiddliness.  The components are nice though.

If I want a co-op, by the same designer, that has more "meat" than Forbidden Island, I'll play Pandemic.

For me, there is no need, or place, for a game between the complexity of Forbidden Island and Pandemic.   Especially when it essentially does the same thing as Forbidden Island.

RATING: 9
Very good components for the price. It's bit deeper than Forbidden Island but also longer so it treads dangerous territory of stepping into Pandemic length, at that point I would always play Pandemic, which is one of my favorite co-op games. But at least with experienced players Forbidden Desert remains just short enough to avoid that.

This game is really fun and love the eye of the storm mechanic. Very clever. It's the first co-op game we own and we really enjoyed it. It can be quite difficult sometimes, but that makes it a nice challenge.

Another great cooperative game by Matt Leacock.  The obvious comparisons here are Forbidden Island and Pandemic, and I would generally agree with the popular opinion that this falls between those two in terms of complexity and depth.  The art is lackluster, which is a bit disappointing since Forbidden Island is gorgeous.  The ship components are cool, but they don't really add much to the game (kids like them).  I do enjoy that this offers a more compelling, challenging game than Forbidden Island and is something I would definitely bring out with a group of adults, although it's still on the "light" side for gamers.  The co-op feel works very well in that players really need to coordinate plans in advance, although the game does an excellent job of regularly throwing a wrench in the works.  The sand movement between turns is really cool and provides a great level of challenge without feeling punishing.  I did have one minor component issue in that all of my X-shaped sand tiles are bowed a bit -- this may have just been a fairly isolated issue and it really doesn't cause any problems during play.  At the price, this is one I would quickly recommend for families, although I wish I could combine the gameplay from this with the art from Forbidden Island.

[u]09/06/2013[/u]:  I feel Forbidden Desert falls very nicely in between its two older cousins - Pandemic and Forbidden Island.  It adds more complexity than Forbidden Island but not nearly as much as Pandemic with its expansion.  There are more decisions to be made than with FI but (again) not as many as Pandemic.

In FD, you are a group of Adventurers who crash landed on an ancient city buried under sand.  You need to find the four machine parts to the mystical flying machine and escape the ever growing sand dunes and blazing sun.

There are tiles and and a deck of cards similar to FI, but the mechanisms are definitely different.  Here the tiles move and sand is added to the tiles creating a barrier for movement and excavating.  Ignore the increasing dunes of sand and become buried forever.  The Sun beats down on the Adventurers causing them to use their varying supplies of precious water.  Drink too much, depleting your canteens, and dehydration consumes them.

This is a very well done followup to FI.  I feel both games can easily be part of the same game collection.  FI is for those times when you want something a little more casual or have a lighter game group at the table.  If they want more of a challenge, then head on over to FD.  And for those wanting more variety and a deeper group puzzle, there's Pandemic.

This is a lot of fun for the relatively low cost of the game.  We have played multiple games at a sitting and have only beaten it once in a two player game.  It won't stop me from trying.  A great game that is tense, fun and doesn't take a long time to play.

Unlike its weaker cousin [gameid=65244], Forbidden Desert presents quite the cooperative challenge in a unique experience. This time rather than waiting around for the right cards, you're up against the clock bigtime. The ruins are filling up with sand, you're running out of water and the storms are getting stronger.

Players really need to work together utilizing their special skills and items in smart ways. Like its cousin the components are top-notch. I appreciate what Leacock came up with to make the sandstorm move around the board, causing havoc.

This and Forbidden Island were important gateway games for our family and so they will always have a special place in our hearts. Desert is more complex and a little more difficult than Island, but both are games we've been able to play with our girls for a few years (they are 9 and 12 now)--though they can sometimes prove taxing for them if they are not in the mood. 

My wife and I, however, also play two players and really enjoy it. In fact, we will play multiple characters, throw in some house rules, and just have fun. I'm excited to get my "game board" I found on Etsy to help keep the tiles in place and class up the joint. 

Ultimately, we love co-op games, and this is a good one that is a great gateway to more complex games.

While this gets lumped in with Forbidden Island and Pandemic I actually find it plays fairly differently since there's no set collection and the storm is more erratic.  A good value for the price and not too heavy to act as a gate way game or someone's first coop.

It's a clever cooperative game, and like many cooperative games, there is a tendency for one or two experienced players to take control and dictate what everyone is going to do.

Also, boy is it difficult. You really need to take full advantage of everyone's unique abilities. As well, if you don't have the water carrier on your team, good freakin' luck.

All that being said, the game is pretty, the discovery mechanic is satisfying, and it comes with a cute l'il ship!! ^_^

Forbidden Desert feels very much like Pandemic: Light. I like it because it's easy to teach, and people who would normally play any sort of strategy board game with me can have a great time playing it. I don't like it because it quickly gets repetitive, and I don't feel like there's much depth.

After 1 play, it's similar to Forbidden Island (obviously) but has a few important differences:

- Trading something doesn't cost an action.
- No cards to collect and discard.
- Rather than simply moving to a tile and getting the goodie there, you must find 2 "clues" for each goodie, then it is located at the intersection of those 2 clue tiles.

Significantly better than Forbidden Island, and less fiddly than Pandemic. I especially appreciated the shifting sands aspect of the game, as well as the resource management of the water canteens. The steampunk flavor to the components and art are a clever touch, and the toy factor of the completed ship is charming. I wouldn't mind owning this one to play with kids.

A significant improvement on its predecessor, Forbidden Island (which itself was not at all a bad game).  The same basic mechanic - uncover a map while gathering components and beating back encroaching disaster - is spiced up by an ever-shifting board.  Harder to beat, better to play.

Forbidden Desert is surprisingly fiddly for such a small game: moving around the tiles and stacking the sand tiles atop them gets really tedious (especially since they you need to flip & rearrange them way too often).  More importantly, mostly what you're doing is moving around & blindly peeking under desert tiles.  There is no real strategy or tactics to that:  shall I blindly look under here or there?  How do I know?  When you loose, the most you can say is: "too bad we hadn't blindly looked under the right tiles sooner."

A híresztelések igazak, sajnos sok a hibás alkatrész, amik a játékra is kihatnak.. :( Megjelölt/hibás lapkák és lapok.. A kiadó pedig kérés után szintén rosszat küldött.. + a mostani első játéknál vettem észre 2 viharkártyán, hogy hibás.. Hát nem egyszerű..
Na de maga a játék? Nekem német nyelvű van meg (Bécsben vettem 15 Euróért), 3-an próbáltuk ki, a többiek segítettek nekem a nyelvi kérdésekben (karakterkártyák és felszereléskártyák). A figurák miatt ezt tartom jobbnak! :)
Első játékban kikaptunk mint a huzat (azt hiszem pont én haltam szomjan.. :P ) A másodikat viszont éppen hogy megnyertük. Mind a kétszer a legkönnyebb fokozaton játszottunk, 3an, véletlenszerű karakterválasztással.
A játék látványa (a felsorolt KOMOLY hibáktól eltekintve) gyönyörű, a játékélmény kiváló! Számunkra visszaadta a hangulatot teljes mértékben! A két leányzó akikkel nekivágtam, oda-vissza van a játéktól, végig agyalós, kicsit kockáztatós, utolsó pillanatig izgalmas játék. Végén persze lehet pacsizni, de nem rajtunk múlik teljes mértékben a siker, kell jó adag szerencse is (viharlapok, mit mikor találunk meg). Ezért sikerélményben számomra elmarad a Hanabitól, ahol egy jól lerakott lap már felér egy végső győzelemmel, így játék során többször átélem azt az emóciót, mint a Die Vergessene Stadt-nál.
De szombaton újra nyomjuk! :)

A much harder game than it's predecessor and one that requires plenty of strategical thinking if you're to make it out alive.  The game gives you more choices compared to Forbidden Island (though that doesn't mean it's more fun)  and you don't feel as if you're at the mercy of the cards as much as before.  The components, as always, are fantastic!

Far superior to the original, Forbidden Desert is a successful example of a good reimplementation.

Its just as easy to play, but feels much deeper and more interesting.

This makes it the best of the two, being more palatable for hardcore gamers whilst still being great as both a filler and gateway game easy enough for non-gamers to enjoy.

The same mechanics as Forbidden Island, but this game come with an beautiful airship model that you have to find the parts for. The art is less of a selling point as mostly it's covered in sand in this game, but it gets extra points for the stand that the storm meter sits in (Forbidden Island's flood meter just lays on the table).

Superior to Forbidden Island, with that much needed "something" added to it. Looks pretty and I really like the way the storm moves around and changes the board, even though drawing loads of cards at the end of each player's turn & moving the storm around is a bit cumbersome, especially when the storm count is high. But it really adds a cool tactile feel to the game. At its best Forbidden Desert really is a cool and exciting rollercoaster ride from "we're ok!" to "oh no we're totally not!"

I'm not sure whether the game has legs for dozens of plays, but after a few plays it feels like an excellent option for a lighter co-op & with the scaling difficulty level you can make it insanely hard. Also good for a solo game.

A cooperative game with some inventive mechanisms. I particularly like how the simple sandstorm mechanism creates a sense of urgency. Still, it's a cooperative game and playing against a game is never the same thing as playing against human players. Unlike a game like Pandemic, there is no good way to predict the storm, so the feeling of being played by the game is more present here.

An interesting follow up game to Forbidden Island, that fortunately adds a 5th player! I found the mechanics to be improved in most ways over Forbidden Island, though I still enjoy that game as well.  Not having to carry a hand of cards that force you to collect and trade just to get a winning artifact, not unlike Pandemic, was a refreshing change to a co-op game.  It also felt a little more team based, as all players had to worry about each others water levels as they their turns passed by.  The concept of finding where two clue tiles line up to find the location of a hidden item was interesting, and not having to shuffle cards back into the desk constantly was also nice.  The only mechanic that felt a tad "fidley" was the storm.  Each time someone finishes their turn, you must draw from the storm desk and more the tiles on the board as the storm moves, while also placing sand tiles as the storm moves across the board.  It's a nice mechanic, but I think it felt a little fiddly, and some what hindered my groups desire to play a 3rd time in a row.  By no means a big deal, and certainly a fun mechanic.

RATING: 7.6
Really fun. For how simple and euro style it is, it really has a strong theme of feeling like your stuck in the desert, trying to get the parts you need to escape before either the sandstorm takes you or you die of thrist. There's a fast paced and sense of urgency to it and it's easy to learn and play without being so simple that it just feels like a children's game. I feel like there's probably more strategy in this game then I realized since we did 2 player novice and barely escaped. I don't think I used jetpacks correctly. I like the player powers and how they make sense. Doing the sandstorm activity in between turns does break up the game and slow it down a bit. Many cooperative games I like have "bad guy" phases that seem to take up too much of the game so I can't complain too much. It fits a good niche that for me, replaces pandemic which is slightly heavier--of having a nice, easy to teach, fairly thematic, fully cooperative game that takes less than an hour and people can enjoy it the first time. I'm sure pandemic is great and I still want to play, but for my collection and my needs/tastes, this one is my light fully coop game where we each play a different character in a fairly euro style.

A good improvement on the original Forbidden Island mechanics. The theme is a little harder for non-gamers to wrap their head around, and it's not quite as clear cut. I personally enjoy it more because Island doesn't have as much depth; it's a toss up for who picks this over Island. I won't suggest the game myself as I'd rather play meatier games but it is a great starter or bridge game to get people into the hobby.

[B]TTS Play:[/B] Nice design - better than expected...  Art and mechanics are solid.  Wish it didn't come in a tin!  Lost first play due (normal level) to lack of ability use, elusive clues, and non-ideal gear draws - the Explorer was key; but the Meteorologist was under utilized and died of thirst.  Need to flip water tiles with all players present to max water gain! Replayed and random draw was SAME roles!  Used weather prediction MUCH better and managed to survive with only six sand tiles and two water at the end...  Timely use of items really mattered, nearly got irreversibly buried and a very tense final turn storm movement made the experience way more emotional than expected.

A good coop that is challenging without being impossible. I feel like this is one of the better balanced coops.  Flashpoint Fire Rescue, Forbidden Island, and the Castle Panic games are all a bit too easy.  Shadows Over Camelot is incredibly difficult.  Forbidden Desert balances quite nicely where it is difficult, but winnable.

Forbidden Desert evolved from Forbidden Island, which evolved from Pandemic. Gameplay features have changed considerably with each evolution so that FD has very little in common with Pandemic and if you like cooperative games it is worth owning both. Players of Forbidden Island often worry that FD will be as easy. Not at all! FD is hard to beat with groups of 4 or 5 on Normal difficulty. So thirsty!

Beautiful artwork, great components, simple rules, challenging gameplay. A little too challenging for my game group though. After several losses no one wants to play it anymore.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

It takes Forbidden Island (tiles, 4 actions, race vs clock, etc) and modifies it to add more complexity and place it further from Pandemic: adds exploration, the board moves, cards to sink tiles not needed anymore, etc.

It's not only more complex, but also more difficult to win and more thematic (refloating islands never convinced me).

It's the game that Forbidden Island would have had to be.

I still dislike the tin box though.

Familiar but still different enough. Since the tiles do not sink permanently, and the hand management part has been completely removed, turns feel simpler than in Forbidden Island.

The tin is larger than last time, and the lid won't stay closed, so the German edition is the way to go here.

We enjoyed Forbidden Island and picked this up on expectations.  It didn't disappoint.  It's a fun co-op, that doesn't lend itself to an alpha gamer vibe.  The sand builds quickly, the storm rampages around the desert, and water is scarce.  I see this one getting as much play as FI.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The choices to be made are mostly obvious and straightforward, which leads to alpha gamer takeover and a feeling of no agency. Often we know what we have to do, there's really only one way to go about doing it, and so we sit back and see if the game lets us do it. As such, this pales in comparison to Ghost Stories.

A "step-up" in complexity from Forbidden Island, this coop game has been a hit with all crowds.  The shifting sands mechanic is really fun and creative.  The components of the "flying machine" are nice (having metal and plastic bits that work well together).  
Mostly solid game with the exception of the "everybody dies if anyone in the party dies of thirst" rule.  We ignore this rule, but we still play that one can still expire from lack of water.  They are then out of the game but the quest continues. If we beat the game, the expired explorer wins posthumously. 
In spite of that "wonky" rule, I still like this game very much!

Quite nice co-op. Even thought I've played the Island variant only once, the Desert is much much better one. Its a quite tough one. Won twice so far. Bad thing is, it seems to get the same problem as Pandemic. One player can start taking over the game with his ideas for how things should be done and approached. Yes, its possible to not do those suggestions, but then again it wouldn't be as optimal play as it could be. Another side of the coin, if one starts to tell others what to do, then he might just aswell play it all by his lonesome. Can't really point what I think, but I'm starting to get the same vibe that we got with Pandemic in the end (before we sold it). It has much better quality and its damn gorgeous, so props should go out.

[b]Forbidden Desert[/b] was traded away in a math trade 2/10/16. (Received Survive: Escape from Atlantis + the 5&6 player expansion.)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Yet another co-op that didn't survive in our collection. After playing it a bunch when we first got it, we soon stopped playing. Part of the reason was the difficulty spike compared to Forbidden Island, Forbidden Desert is much less forgiving and more demanding due to not only finding the treasure but also having to manage water for each character. My youngest daughter has been playing Forbidden Island with us since it is simpler and more straight forward so I wasn't sad to see Forbidden Desert go. Honestly I'd still rather play Forbidden Island, I prefer the game mechanics, art and variable tile set up.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Another fun, family co-op designed by Matt Leacock (Forbidden Island/Pandemic) with typical top notch art and components. 
- Happy to find out that it plays much differently than Forbidden Island and is a definite step up in difficulty (this game can be brutal). 
- The sand building up on the board is really helps immerse you in the theme and helps build tension. 
- A few role repeats and some brand new ones; what's cool is the old roles still feel fresh because of how differently this game plays out and the interactions with the new roles. 
- I enjoy having to find the pieces by uncovering the two tiles and finding where they intersect to unearth the treasure. 
- Quick playtime, Forbidden Desert is another game we can easily bust out on a night when we don't have a lot of time to play a game. It also helps that it's a co-op so there won't be hurt feelings when playing with tired kids who are begging me to play a game.[/i]

Someone please correct me if I interpreted the rules wrong, but in this game, you lost automatically if the sand tiles ran out. That takes the game from this interesting adventure where you're trying to survive and piece together your broken ship, to a game where you're just trying to clean up sand.

Tried it for the first time with 6 year old. Started at novice level. Enjoyed the whole searching and digging for stuff feel. Felt the constant threat to manage water level, and sand dune levels, especially nearing the end. In the end, we were one turn from winning and I had to draw a Sun Beats Down card with my last storm card draw. We cheated and took a different card that guaranteed us the win which was how I knew we only had one more turn to go. Much better experience than forbidden island which was a tad too easy. Wanna try with more players and different roles too.

A perfect sequel to Forbidden Island! This game is cooperative like FI, but the mechanics are fresh and new enough to really enjoy owning and playing both games. If you like the original, I just can't see you not liking this one. The sand really make this game tough to win and sure look great for the theme. 

I am impressed with the clever design and look to this game. The box storage is also excellent. I'm not a fan of metal tins but at least there is room for everything. Since I sleeve my cards, I store them under the plastic insert. 

There also is a vertical board that indicates the current danger level to the game and an air ship that you build to escape the desert. When you have collected the parts to the ship and make your way to the landing sight, you build your ship and fly away.

This basically replaced Forbidden Island for us. It's slightly more complex but still pretty simple. It's got a bit of randomness built in with the movement of the storm.

Sure it's a spin off and a variation on a theme, but it definitely feels like an improvement over Forbidden Island. For starters, it changes a simple hold-back-time race game into an exploration race game, where you must go out and find things in order to win. You can let go tiles you've already explored to the sand storm, but if things are building up on unexplored tiles, you could be in trouble as you'll have to spend actions digging things out. Luckily there's a few gear cards you can find that will save you from disaster. That is until the water for each player starts running out, which is a second type of disaster card in the deck. The water requirement forces more co-operation and discussion in order to get people together at the oasis to recover enough to keep going for long enough. Just that one extra dimension improves the co-operation aspect significantly. An enjoyable thumbs up.

"Excellent thematic co-op. Straightforward rules, but has interesting decisions. My wife and I like it a lot better than Pandemic or Forbidden Island."

What I like:
- Pure co-op; good theme; great components (and inexpensive)
- I love that there is no abstract set collection element
- Really clever storm/sand mechanisms
- More opportunities for cooperation than Forbidden Island

What I don't like:
- Can run a bit long with 4-5p (75+ minutes)
- Not a fan of tin boxes, especially a different size than Forbidden Island

While sharing some aspects with Forbidden Island, this is a pretty clear improvement. It is more thematic, requires more cooperation, probably has more tough decisions, and feels a bit less random.

I would put the weight around 1.9, slightly higher than BGG voters.

Both of these seemed just a little more interesting than the "sinking tiles" and relics in forbidden island - though both solid.

Forbidden Desert is a purely cooperative game roughly based on the system used in the designer's previous games, Pandemic and Forbidden Island. Here, players take on various rule-breaking roles to explore a desert tile board, trying to find various airship parts plus the landing pad to escape. A sandstorm moves around the board as determined by randomly drawn cards, burying tiles it touches in sand, making tiles unable to be explored or even crossed until unburied. If a tile has no sand, it can be explored, revealing one of two clues that will reveal the location of one of four airship parts (think latitude and longitude), the landing pad, a tunnel that can be used to traverse to other tunnels and hide from the sun, an oasis that can refill water, or a blank tile that provides the explorer with a random bonus card. Mixed in with the cards that move the sandstorm around are cards that make adventurers lose water and cards that increase the number of sandstorm cards drawn. Players must find all four parts and get to the landing pad before any of them runs out of water. While this is still a family-weight game, it's more complex than something like Forbidden Island and I enjoyed it more because of that. However, it's still a cooperative game that's largely depending on luck, which isn't really my cup of tea.

Decent challenge of a coop, similar yet different than Forbidden Island.  The sand shifting is unique and the powers of the players are decent.  The items were not plentiful and had to plan when to use them.  The game was tense and fun.  

The cards are less predictable and random vs typical coops, which can be good and bad.  Seemed like some games would be difficult depending on initial setup and players used.

Perhaps the most fun first-play of a game in my experience so far. Very good game design incorporating the best elements of many games.

Variable character abilities. Variable difficulty levels. Uncovering hidden tiles. Race against natural disaster. Random movement of the sand storm. Cooperation between teammates. Discovering useful gadgets. Finding clues to buried treasure parts. Excellent components.

Extremely good job by the game designer and publisher.

RATING: 6
My kids adore Forbidden Island, so when I was able to grab this for $10, I jumped on it. It does enough things differently that I like it more than FI. In FD, for example, there’s no hand of cards that need to be passed around to make a set with one player. This was always the most boring part of FI (and Pandemic!) for me. We just find the tiles that point to the location of the parts, grab the parts, and go. I’m sure we’ll get many plays out of this.

(5+ plays)  Very similar to Forbidden Island.  The 2 clues pointing to the map location of the artifact is great, and gives the feel of following a treasure map.  No treasure cards to keep track of is a trade off for a bunch of sand tiles to fiddle with - a wash there.

Overall, a really nice game.  If I had to choose one of them, I'd be on the fence right now.

This is an absolutely fantastic cooperative game. Compared to its older sibling, Forbidden Island, I like the game play a bit more and it allows for one more player (2-5). The sight of the sand building up isn't quite as gut wrenching as watching your island disappear though. I give a slight edge to this one but will be keeping both.

Found this to be a nice little cooperative game with an inviting theme--although the theme was a little clunky.

The mechanics were fine although sometimes I felt that the handicapping with water drove gameplay a bit too much.

A slightly more complicated bigger brother of Forbidden Island. Although I like the theme less, I like the game more.

RATING: 6
The game is fun, but there are some serious balancing issues. There is nothing preventing you from just failing because the "Sun beats down" on you it the first 12 cards or so. 
If you don't find caves or if you fall on the mirage you may also, through no fault of your own, lose the game. I would say that the Meteorologists power loses strength the more player you have, so he is better in a 2 player game. Also I'm under the impression the for a 3+ player game the game is balanced taking the Navigators talent into account. I think that the Navigator+Climber combo is so powerful that the game kind of assume they will be part of the group.

So it is light, it is generally fun, I mainly play it with my kids. Strategy-wise, I'd say there are many ways you can lose where you couldn't have done much depending on how the storm evolves and whether or not you find the right locations or items.

+Co-op, variable board, minor toy factor (airship pieces). Pandemic light (same designer) with several parallel elements; stepping stone to Pandemic.

8 - I found this game to be the most challenging of the three Matt Leacock co-op games due mostly to the overbearnig sun, and the constantly shifting desert.  While it has good management capability like forbidden island the piles of sand grow very quickly and can get away from you in a flash.  In addition water being a finite resource with most character groups makes it especially challenging.  I own all three but with the expansions I'd rather play Pandemic, this game though sets up quick and has lots of refinement without all sorts of expansions.

So Forbidden Desert is the revamp/sequel to Forbidden Island. Both of these were the groundwork from which the overly ubiquitous Co-op hobby game Pandemic, from which a whole franchise has arisen. Compared to Forbidden Desert, Island shouldn't even exist, and Pandemic clearly has some common ground. Designer Matt Leacock clearly knows how to build co-op games with player roles and building threats, but if you've played one of his games, you're not going to find much richness or diversity in his collection of designs (including the upcoming Thunderbirds game).

Your goal in this game is to gather various parts of your airship (the steampunk element in this games aesthetics surprised me and frankly pissed me off; why does an airship need a GIANT SUNDIAL on it's bow?) before the desert storm (not the US/Iran conflict of the 80's) consumes you. You get four actions a turn (Which will sound familiar to the Pandemic players) to clean up sand (outbreaks) and flip over tiles to find clues to your ship parts. Then storm cards flip and affect you, most notably adding sand to the tiles, and/or draining your limited water reserves. The game ends if you get overwhelmed with sand, or you run out of water.

I think this is actually the most fun offering out of Pandmic/Forbidden Island/Forbidden Desert simply because the difficulty is there.

Confession, I traded Forbidden Island for Desert. After playing my first game of Forbidden Desert, I do like it. And I like somethings better about it than Forbidden Island. On the other hand, I kind of miss Forbidden Island though. Still need more plays. After more plays, my opinion might change. At this point I will rate it on par with Forbidden Island. The thing I miss the most with Forbidden Island is saying "Breakers Bridge" in the most country voice I could. :(

Update, I got Forbidden Island again, so I can have my pick of the Forbidden series. Sad face to smile face. :)

Fun enough as a cooperative game, but very difficult to beat. You have to "spin a lot of plates": you have to ensure that everyone has water, find and gather artifacts, dig up sand, and do all of this before all of the sand tiles are used up and/or the Storm meter maxes out. My kids like this game, but I prefer Pandemic from Matt Leacock over his Forbidden Desert.

Super fun co-op game that is so much better than its predecessor Forbidden Island.

I enjoy the shifting of the board and the strong feeling of discovery and exploration, but it's tough to win and is a little overly determined by luck. Not the best combination.

I prefer Forbidden Desert to Forbidden Island, but I still prefer Pandemic to both.

Forbidden desert is a better version of Forbidden Island, adding in a few more choices about how to get things done.  In fact, if you own Forbidden Desert I would see no reason to get Forbidden Island at all.  Much of what I said regarding Forbidden Island applies here - nice components and theme, and is in general a "kinder gentler" Pandemic.

Similar to Forbidden Island, but better.  The 4 components needed to win are found by excavating tiles that give the column and the row (rather than by set collection like Pandemic and Forbidden Island).

There are several ways to lose.  You can get buried in sand (run out of sand tiles because you let them build up).  You can die of thirst (not going to the wells/tunnels enough).  You can die if you aren't quick enough and the sand storm spins out of control.

Good game.  fun.  the components of the little ship are fun....the kids love to handle them like Forbidden Island.

Good game.  Definitely an improvement.

Our favorite co-op is still Flash Point:  Fire Rescue.  We prefer the theme...and seems a little more 'exciting' with life and death of innocent victims hanging in the balance.

Fun with a group because of how difficult the game is. You feel so accomplished if you actually win. Winning this game is actually one of the best feelings I've had board gaming. But it doesn't happen often. It's actually easier with a larger group. The special abilities combine better and make it slightly less brutal and way more fun. Probably not as hard as some other co-ops, but this being my first one, I was taken by surprise. Still, I love this game.

I can see this game being fun.  The group I played it with had several people who didn't understand coop games and were chatting the entire time.  A 45 minute game turned into 3 hours.  Very annoying.

Modular board design, player powers, and cooperative play.  All things I love in board games.  Solid design and a fun toy factor with the flying ship add even more to this.  It is a little light in interesting decisions which means I usually go for something like Pandemic on my shelf, though this gets plenty of play when I don't want to setup or have time to play a heavier game.

Quite the fun coop game! This is definitely a great gateway game to coop. I would choose this over pandemic. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Have played half a dozen times.  Have won once, I think, pretty easily.  Lost the other times.  Sometimes badly.

It seems pretty necessary to play optimally (especially to use your character's special ability!), but isn't complicated rules-wise.  In terms of fun, it's just ok. Rather than remembering the cool actions/plans we execute, a lot of my memories are shifting the tiles and piling sand on them.  Which is probably why we lose so much!

Anyhow, it's a fine game and will play if looking for a short-duration and simply-explained game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Highly addictive co-op game. All the characters are good, unlike in Forbidden Island. The game is really hard, probably the hardest co-op game I have played. Sometimes you might get unlucky but making wise decisions throughout the game is the key to victory. Even one crucial mistake may cost you the game near the end.

I'm not sure if the luck factor is too high. Getting constantly unlucky with the "Storm moves"-cards will sometimes make you lose the game. Avoiding hits aka losing water due to "Sun Burns"-cards is much easier.

8 of the desert tiles in my game were stuck together and have some damage from having to pull them apart. 

Update Aug. 2014: emailed for new tiles and they were sent very quickly.

RATING: 7
This is the latest game from the designer of Pandemic and Forbidden Island. It is a co-operative game for two or more players, a pure co-op with no traitor and as with his other games open communication. This falls somewhere between the other two games, it is not as strategic as Pandemic but it jettisons less of that games complexity than Forbidden Island so it is a little less child friendly.
Players turn over tiles, which the game is regularly covering in sand, in order to find 4 pieces of a ship in order to escape the desert. They do this without getting buried by the sand, running out of time, or exhausting their supply of water.
Its clever and the theme appeals more to other players I know than Pandemic so will see some table time. Fortunately the rules are easy to understand (unlike some recent co-op card games) so everyone can follow what is happening and contribute to the discussion of what strategy should be followed.

Great entry-level into the higher-level gaming world. Provides dialogue and problem solving as a team. Great for families, and there's nothing better than getting out of the desert as a team (actually almost just as fun when you're almost out, and get stranded as a team).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In many ways a "remake" of Forbidden Island and Pandemic (with graphic style and so on taken from FI), this adds quite a few new features and thereby manages to be more interesting than either. But it's still a co-op, and I'm afraid I still don't really enjoy co-ops as a general rule. And in this one it appears, on the evidence of my few games, that "hide in the tunnels while hoping something good happens" is the best plan - this might change if the Water Carrier is in play, but even with the WC (which I had in my first game, which we lost) it seems very hard to avoid someone dying of thirst without lots of hiding in tunnels.

This is the game that got me back into hobby board games after quite a long hiatus (Settlers of Catan in the late 90's, Evo and Puerto Rico in the early 2000's).

Unlike the games listed above, this game has an overall different feel (it is a cooperative game).  Many people say that Pandemic is a superior game (it is definitely more popular), but I find Forbidden Desert to be more elegant in its design, gameplay, and artwork.  I love the theme and the mystery and perpetual puzzle of trying to unearth the buried city and escape before time runs out!  It's a really great game and will no doubt be in my collection for the rest of my gaming career!

Update: Got as anniversary gift 2013 : )

On first play through, all I can say is: Amazing! Great game, like Island but way better. I had a ton of fun and so did Mindy. 

Unfortunately, The City/Desert tiles are factory machine stamp damaged and we have to return it. The punctures make the tiles marked and you have to keep them secret- it sort of ruins the game if you know where they are at.

So after we get the exchange we'll play again and get a feel for the game. Hopefully this does not mean Gamewright has gone cheapo on their manufacturing or their QA department... We'll see. Could have just been bad luck.

It feels like a simpler version of Pandemic. Very short set-up time, all hidden information so there is little room for bossy play.  Only played 2 player but it is good fun. Runs shorter than Pandemic.  

The fact that the 'sun beats down' cards are not seeded at intervals through the deck means that you can have impossibly hard games or some that are very easy.

RATING: 4.9
Played with an 8 year old and an 11 year old, this game is just about right.  The rules are easy enough for them to pick up, and they don't get swamped with decisions.

Sadly, this indicates that there isn't much depth or strategy to it.  The wind doth blow, and you make the best of the situation, rinse (in sand) and repeat until victory or death.

I have to ding this compared to Forbidden Island because it lacks that marvellous mechanic of urgent hazard on a Waters Rise restack.  In Desert, the sand just piles up monotonously until either you dune blast it or parch.

Randomly digging around is fun a couple of times, but adults might like to look elsewhere. I won't say the P- word, but you're all thinking it.

Forbidden Desert AKA Dozen ways to die. It's really fun to play, even though you have very good chances of losing. However, once you know a couple of tricks to make the best of every turn the players take, it's not that hard to win.

It's predecessor, Forbidden Island, was too easy, so they took it the other way and made this one too hard.  It's not impossible, mind you, but bad luck can be overwhelmingly brutal to the point where you simply can't win unless one of the players is fortunate enough to pick the right character card.  Anyone that's played this knows which one I'm referring to.

I still like Pandemic better as a cooperative game.  The storm deck is far too unpredictable to make long term strategic choices compared to Pandemic's infection deck.

RATING: 6
A good improvement on Forbidden Desert, although it's actually quite different (Forbidden Island feeling very much just like a simpler version of Pandemic).  There's a lot less randomness from the luck of the draw like in the other games - sand is going to pile up and the some tiles are going to get moved each round - and it's much more about managing your actions, the amount of sand on the board, and the amount of water everyone has, with none of the set collection that most other co-ops seem to center around.  It's more like a spatial puzzle to solve, but the pieces of the puzzle are moving around.  Seems probably best with 2 or 3.

Neat little puzzle. Very simple and maybe a touch too light for my tastes, but there is sufficient challenge. This can be very alpha gamer prone though. 

This is not usually an issue since I am normally the most experienced gamer when playing this and I try my best not to quarterback others. Still, advice is often asked of me and I usually try to give them a few options and have them pick. This means though that I have to rein in what could be the best options on my own volition, just to make sure other players are making their own choices. This is not really a problem but ultimately, I probably prefer it if a game naturally compartmentalizes people's roles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I didn't enjoy this as much as I hoped, mainly because of the chaotic nature of the desert movement.  In Forbidden Island and Pandemic you have a feeling of impending doom, but you feel like you have some control - to me this one felt more luck dependent - we struggled to find the tunnel system we needed to survive and without it we were just losing water, and this happened both games I played.  I wouldn't avoid playing again, but I wouldn't rush to either.

Lovely game, I'm happy to own all three of Leacocks coops. Communication and exchange of tools is a must. However, I don't find it more gamey than Lost Island, if anything, it's _more_ random due to the erratic wind cards. Superb, non the less.

This is Forbidden Island with a bit more complexity and a greater scope of adventure.  You are trying to find parts to your crashed ship as they are being scattered around in the whirling, twirling desert winds before they are covered and lost to the sands of time.  Can you find them all before your team is wiped out from extreme thirst and the scorching heat?

This game keeps the group at the edge of their seats while figuring out how to beat the game. It feels like something is definitely at stake while you try to find the missing parts of your airship. 

We've yet to beat the game, as the desert always creeps up on us in the last few rounds... Love it! Definitely a challenge!

Then came the desert. You've survived Forbidden Island, but can you survive the sands. A worthy sequel to its predecessor, this game seems more full and adds depth to the original concepts of Forbidden Island. I would definitely say this game is better, but I have sentimental attachments to FI. Either way, the challenge, theme, and mechanics of this game make it an exceptional sibling to Forbidden Island and I highly recommend it.

One of favorite coops. It's simple and yet so smart. I find the way the sand mechanism works with the shifting tiles to be fascinating. It's obviously in the same vein as Forbidden Island/Pandemic, but it feels fresh and unique. I don't think I would ever choose to play Forbidden Island if this was available instead. Elegant and satisfying experience each time I play.

More of the same... Although this game *feels* different than Forbidden Island and isn't just another Pandemic Lite, the mechanisms really aren't all that different.  Sinking tiles versus moving tiles getting buried isn't really *that* different; getting a special action card from certain tiles isn't that different from possibly getting one in a random draw.  Whatever.... Overall, Forbidden Dessert adds onto what was in Forbidden Island and is definitely more difficult, but it's not really better, worse, or more or less fun. It's just okay and not something that I need to own.  Maybe I'm just becomes less and less a fan of cooperative games, although I do REALLY like Freedom: The Underground Railroad quite a bit (probably because it's a lot more "Euro" in design and is unlike any other game I've played before).  Forbidden Island is just an unnecessary sequel.  Nice bits at a pretty good price though, but that's not enough to add it to my collection.

Great co-op game. I like how the desert acts like a living organism trying to consume you. Has a pandemic like feel (four actions, remove bad things on the board).

A good co-operative game. Designed by Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, and there are similarities in the game mechanics.

I really enjoy playing this game. The board games I'm able to play regularly need to be restricted in complexity and length. Forbidden Desert does well in both categories. It's also a cooperative game, which is a new and appealing concept to new players. The groups I play this with certainly don't always make optimal choices, and this game is more often than not a nail-biter until the very end.

The storm shifting the playing area is a welcome addition to the static board of Forbidden Island. I like Forbidden Desert more than Forbidden Island. The latter seemed easier to "figure out." The great theme and replay value make Forbidden Desert a keeper.

Behaves a little like a cross of Pandemic and FI (unsurprisingly), but with some neat mechanics (the clues, the storm moving around), and the artifacty-steampunky theme is great (jet packs? dune blasters? awesome). The mechanics also force you to explore more, whereas in FI you can usually just write off some tiles as not needed.

From the maker of Forbidden Island and Pandemic, this is a solid Co-Op game.

Nice pieces that come with the game, and allows for scaling difficulty for players of varied experience.

RATING: 3
Seems less transparent and simple than Forbidden Island (which is a baby's game), but I think it's more boring. Also more complicated. Maybe I was jaded by this series of reskinned games by the time I played it but the payoff just doesn't seem to be there. Nor does the tension -- the threats aren't as clear and definitive, and there's no equivalent of "reshuffle discard and put on top of deck" mechanic to give an increasing sense of danger. Just walk around digging shit up, hoping you find what you need before you randomly die of thirst or get buried under sand at unpredictable intervals. That's not to say that tactics aren't important, but the suspense wasn't there. 

Also, the maintenance steps in this are kinda tedious. Pandemic > Forbidden Island > Forbidden Desert.

Unless I was taught wrong, which is possible, but seemed legit.

Only one really short play of this, so I'd like another go at it. I think that the mechanics are just different enough from Forbidden Island that it actually is a nice change-of-pace from it, as how you collect treasures and fight the main obstacle (the blowing sand rather than sinking tiles) provide for the same tug-and-pull, yet in a slightly different way.

A nice change from Forbidden Island. It's a further streamlining of Pandemic's original ideas (there's no player deck any more, except for the event equivalents, and no hand limit!) but also a bit more complex than FI. The map coordinate mechanism (finding the tiles which show column/row of the four machine parts) is well done. And the sandstorm movement is simple and effective. 

Pretty good!

First of all I have to dispute the pretty common claim that this game is very different from Forbidden Island...it's not at all.  It is really just the same game with a couple of updates.

In this game you're in a desert made up of tiles.  The action system is the same, you get 4 actions each turn and use them to move, exchange items, and clear and excavate tiles.  Instead of a tide there is a sand storm and instead of sinking tiles they are covered with sand.  There are special items that do pretty much the same things (jet pack instead of helicopter and dune blaster instead of sandbags).  And instead of finding sets of treasures you are finding the 4 missing pieces of your crashed helicopter before returning to the exit tile and leaving on a helicopter.

See, it's the same damn game.  And as such it faces the same problem as Forbidden Island...it's not as good as many other coop games.  Especially Pandemic which is just an all around direct replacement.

I did rate this a little higher than Forbidden Island because of some of the kind of neat mechanics that are added to this game.  The pushing around of the tiles and ever changing map is kind of neat and I like the oasis/mirage mechanic.

One of the best coop games out there. The different characters synergize well, the choices made a important and the game is tense, challenging. Games are quite short for the level of immersion.

The little brother of "Forbidden Island" is its big brother! With FI I was always a disappointed by how easy it was to win, this one seems harder. It has the same family friendly appeal, it is easily playable in half an hour (unlike many co-ops), it comes with similar mechanics but there is more going on. Besides retrieving the 4 objectives, the group has to make sure no player is running out of water, which gives a new edge. There is just more one has to do in "Forbidden Desert". I know in FI I often did not use all of my possible actions, here you will need them all. 
Thematically it seems stronger, too, finding and digging parts of the airship out of the sand of the desert you crashed in seems something more likely to risk my life for than 4 random treasures. 
I wish this had come out first, we own FI and it is not different enough to justify its way into our collection but I think I would choose FD over FI.

I do enjoy coop games but of course some of them are prone to very bad or very easy shuffles of the cards and this is certainly one such game. If you are used to forbidden Island the difficulty in this game is quite a bit higher, the components are all very nice and the theme is pretty in tune with the gameplay, my only knock is that the game is prone to unlucky draws and it also suffers from the coop problem of having one dominant player run the show and tell other players what to do of course this also really depends on the group your playing with

Pretty darn slick!!!  Simple setup and high quality cards and components.  Even though it is cooperative, I get pretty excited when I am racing the heat and storm.  Players actions are quite simple yet the special abilities of the characters make for some amazing combinations.  Unlike Pandemic, I think the character's special abilities are very balanced and are used almost every single turn.

This game is a great co-op filler that has a really cool theme attached to it.  My favourite mechanism of the game is the storm which travels around the board, leaving piles of sand everywhere.

Nice family game to play. I think especially a family because (common with coops) you have to be aware of someone driving the game. I think it works well then in this regard as a parent with children game. As the parent you can support the decisions being made, stop someone taking over and help cope with the loss!

Never played with other adult gamers. And we have won it but more often lose.

Family co-op game from Matt Leacock (Pandemic). Players move pawns around a semi-randomized grid of face-down tiles, looking for the airship components they can use to escape. A cruel event deck moves tiles, distributes sand (which needs to be dug out) or makes the sun beat down until they die of thirst, but tiles not directly pointing to an exit space usually provide useful items.

Mechanically and thematically it works well but the luck factor is significant, especially on higher difficulty levels. Navigator + climber seems overpowered.

Solid family game but too light to be of interest as a puzzle.

While it's not a co-op I enjoy playing solo, this is my go-to for a gateway game. It has enough depth to pull people in without feeling overwhelmed by rules, and the co-operative nature doesn't deter anyone from being pitted against other people. A solid experience.

There is no big bunch of (non filler)games reaching 8 plays in my collection. The fact that this game does that, means it has attraction. I see a combination of nice material, accessibility and innovative mechanics (brilliant to see how the sand moves). Above all the game let's you experience a tense coöperative story, even when it is not endlessly replayable.

OK .. firstly remember that this is a collaborative game aimed at families as much as gamers. So don't try to judge it against Eclipse, Through the Ages or any other gaming monster.

Forbidden Island is a fantastic family game and a way to help less experienced gamers start to enjoy the world we gamers inhabit. So now .. Forbidden Desert takes the Island concept and adds a whole new layer. I cannot recommend this game highly enough to anyone.

Gameplay is a step up in complexity from Forbidden Island. Desert is also a more thematic game; there's no abstract card draw. Instead, actions are very concrete and tangible. Managing water and racing the desert sands makes a tense and exciting game. Only downside is that several of the player special abilities are pretty bland.

RATING: 9
The larger cousin to Forbidden Island, this game is a more sprawling adventure, and it is certainly more forgiving of mistakes at the beginner levels. The role play aspect of this steampunk adventure is off the charts and the sand is a great mechanic. If you enjoy co-op games, this one is a no brainer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love co-op games. I love cranking up the difficulty to the hardest level with new players while offering no advice unless directly asked. They die, but then want to play again and want to know about the other games I have.

Forbidden Desert fits that role and has this crazy random storm chasing you all over the map that adds some chaotic random in your game. I love chaotic random when the theme fits.

However, I could just never really enjoy this game.  I enjoy pandemic much more and find it is just as easy to teach to muggles.

I'm certainly not the target audience because I dont have much fun with co-ops. Mainly because people constantly explaining what to do to one another is totally non thematic. ALso the logic/strategy of set collection or tile flipping again does not ring with any theme for me. I did like the mechanisms better than Forbidden Island so if you like the first one, you'll probably like this. I find it a little long for something that is filler in terms of thinking, an hour of this is too much for tile flipping. Also the sand shifting is interesting but is way too tedious; it slows down the game, breaks up the play etc. This would be much better with an app. or some artificial intelligence to make this game go much faster.

A bit blah. Does it really do anything different to Forbidden Island? Maybe it's a little less random as tiles are always recoverable, but even with a close finish, this felt a little dry (pun maybe intended).

I still dislike roles in co-ops as it tends to massively dictate what you can do and how you'll experience the game.

All in all, it's decent but unspectacular. I'm sure people have bought both but I don't see why you would.

This game is very much a lighter version of Pandemic which plays a little bit quicker.  I think it works quite well, and I'm happy to play it.  I don't see needing both though.  And I think Pandemic is a little less luck reliant after just a couple of plays.  At least, I think there's more time, and planning that can be done in that one.  This game is not bad though, and is a little bit easier on the kids and stuff, has less components, etc.

It works quite well for what it is.

cool theme
I like how the storm is represented and the sand tiles.
The arrow tiles that determine where a certain airplane part is located are cool but sometimes it is to easy when it hits the spot where the active player is standing.

I wonder why the translation for the German title is so off: "Die vergessene Stadt" instead of "Die verbotene Wüste". Is there something already blocking the correct name, or what?

There is almost nothing bad that I can say about this game. The theme is fun, the art and components (including figurine) are amazing, the game is challenging and exciting, and the price is icing on the cake. You really can't ask for much more out of a pure Co-Op game. My nitpicks would be that I have lost this game the first round before it got back to my turn in a 3 player game once. Alpha players and/or players who want decisions made for them can somewhat dampen the experience but that is not the games fault necessarily.

Matt Leacock's pièce de résistance of family gaming!  If you don't own it, and you have any kids 7+ in your family, you should own it. It's freakin' amazing game design with cool components.

I was one of the first people to own Pandemic years ago.  It was, and still is, an excellent game.  Forbidden Island was cool, but never had that special edge to it.  

Matt Leacock has created this masterpiece filled with theme, tensions and good old family coop fun!  Plus, there's a cool toy to build as you move forward. 
 
Awesome game!  Will always play and will always keep.  I'll keep Forbidden Island for play as my boys get older.

I like the moving tiles and the sand aspect of this game, and also having to share water. It is not easy to win even at novice level. Having played it a few times, I realize that it still suffers from quarterbacking, but definitely less so than Pandemic because there are so many aspects to balance. No one decision is a 100% perfect decision, so more constructive discussion takes place. Try not to end a game session with this game because it is quite tense and could leave a bitter taste if there is no win. Best to follow up with a competitive game so everyone has the satisfaction of pitting against each other and earning some credit instead of leaving the session having lost to a cooperative game.

Go ahead and sell Forbidden Island. Or give it away. Either way, you won't need to play it ever again after getting Forbidden Desert. FD replaces FI in every possible way: it's more thematic, it adds an element of exploration, and it's way more fun. It also gets rid of the clunky card mechanics of trying to hand cards back and forth until you have the right ones. This game is all about trying to discover the right tiles, then getting out of town before you succumb to the desert heat. This is the best entry-level co-op game out there.

This is a fun fast game that has a nice amount of stress to it. The mechanics are fun, and the fact that you are constantly digging out and the mechanic for the storm makes it so random that it's hard to really plan ahead that far. It's a definite improvement from Forbidden Island and replaced Forbidding Island, I don't think that there is a need to have both in your collection, so just go with this one.

Have only played a single two-player game, but the sandstorm mechanic is really creative and often drastically changes the lay of the land in a single turn.

The increasing card draws really ratchets up the intensity. The game felt like a cakewalk for the first few turns but we narrowly avoided being buried alive by the end.

The character roles are varied and run to play, as well, which should lead to a bit of replay value.

After playing Forbidden Island and Pandemic a few times, I feel like I am almost always able to assess the best actions to perform. Feels like only an unlucky shuffle of cards will lose the game.
Forbidden Desert does not feel the same way. Along with the luck involved in shuffling the cards, you are forced to make tough decisions due to necessary information being hidden under the tiles. 
The game is more difficult to win as the best choices are not as obvious. Because of this, Forbidden Desert has provided the best cooperative experience of the Leacock co-ops I've played.

Gotta give Matt Leacock credit, the man knows how to design good co-ops. I like this one, while similar to Pandemic, I feel like the tension is higher for the whole game, and then ramps up near the end. There are a few ways to lose the game (buried alive, run out of water, the storm intensity gets too high) so it seems to add to the tension. Also, with all of the different concerns the optimal move is not always evident, which cuts down on Alpha-gaming. I like it.

RATING: 7.5
PROS: Fun coop game, easy to learn and highly enjoyable in it's gameplay and theme. The graphics are attractive and the game works fine as a gateway for non-gamers. Different characters, difficulty levels and tile randomness add great replay value and different challenges. It's a good game from 2 to several players.

CONS: Somewhat luck dependant - The oasis' placement (may be too close to each other, you may find the mirage when you need water the most), the tiles you choose to explore (you may find easily the directions for pieces or not, and the pieces may be close to you or across the board, buried under 6 tiles of sand), the tunnels' locations (they may be too close to each other, which is bad), the way the storm's eye moves (it can get trapped in a corner doing nothing or hastefully cross the map depleting the sand tile pool), the equipment you draw, how many and when the suns and storms are drawn. On the latter, I haven't played a single match without at least one moment of "alright, if we get really unlucky now, we lose" when drawing storm cards. This unpredictability makes the tactical decisions limited to a certain extent (except when you are playing with certain characters), and you are not only playing against the game but also against probability and mischance; The clunky metal box is awful and its contents could easily fit a box half of its size. The desert tiles should be square cards - allowing sleeving - because they wear out and you end up with marked tiles. Also, I received 2 or 3 tiles with small print errors (dots) which are enough to distinguish these locations if someone tries a little harder to cheat.

Forbidden Desert is essentially Forbidden Island rethemed and improved.  Instead of sinking, land gets sand tokens piled on them.  The storm randomly moves around shifting tiles every which way and piling up more sand.  You have to dig out the sand to flip over tiles so that you can find the treasures, which in this game are parts of your crashed ship.  

Ship parts are located on the map according to where the two corresponding part tiles intersect.  Instead of water rising, this game has the sun beating down, which meakes you thirsty.  This is a desert where the sun only occasionally beats down... the best kind of desert to crash land in.  Opportunities to get water are very limited in the game and usually require everyone to be on the same square, which messes around with the go out and search part of the game.  

Once you find all the ship parts you have to find the launchpad and get everyone back there.  Luckily all deserts come with a buried launchpad, another little known fact about deserts.  

Now that I've played Forbidden Desert, I really would rather play it over Forbidden Island every time.

[floatright][ImageID=1528722][/floatright][thing=136063][/thing] has several similarities with his "middle brother" - [thing=65244][/thing], particularly regarding the abilities of the roles. The game dynamics is as follows: it is a cooperative game in which the players want to recover and rebuild a flying machine buried in the desert - this being the forbidden one, so you know it won't be an easy task. The machine was left in pieces and is necessary to explore the parts of the city in order to find them. All the while the desert itself is trying to murder the characters, beating them down with the inclement sun. Also the dunes shift in the wind, so things seem to move around.

The board is composed by 24 tiles in a grid of 5 x 5 with a space in the center. In each turn the player has four actions points to spend, and they can be used by moving (one point per tile), digging (one point per sand marker), exploring a tile (one point) and collecting the pieces of the of the machine (one point per piece). Players cannot move into tiles with two or more sand markers, being necessary to remove the sand first. Also is not allowed to explore a tile with sand markers on it. At the end of every player turn cards are revealed accordingly to the number on the sandstorm meter. The cards in this deck are in one of three types: sandstorm (rises the sandstorm level), suns beats down (drops the water level of the players) and directions cards that indicates how many and in what direction the tiles will move - each tile that moved receives a sand marker, and if a tile moves more than once, it receives a sand marker for each movement.

Players lose if the sand markers are depleted or if the character dies of thirsty (the level of water reaches the death level). And victory is achieved if all the pieces of the machine are collected and are taken to the hangar were they will be assembled - for this the tile must be clear of sand.

The game has more to it - special cards, tunnels, wells - but this is the basic.

[thing=136063][/thing], as [thing=65244][/thing], has a really high replay value and also shares the great pieces. One thing that [thing=136063][/thing] has an advantage is the use of actions: many times in [thing=65244][/thing] I found myself, or others, with nothing to do with the actions available. In [thing=136063][/thing] all the actions always counted for something. However without the Meteorologist, [thing=136063][/thing] seems to be more chaotic and unpredictable, so making strategies are harder to be put in place - this, by the way, has one positive point: since the it is harder to see a path, it is also harder for an alpha player to dominate, mainly because the lack, in some moments, of a clear "better move".

Anyway, the game hit strong notes with me, and I liked it quite a bit, basically the same amount as [thing=136063][/thing].

An okay coop, but I don't think it's different enough from Pandemic, which is a better game.

I never get tired of playing this. The balance seems to be near perfect, always winning or losing by a grain of sand. The only negative for me is one of the characters (Meteorologist) is useless in most games.

While forbidden island is still a good game, I do feel that this one is better.  It is reasonably challenging but can quickly become hard increasing the difficulty level.  I like the theme of this and makes me thirsty every time I play.  I like the mechanics of blowing the sand around and making it thicker and finding the locations of the artifacts to escape.  A simple game (no too simple as forbidden island), yet very fun.

More strategic but less heart pounding than Forbidden Island this one requires coordination and everyone playing their role to win. 

A recent play experience reminded me of Ozymandias by Percy Shelley:

I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown
And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.
And on the pedestal these words appear:
`My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!'
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
The lone and level sands stretch far away".

This game is fun and inventive. The use of negative space as the threat is so simple its genius. We get our casual gamers to invest in more complex games with Forbidden Dessert and they are always glad they did. The fact that it's cooperative makes for fun gaming with friends who don't like to compete. I highly recommend it.

This one caught me by surprise. I am not a fan of co-op games. With the exception of Hanabi, most of the co-op games have failed to excite me (see Shadows over Camelot). Either the games were too long, too complicated or the theme just does not sit well with my crowd (see Battlestar Galactica). So, forbidden desert was just the right mix of easy rule set, quick play time and still had enough tension. With two, the game moved along swiftly and we were done in 30 min. Even though the game was easily completed, there was always a slight tinge of danger that one of us wouldn't make it. 

This one is a keeper, and that says quite a bit about my taste of co-op games.  

After another 2 games, I have bumped this up to 9. I don't know what it is, but the short playing time coupled with the tension of finding the objects and getting back to the launch pad really made this game exciting! I think Pandemic was a game I enjoyed but because of its length, I shied away from it. Forbidden Desert just hit the sweet spot of length and depth of game play. That really is saying a lot since I don't even like co-ops that much. What a great design.

A novel extension of the Forbidden Island (or Pandemic-lite) system. Desert feels a bit more unbalanced - either you quickly get buried in the sand or you skate through the dunes to victory. The theme is great. The replacement treasure mechanism (two tiles pointing out the row and column of the item) is beautiful. The moving storm is also clever and feels like those old slide puzzles (even if I have trouble consistently moving the pieces vs the eye of the storm).

I liked Pandemic. There are a lot of good things going on about the game. However, Forbidden Dessert (made by the same guy) satisfies my craving for a good coop in a much better way than pandemic. It's a bit simpler and quicker to play. The theme comes across just as well and maybe even a little bit better. I think it's a great 2 player coop, but shines when it's 3 or 4 players. I wish it didn't come in a tin, but other than that the components are really awesome (borderline toys). I always bring this out as a nice coop to play with new gamers or those that don't like conflict.

The co-operation games must have a good story, feeling or something like that to grasp you into it in order to enjoy it (otherwise just play solitaire with multiple characters). This game lacks that kind of things, I had no feeling in the game and the moving desert felt quite funny.

Otherwise the game mechanics are ok, but the theme is pasted up and there is no real story.

Forbidden Island was a bit of a dud for me because it was pretty much Pandemic-lite.  It wasn't that it wasn't entertaining, but it was just a copy of the exact mechanisms in its inspiration, and it didn't seem like a novel idea any more.  Forbidden Desert at least takes the basic idea from Pandemic and makes it into something different enough to justify making another game.  It's still cooperative, though, so it's not a game that's going to wow me one way or another anyway.

A bloody tin, slightly smaller than square box... slightly larger than medium box! Damnit! (Tins are ace and all, but so hard to stack and shelve, and you're forever fearful of putting ugly dings in it or squishing it when transporting).

Co-op.

Plays quite differently to Forbidden Island.
*3* separate timers to be aware of! Potential super crunch!
Nevertheless initial crunch not yet evident, pretty sure we'll see it in more plays-through. Could be that Island visually removes locations from the play field whereas Desert covers them with sand tiles. 

(Actually I found the same thing with Atlantis Rising - I think it's quite impacting when you actually remove tiles, as it just nicely exaggerates the pressure and desperation. I'm sure Desert will be fine though, been seeing it in Instagram feeds & folks are enjoying it).

A great game. I think its better then forbidden island due to the fact that here is the extra addition of Sun Beats Down cards, which makes the game very challenging. This game will keep you on the edge of your seat, and in most cases the lack of water ends the game which is frusterating but makes it more enjoyable. This game is in my opinion pretty close to perfect and even after multiple plays I find myself keep coming back to it. And once again the art and style of this game much like Forbidden Island is wonderful as well.

Besides the boxcover, the title and the fact it's coöp, I didn't really know anything about this game when we bought this. But after our first play, I can't say I'm dissapointed. Easy to learn, very nice duration and yet the gameplay offers a lot of tension. Together with a bunch of different characters replayability is guaranteed. And the fact it plays also very smoothly with two players is certainly a surplus!

Okay, mark this up as a weird one for me: I don't really like Pandemic. I think it's a solid game design but something about it just doesn't make for an enjoyable game. I also wasn't terribly impressed by Forbidden Island. Nice components and simple mechanisms...but again, not terribly exciting to play.

So, along comes Forbidden Desert and I'm thinking it would just be yet another "looks cool but where's the fun?" game. Yet, to my complete surprise, this game really intrigues me. I don't know if it's the shift in dynamic making the game more of a scavenger hunt, or if it's the idea of the sand piling up and the moving storm but something about this game transforms it into a delightfully tense experience.

It's difficult but, as will become evident by a few other games higher up my list, I've never been one to shy from a challenging game.

Score one (finally) for Mr. Leacock in my book! Now, where's my canteen? It's getting hot out here!

I definitely enjoyed this more than Forbidden Island and also more than Pandemic. This game feels a lot more fresh than the other two because of the moving tiles and the sand building up.

I don't own this, but I'm looking into buying it.

Co-op worker placement tile discovery game. We are a team of specialists sent on a desert research & recovery mission of a strange technology.  A sand storm hits and our helicopter crash lands. It quickly turns to a survival mission with limited water. Finding that alien artifact may be our only hope. Easy to teach and the theme is rich and infectious. The shifting sands adds urgency to excatvating the 5x5 modular tile desert.  Game has a small footprint. Good for the camper.  Not many components, still surprisingly inexpensive?

In Forbidden Island, your titles sink and then disappear.  In Forbidden dessert, they shift around and get sand tiles heaped on top of them.  In addition to this, there's a thirst mechanic where you have to find water and keep hydrated or your characters will die, which is a good substitute for the 'island disappearing around you' mechanic of the first game.  If you enjoy Forbidden Island but want something a smidge (and only a smidge) more complex, try this.

It's a great introduction to the classic co-op experience. I prefer deeper games though, and so I feel the choices you can make are too limited for me. But, as an introduction to co-op, especially with kids, I think this is a great game.

More interesting and challenging than forbidden island, and plays with 5.
'18/01/05: Playing it solo a number of times made me appreciate Forbidden Island more. I think out of the two Island is the better game because you have to work together to get cards to each other, a logistics puzzle I like, whereas in Desert you can all be in different areas (although the water sharing mitigates this a bit I guess). I think it's worth having both, but only because I have no other co-op games.

Played twice so far. Fun game, with the Castle Panic stress at the end of your turn when you have to determine what bad stuff is going to happen to you. I like the mechanic of finding artifact locations by plotting the intersection of two card pointers. The designers also did a great job of keeping the intensity high with the storm movement, and burying tiles with sand. 

The water-carrier feels a bit over powered, but we might not have been playing correctly.

Probably won't be a hit with the entire family because of the stress factor. But it's very enjoyable and fun.

Forbidden Island isn't bad, but there's not much reason to buy it if you already own Pandemic - even for families.  The games are just too similar.

Forbidden Desert, though, is different enough from Pandemic that it's worth owning.  The way the item locations are determined is neat, and the storm and water mechanics are both imaginative and thematic.  Plus, you get to complete a snap-together airship with found loot.

I'd love to trade Forbidden Island for the sandier version, if I could.

This is the ideal coop game. Very little setup. Easy to understand and it plays quickly.

I also enjoy playing this game solo as 2 characters.

The theme on this game is spectacular and the board is dynamic and really immersive. Nothing like it. Turn between players are usually pretty fast, and there are many valid options a player can take during their turn, which allows for more non-linear independent from group  play.

Relatively easy to learn, but difficult to play. Challenging, and the moving board is rather unique (and spoils all your best laid plans!). Some roles do better in 2-player games (such as the Meteorologist, in my opinion) while others do better with more players (especially the Water Carrier). The game seems to be easier with fewer players - I have managed to beat this game on Elite with 2-players (using the Climber and the Meteorologist), but we can't even beat Normal difficulty with 3 players or more.

Co-operative, simple, yet challenging game. It feels like an accomplishment when you win. This is definitively a step up from Forbidden Island in terms of complexity and difficulty. I love having to locate the ship, but the water bearer seems to be a required character IMO. Everyone I've played this with loves it. I can't say I'd ever turn down a game if asked. Has the right balance of difficulty (with the ability to increase the difficulty) and ease of play/weight of tactics.

The framework of this game is pleasantly familiar from Pandemic and Forbidden Island.  The way the goal items and moving storm make it more of treasure hunt is a nice change to make it refreshingly its own game.  My only concern is that the best part of the other games is the "smart" deck that hits you where it hurts over and over again.  The threat of the storm is just so much more random that its hard to reason against or feel strongly threatened by.  Admittedly I've only played on the lowest difficulty level with my 4 year old so far so time will tell.

My wife and I purchased this game, hoping that we would enjoy it as much as we enjoy playing Pandemic with 2 players. 

Turns out the game is just O.K. for 2 players, in our experience. After playing through it a handful of times together, we haven't picked it up to play just the two of us.

However, where this game shines is when we have company over who may not be as serious gamers as my wife and I. The rules are simple and the cooperative nature of the game makes for a great social interaction.

I don't know that I'll ever reach for this again when it is just my wife and I looking to play a game, but I expect it to be something we regularly reach for when company visits.

A good mid-range co-op with a really cool theme. It's not as challenging as Pandemic or Ghost Stories, but still requires you to carefully utilize your role.

Another good coop game. I love the modular board mechanic and the tension that all of the elements bring to the table. When there's only one way to win but SO many ways to lose, the game becomes a real nailbiter. However, I see a lot of people get overwhelmed with the game's sheer difficulty. On Novice mode mind you. Makes it hard to get other people to play it.

Has the mark of a great co-op: the closer you are to victory, the more tense it gets. I never have the feeling of whipping the game and be done with it, so I keep coming back.

Like playing coop games, especially with my two boys. Desert is by far the better game over Island.

It's good. It's much better than Forbidden Island. But if you're looking for a more complex coop, why aren't you playing Pandemic. In fact, why aren't you playing Pandemic right now?!

Coop game sequel to forbidden island. This game includes extra mechanics that up the difficulty but they're are not the "same" game. This one is more complex so I'd recommend both games for when you want a more in depth or simple game to play.

[b]1st play, 2p[/b]:

A simple cooperative game with interesting mechanics and lots of potential, but unfortunately the overpowered [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/981733/navigator-climber-superpowered]navigator & climber role combination[/url] we chose to play with exposed some cracks in the gameplay. I'll have to try again with a higher difficulty, a larger group and/or make sure never to play with that specific role combination in a future 2p game. Gorgeous components, but slightly cumbersome irregularly-sized tin.

Initial rating: [b]6.5[/b]

Yeah, that broken combination pretty much ruined it for me and there really wan't anything I found that made me want to go back to it. It was pretty flat unfortunately.

GAME: Firefly Fluxx
RANK: 2528

RATING: 4.5
Like most Fluxx games, it can be entertaining but it's mostly annoying randomness.

It's Fluxx with a Firefly theme. That's all you really need to know.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the seemingly more basic iterations of Fluxx. Fluxx itself is a brilliantly light fast paced and chaotic card game which satisfies both new & experienced gamers. Great filler game.
While firefly fluxx is definitely not the worst version of fluxx out there, it doesn't seem to be overly special either. The humor is a big draw in fluxx and honestly other versions hit higher notes with puns and clever/ridiculous cards. Firefly doesn't offer a whole lot of changes to the fluxx universe although the rogue space pirate-ness does offer thematic plunder and stealing cards/actions. 

So while I tend to give Fluxx itself a 9/10, Firefly is really just a reskin/theme without enough flavour or changes to really get my endorsement. If you don't already own Fluxx (and this is the only one in the store) or you love firefly and named characters with clip art likenesses will fill you glee I would opt for Star Fluxx, Pirate Fluxx, even monty python fluxx for the action/speaking cards which ramp up the fun. Firefly Fluxx isn't a bad version of the game but it is essentially the same as the base version.

Good for: People who love firefly. People who don't already own fluxx.
Not recommended: If you can get Star Fluxx (and like scif)/pirate fluxx/monty python fluxx. Or if you don't like firefly because that's really who this game seemed marketed for is fandom > game play. 

Not at as bad as some Fluxx offerings out there, but not one of my top recommendations either.

Not the best Fluxx game. The Firefly theme feels very much tacked on with only one or two cards actually adding anything distinctly different. Otherwise, it's just Fluxx with some (quite poor) Firefly artwork.

GAMEPLAY: :star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar: 
The only Fluxx game I've played, turns out I don't like Fluxx games! Too much comes down to the luck of the draw, I prefer a little more strategy 
 
AESTHETICS: :star::star::star::star::nostar:
I love Firefly and this has some cool references and srtwork although a little cartoony maybe

RULES & TEACHING: :star::star::star::star::nostar:
Very simple to teach as you learn the rules as you go I guess!

first time playing FLUXX and we enjoyed it a lot.  obviously drawn to the game because of the firefly theme, like the fact that it's a simple, fast (usually) game that we can easily carry with us and play anywhere.  going to have to look at other FLUXX games now.

I'm a big Firefly fan but this didn't blow me away. The cards were somewhat different from other Fluxx's (+ had a yellowed background) - nothing major. Multiple plays with 2 people felt flat. Worked better with 4 people. Prefer most of the other Fluxx's to this.

Fun game for Firefly fans. Even those who don't know Firefly should not have an issue in playing this edition, although the references will be lost on them. I recommend playing with less people (2-4), but I may be biased since the one time I played with 6 people, the game ended before I reached my second turn.

As much as I adore the theme, and enjoy Fluxx as a filler game, Firefly Fluxx has some serious gimmicky mechanical issues. Having Zoe steal Wash steal Serenity steal Stolen goods was funny the first time it happened. After the eighth, the game quickly lost its appeal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good fun. Better than average use of the Firefly 'verse with the Fluxx mechanics. Does achieve a bit of the feel you're hoping to find. But it's still Fluxx. I've got a few friends that really don't like Fluxx much.

Takes the Fluxx engine and adds Firefly characters and "stuff" as keepers and creepers.  The rules are basically the same adding draw, play, keeper limits, hand limits, and other rules.  There are surprise cards and actions as well that include items from the series.  All the goals have flavor text like "Big Damn Heroes", etc.  

The art on the cards is ok.  It is "cartoonish" but does not bother me.  

I am not a huge Fluxx fan, but I like the game a lot because of Firefly.  If you like Fluxx and Firefly, this is a good version of the game to own.

Big gorram Firefly Fluxx. If you aim to misbehave, Serenity style, then this is the Fluxx for you. Guaranteed shiny fun with your friends. That is, of course until their (or your) sudden but inevitable betrayal! Till the next time I play this... I'll be in my bunk!

This catches the theme  of the show nicely. 
I find this version to be tamer than some ( adventure time, Regular show, Cthulhu) but I really find this version - to be chill to play. Relaxed, and fun.

RATING: 2.5
+1 Light - No teaching, all the rules are on the cards, mostly brainelss. 
+.5 somewhat flexible group size, but more players means more downtime and even less room for strategy.  

-2 what decisions you do make, you make with very limited information because game parameters change so frequently, broader strategy goes out the window - making the outcome of your actions, and the game, seem random ('oh, I won? huh...')
-1 art/flavor text on this version isn't even good. More 'heres a thing from the show' and less cool stuff one could read out/show as they play it. 
-1 play time, for such a light game, is completely inconsistent. Ranges from 2 minutes to eons, with little in between. 

I avoid it where possible. Sometimes ends up on the table with an awkward number of people, waiting on something else, and no one is bothered taking the initiative to set up a better game.

I played this with a friend.  I like, nay very much like, enjoy even, the Firefly series and such.  I even like the way these cards are a little softer as far as color scheme goes, making the cards look more worn to fit into the Firefly universe. 

HOWEVER.  Looking at the cards to read their instructions and then looking at the draw deck....   I nearly went blind every time....  Why make the backs of the cards so gorram white when the other side is off-white?....

Meh, merely a minor gripe...  I still will buy this to add to my game collection.  I can't be stuck w/ only Zombie Fluxx, now can I?....

RATING: 4
Meh, Fluxx isn't all that interesting of a game to me, and the Firefly theme doesn't really add much.  Simple game to play real quick to kill time I suppose but don't be surprised if the game just won't seem to end (and not because it's fun, but because it simply refuses to).

It's another Fluxx game with a different theme.  I like Firefly which helps.  Fluxx always feels a bunch of random chaos until someone stumbles into the winning Goal.  I enjoy the 'take-that' moments and wish there were more of them.

I love Firefly, but this version of Fluxx is not up to the high standard set by the Monty Python, Cthulhu, and Zombie versions. Very little "Firefly" to it except for the keepers and creepers being characters and things from the show. The characters do not have much in the way of unique abilities, and several glaring omissions from the card list (for example, the game features the "Hands of Blue" but not The Operative and Mr. Universe?). The Creepers have no real special abilities (why doesn't the Reaver Creeper kill all of your character Keepers?). Overall, a (rare) disappointing effort from Looney Labs.

This is a fun little game, and a MUST if you like firefly. It's silly, random, but quick and easy. There isn't a terrible amount of strategy, and will likely be looked down on by hardcore gamers who hate randomness. That said, it's just a little game, and the Firefly theme will always have a special place in my heart

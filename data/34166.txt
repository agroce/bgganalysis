RATING: 8
Quick, easy, scalable filler.  Buy 2 copies and play up to 8 people.  Random, yes, but there's some subtle strategy at work.  Besides, if you really get screwed the game will be over in 2 minutes and you can play again.  Rates a 8 for the short game time, number of decisions per game and balance of luck and decisions.

My kind of filler.  I love it!

Stumbled onto this from Joel Eddy's blacklist entry for Qwixx. Played a few games online. It's clever but I find these sort of fast paced rote decision games to be really hollow. At least it manages to be slim which is the best quality for those sorts of games. Contrast, say, Dominion.

{50+ plays • 3-8 players!}  What can I say?  I dig this one.  It's a cool little bingo-esque filler that I dare you not to play 4 times in a row.  Those 4 games, by the way, might not even take 30 minutes total.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a great little filler,engaging enough to play several times in a row. Can be explained in 5 minutes and takes about 5-7 minutes a game.  Has been stocked at numerous online retailers.

If your going to purchase this, consider purchasing 2 or more sets so that you can play with up to 8 players (or more).  There are no scaling issues rather than reducing your chances of winning, and each game/round can be played in around 7 minutes.

Very light filler game.  I would give it a 5 but then I would be giving it less just because it is filler and that is not fair.  For a 15 minute game it is pretty good.

Super-simple game, as advertised.  People who like Bingo will like this, and I like it too.  No strategy, though the decisions, while easy to make, do influence the outcome.

RATING: 7
Components: Very simple, functional components.

Experience: Fun. A blend of Racko-O! and Take It Easy. Mostly chance-driven, but it plays quickly. It's fun, once all the pieces are on the board, shuffling tiles about, trying to open up the widest area into which that one, stubborn piece can fit.

If you want a 10-minute filler, this will do. A bingo-type (?) game in terms of will play as many people as you have boards for. Someone rolls a d20 and that is the number that must be covered this turn.

The numbers tokens available to you are completely random (which ever three you happen to flip over) so there is a lot of luck involved here. The game keeps going until someone has ordered all of their number tokens in ascending order on their board.

May10:

This is a genius of a game.  So simple, yet so addicting.  It has very real decisions and practically no downtime.

I realize there isn't really any player interaction (well, you can encourage the die roller to roll better dammit)

The probabilities just don't collapse easily.  There's always some numbers to crunch on what the best move is.

And yet there's enough luck for the family to stand a chance of winning as well.

This just is a very good game.

Quick filler game playable in 10 minutes. The goal to order numbers reminds a bit of the 10 Days-series where you have to get your country cards into the right order. If you enjoy that series you'll probably like Finito as well. Here, the D20 decides where to put a token. Nonetheless, it doesn't feel like the game is playing you and the decisions are meaningful enough for such a light game.

RATING: 7
Another one of those very simple, addicting games that can be good for a large group of people.  I think it's a little sneaky to only include components for 4 people in the box.  Take It Easy has at least 6.

I think there's a larger amount of luck here than Take It Easy (due to the luck of the draw as well as the die roll), but it plays quickly enough that it's not really a problem.  All in all, a really nice filler that feels different enough to get a lot more play.

Update: I'll keep it at a 7 because my wife really enjoys the game, so that makes it fun to play.  But I think that what really bothers me is the completely solitary nature of the game.  It's true that Take It Easy and Wurfel Bingo are also completely solitary, but in those games at least you are trying to make do with the exact same options, so in some way it is a test of skill.  Here what you are doing really has little relation to anyone else.  When someone wins it's like, "Oh, okay - you just won - nice job.  I was one roll away from winning myself." 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Playing this game one time as a single game seems a little too simple; too bingo-ish.
I think I will prefer to play multiple games and do a running score.  Prehaps 4 quick games and highest score total wins.  That would be much more strategic and still not take much time.

[COLOR=#0000FF]Ausgesprochen nette Idee, deren Entwicklung mir in der vorliegenden Fassung noch nicht vollständig abgeschlossen scheint. Schade, dass der Name "Würfel-Bingo" bereits vergeben ist, der hätte schließlich bestens gepasst.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=#009900][b]Memo-Finito![/b]
Diese spontan entwickelte Variante bietet sich an, um die (relativ schlichte) Herausforderung des Spiels etwas zu steigern: Wer einen Stein neu platziert, setzt diesen generell verdeckt ein. Die bereits auf dem Plan liegenden Steine dürfen jederzeit aufgedeckt, im Anschluss ans Aufdecken aber nie wieder umgesetzt werden. Sobald alle Steine eingesetzt worden sind, muss jeder Spieler nach dem Umsetzen eines Steins mindestens einen solchen aufdecken und damit "fixieren". Deckt er den gerade umgesetzten Stein auf, darf er diesen auch sofort vom Plan nehmen, wenn ihm dies günstiger erscheint (der Stein bleibt aufgedeckt). Ein Durchgang endet, sobald alle Zahlen eines Spielers aufgedeckt sind. Es wird bei allen regulär gewertet: der längste Block zählt, wobei noch nicht aufgedeckte Steine ignoriert werden. Jeder vom Plan genommene Stein reduziert das Ergebnis um 1 (= 1 Minuspunkt). Ich empfehle, über mehrere Runden auf eine vorher vereinbarte Punktzahl zu spielen (z.B. 30 Punkte).

Vorsicht: Diese Variante ist kaum zielgruppenkompatibel mit dem Grundspiel, verlangt sie den Spielern doch ein deutlich gesteigertes Maß an Konzentration ab. Da ihnen maximal exakt 24 Züge zur Verfügung stehen, ist die vollständige Konstruktion einer korrekten Zahlenreihe eher unwahrscheinlich.[/COLOR]

It's super fast and super dumb but surprisingly really engaging for the few minutes it takes to play a few rounds.

A simple game that's sorta like Bingo with some tactical choices.  Looking forward to playing this with my son.  At two we like to just play with the chips and talk about the numbers and colors.

The game: you have numbered chips 1-12 and a board with numbers 1-20 (some repeated).  Everyone flips 3 chips face up.  Roll a 20-sided die.  Everyone then places one of their 3 face-up chips on the number rolled.  Flip another chip face up and repeat. If the number rolled is already covered with chip(s) then choose a number to the left or right of that.  Once all the chips are placed you can then move any one of your chips to the number rolled.  First player to have all chips on the board in sequential order exclaims "Finito!" and wins.

A bingo-style game in which players attempt to arrange tiles numbered 1-12 in ascending order along a grid of tiles from 1-20. The game has a tiny amount of strategy, but it's a very luck-driven game that anyone can feel competitive at, similar to Rack-O. Pretty addictive, as fillers go, with an extremely low barrier to entry.

The game plays 1-4, but buying two sets enables 8 to play with no detrimental effects. Perfect for a large family gathering.

RATING: 7
A GREAT filler for any number of players (each set can accomodate 4, but you can buy extra sets and play with more... a 48-player game of Finito, anyone?) :)

This was the first official game I played at the 2009 GoF and I was determined to win a game. It took 14 consecutive plays before I had the satisfaction of calling "Finito!" with much glee and fervor!

For a change here's a nice development of bingo: when a 20-sided die is thrown players fill one of the slots in their cards showing that number with one of the four face-up chips out of their pool of 12. When all the chips have been placed in the card, the throws will signal which slot a chip has got to be moved onto. The first player who sorts all the chips in the right order wins.

Pleasant, light and lively, Finito can stand a decent amount of consecutive plays before it becomes repetitive.

RATING: 8.45
Strangely fun and addictive! I had no idea I would enjoy this game so much. It really couldn't be any simpler and it has wonderful high quality components. At first I thought it might be some type of Bingo or Sodoku type game. But it definitely is not. You have 12 numbers, but only 3 are revealed randomly at a time. You are trying to place them in order from 1 to 12 on your own personal game board that has numbers doubled from 1 to 20. Someone rolls the 20-sided die and that is where you may place the number. Strategically you will need to decide where your numbers will fit best to achieve numeric order. The winner is the first to get all their numbers in order. A great game for 2 to 4 and I could see if you owned multiple copies of the game, many more players could easily play at the same time.

A great little filler, the sort of game that plays a lot better than the description might suggest. I really enjoyed this, despite (or maybe because of?) my inability to do well at it.

RATING: 7
Decent 10 minute filler where, like all dice games, the fun depends on those playing. You're trying to get your discs, labelled 1-12, into correct order. But each turn you only have three discs to choose from, and one of them must go onto your mat into the position the just rolled d20 says. Unless you're incredibly lucky, they won't be in sequence by the time they're all on, and then you move the discs that are already on board. Like Europa Tour, when you're down to just one disc being out of order, you want as big a gap as possible to maximise the number of d20 rolls which will allow you to move that disc into its correct spot. So, there are some rack management decisions along the way, lots of randomness, but its all over in a time appropriate for the game. It fills its niche.

This filler is really just a filler! I expect to go down with my rating in a few weeks-months! Still fun with some non-gamers!
Update: I actually raised my rating because I still like pulling this out as closer for our gaming sessions! Valid game! Well done!

This is a multiplayer solitaire game along the same lines as Take It Easy!, except with dice-rolling.  Each person has three random chips from their stack to place on a line, and one person rolls a twenty-sided die to determine where the chip can be placed.  Once you get all your chips out in this manner, you start swapping positions.  The idea is to get all of your chips in numerical order.  It's a decent diversion.

Finito! feels like Rack-o, is much faster, and somewhat addictive. It can be played in a few minutes, while other people are setting up or explaining another, larger game: in other words: the ultimate filler.

Sounded like a game I would like so I suggested it and I wasn't wrong! Very simple game to try and get your numbers in a row. A D20 is rolled and you have to place one of your discs valued 1-12 down and only once you played all of the tokens are you able to start moving them around. It is clever and the first to get them placed in ascending order wins! I would play anytime. Fast and light beginning or ending to any game day.

RATING: 6
I give it a higher rating simply because it's painless.  But it's nothing great, either.  And it confuses a lot of people to roll numbers and place numbers.  Others mentioned that it would be better with letter tiles (A, B, ...) rather than number tiles.  And that is quite true.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Quite simple & fun. Has a sort of bingo feel but with movable numbers!

Dice rolls to determine where number tiles are placed. Try to judge the likelihood of future numbers being rolled in order to get your tiles on the board in correct sequence. Once all tiles are on, use subsequent dice rolls to get them in order. First player to achieve this wins the round.

Az est meglepetese. Nagyon kis egyugyu, egyszeru jatek es megis lenyugozott mindenkit. Ranezesre azt gondolna az ember, hogy egy bingo stilusu jatek, es talan igaz is. 1-12 -ig szamozott korongokat ugy felhelyezni a tablara, hogy sorrendben legyenek, egyszeru, ugye? Pedig nem az, mindig harom korong van felcsapva es egy d20 kocka dobasa donti el, hogy hova kell felrakni egy korongot. 20-as jott ki a dobasnal? Nalad csak a 1,4,8-as korongok vannak felcsapva? Mit raksz fel a 20-as mezore, ahova jo esetben a 12-es korongnak van a helye, mert valamit fel kell raknod. Miutan az osszes korong a tablara kerult, kisebb-nagyobb sikerrel a sorrendet tekintve, folytatodnak a dobasok es a kidobott szamra a tablarol atlehet helyezni egy korongot es igy megprobalni letrehozni a sorrendet. Gyors, jo bevezeto jatek.

This is my least favorite of these three (other are numeri and finito).  I find the luck element, from both the die roll and the chip draws, to be a significant issue -- moreso than in numeri.  Of course, without the random draw of chips there wouldn't really be much of interest here.  [01/08/2011]

Finito! -- Played once; three-player.

Very light, but surprisingly addictive filler.  We played one round for each player and totaled the scores.

Like Bingo, the number of players is limited only by the number of sets of boards and chips.

There is a [b]lot[/b] of luck in the draw.  For example, if a player draws the tokens numbered 1, 2, and 3 and then the number 20 is rolled, they're going to be forced to put a low-numbered token on a high-numbered spot.  But once the tokens have all been placed on the board, players can choose from the full range of tokens.  So while luck is still significant, thoughtful play can make the difference.  

Play is quick and duration is short.  In a longer game, so much luck would be frustrating, but in [i]Finito![/i] the luck actually adds to the hopeful anticipation.

Nagyon egyszerű játékról van szó. 36 helyes táblánkra kockadobás során juttatunk fel 12 számozott korongot véletlenszerűen, majd a kockadobásokkal próbáljuk áthelyezni őket, hogy növekvő sorrendben szerepeljenek a korongjaink. Akinek leghamarabb sikerül ő a győztes. 10 perces játék, amiben megvan a szerencse szerepe a felhelyezésnél, de tetszett.

RATING: 3.5
All the tedium of Take it Easy and Cities, without any of the fairness of the parallel draws.  The advantage that Finito! has over the other two is that it is faster. It is harmless, and it is kind of fun to play the odds.  All in all though it is only a small step up from bingo.

I think High Score/Würfel Bingo is the best of this kind of game, and even then I'm not all that hot on it.

A nice, quick filler.

Players have the same board and set of numbered (1-12) tokens: each player shuffles their tokens and flips 3 face up. Each round, someone rolls a d20. In the first 12 rounds, you place one of your 3 face up tokens onto the number rolled (if already occupied, may use the first free space to either left or right of that space). Then replace the used chip. After 12 rounds, you may MOVE a token to the number rolled. Continue playing till someone arranges all their tokens sequentially = winner!

I've been on a roll lately with playing new games that are challenging yet fast-paced and easy to learn.  Reminds me of Rack-O with dice added for an extra twist.  A good family game too.  My rating should be an 8 but I awarded an extra point for the colorful game box.

Another entry in the recent trend of bingo-like games. This time, players have to arrange 12 discs in ascending order, but they have to place a disc on a space indicated by a die roll. Due to each player having a choice of 3 random discs for most of the game, there's more luck variation than games like Take it Easy or FITS where everyone has to place the same piece. Quite involving in a lucky, solitaire, puzzle kind of way.

The ultimate filler game, Finito takes only about 10 minutes to play. A sure sign that this one will have some staying power is that every time I've played it, someone in the group wants to immediately play a seccond or third game. Finito is the new gaming popcorn ...

Since most of the decisions are obvious, Finito is more about the dice rolls and the tokens which are turned over--both random events.  It's a lot of pieces and setup time for one giant randomizer.  At the end, however, someone does get to yell out "Finito!" and that's really the best part of the game.

Played online at Happy Meeple. This is a very simple bingo-esque game where players try to place numbers on a grid. The first phase, players have to put down numbers based on a die roll, the second phase, players move around numbers also based on die rolls. Clearly lots of luck involved. There is likely to have some strategy involved in placement, but it is not yet very clear to me how to do just that. Intriguing little game but a fun filler.

This is a cute enough game, but I'm not sure it has the kind of tension I want out of a game.  There's definitely a tactic to use when initially placing your pieces, but when the game comes down to just rolling the die, it loses a lot of its tension.  Oh, well.

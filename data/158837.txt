RATING: 5.5
My rating on this game has a lot to do with the fact that clue type games don't really grip me. I liked that you could assassinate people early if you knew. The deception and disguises are innovative and for people who like deductive multiplayer games, this may be intriguing. I find it better than werewolf, shadow warriors, bang or the like. Just not my game....

 One of the best deduction game i've ever played!

RATING: 7
A good simultaneous action selection slugfest in the vein of Mission Red Planet. Deduction is not the primary mechanism. It's more a question of knowing who is furthest on your trail and knowing when to switch from offense to defense and back again.

Juego de Roles ocultos.... una especie de Cluedo... no está mal. Hay que darle otra oportunidad.

RATING: 8
Like Cluedo but on a train & more fun. Seems better with more players. Best strategy also appears to NOT just target one person relentlessly, if the last gameplay is anything to go by.

Not a very well placed deduction game. The card play of the game slows the game so much.

I played with 6 players both times, the game can really drag with that many. Try it with 4, might be more fun.

This isn't an easy game to just pick up and play unless you have someone who can explain the game to you. But after going through the games rule book and learning curve, I was able to teach my family and since then we have played many fun and no interesting games. It is more fun if nobody directly picks on one person and when that has happened in games nether of them have won and both leave the game first. So with that in mind a subtle approach to eliminating other players not only brings this game to life but is a world of fun!!!

Player count is going to decide if this rating stays.  This is a murder deduction game.  You must figure out which character the other players are and then assassinate them.  Yes, there is player elimination.  That's the down side.  But the game is pretty fast at the lower player counts.  

Six player game takes way too long.  I might be willing to play 5 players, but six was too long by at least 30 minutes.
Rating dropped from 8 to 7.

Very nice deduction game. I played it and I liked it a lot. The train mechanics and events spice up the game and make it replayable for me.

A pretty good deduction game. I wouldn't heard about this one if I didn't win it in a contest. Teaching the game takes a bit more time than I like. The gameplay is quick and everyone gets more and more tense as people start figuring out identities of others. I enjoy it best with 4-5 players.

Several qualities about this game: light deduction, direct interaction, assimetric habilities, great tension moments and smart mechanics. However, the game has it problems also: too much different types of cards to handle makes part of the game confusing and adds time. Also, despite the player elimination being a great factor for the tension, it is player elimination anyways.

Un Cluedo con qualche cosa in più. Nel gicoo si impersonano dei personaggi su un treno e bisogna smascherare l'identità degli altri giocatori. Molto carino e ben amalgamato. Ho solo un po' di dubbi sulla longevità ma è un gioco che mi piacerebbe riprovare.

Okay deduction game, however is let down by the high player requirement for a good game (5+) and duration.

A very good deduction game, it's pretty popular in my gaming group and is easily our favourite deduction game.

From a brief look at the video review, it seems a silent version of Clue(do), so may not be engaging for the non-turn player(s) getting incidental clues from verbal requests.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A fast deduction game with player elimination and a heavy reliance on luck-of-the-draw. I would play this over games like Clue or Alibi, but it's certainly not the best in the genre. Try P.I. For a less annoying, albeit longer game.

Played at Essen 2014. Interesting deduction variant of "Cluedo" related games. As well "Inkognito" comes to my mind. Not very new to me regarding mechanics and gameplay but some fresh ideas such as action cards. Player elemination does reduce my interest.

Enjoyable deduction game, mixing mechanics from Mystery of the Abbey with cardplay and a 'stab, you're dead' mechanic which brings a lot of tension and a race-like feeling to the game.

Its main drawback? If you're the first to be assassinated, you can watch at the sidelines. And this one lasts longer than Werewolves, so that can be a bummer.

If you like deduction games though and don't mind a cutthroat game, this is one to try out.

6-12-2016: Lighter deduction game, where players use cards to investigate others in order to assassinate other players.  Deduction uses appearance, scent and voice.  Likely hard to find.

This is my ideal game for larger numbers. It's very interactive, and the hunt is always fun.

Provisional rating, one play 4p (probably not the best number) with the Spiel 2014 promo. Liked it for being quite stripped down (as opposed to, say, Mystery of the Abbey) and having some theme (Sleuth).

This feels like a super-niche game that will appeal strongly with the right crowd - finding that group might be a little difficult tho, but not impossible.

RATING: 5.5
Lovely concept & great setting, but strategy-wise the game feels a bit wonky. Seems like the winning strategy is to only protect yourself, and have the other players kill eachother, and hope you get lucky with the final stab. 
Or did my group just succumb to groupthink?

Deduction racing game. Stay alive and reveal your opponents' identities.
The innocent passengers, the events and the reaction cards make this deduction game unique.

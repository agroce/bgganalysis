Game too short.  Could not develop your military force, so it was virtually useless.  Too easy to develop strength of monsters and too difficult to develop any monster special abilities.  Monster fight was nothing special, almost a foregone conclusion.

RATING: 6
Sometimes a game just needs to be silly.  This game starts out with that and handles it quite well.  Player interaction is high due to the dual control of a military force and a monster.  As the game advances though, there is the risk that players become too attached to their creature and expect it to actually win.  That's when you know the spirit of the game is being lost.  The push for a win should happen early.  If you get down to a grudge match between monsters - the game play can overstay its welcome.

Wow!  What can I say about this game.  Not much, didn't get to play it as it took too long to get through the instructions.  The game looks like it could be a lot of fun playing a monster smashing up america, but I have to wait until next time to actually try to set it up again.  The instructions feel like that were originally written in Chinese, translated by a Korean person who did not speak Chinese well, then translated into English by a brain-damaged retarded 5 year old who could only speak Esperanto.  Someone (maybe even me) needs to rewrite the instructions in simple english and publish them here for all to see and finally understand.

A very cool looking game that has decent light gameplay and then slapped with the worst ending ever.  Seriously??  "We have no idea how to end this, let's just have them roll 30 dice and call it quits."

Okay, I confess, I broke down and bought it.  Even though I have "Ravage" already.  I'm a sucker for bits.  I still can't get used to sailing stubby missiles around the ocean then launching submarines in the air (same piece represents SSNs and SLCMs).  Wish there was a surface navy.  Wish there were B-52s.  Wish the black planes were real F-117s.  Wish there were rules for fleeing terrified people.  Wish there would be an expansion someday.  Sigh.

This is basically a social game for people who like "Rampage," the arcade game from the eighties.  The Military Research and Mutation cards are unbalanced, but so are the dice!  I enjoy the theme, but other than that, I would refuse to play back-to-back sessions of this game.

The problem with this game is the battling sessions between the monster is pretty short compared to the initial stage of powering up your monster. And also, you can be as healthy as an ox but it does not matter one whit if you have bad dice throws. :(

To me, the first part of the game is meaningless.  The entire game comes down to the monster challenge at the end.  Dice are pretty much the sole deciding factor.  Decent game for the kids but a bad game for people who like strategy.

RATING: 6
Great theme, pretty fun game.  There's probably a bit too much randomness in the die rolls, and a lot of chaos in the cards, but as long as you don't take it too seriously, it's a blast stomping cities with giant monsters.  However, the end game is really broken and arbitrary.  Only play this one with a group who enjoys the game experience and toy factor as much or more as winning and tight gameplay.

I originally gave this a 5, but I think I was expecting too much out of it with the AH logo on the side.  More recently I've played it again with my 5yo son and it is a fun quick game.  The initial part of the game is really just a ramp up to the final battle.  There really is hardly any tactical geographic pay here.  The map is simply there to get stomped on.

With this mind set, and thinking of this more as a filler/kids game, it's pretty fun.

Fuck the naysayers...this is still the absolute best Kaiju boardgame on the market.  It's all about the build up.  Smash cities, mutate, power up and then in end you have a big epic, dumb dice fest to end it.  Great family game and a true classic in the Ameritrash genre.

Bits are really nice, but I'm not sure if there's enough going on while you're playing it.  You can get hosed pretty good by the power cards, which can be problematic since it took you 2-3 hours to get them.

So this is pretty cool, despite the varying reports I've heard about it. Took me two years of owning it before playing, too! Still learning the military's strengths/weaknesses and a lot to learn, but the combo of prep for the monster challenge and figuring the best order to fight and when to use infamy tokens, etc etc. Very interesting and just a cool/fun game/game theme.

It's like Risk on Steroids with a Giant Monsters Kaiju theme! Great game to play with my lil'boy, and family. It does actually have SURPRISING strategy, more than most think. Such as using the military to slow down the monsters, to enhancing your monster and preventing such to others, player competition and co-op, gaining the most infamy are a few.

Sadly yes the ending is anti-climatic and a dice-fest(which dropped the rating to 9)  BUT you can enhance or make some house rules to change that and even the game, like: Make the end monster challenge less about a luck dice fest and more about strategy, monsters can engage each other in battle during the game, winners steal infamy, or a mutation card and also take health away. Change the dice rules more towards like Risk with defenders win on ties, limit the mutation cards or remove them altogether! I also have encountered one major flaw in the game the military units divisions that are seperated between the players are unbalanced(easily fixable in house rules).

My family likes the original rules, but my brother and I have enhanced and changed some of the mechanics for us and the boys to be more strategic and less luck which makes it great! One specifically is you must smash a military base to get a Military Research Card, instead of the easy opting out to deploy to get one, makes it more like the mutation cards. The game is simple to learn yet deeper in complexity then you think right off. I highly recommend this game to those who love to have a fun humor filled time and love the theme. 

Update: We have victory point based game around the Infamy. The monster who gains the most infamy by the end of the game wins. This includes the infamy tokens we give each monster (an equal sum) that you can take from a opponents monster if you wish to engage in battle to increase your odds of winning.

Fun theme, great bits - Cameron likes it a lot (it's perfect for an 8-year old!). There is not a huge amount of depth in this game. I suspect that it might be possible to write a good player's aid and some variant rules that would make this game a lot better.

Fixes some of what's wrong with it's predecessor by removing the terrain costs in the west and better balancing the monsters and branches of the military.  Still not a serious game by any means but this would have been solid gold when I was 10 years old.

RATING: 4
Very little strategy other than a lot of diplomacy in trying to get people to move their military units in a way that slows down others but leaves you with a good move.  The military units are worthless except for locking down a few hexes or launching an all-out assault on a monster which costs 2/3 of the units involved but gets you a military strategy card -- yippee.  Worse yet, they can be strung out in a thin line that does no damage but slows the monsters (and the game) to a crawl.  Fun theme, but the mechanics are dull and after 90 minutes of play it all boils down to who gets lucky during the dice-off.  Disappointing.  Not even sure my kids would like it.

RATING: 7.5
To be honest, when my son (age 5) and I began playing, I was not impressed at all.  A quick read of the rules lead me to believe it was going to be a dull experience... and when we had to pause in the middle, I was not too depressed.  

HOWEVER, I decided to leave it out so that we could finish the game the next day (a life lesson for the boy about finishing what you start) and the next day's session was really fun.  As the monsters and military forces gained power and powers, the game opened up a little.  This game turned into a realy joy to play by the end, as we both approached the final showdown.  In the end, I can honestly say I was looking forward to playing it again.  

My final analysis is that this game is actually pretty well designed and has the crucial element for a heavy theme game... it's just fun.

This is a great laugh. You get to control a giant movie monster and a wing of the armed forces.

Although the end game is a bit random and so to a large extent determining the winner is a bit arbitrary I still enjoy MMA every time that I play.

The game itself, while not a brain-burner by any stretch gives enough options to try out different approaches to powering up your monster and crucifying your opponents monster in simple, evocative and fun ways.

The components are great and the art on the box cover and cards is very nice.  The fact that its a game about giant monsters trashing things doesnt hurt either.

I love it and wouldnt dream of getting rid of it :)

1 play (4p) - fun beer & pretzels type game with great theme and pieces. I can get into its childish glee.  I wouldn't mind playing under the influence of fermented grains.  Clearly it ain't a euro.  By the way I think it's possible for the armed forces to do damage if you concentrate your attacks. I especially love Captain Loincloth and Iron Shorts. I imagine this one won't see much play due to the understandable lack of enthusiasm around me.

Don't listen to the naysayers who complain about the dice roll at the end. The game's a lot of fun and who actually wins rarely bothers me. Most times, everyone's so close that it's a toss up by any measure, so you might as well roll some dice.

What a fun game!  The "game" isn't so great, but as a theme and with the right people, it's a blast to play -- what's not to love about being a humungous B movie monster, swatting away tanks while heading for cities to stomp?  Cheezy, luck-based fun.

Boy, did I want to love this game. Sadly, it suffers from the same problems as the first version.

Will I ever find a game that can match my love of this genre?

RATING: 5
not very strategic. The final show down is hardly led up too by any of the mid-game decisions and the end is a matter of die rolls. Interesting but has very limited re-playability: I must admit I have never played with more than two, perhaps it shines with 3 or more but I doubt it.

This theme probably could have been made in to an awesome game.  But at least this game doesn't suck completely.  More special monster powers instead of just having slaps.

This is a enjoyable theme filled romp, not much depth and I don't care.  I can see this being a family game for years to come.  There are meaningful decisions to make;however, being the challenger at the end seems to be the key to victory.  Fun journey of building up your monsters strength while trying to stop your opponents from doing the same with your branch of the military.

You get to go around America with gigantic monsters and smash stuff!  Also, use your branch of the military to slow down opponents' monsters.  Very fun game with great theme.  Only criticism is that the end is a little bit of a dice fest, and can feel a little random and anti-climatic.

I love the campy, 1950's B-rated sci-fi look & feel.  4 player game was a hoot!  A real dice fest.  With only 3 dice included, you need to add more.  Would have liked to see renditions of The Blob (in lieu of Toxicor),  but I'm sure licensing would have been prohibitive.
Plays just as well w/ 3.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
B-movie creature, city stomping, plane swatting fun. Great bits and tons of plastic pieces and a fistful of dice. The downside though is that you can't fight each others monsters during the course of the game and the final creature battle feels rushed and anti- climactic.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good Ameritrash game.  The game has a great theme, and my son loves to play this game (he calls all the Monsters by their "real" names though).  Overall, I don't feel there is more strategy, than say Hersoscape, so I rate it lower, but it is definetely a better than average game.  I enjoy playing it with my son and I am very glad I have it in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is big on the fun factor, and maybe a little shallow on mechanics, but with the right group it won't matter.   It's too much fun stomping around the country, laying waste to cities, and amassing heavy military units to beat down the opposing monsters.   The Monster Challenge at the end seems like it might be a foregone conclusion, but maybe not always.  Still, for a pure fun game, this is a winner.

RATING: 9
Yes the game does end up with handfuls of dice rolling at the end. Yes that makes it feel anticlimactic. But leading up to the end is such a blast, moving military units around that in the end will end up dead but hopefully slow down your competition. That your monster can end up as a side show in Hollywood is amusing. The different ways monsters play. It is just a fun experience. There are better games in the genre but a better game comes at the cost of accessibility which is one of the highest traits that I want in a game.

I have had the unfortunate privilege of actually playing this "game". Granted it has some interesting ideas, but after playing the main thing in my mind was: "Wait, that was it? Where's the game?"

The game is probably more fun for kids.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) The "mutant monsters conquering America" theme is fantastic. The humour is fantastic. The monster miniatures are fantastic. The gameplay is... not so fantastic. Ah well, you can't have everything in life, and this quintessential piece of Ameritrash is good for a laugh.

This game is hilarious.  You know all those classic and goofy monster movie concepts?  Well they've basically combined all of those into a game.  Of course they changed the names of the monsters to avoid copyright problems, but we'll all be able to figure out some of the classic ones.  The best part is, you get to play as a monster!  So you get to visit various locations in the U.S. and destroy the towns while fighting the military forces.  I think most people will find this game highly enjoyable.

Not BAD per se, but not something I can imagine breaking out again.

Interesting game. 

The monsters felt a little ineffective as they didn't actually do much. We played the combat a little wrong so there were lots of military cards which may have changed the game quite a bit but overall happy I got this played and the b/f seems to enjoy it so this is likely to be played again, although the b/f did say it went on about 30 minutes longer than it needed to.

It is kind of frustrating that your military units can't do too much damage to monsters, and will never be more than a minor annoyance.  And yes, the whole game is essentially a prelude to a final dicefest to determine the winner.  Still, this is just plain fun. If you're one of those who complains about the impossibility of long-term strategy or the amount of randomness, or if you generally take the game too seriously, we will politely, but firmly, ask you to leave.

This game makes me happy. I love launching missiles at enemy monsters. Or becoming the Guard Commander and driving my enemies across the map in the last few turns with my two armies. Very very random at the end – don't play with people who get upset easily. The random ending makes the game short though before playing it gets old. Great components, and all the unique cards and powers add to the feel of the game.

In terms of dice rolling happiness, this game is rendered totally obsolete by King of Tokyo, which in my opinion is in turn rendered obsolete by King of New York. Yahtzee mechanics are way more fun than the totally crapshoot that this game winds up in. Howeover, I will hold onto this game because of the armies you get to command and sic on other players.

Our first play (2-player, one adult & one 13-year-old) went slowly since there are quite a few rules to learn. The rules are pretty simple, though, & were easily remembered for our second game which went more quickly but was still too long. A light wargame, basically. Maybe simply too long for what it is or maybe not great for 2  players? We've ended all our games before the monster challenge...the game is long enough by that point & the challenge seems pointless. My son likes this (first played when he was 13) but I find it tedious so "6" is an average between us. Great monsters & humor in the game so are great for the theme.

Amazingly stupid thematic fun.  Just *try* to play this without making monster noises or SWOOSH for aircraft moving in for their attack run.

Great for kids or for light, quick dice-rolling fun (the 90 minute playtime is as advertised).  Great bits, nice theme, lots of mindless stomp, smash, and killin' action.

Plus, stomping Boston feels GOOD.  I like to imagine Bill Belicheat just quite doesn't make it to his evil bunker in time.

This is a game that hits the sweet spot as far as time invested versus playability.

Plus the frustrations and moments of euphoria experienced when a well planned strategy fails or a desperate last push succeeds is what makes games like this exciting.  Monsters is oozing with theme, and the mechanics are enjoyable for this light wargamey fare.

The end game can be quite a dicefest but the theme is a blast. Though in one 3 player game my wife one and was out of the room except when her turn to move came each round...

A fiddly, hilarious game.  Making the monster sounds should be mandatory.  Feels like I'm playing the old video game Rampage.  As some complain, the ending does feel a little random, but I thought it was ok.  Plays quite quickly.

Gotta say that the shine wore off this one quickly. Sad fact is, this isn't a 'game', its a crap shoot. The military units are a pointless addition, and the complete lack of monster on monster action till the end means that all the board movement could be replaced by random card draws for the exact same effect.

And the end is completely random. Higher hitpoints and infamy tokens alter the probabilities slightly, but you can still easily lose despite any choice you make.

If the kids weren't fans, this one would be on the next trade list I could land it on.

Better then I expected.  Simple system but still leaves room for strategy.  Had fun playing and will play again.  After a few more played I had to knock this down a notch.  It just seems like the end game is done poorly.  You get to this big battle royale at the end where the dice play way more of a role then the amount of 'building' up you did during the main game.  You could be way ahead in the main game only to be defeated by the weakest opponent due to lucky/unlucky rolls.

Somewhat fun.  Not balanced, not strategic but it isn't meant to be serious. 

After a few plays I can't bear to bring it out to the table.  Too many better games out there.  End game slugfest/luckfest is silly and horribly disbalanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game does what it advertises it is supposed to do. Big monsters stomping around killing tanks and destroying towns and so forth.

The end game is a little weird as you stop what you are doing and rush to brawl each other with the monsters. This won't get played a lot with all the other options available for that same time period, but I do want to play it again and see what I think. I definitely enjoyed the first 95% of the game I played in.

RATING: 6.5
A rather enjoyable game. 

MMA is an example of a game where theme is more important than the actual game balance or mechanics. The mutation cards and military advance cards are not all equal and the endgame is a dice fest which sometimes has little to do with the rest of the game.

However, controling giant, rubber suit monsters that stomp on cities is just so much fun that it makes up for all that.

Not a game to be taken seriously but such a fun romp I'll ignore the very serious mechanical flaws.

RATING: 6
Fast, simple, light-hearted game.  Very similar to the original, but the rules have been simplified (believe it or not).  eg. Military branches do not track income, terrain modifiers are eliminated, 2-rounds of combat (not 3), no rolling for military research cards.  I immediately took out the Berserk card; it seemed way too powerful if saved for the final show-down.

Hmmm, not going to rate it yet as I have not actually played it. But I read the rules and set up the board to see how it feels, and I think that there is something missing in it. It seems very light, but at the same time too complex for the lightness. Maybe I'm not understanding something that will reveal itself upon play, but starting to think it may be tough to get enough people interested in trying this one. Oh well, the little monster figures are pretty neat though. And who couldn't use a couple more minature planes, rocket launchers and transports?

Bashing stuff is fun with the right crowd, and the final confrontation can be pretty climactic. The hard part about this is that there is a lot of complexity and length, but the gameplay is pretty light and dicey. Younger boys especially like this one, and people who are young at heart, but bear in mind that most of the enjoyment comes from controling a monster and smashing stuff, not from winning.

Dumbed down and brain-dead revision of the far superior [thing=285][/thing]. Tossed out all the stuff that was interesting (like the Local Heroes rule) in order to 'streamline' play. 

The Disappearing rules are by my definition 'broken' and I have to wonder whether anyone playtested this version. 

On the positive side, many components of this game can be cannibalized for use in Monsters Ravage America...

A light-hearted game with simple rules and the chance to play your favorite movie monster as you romp and stomp across the lower 48.

B-movie fun all-around.

As a fan of giant monster movies such as Godzilla and giant monster video games like Rampage, I couldn't help but buy myself a giant monster board game. As one would expect, it's silly fun, yet still has a bit of depth to it, and I especially like the idea of playing the military as well as the monsters. It makes for a nice little adventure across the country stomping cities and landmarks powering up for the final showdown of semi-epic proportions.

The game looks gorgeous and the minis are top notch, but the game itself is a bit of a mess. A very long build-up to a random dice fest at the end.

People who complain about this game worry me.  It's about monsters destroying America and it comes with lots of dice...  Honestly, wtf did you expect?!  Personally, I have a definite soft spot for it.  MMA is very "beer and pretzles," relies probably 70% on luck, and can be a bit fiddly for what it is, BUT it is high on interaction, very easy to cheer and jeer for, and has enough theme to suffocate from.  I really don't understand why this gets such a bum rap.  Not everything can be Puerto Rico, people.  Some games try to be *fun* every once in a while.

I actually kind of like it. A good mix of ways to enhance your monster while preventing others from doing the same. There's even a positioning battle for the challenger advantage of going first in the monster challenge. The monster challenge reminds me of the battle with the Ancient One at the end of Arkham Horror which we actually tend to enjoy so liking this game is natural.

RATING: 4
It’s a great theme, and the theme is strong and comes out nice for sure, but that is about the best thing and really the only good thing I can say here other than turns are pretty simple.  

WAYYYY too long for what it is, should likely be shortened (easy to do really).  Biggest problem I thought though is the whole game is just trying to build yourself up for a big dicefest battle at the end.  Some are going to love that aspect for sure, its just not a game for me when it takes as long as it does for all that to happen.  Seemed VERY hard to try and defend your bases, this was likely intentional to dissuade turtling but I didn’t like losing precious units because another base got attacked. 

Decisions were not that interesting overall and I’m not sure how much they really matter in the end either.  Its not a high strategy game to be sure I just wonder if its too much the other way, walk around, try to smash things, try to get stronger and then have a big fight at the end.  Likely the perfect game for some, just not myself there are other FAR better games that do this same kind of thing. I have not played King of Tokyo, but I have a feeling it is very similar but WAY better than this.

This game has a lot of factors that make it fun.  The theme is fun, controlling a branch of the military is fun, and destroying cities is especially fun.  However, luck plays such a significant factor in this game. This means there is often a run-away-leader problem and it's very easy for at least one player to be eliminated/completely out of the running.

I do love Avalon Hill. This is certainly not their best title, but it's another stupid fun type game. Mindless city-stomping. :) For us N64 lovers, it could be compared to Rampage: World Tour.

The end is kind of anticlimactic, but fun nonetheless.

A lightly strategic game about destroying the US and killing off giant monsters.  Think "Rampage" in a board game.  It's a riot.  A lot of fun with the right crowd (i.e. a crowd that doesn't mind settling a 2 hour game with the roll of a couple dice) I've had a lot of fun with this one.

While I have enjoyed the games I have played, there are other gamesI would rather play.  It is a good gateway game for kids, especially boys.  Who wouldnt want to be a Big bad monster destroying everything, then have to fight it out against the other monsters for title of baddest monster, and have the chance to be religated to a footnote in Side show history!

Played this for the first time last night in the 2 player version.  We of course had to play King Kong vs Godzilla, me being Godzilla.  The game was still fun 2 player, but is clearly designed to be played with more.  There is just too much ground to cover, so its basically a race to stomp the most stuff and get the most cards, and not as much interaction as one would like.  I was able to get both special characters from research cards, which wasn't as much of an advantage as it would seem, Konk pretty much flattened them quickly, but it did reduce my exposure to harm.  I was able to get one huge attack in on Konk, and send him to Hollywood shortly before the end of the game, and yet I still went into the final challenge at a disadvantage, health-wise.  Fortunately, I had save 5 infamy, and was able to pummel Konk in the first round of the challenge despite going second.  We had a good time, but I think I would rate this one slightly higher with a full or mostly full table.

It seems too short. More stomping and more military unit pieces would be a good. I also do not like the end game being a roll off. I could be the strongest monster around and because I roll a series of 1's I lose?

Rating based on 2 player game.  I think this game would be best with 4 players.  Don't play this if you are looking for a test of strategy either as their are many varying effects in this game that really don't balance out the game...particularly with the mutations and army research cards.

RATING: 3
Great idea, poor execution. Fights between giant monsters shouldn't be so boring. I understand the military isn't SUPPOSED to be that effective, but in that case, why pretend it is? Why give the military units stats at all if they're just meant to be speed bumps? There's a fun game somewhere in here, but I don't know if it's worth excavating.

Great reissue of Monsters Ravage America.  Fun, lightweight game full of old movie monsters, though where is the giant flying turtle piece?  (Gamera is a friend to children!).  Makes me wish someone would reissue The Creature That Ate Sheboygan with cool pieces, a new map and tuned- up rules.

A semi-letdown. I like the dice-fest that it is, it's just a bit slow. The military seems almost useless to boot. It oozes flavor though.

This game is awful. It truly is a terrible game and an utter waste of time.

The dice-rolling combat mechanism is akin to a worse Risk, if that's even possible; stomping various places throughout the game is non-climatic; the redeployment seems broken to me; the game is dull; and once you get to the point where the monsters battle each other, well, it just sucks. It's a boring, poorly-designed game that hopefully signals another death knell for Avalon Hill. 

I wish I could have the two hours of my life back that I wasted with this attrocity.

RATING: 6
I think this title gets a bit of a bad rap. It's not that great of a game but it's not that bad either. Good for a few laughs and fun with dice chucking when you're in the mood. It does seem as if the military are nothing more than minor annoyances than a real danger other than the cruise missiles. They do serve an important purpose of keeping an opponent at somewhat reasonable level though.

RATING: 5
This is potentially a very fun game. The theme is cool, as is the concept of crushing stuff to level up, and the components are fantastic - I particularly love how the armies are so small compared to the giant monsters. Unfortunately, I think the game is hampered by some balancing issues. The military deck seems to be far more powerful than deploying units, so it is quickly exhausted. Conversely, the mutation deck varies wildly in terms of powers, with some being almost useless, while others are extremely powerful. In the one game we played, one lucky player drew a +1 defense mutation (which halves the chance of that monster being hit), which made the final roll-off showdown rather lopsided. I don't mind a bit of chaos in my games, but I don't like when balancing issues determine victory, rather than the players.

RATING: 4.5
A fun, humorous theme, but it has Dice Rolling and Variable Player Powers, which happen to be things I don't typically care for too much in games.  Looking up attack points, defense points, etc. and then rolling dice to see who takes damage and how much, oh, but I have this special card... etc. etc..  Repeat for 90 minutes.  I just find it monotonous and it's hard not to feel like we could have just skipped the process by rolling a dice once: highest roll wins the game :)Having said that - if you like American style games such as this, it does have a fun theme and great bits.

I came for the awesome monster minis and stayed for what turned out to be a really fun game. The theme is the highlight, but there's a lot under the hood, too -- multiple paths to victory; genuine rewards for good strategy, even in the face of poor dice rolls; and an enjoyably different game every time you play.

Monsters involves more chance than I usually enjoy, but it's washed out by how much other cool stuff is going on at any given point in the game, and how satisfying it is even when you lose.

Only played two separate two-player games so far.  It's an enjoyable bit of fluff, and I feel it would really shine with a full complement of players, with monsters and military units zooming all over the board.  For now, in my limited experience, it's cool but not as great as I'd hoped.  I'll probably update my rating once I play it in a larger group.

Well, I've played a few four player games, and I raised my rating from a 6 to a 7.  Definitely a lot more fun with more monsters and more military units zipping around the board.  A lot more competition and goofiness.

I bought this for my son and it was the perfect gift for him.  He loves monsters and likes the idea of them fighting and stomping towns and cities, a là Ultraman or Jaspion.  The components are excellent and the game itself is good at showing how wimpy humans are (though the robots they construct can actually win the game if they are left standing).  The rules need work, but really this is a game to be played for the fun and the theme, not a euro.  For that purpose, it delivers.

Love the theme.  Love the presentation.  Lukewarm about the game so far.  Maybe I should play it with an older crew?  The end game face-off is rather silly, but what part of the game isn't?  It took a little while to get rolling along with younger kids, but they haven't seen as many giant monster movies as I have.  The split-personality of running "part" of the military versus everyone else was a little difficult to grok for them right off the bat.  Much of the "strategy" options didn't start to sink in until late in the game.  Combat mechanics seemed a little clunky and awkward to me, but then again, my crew of kids were not really deploying units, but trying to stock up on the wacky Military Research and Mutation cards first and foremost.

You're a monster.  The goal of the game is to arm yourself for the big monster-end-game-battle.  You can mutate, gain extra dice actions (infamy) and earn military research.  There's something here but it just seems like to be competitive you'll need to just really concentrate on the end-game which may mean less smashing and confrontation (in other words playing it safe).  As a beer and pretzels game I think it probably accomplishes what it sets out to do.

Light, cheesy fun. We always have a great time destroying cities and roadside attractions (like Carhenge & The World's Biggest Ball Of Yarn!) At the end of it, though, it was either too complex, or not complex enough - too complex to be the light and humorous it ought to be since the added maneuvering of military units slowed the game down and sucked out all the fun, not complex enough to offer any truly meaningful strategic choices. And that after strategizing the whole game toward a victory you can be beaten by the last-place player who rolls lucky in the final fight show down really does speak to the weakness of the game.

It sounded great when I first saw it, but now I must admit that it disappointed me a little.

I like the tongue in cheek nature of the game and it's honest fun if you are in the mood, but it simply lacks depth and is a little too simple for it's own good sometimes. Plays better with four/five players.

A dudes on a map game from the Hasbro Avalon Hill division.

Each player takes on the role of a monster from classic B-Grade movies and then goes about moving across America and destroying cities and towns for victory points. Think Rampage the video game on a map (before Rampage was released! :D)

It's so so but the big problem here is that it overstays its welcome badly as the leader can be hauled back by sending the army and airforce after enemy monsters and some of the card play is pretty chaotic.

Rating of 7 is with lots of beer and pretzels - as this game is meant to be played. Without these needed components (unfortunately not included), I don't know how I'd rate it. It's just a big fun stupid dicefest, and I like that from time to time.

Great game, don't take it too seriously or try finding deep strategies here. Have fun smashing the US, attacking other monsters and hoping the dice decide to favor you in the final battle (remember to make good use of your monster's battle cry, it helps!)

RATING: 5
A very light game.  It's okay as a filler game.  Best played after a heavy weight game to somewhat refresh you up for another game.  It's pretty hokey, which I believe is completely intentional, and does have some good humor in it.  The military units are pretty worthless until the second half of the game.  Even then, you get a few, but they just don't seem to do much against opponents.  Feels somewhat cumbersome moving them around.  Almost somewhat of an afterthought.  Although moving the monsters around and stomping the crap out of things can be entertaining and funny.  Just don't look for anything deep in the game, because it flatly isn't there.  It's mostly luck.  Beer and pretzels game.

Ugh! Terrible game play - little suspense, little character interaction, monsters not well differentiated, and the single worst endgame we've ever experienced. The monster movie fans in our group were the most displeased with the game. After play, I couldn't think of one positive thing I liked about the game. A pity, as we were looking forward to something light and enjoyable.

If you like the theme of Monsterpocalypse but don't feel like investing in a collectible game then you should definitely give this one a try.  It's a little less "intimate" than Monsterpocalypse, since it involves a map of the U.S. rather than individual destructible cities, but it should fulfill any giant monster vs giant monster vs army cravings you might have.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The theme sounds fun, and the monster miniatures are cool but there's not much of a game here. 

For the first 90 minutes you roam around with your monster, stomping cities and trying to collect hit points, reroll tokens, and special powers. At the same time, you try to use your military units to slow down your opponents. 

This part might make a decent light game, but no: Everything done during the first 90 minutes is rendered meaningless, since it all comes down to the final showdown. For the last five minutes you chuck dice against your opponents, one at a time. The last one standing is the winner. The hit points collected during the game help marginally but it really is just a coin toss.

A worthless timesink, way way too long.

Selbstverständlich kann jeder einzelne von uns jederzeit problemlos damit aufhören, sich andauernd Brettspiele einzukaufen. Jaja, ist schon klar. Wer sich aber ganz insgeheim doch ein klitzekleines Problemchen in Hinblick auf den betriebenen Zeit- und Geldaufwand für sein Hobby eingestehen möchte, und unauffällig doch nach einem Spiel sucht, das ihn von seinem Verhaltensmuster entwöhnt, der kann es ja einmal mit Monsters Menace America probieren. Ich kenne da ein paar richtig eisenharte Eurogamer, die man mit einem solchen Spiel geradezu traumatisieren könnte. Das Spiel ist nämlich kompletter Müll. Lupenreiner, kompromissloser Ameritrash. Wer also mit dieser Richtung schon mal so gar nichts anfangen kann, der lese hier besser nicht weiter. Ich meins ernst. 
Alleine schon der Titel ist eigentlich ist schon so unfassbar geil, dass ich dieses Ding vor einiger Zeit praktisch blind gekauft habe: "Monsters Mencae America - A Game of Mayhem and Mass Destruction". Mann, das klingt doch mal nach was! Dagegen solche Langeweiler-Namen wie "Istanbul" oder "Sankt Petersburg" oder [ hier den Namen einer Stadt oder Insel einfügen ]...? Der Titel kann so jedenfalls mühelos konkurrieren mit anderen grandiosen Namensgebungen wie "Road Kill Rally", "Chainsaw Warrior", "Car Wars" oder "Zombicide".
Auf dem Cover zertrampelt ein gigantischer Dino mit blutunterlaufenen Augen gerade den Space-Needle-Tower von Seattle, während er einen Personenzug als Armband um die linke Pranke wickelt. Um ihn herum wuseln Panzer und Düsenjäger durch Explosionswände, und im Hintergrund ebnet ein wandelnde Riesenaugapfel mit aus ihm herausschießenden Energieblitzen die Landschaft ein... Woohooo! 
In der Schachtel haben wir Plastikspielfiguren, selbstverständlich. Zum einen wären da die sechs zur Verfügung stehenden Monster einschließlich dem auf dem Cover abgebildeten Augapfelmutantending, von dem wir anhand des Monsterbogens erfahren, dass es "Zorb" heißt, aus dem Weltraum kommt -- nämlich vom Planeten Opticus(!) Omega --, den Kriegsschrei "zrEEor" von sich gibt und in der Area 51 mit radioaktiver Strahlen behandelt wurde, was seine leicht abnorme Riesengröße bedingt. Außerdem haben einen Haufen Panzer, Flugzeuge, Cruise Missiles , Raketenwerfer und Atom-U-Boote. Letztere allerdings leider nicht als Plastikfigur. Sehr Schade.
So. Wir haben also schon mal den passenden Titel, Amerika im Krieg, Plastik-Monster, Plastik-Panzer... was fehlt uns noch im Ensemble der Grundeigenschaften des genreechten Ameritrash-Spiels? Genau. Würfel! Kein AT-Spiel ohne Würfel! Davon hat es leider nur mickrige drei Stück im Spiel, aber die sind dafür schön giftgrün-goldig, gerade so, als ob sie auch ein bisschen zu lange in der Area 51 mit radioaktiven Strahlen behandelt worden wären.

So, und jetzt?
Als Spieler übernehmen wir nun je ein Monster und versuchen im Folgenden, Amerika möglichst rabiat kaputtzumachen. Warum, weiß kein Mensch. Sobald Amerika kaputt ist, hauen wir uns noch gegenseitig auf den Sack, bis nur noch einer übrige bleibt. Warum, das weiß auch kein Mensch. 
Das war's. 
...halt nein, das Militär! Jeder von uns steuert aus ebenso unerfindlichen wie wunderbaren Gründen auch noch jeweils einen Teil des Militärs, und hetzt es den anderen Monstern auf den Hals. Dabei erforscht und baut das Militär im Laufe des Spiels Riesenmonstereinheiten wie Captain Collosal (der dann als Plastikfigur aufs Spielbrett kommt), während auch die Monster immer infamer werden und bei Beschuss zuweilen unverhofft mutieren.

Meinung
Ich habe einmal ein Interview mit Uwe Rosenberg gehört, in dem dieser sinngemäß sagte, es sei ein Grundprinzip seiner Designphilosophie, die Spieler etwas aufbauen zu lassen, weil dies im Spieler ein gutes Gefühl erzeuge. Good Vibrations für Alle, sozusagen. Das mag schon sein, bei IWdZ geht es mir auch so; aber manchmal -- eigentlich ziemlich oft, wenn es um Brettspiele geht -- sehe ich das total anders: Ich will lieber Dinge einreißen. Ja, ich gebe es zu: Ich bin der Typ, der sich gerne auch mal Videos von Hochhaussprengungen ankuckt. Ich habe einfach Spaß an Krawall- und Kampfspielen. Ich lasse gerne Panzer in der Gegend herumfahren und Monster Städte zertrampeln. Von daher ist dieses Spiel genau mein Ding. Grundsätzlich.
Das Spiel grottenschlecht, total hirnlos und zugleich unglaublich geil. Selbstverständlich muss jeder Spieler immer seinen Kriegsschrei ausstoßen, wenn er eine Stadt vernichtet, und keinesfalls sollte man vergessen, beim Abfeuern einer Rakete "wwwusch!" zu sagen und "KA-WUMM!" beim Einschlag. Ein bisschen Taktik steckt auch darin. Es ist nicht weltbewegend viel, doch gerade genug, um über die ca. 1,5h zu unterhalten. Viel wichtiger ist natürlich, den führenden Spieler immer geschlossen zu attackieren. Bei dieser Spielweise levelt sich das Spiel immer wieder aus und bleibt spannend. Man kann das als gemobbte Anführer mit der richtigen Taktik etwas abmildern, aber insgesamt darf man so ein Spiel nicht ernst nehmen.
Bei dieser Gelegenheit will ich einmal einen größeren Bogen schlagen zu einer kurzen Sammlung grundlegenden Unterschieden der Prioritäten beim Spieldesign. Ich würde sagen, mit unserem deutschen Familienspiel und dem daraus erwachsenen German Game (nicht aber der modernen schweren Euros) sehen wir in aller Regel folgende Zielsetzung verfolgt: Das Spiel soll für jeden spielbar sein, in der Familie also vom Kind bis zu den Großeltern. Das Thema soll dem Spieler ermöglichen, intuitiv die Regeln zu verstehen und darf keinesfalls anstößig sein. Interaktionen sollten immer konstruktiv sein und keinesfalls Aggressionen erzeugen.
Das moderne Eurogame spricht dagegen eher den Denker und Stratege an, der gerne immer und allzeit die Kontrolle über den Spielablauf behalten möchte, der ausgefeilte Mechanismen schätzt (und zuweilen einen kuriosen Mechanismen-Fetisch entwickelt), der Glückselemente, Königsmacherei und Leaderbashen verabscheut und die Herausforderung des intellektuellen Kräftemessens liebt. 
All das kann man von Monsters Menace Amerika nicht erwarten. Weder kann es den Familienspieler, noch den Eurogamer ansprechen, vom Wargamer ganz zu schweigen. Das Spiel ist sehr einfach, glückslastig, destruktiv und konfrontativ. Das Thema ist anstößig, weil gewaltverherrlichend (oder zumindest gewaltverharmlosend), und spricht dabei doch fast niemanden außer minderjährige Jungs ab dem Alter von vielleicht 10 oder 12 an, und um an diesem Spiel Spaß zu haben, muss man es womöglich aus so spielen wie ein 10-jähriger. Für den Erwachsenen Spieler ist dieses Spiel eigentlich zu primitiv und infantil, auch in Bezug auf die grafischen Gestaltung mit ihren einfachen Zeichnungen und grellen Farben. Ich achte sehr auf solche Dinge, und auch in dieser Beziehung ist MMA einfach kindisch. Das macht mir nicht viel aus, aber wie bereits gesagt: Man muss man MMA schon als Beer-and-Pretzel-Game verstehen, denn selbstverständlich fallen auch mir auf Anhieb mindestens fünf andere Spiele ein, die von der Grundausrichtung her betrachtet in eine ähnliche Richtung gehen, aber taktisch/strategisch wesentlich interessanter und somit ernst zu nehmen sind. 
MMA ist einfach Trash. Waschechter Ameritrash mit der Betonung auf "Trash". Man spielt als Erwachsener ein solches Spiel irgendwo  aus demselben Grund, aus dem man sich grottige Kung-Fu-Filme aus den Siebzigern, oder natürlich japanische Monsterfilme a la "King Kong - Frankensteins Sohn" anschaut: Weil sie schrottig, aber sympathisch sind. Was im Filmbereich ein "B-Movie" ist, ist im Brettspielbereich ein Spiel wie dieses. MMA gehört in die selbe Kategorie wie ein Flying-Frog-Spiel mit seiner unterirdisch schlechten Soundtrack-CD und den schrecklichen Photoshop-Grafiken. Cooles Thema, stimmungsvoll, unterhaltsam, klischeebehaftet, mechanisch und dramatisch eher durchwachsen, aber unverwässert und liebenswert.
Für eine BGG-10 ist das also leider nicht genug. Abgesehen von der fehlenden Tiefe muss ich diesem ansonsten großartigen Spiel leider auch noch einige Sympathiepunkte dafür abziehen, dass die Cruise Missiles der Marine und der Air Force nicht mit Atombomben bestückt sind. Das ist sehr schade, denn das Spiel fühlt sich so einfach nicht komplett an. So bleibt nach dieser ersten Partie leider nur eine BGG-6

RATING: 7
I got this game prior to Christmas 2006 for my then 7-year-old. Lots of problems with the rules. Although for the most part the rules aren't badly written, the layout of the rules book features sidebars that interrupt the flow of the rules and make it harder for one to digest them all. There are also some places where the rules are unclear or unaddressed, too. Had to do a lot of checking in various places for answers. (The game is rated for ages 12 and up, but younger kids can easily be taught how to play.) The theme is fun, the board and the pieces are terrific (six monsters about 2-3" high apiece; miniature jets, missiles, subs, tanks, rocket-launchers), and there is more to the strategy for this game than first appears. Many have complained about the final portion of the game, "Monster Challenge," and that it seems tacked-on. I understand why they feel this way, but I can only say, look at the theme and keep in mind this a fairly lightweight game that should be played with a major dose of fun in mind, and roll with that feeling. Not to say one has to like it on its own merits, but "Monsters Menace America" has enough going for on the fun side to overcome many of the drawbacks I mention above. I do wonder if it was rushed into production, as perhaps incorporating certain monster strengths for the Monster Challenge would have made it more rewarding than simply a succession of plain dice rolls to decide the game. In that sense it's frustrating to think this game could have been great rather than flawed-but-fun. I give it an extra half-point simply for being so much fun to play plus the bits. Trevor, my 10-year-old (as of 2009), rates this one a  10. If I had to rate it strictly on its own merits, it would probably be "6" because it seems to me the end-game wasn't properly play-tested and feels unsatisfying--but on the other hand, the game drips with theme and an overall attitude of fun and silliness that for me the latter compensates. Not particulary good as a 2-player game either, due to the size of the board and the many card or placement options available, so I'd recommend people play with 4 participants.

What a game! We don't always play this game, but when it comes out it scratches that itch perfectly! So, you want to be one of the great old-film grade B monsters (the Blob, Godzilla etc.) and you might also like to be the army, navy, air force, marines, or national guard attacking and trying to defeat said huge monster! Well...why not be both! Send your army to kill your opponents huge monster while sending your monster to destroy another part of the USA! And how about a great battle between both monsters for achieving the ultimate Monster victory! Yes...that's what it's all about! So good!

Really enjoyed the pieces. cards, and board!  But first play was 2-player with my wife and it was not good.

Excellent theme, dated mechanics, broken end-game. It's a shame it isn't better because this should be an entertaining 1 hour game.
The problem is that the endgame is just a dice off and the outcome is weighted too heavily towards this, so the last hour you just played building up was largely irrelevant.

Ok, I admit it.  When I first got this, I was expecting something silly, and fun.  And I got something silly and fun.  But there really isn't a lot of depth here.

Well, it seemed a good idea at the time but the military is very weak, even the big military units die off easily.

Got to play at our Tuesday night meet. I figured out afterward that it is better the surround the cities with units because win or lose, the monster can't stomp the city. Then if you have the units you can counter-attack for a card.

Cool bits and a pretty good game.  I was worried about its length and that the battles would be clunky and too long.  The length is excellent and battles are short.

Awesome theme with masses of dice rolling. Perhaps limited on skill or planning, but good fun nevertheless. The whole game basically revolves around trying to earn slight advantages for the final dice-filled battle which determines the winner.

This game has a great theme.  I would have liked a little more monster rampage and a little less war game, but it was okay.

I find it jarring to my sense of immersion in the theme when I have to play both the "Good Guys" (military) and the "Bad Guys" (monsters).  I tend to focus less on the placement of the military and try and destroy stuff with my monster.  This tactic will not win you the game as balance is required.

A wierd game. The military is by far too week to really have a difference. You need to be massed for it to make more than a dent. The end was a showdown, which was fun.

Squisha! SQUISHA!!  There goes Pittsburg!!  For people who can get into the theme and the spirit of it, this is one helluva fun game whether you're a slime monster trying to slurp up Seattle, or the U.S. army valiantly trying to stop Kong from crushing Cleveland.  The great thing is, you get to do both during the same game.  Plus, there's tactics, there's strategy, there's player competition and cooperation, and there's... OH NO!! THERE GOES SAN DIEGO!!  LAUNCH THE NUKES, IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE!!  I can't predict replayability past 20 games, but I definitely want to play this a second time, as soon as possible. (Update: it kinda sucks with just 2 players, especially if one player gets certain deadly card combinations.  It's WAY more fun with 4.)

The theme is ok, stomping cities with your monster is fun, but luck is the dominant factor here. Army unit don't stand a chance against the monsters except when they attack in masses which is difficult to achieve. Endgame is all about luck.

Add at least 3 to the rating if you're playing with boys aged 6-14 (or older men regressing to that age!). The game play is simple and luck driven. The options are pretty balanced so I think it doesn't matter too much what you do. However it will always end in a dramatic tussle where anyone can win, the miniature monsters are cool, and it doesn't last too long (

A very fun, light game that's reasonably quick to learn and play. Suffers from a problematic endgame that gives too much advantage to the first challenger.

RATING: 6
This game is definitely a fun romp - there's something about destroying your home town with a giant sludge monster that is just kind of funny.  The end battle is somewhat anti-climatic, but the game is more about having a laugh than about winning, at least for me.  Fun game, based on one play with four players.

2 player game was disappointingly flat, pretty pointless. I can see 4 player being more fun with people in the right mood for it. Maybe three player controlling two monsters each?

Will try to hang onto this until my son (currently 3) is old enough to play. At the moment he LOVES playing with the monsters and tanks - who can blame him? so do I - but there really isn't enough game there for full adult attention. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Based on one play, it played very well. The pieces are neat, the game plays well with four players and you can win with different strategies. Overall a solid 7, because I had the impression, the last challenge was too much luck based and had not much to do with the main part of the game. In other words: I didn't really accomplish very much during the game, but had some good mutations and dice luck and won in the end against all the more successful players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excelent fun game in which players develop their monsters and get in the way of the ones of their rivals in order to be the best in a final dice match.  Quick, easy, intuitive, fun and with the best bits around.  If you are short of time and want to play a game with an adventure feel, grab [i]Monsters Menace America[/i] and enjoy.  This should be a classic and certainly one of the best that I've tried from the new Avalon Hill.

Blah. There doesn't seem to be much interaction on the map, and the military is a joke. The monsters all look good, though I wonder why they didn't paint the military monsters. This will probably be a big hit with kiddos, though. (Not my kiddos, of course, as they have taste.)

This is like Marvel Heroes but moreso - I dreamed of greatness and didn't get it. It has too little depth to last as long as it does. If it had a few more options or lasted about fifteen minutes less, it would get a much higher rating.

This game is kind of fun to play, but I keep feeling like the rules need some tweaking, particularly at the end of the game. I've written two alternate rule sets and have yet to find a satisfying way to end the game with a Monster Melee that's actually FUN.

The bits are beautiful, and I love the art style. I just wish the game was more consistently fun.

RATING: 8
Hard to find out of print AH title, but very entertaining family challenge style game. Box indicates it is for ages 12 and up but our 8 year old did not have difficulty comprehending the rules, grasping the strategy and making competitive moves for both her monster and military units. Grab a copy if you can still find this for a reasonable price.

RATING: 6
A fun game, but the "showdown" at the end, where the game is actually determined, is kind of a let-down as the gameplay, which was previously quite interesting (attack the enemy monster? mutate? stomp a city? Use your radioactive field to destroy enemy tanks?) is reduced to simply rolling dice over and over again until a certain number of "successes" is reached.  This makes it feel like a really good TV show or movie where the producers ran out of money and had to wrap the show/series up rapidly in a lousy fashion.

This is one of the silliest games in my collection. I bought it completely on a whim one day and after playing it once I like it well enough but it's not great.

I enjoy playing it just for the theme but I have a hard time convincing others to play it with me.

Rating based on one play. I'd like to give this another try - with four players rather than three - and then reconsider my rating. As this was our first game, I don't think we were very aware of the relative values of different actions we could take. Lot's of dice rolling, but the theme is cool.

Received for under $23; at that price game is worth it. Monster pieces are decent, and have the same smell as the AH Nexus Ops game. Components are sturdy.

RATING: 6
Aaaargh! I am really torn about this game. The components are brilliant and the game seems, at first glance, like a good one. Many comments here are complaints about the anticlimactic end-game monster challenge: I'm not enamoured of the implementation, but a climactic royal rumble is a pretty great conclusion to a light game. The real problem is that everything leading up to said climactic royal rumble can run too long and is comparatively tedious.

My first thought was: wow, it's like Richard Garfield stole the only fun part of this game to make King of Tokyo. 

I really [i]want[/i] to like the game, but I think I've been a bit blinded thinking of it as a light wargame. It isn't: it's a race game where the military units are there to distract and inconvenience your opponents -- think caltrops dropped from Dick Dastardly's car. Played right, it should be fast and furious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very good theme play.  Game very easy to learn and play.  Play is OK, no interesting mechanics.  D6 combat system.  The militaries are virtually useless, unless a player gets lucky and draws a useful military card.  Mutations along the same lines.  There are a few very powerful abilities which can really tip the balance in your favor if you draw them.   Monster fight was nothing special, seemed tacked on and will most likely be a forgone conclusion.  Components excellent - mounted board, plastic playing pieces and durable cards with very good artwork.  Game length short at a little over an hour.

[4 plays] Got this for my son (8) as a gift.  He immediately loves it.  I found the game amusing and fun, really it was a great game to play against my son.  Some decision making but clearly enough luck anyone could win, plus a great theme as well.  The end sometimes just feels a little anti-climactic.  All of sudden just stop destroying cities and battle each other to the death.  I have played two players twice and three player once.  Really two player doesn't seem like the monster challenge works as good.  Maybe the whole monster challenge thing will "feel" better if there was more than two monsters.  Overall we liked and look forward to playing it again.

This game was a lot of fun, stomping around the board with my monster and interfereing with other players with the military; until the end game.

The monster challenge comes down to who is the luckiest with the dice.  While this can be controlled to a small extent by preparing your monster better, even when you win, it's tedious.

Update:  I've played this 4 times now and that's enough for the rest of my life.  I will only play again is because my 9 year son likes it.

Not exactly like playing a board game, but a fun way to spend time anyway. I give it such a high rating mostly because the quality of bits, and especially because of the production quality of the rule book. All rules should be done like this!! I would play this game more often than I can get others to play it.

A fair bit of fun in a game that plays quickly. I don't believe that you can devise a clever plan here and see it through, but you can experience the fun to be had from drawing a cool card (especially when you really need it) and/or crushing an opponent with some great rolls. All of this on a board with monsters and military units spread across it.

Each player is one of six Giant Monsters, stomping across a map of the USA in search of cities to destroy. The monsters run the gamut from the classic (enormous lizards and gargantuan apes) to the slightly more unconventional (giant walking eyeball), and each has its own set of attributes and powers.

Ingeniously, everyone also controls an arm of the military, which can be used to attack and weaken the other monsters on the board. It's a losing battle for the militia -- monsters can wipe out military bases and reduce the total number of forces available to each player -- but you can get a few good licks in early in the game.The battle escalates until the 20th city is reduced to rubble. At that time, all the monsters duke it out in a free-for-all, mano-a-clawo Monster Challenge; when the dust settles, the last monster standing is declared the winner.

Really wanted to like this game (theme and components are brilliant!), but couldn't. I really tried. After 18 years of gaming, it made me feel like I was thrown back to the start of my hobby. Like games had not progressed at all during that time. But I am sure they have. The game is not horrible...it just feels terribly dated and unexciting.

RATING: 6
A decent B-move game. I gotta say I am really drawn to the mechanical idea of the game, where everyone is upgrading their monster to duke it out at the end in a big brawl. It's a bonus that the upgrading process is it's own little tactical game. Sure, there are some implementation mistakes and the game is pretty random, but it's fun enough for what it is.

Most of the game elements are fun and the pieces are neat, but the endgame was rather disappointing. I was expecting something out of the classical monster movie that all monsters fight each other ala King of the Monsters. When the challenge gets to choose to use all their attacks and use most of their infamy before you get a chance to do anything makes waiting the eighty minutes irksome.  I personally think it should be done in volleys and all monsters houdl fight and would appreciate such a version and would suggest that if I ever play again.

This is a good game for kids but there wasn't enough there to keep my interest.  The parts are kind of nice but the game lacks depth.  Basically you trounce around the board collecting health until enough cities have been trampled and then one by one you pair off against other players in a dice shoot out.  There some military stuff thrown in but it's mostly a nuisance.  Ah and just for fun throw in a couple of cards which can greatly shift the balance of power in the end game.

RATING: 5
Sometimes you need something light, luck-driven and themey, and this game scratches that itch very well.  Note that I said "sometimes" and not "often."  Serious gamers, don't waste your time, as you will be frustrated by the lack of control and meandering gameplay.  But it's pretty and entertaining, and it's a great way to catch the eye of non-gamers.  Is it innovative?  Nah.  Is it deep?  No, not really.  Is it balanced?  Probably not.  Is it entertaining?  With the right group, yes.  Don't bother bringing it out to your serious game group, this game is all fluff.  Strangely, this is probably best with two players, although you lose some of the epic group monster face-off feeling that you get with more players.

Theme abounds.  My son and I have great fun smashing the pathetic military and defenseless cities.  The endgame is somewhat lacking, however.  We build up our monsters over the course of the game, and then... what?  Roll dice?  Erm, ok.

This game is a lot LESS fun than it sounds. You'd think that giant B-movie monsters stomping across America and smashing stuff would be more entertaining. Well, the destruction is so abstract that you might as well be moving your monster around Candyland and picking up gum drops. The only part that is mildly interesting is controlling the armed forces and researching technologies to stop your opponents' monsters. All that is pretty insignificant though, as the grand finale consists of teleporting all the monsters into one space and then letting them fight it out. They do this by taking turns rolling dice until one of them is knocked out. It's an unbelievably lame ending for the 2 hours of effort you just put into it.

This is not the Godzilla game you're looking for. Now move along...

This would be an awesome 15 minute filler, but it's fairly intolerable at 90. There are very few decisions to be made, and the endgame is literally roll the dice until someone wins.

The bits are cool, but now that King of Tokyo exists, I don't think there's any reason to play this.

This is good retarded fun. If you take the goofy premise of this game too seriously, you WILL not have a good time with it.

Another one of them there American style games with bags of theme, but a rules set that leaves a lot to be desired. I think a few rules changes would make this a much better game. If I think of any, I'll let you know.

Very nice bits, goofy, simply gameplay and engaging theme. But all the fun of the game is unraveled by the horribly imbalanced and wholly luck-driven final monster standoff... A revision including some sort of Victory Point or "Best 2 of 3 Categories" scoring (between Infamy, Medals, Health or stats like that) would have been preferable. Will probably need to make house rules to adjust the endgame to increase its replay/strategic value.

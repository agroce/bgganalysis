I really enjoy this game. The rules took some time to get accustomed to, but after a couple of missions, they clicked into place for me. I still occasionally refer to the rulebook if I forget a particular term or specific mechanic, but I've read it enough to know exactly where to find it, so it doesn't bother me much. Also, I love the mission variety. The Candlepoint missions, though fairly generic, do a good job of both introducing the game's mechanics and giving you a taste of each of the various factions that you will encounter should you play the expansions. Right now, I'm in the middle of the Skinwalkers missions, and it already feels like the training wheels are off. The baddies hit harder, but the gifts and fragments I can obtain are also stronger. Also, the Lunacy mechanic is a fun additional mechanic on top of everything else in Skinwalkers. Getting more Lunacy means that some of my gifts and fragments are more powerful, but some of the enemies have abilities that are more harsh toward players with higher Lunacy. It just adds another factor to weigh in toward your decisions that I enjoy. Overall, I like the game. The rules could be clearer, and it definitely opens up more for multiple-player groups as opposed to solo players, but I would definitely suggest others give it a shot.

Abstract:
A more deeper, refined version of the cooperative Pathfinder the Card Game: on your turn, draw a card, see what it is, decide what card you want to play to roll dice to beat it (roll and resolve). 

+ Theme (dark gothic)
+ At its core, easy gameplay
+ Number of combinations and effects of cards
+ App tells you, what happens in the game world which temporarily changes the rules of the game.
- Rules book (well written with all edge cases, but not if you want to learn the game)
- Wrong links in the glossary of the rules book
- Too easy (no actual difficulty levels - scaling comes from playing through additional stories)

Thoughts:
Roll and resolve is not my favorite mechanic.

While this game is fantastic, the instructions SUCK. First, when reading thru the rulebook, change all funky words to basic English. That helps. Then remember the promise you made love ones to never harm yourself as you'll likely want to poke your eyes out as you dive into the Internet and find you aren't alone and not many have mastered it enough to help.  The creator is great at having posted corrections but it's not fun searching for them. There is one great video out there, (I'll post a link soon as I recall and recover from the madness.) BUT I did decipher the game rules myself with great frustration. So you can, too.  Give yourself two FULL DAYS. 

Once I did, I very much enjoyed the game.  Although I am convinced the reason "rage" and "soul" is used in the game as virtues would be because the game sucks your "soul" out of you during initial setup and play-through due to extreme "rage".  And I am a rather mild tempered, calm red head. Make of this what you will.

I rate it a 7 because I can not in good faith suggest it until a better rulebook is produced and distributed.  The game itself isn't that complicated, so there's zero reason for this situation. I'd normally give it an 8-8.5 but if a person can't pick up the game and play by a rulebook, it's impossible to recommend it.  Too bad, too, because I'd be gifting it for Christmas gifts if not the case.  I just don't want to spend hours explaining to others nor hear lies "oh I was gonna play it but the dryer caught fire and when I went to call 9-11, a spark from downstairs drifted upstairs and burned my Apocrapha game. Set it afire in a flash, but strangely didn't so much as mar my table. The oddest things happen to me, CyLee.  The oddest things!"

I’ve been a gamer for years and have managed to decrypt some of the most confusing rule books and mechanics, but this game is the most unnecessarily confusing set of rules and symbols I’ve ever seen. I can’t even figure out why the non-basic cards are better then the basic ones, let alone which cards are therefore worth committing more resources toward gaining. Also, every card has keywords at the bottom that awards bonus dice when the card you play matches a keyword on your character, or maybe when your character matchs a keyword on the card your facing, or maybe when a card your facing matches a keyword on the card you play, or maybe when a card your facing matches a skill of a player giving you bonus dice sitting in a position three spaces clockwise with a matching fragment in their halo... maybe none of that, or maybe all of that, either way this game’s main goal seems to be promoting confusion....

Kickstarted (a long time ago!) Finally arrived, was it worth the wait ... ?
Yes and no. :/

It is a re-skin of pathfinder and there are some improvements here I like and some stuff I'm not so keen on. I don't hate it, but without previously having played Pathfinder I think I'd have been baffled as the rulebook is a mess :(
Oh, and it's tried to be too clever with keywords - they're everywhere with no reminder text, so best you learn 'em or be forced back to that awful rulebook :(

This keyword approach also makes setting up the scenarios feel like a logic puzzle, maybe that makes that element fun for some, for me it's just a pain, why they couldn't have explained it in the quest book I don't know :(

Moans aside, I like the setting and the switch from polyhedral dice to regular D6's - and that your stats are mirrored in your deck construction, that's neat. Art is good and get past the 'what does this do/mean' bafflement of cards and rulebook and the game is pretty solid.

If you hated pathfinder then probably avoid this - as it's similar enough.

Oh, and my enter here deck was misprinted - cards seem the wrong way round, bend the wrong way and stand out when mixed with the rest, which makes spotting the minion 1-4 cards easy in the 10 card nexus decks :( Got sent a replacement deck, exactly the same issue :( :(

Oh my. Pathfinder was fun, and one would think that the successor should be improved. This time, this isn't the case. No more items, obly 4 different gift types. No class sheets. Fragments sound cool, but the actual fragments are rather boring/limited. Near to none character evolution/progression. Laughable difficulty. Few actual decisions. Very very strange stories/writing style. Hard to comprehend for non native speakers, but even if more easy those wouldn't be my style at all. 
Always all characters at the same location, assisting like hell, mutations most time don't matter at all.
12 games played - waste of time.

Quite steep learning curve, a lot of details to learn and the manual quite frankly could be better. The tutorial deck is a shorter version of one of the missions but there's nothing that really guides you through the mechanics (the tutorial video is very unclear as well).
Best tutorial video I could find so far is this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TzXA472aSw&t=8414s

After the mechanics snap though this is a great game, very immersive, very fluid, and challenging, leaving a lot of space for collaborative play, strategy, and a bit of roleplay.  The Guided mode looks promising.

Not for casual players, not easy to teach, but very rewarding game experience - if there was a more 'user friendly' manual to ease in players into the mechanics I would rate 1 star higher for sure.

So far I'm enjoying myself playing solo. That being said, I feel that I'm missing out on some essential part of the game by not playing with others, since so much of this game revolves around helping and/or sharing with your teammates. I had mostly planned on this being a solo experience though, so not sure if/when I will ever experience the "full" game. I'm not a PACG player, so don't know how it compares, but some of the mechanics are awkward and hard to get my head around at first (esp. being just 1 dude at the table), and remove me from the theme. I do like the theme overall though, and I like the idea of building a character by using a binder card-sheet, even if most of the "memories" are simply single-use cards.

Big PACG fans, but this one doesn't quite capture the same magic.  It feels clunkier.  There are some new mechanics that are definitely interesting, but this one is much harder to get to the table.

Underwhelming. The mechanics are like Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, but more complicated and symbol-driven. They also don't mesh nearly as well with the theme. Production values are lacking too; the character pawns are printed on really cheap card stock that splits when you try to get them into their stands.

For my time, I'd rather play 7th Continent, Time Stories, or even PACG any time I'd be tempted to bring this out.

My first impression is that the core game is not more interesting than Pathfinder. They did make some good decisions in switching to d6s and including a book that tells that story.

The game system itself is overly simplistic. Close locations by exploring. However, the game is made monstrously complex by having tons of opaque notation crammed onto every card. It is the exact opposite of elegant. Some of this is needed in card based co-op games, but it sets up an annoying barrier to entry in a game which at its core is dead simple.

Pathfinder with a light horror/weird skin. Theme and mechanics do not gel well at all and the game is so similar to Pathfinder that there's really no reason to have both. Every mechanic from PACG is in this game just with a different name. Character advancement is shallow and uninteresting and, in most cases, is simply a one use card for the next mission. Rules are muddled on several issues and iconography is a confusing mess.

Awesome twist on the Adventure Card Game. Art style and theme are stunning and engaging, very unique. Positioning around the table being a key mechanism is very interesting, and the support stage keeps the whole table engaged each turn. My major concerns are scaling and fiddliness. Timers and difficulty don't scale, so more players means fewer turns per player, though more players means more options each turn. Various scenario, daily (via companion app), nexus and threat modifiers can be hard to keep track of. Overall, though, a fun and engaging experience.

RATING: N/A
Game may be "too easy".  Suggestion is to NOT play with Ophelia and possibly Gabriella.  Also consider adding an extra location to increase difficulty.

Finally, the game may be much more balanced with higher player counts.  Seems to be issues with 2-3 player games.

Look for an updated digital rulebook in (early?) 2018.

I backed this game enthusiastically in April 2015 and it's 2018 right now and they haven't fully delivered what they promised. I will never buy/pledge anything from Mike Selinker or the Lone Shark Team. They have dropped the ball on this game so tremendously they have lost me as a customer forever.

Putting that aside the game is incredibly tedious and fiddly. They deserve an award in making a rulebook so unintuitive the majority of people will never even play their game. I've played heavier games than this but I think the large difference is those games the "weight" is in the gameplay and not getting through convulted paragraphs of text to simply learn the game.

When you finally get to the gameplay the enitre game is essentially a roll-to-resolve game. To say it's thematic is like saying a crossword puzzle is thematic because words intersect each other. The word matching thing is an attempt to make the game seem interactive but in actuallity is more of a nuisance than anything. 

Turns essentially break down to flipping over cards, determining how to roll the most dice with the most rerolls by shouting random words at your teammates and hoping they shout back at you with the same word.

I was fortunate enough to get a "demo" of this game and felt the scenario was uneventful and overall boring.

I don't know how games like this are still made. It's insane that years of development went into this game and this is what they churned out.

Rating is still preliminary; could go up if a better rulebook is released and I find a group interested in playing... but at this point, I'm not betting on that happening.

Rules as written have significant issues - or, at the very least, are in need of significant clarification - which makes the game more challenging to learn/teach than it should be. Apocrypha is a very simple game at its core.

And yet, despite being a relatively simple game that is poorly explained, it still feels like Apocrypha has the bones of a very solid adventure. Theme and mechanics are both interesting. Mission structure is nicely varied, and it appears to have plenty of room for further customization with later modules. Card play should be very quick once you know what you are doing - but I don't think that most decisions are as obvious as they initially appear.

One big disappointment: the game isn't as good solo as I had hoped. It really needs several characters being run at the same time to get the most from the assist systems.

Just had the one sort-of play with a friend. I was thoroughly unimpressed and didn't enjoy the endless rule-looking up in the trash rulebook.

Left it with that friend as they said they were up for trying to figure it out better - Will get in another play at some point, hopefully with more players and a better understanding of the rules (That friend has done a couple solo plays to get to grips with it).

Currently though, its' looking destined for the sell pile once the rest of the content from the KS arrives.

I liked Pathfinder ACG in general, but thought the progression in the adventures was a bit of a bummer, because there was only a linear way through them with a defined end. This one sounded more like what I envisioned it to be, a big world of adventures, but it turned out to be a big world of mess. The rule book is atrocious - why isn't there a page on each type of card, clearly labeling each graphic element, describing what it is meant to be and used for? Sure, everything might be written somewhere, but why the hell do I have to flip through the book to find out what "study 2" means on a saint and what a card asks for when it says "skilled in study"? Yeah, there is a video tutorial, but that doesn't replace a frigging rule book, guys. And the cards - the most important component in a card game - feel super flimsy. Sure, not every game needs mtg-level card stock, but guys, this one is just plain bad. If no good rules video shows up or good reference from users, this will go to the trade stack. And rating might even go down, because bad rules like these make me angry.

Mike Selinker knocks it out of the park again with this incredibly ingenious card driven adventure game that also works seamlessly as an RPG should a group wish to play it that way. Ingenious card mechanics make gameplay a breeze and a shedload of extra chapters from some of the best writers in sci-fi and fantasy make this a really smart project.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Update: I've played the game three times now and feel comfortable giving it a rating.

The Good:
It is definitely a fun game to play and I like the variety of missions. The system is interesting and the many cards give all sorts of different options. I like the unique attributes of each Saint. The Omens really change the encounter and the Mutations do as well. Each battle is relatively unique and makes for interesting strategic decisions.

The Deck Building is interesting after each session in trying to optimize your saint. I found the Enduring Fragments mechanic to be interesting but the fact they are almost always, if not always, Sacrificed when used makes them somewhat less than "Enduring".

The Bad:
The Rules and Scenarios. The rules and scenarios seem to be written in a manner that gives far more emphasis to style and flavor over understandability. It has taken three sessions to get what I consider a fairly good grasp of the rules but even then certain cards are seriously cryptic.

An example of this would be the In Cold Blood scenario. The description indicates you are to find Vital Fluids but it you are left to figure out they mean to find one Vital Fluid in each Nexus to achieve the a win. Nowhere are Victory Conditions described.

The rules are filled with examples of this nature. Yes, you can figure it out eventually but they often don't explain things in an easy to understand fashion. This makes the game difficult and frustrating the first few times playing.

If the rules were written again with an aim to explaining the actual game play I'd increase my rating by a full point or more. The problem here is that it's so difficult to understand.

Neutral
The cards have many unique and cool things about them but this has the unintended consequence of making them extremely cluttered with small symbols not ideal for us older players without sharp eyes. I do like the variety of the cards but find them awfully busy.

Conclusion:
Fun game but you're going to have play a few times to get the hang of the rules. If you're willing to hang in there and learn as you go it's worth the price.

Very much enjoying this. Love the backstories and the weird intros to each mission, also loving the artwork and the quality box with gorgeous dividers and a robust insert - nice!
For me, boardgames are all about theme and this game does a pretty good job of drawing me into its world; I find a real sense of exploration and anticipation when flipping a card at a nexus and I'm nervous to see whether it's a gift, a threat or something I need to complete the mission.  The fact that there's a huge variety of cards really helps. 
I've played 4 learning games (solo) with 1 or 2 characters and settled on 2 characters for my fifth game, I'm hoping the sense of achievement and continuity continues via halo fragments and the slowly changing decks; time will tell and my initial 8 may move to a 9 if that is indeed the case.

I don't find the game too easy and am pleased they made this one winnable as opposed to certain LCGs (LotR). For those who do find it too easy then there are lots of ways you can make it harder, put fewer cards in the 'clock' for one?

Far better to me than the Pathfinder ACGs.  Really loving the weird little flavor text and stories!

Big, heavy, story driven co-op dark horror campaign card game with some deck building and best of x six-sided dice.  The deck is your life. Lots of steps and terms that are unfamiliar.

(3p campaign with Ophelia, One, and Gabriella)

Apocrypha is an excellent interlude between Pathfinder campaigns.  There are a [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/25936186]number of key differences[/url], but the core experience is quite similar.  I'm hoping for zanier, stranger, and more horrific encounters down the line, but we're still being entertained with the base set (18 scenarios total) and are happy to continue.

As a bonus, the new mechanics are inventive and neat: surprise mutations after receiving assistance, the importance of seating order, memory fragments and the card halo, and daily rule changes.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of them migrated over to Pathfinder in the near future.

And please do read the flavor text on everything, if only to yourself.

I'll wrap up with a public service announcement:

If you're a casual gamer, put Apocrypha straight out of your mind. Pathfinder was bad enough with its intimidating rulebook, errata and FAQ issues, constant monitoring of location and player effects, and nontrivial monetary investment - and I say this as an aficionado and huge fan.  Apocrypha is more of the same, only more.

Apocrypha's iconography + keyword assault is daunting and confusing, and some mission structures are 10-minute logic puzzles that should be rewritten in plain English. These obstacles place the game firmly in the non-casual category.

Potential players need to dig in and internalize the card interface if they want to grow out of the frustration stage.  If someone isn't willing to do that, it's probably best not to invite them to the party.  Either that, or you become an all-knowing rules guru and constantly interpret the hieroglyphs on other people's cards.  How fun does that sound?

Awaiting Kickstarter - with trepidation. I hope it is a good game but it looks like it has train-wreck potential - not much communication about the game, lots of delays, no delivery date, no up to date game play demos online (The ones that did come out were laden with errors).

After several games I'm relieved to say I don't hate it. It has Pathfinder the Adventure card game DNA which helped me learn it, without that knowledge I think I'd be lost since the rules and mission set up system are both needlessly messy.

My main criticism is that for a co-op game so far it has been far too easy. We have not come close to losing yet which makes it lack tension. I should note that we have only played Candlepoint missions so far. Next time we will try Skinwalkers, I hope there's a chgallenge somewhere in this box.

Advantages
+ Great art, good theme
+ Building a deck over time is interesting
+ Rewards planning with other players

Disadvantages 
- lacking in challenge (so far)
- Crap rule book
- inelegant terminology
- needlessly convoluted mission structure set-up
- Expensive for what the experience provides

< October 2017 (19 months delayed kickstarter 1/3 of content promised has been delivered October as of 2017)

Very thematic, great back story, deep mechanics but not overly complex.  Great game!

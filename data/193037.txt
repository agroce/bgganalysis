Dead of WInter creates such a rich experience that winning becomes such a small part.  I can't compare to the original as this is the only variant i've played, but regardless it's fantastic. A favourite of my gaming group immediately.

I base the rating on a limited view.  I played this as a 2-player co-op.  We did not have the secret agendas and our mission was extremely tough.  With what we did, it had a puzzle aspect that I assume took away from the experience you get in the full game.

I think I am saying in saying that the full game is not going to be up to the standard of [thing=144568]Dawn of the Zeds[/thing], the greatest of all zombie games, but at the same time, it is definitely better than the dogs, such as [thing=2471][/thing].  This is probably on par with [thing=29368][/thing], and I would play it again.

RATING: 8
I really enjoy this, the game seems to be balanced more in favor of the colony than the base game.  Still very difficult, especially with bandits or raxxon mods, but the extreme difficulty spikes from the base game only seem present in uncommon situations.

There seems to be a loss of theme and immersion compared to the original DoW.  While that isn't a big negative for me, this doesn't seem to "hook" new players as well because of that.

This feels more like a game, and the original feels more like an experience.

Ótimo jogo, o tema e ambientação vai muito além de zumbi e em grupos que pega o espirito do jogo fica realmente empolgante. Jogando em 5 pessoas pode ser um pouco demorado por ter que administra muitos personagens, ações ou explicar regras, porém é quando as cartas de encruzilhada funcionam realmente por depender em sua maioria que certos personagens estejam em jogo. Aprovado.

This was my first board game. I did a lot of research before buying it, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. This is a truly great game. Deep, interactive, immersive, and challenging. I've played it with two groups of people, one familiar with board games and the other complete newbies, and everyone's amazed with the game. I highly recommend it.

I brought this to a family function.  I had a terrible time playing it, but all of my non-gaming family really thought it was fun.  How much my family and friends like a game always influences my rating because I often play games for the sake of other people, and I enjoy any game that my family is having fun with.  I suppose what I can say I liked is that, it didn't matter that no one met their objectives.  The fun in the game is the way the crossroads cards pull you into the story.

As a standalone, I think this is superior to the base game - you get all the normal stuff (including better components for the locations) as well as the three modules. As an expansion, it's a bit frustrating - I don't like the Raxxon module, and a ton of the rest is duplicated material.

RATING: 9
Though you can play it as a standalone game, this is also pretty much one of the best expansions I've ever purchased, with tons of new content that you can mix and match in with the base game. Loads of new characters, enemies, gear cards, locations, Crossroads event cards (some of which are mature and gruesome), there is frankly enough here to make Dead of Winter fun forever. An essential if you've got the core game, and worthy even if you don't.

A great game, the only thing I don't understand is why they made a stand alone expansion. 
I love the new place to seek, Raxxon. It's very resident evil alike, and you are much more exposed!

As expansion : unnecessary broken expansion (Especially Raxxon's item), the base game is good enough.
As standalone : still fun but off-balance. a bit too much sci-fi things.

-The colony upgrade and bandit modules I look forward to try! The raxxon... well maybe when we get bored of everything. :)
-I won't mix the two boxes together though. Maybe some characters.

Fist play:
-Played Raxxon. Fun but in the shorter scenarios the bad zombies didn't give extra challenge. :)
-Pills didn't look attractive enough to use.
-Improvements are a nice bit of help if someone feels the game is just a bit too hard.
-New characters, items and crossroad cards are cool.

After a few plays:
-Characters are too 'optimal'. Almost all the characters are useful, and are less wacky than the ones in the base game (Mall Santa anyone?). This is not very good.
-The items also seem to be a bit stronger.

This game still has all the problems from the original (luck, luck, and more luck) but I give it a slightly higher rating just because it has more stuff than the original and therefore gives you more to think about...in the good sense.

RATING: 9
Before this expansion, the original set felt somewhat lacking to me. Unless you have a group willing to roleplay the game out with you (which is sadly rare in my case), everything came down to two choices for me - do the thing that benefits the colony or hold out for you own personal objectives

But BOY the added modules do A LOT to make the game more exciting, while also not adding too much additional rules to keep track of! 

Raxxon adds an awesome element of risk vs reward - terrible TERRIBLE things can happen but at the same time there's some amazing game-saving items to be had if everything goes well. The special zombies make ALL of the zombies feel more like a threat rather than just a nuisance in the background because you have to kill those before any other zombies and they often have a much higher chance of killing your survivor in various different means, and the choice all the players have to make to contain them or use their dice to complete objectives is amazing. The bandits also add a wonderful increase in randomness and choices. If they get out of hand, they'll tear through location decks and take the things you want, and add even more zombies around you. However you can also use them to find the items that you want FOR you, because if your really successful with a search or attack at a bandit hideout, you can choose from any of the items in their pile! But at the same time doing those actions at that hideout can be more risky as it seems to be a more wound-prone alternative. Then finally the improvements module works really well for giving you opportunities to adjust to whatever hardships the game is throwing at you. For example, if you have a lot of helpless to feed, it's a real good idea to invest points into the greenhouse! Got some crazed item using players on your team? Invest in an outhouse!

A lot more of the crossroad cards also seemed to go off, and one even interacted with another in a great way, showing the rivalry between two characters that I really appreciated. However I could have just gotten lucky because I could easily see combining the DoWs diluting the deck. Perhaps when I combine the DoW games I'll use a house rule where people will draw 2 or 3 cards if the previous was an 'If this character is in play' type.

Any who, All of this does SO much to revitalize the game. The base game was rated about a 5 for me, but this one is definitely an 8 or 9 now. I also personally just jumped into the game using all the modules at once - it's not much to tack on if you already know  the game, and they even have a section for just new rules that's easy to consume.

---Edit---
After a couple more games, my game group agrees. I've never had as many laughs or tense moments playing only the base set. I dont see myself going back!

More stuff for Dead of Winter?  Absolutely!  Here is a list of what the game adds:  Explosive barricades, unruly helpless survivors, despair tokens, a graveyard tile, an Improvements module (allowing you to spend precious recourses to upgrade the colony), a Bandits module (now you have to contend with a roving band of humans on top of the zombies), and a Raxxon module (introducing crazy, government enhanced zombies waiting to be unleashed).  Each of the three modules can be played with any main objective, including those from the base game.  Use one, two, or all three!  In fact, the entire set is both modular and stand alone.  It also comes with new survivors, item cards, secret objectives & main objectives, crisis cards, and crossroads cards (even some rated R crossroads that come in a specially sealed envelope).  All of this adds more variety to what is already one of my favorite board games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Definitely a bit of a disappointment. Absolutely no need to recreate the base game here. Some of the new mechanics seemed ok but were under-utilized. Need a few more plays.

Edit: have played 4 times now. Still disappointing although it's ok. The Crossroads cards seem to be waaaay harder to get triggered then the base game, with much more specific conditions. The weapons from the research lab also seem too overpowered. The 'super-zombies' that pop out of the lab seem to have minimal impact on the game. Would have preferred a either a very different game (i.e., the original 'shopping mall' rumor that went around) that didn't replicate the base game, or slimmer and cheaper expansions.

Great theme and complex dynamics make this a very interesting game. Difficult, so replayability tends to be high. The secret mission/betrayer system creates so much tension throughout the game that, even though you are trying to help everyone else to survive, you actively question everything they do. I'm not convinced that the Long Night is the better of the two available options, given how diverse the players and crossroads components are in the original game. I have yet to play the highly complex Raxxon module, so my opinion may change! One thing I really like about Dead of Winter is that the coop game "quarterbacking" phenomenon is limited as a result of everyone having their own agenda; no-one gets to dictate how the game is played, which is really nice.

Can you survive? Hunger, bandits, zombies, and don't forget to keep morale from tanking.  A semi-cooperative (there could be a hidden traitor, and everyone may have individual goals as well) game that has you trying to achieve a group-goal in a limited number of rounds...unless you're a betrayer and have your own goal that runs counter to it.

Game is not bad, its highly overrated. I played two times, first time was quite interesting but second time it was only repeatable mechanics and decisions what to do are very easy. Playing time is lie. For 4-5 players is about 4-6 hours, depend on rounds. Maybe after 10 games time it will decrease but Im not going to play 3rd time.

Decisions to make - they are always obvious, except maybe voting but this is social mechanism rather than game. 

Special zombies arent so dangerous. Bandits are not adding climate at all, just another mechanism which add complexity but there is not much to do with them. Robinson is much better game, better co-op and has worse rating. I think BGG ratings today are not relevant because they are inflated by fans of particular games.

I'm split and torn by this game. As an expansion it's utterly expensive and offers only few extra cards that can be mixed with the original game without any issue. Every other card get diluted and either the location gets unbalanced adding a lot of setup time or the Crossroads gets triggered once in a life time.
As a stand alone game is.. Dead of Winter with something extra (in the vest of new modules) but less usable cards. There was no reason whatsoever to have this Expansion as stand alone.
Additionally the first printing is filled with typos and misprints.
Incredibly disappointing.. although DoW is still a good game. I'd go for the original

Tentative early rating, had the original base game - though sold due to poor experience at the two player count (it's really just a straight coop at that number without the betrayer which is in part a large amount of the flavour that this game offers), bought this box cheaply and also as I play the higher counts in games now due to a change in circumstances - I don't think it sold as well as perhaps it should hence the low price. It's a generous box, you basically get a version of the base game with cardboard locations versus the card of the original and a few extra modules. Few reviewers stated that they didn't see the point of the base now as you can just play this without the extras if you want. I am not that convinced as the extras themselves are mixed in quality and I think the characters in the base game are a funner (not a word) selection. And if you are like me, I tend to play games with new people often so opt for the simplest set up possible, which would mean never using the expansion bits - many of the cross road cards mention them, you are supposed to ignore them if they are not in play, so without them you feel that you are not quite playing the full game.

Like all of these sorts of games the play experience will be very group dependent; the exposure die can be very upsetting (if you are easily upset), downtime can be something at the highest player count, however the experience is highly thematic and almost paranoid, which may or may not be enjoyable for you.
Further plays needed.

It is really fun to play when there is a traitor. When there is none, it kinds of lay a bit flat since it is easier to achieve the objective. Tried 3 players games, and we lose each single times but one. Generally it is a great game.

I hesitated from this one originally because of the cardboard figures instead of miniatures and I assumed it was another zombie game in the same type as Last Night On Earth.  I could be no more wrong, DOW, is the definitive zombie game that all others compare to.  This is the Walking Dead, Resident Evil, and 30 days of Night, all rolled into one.  Imagine living in a frigid nightmare where you have not only starvation, sickness, and despair to worry about, but add bandits, and top it off with the living dead, and each of you has a personal agenda you have to complete, and you have an idea of the world DOW is set in.  Not only a fantastic game, but an incredible experience

This takes everything the base game did, and improved upon it. Not only are there literally improvements (seriously, a mechanic that lets you upgrade barricades and weapons and stuff in the game), but there's additional modules that create entirely new ways to play. The bandits bring in a whole new threat to worry about on top of stressing wherever or not there is a traitor in your group. Raxxon, the Umbrella Corp of the DoW world, has accidentally released their failed experiments of mutated super zombies upon the town. Some of the new items feel like they take the challenge out of the game, but when used with the right module they fit perfectly without making things too easy.

My wife really wanted a zombie themed game, so this was a pretty good choice. I like it; she thinks it's okay. I can see it getting old after a while as you're basically doing the same things every game--going to locations and searching for items to complete the objectives. Honestly, the zombie theme is pasted on.

I own both this and regular DOW and TLN is a great expansion but NOT a better core set than DOW IMO. I love DOW and I enjoy both DOW and TLN but if you had to only own one I would advocate for vanilla DOW.

I get why people say that TLN is the superior version of DOW. Shut up and sit down said TLN is better.  And it certainly comes with more.  But I have to disagree.  Sometimes less is more.

First of all, the characters in the first DOW are way more solid. IMO the new characters only work as supplemental. Similarly, the books in the library in the core set are by design better than the supplementary books in TLN. Specifically, characters who can search twice, and blueprints that let you search twice are too important, mechanically, to loose entirely by only owning TLN.

I actually make randomized location decks by combining the two sets. But I am a weirdo.

Also, all the extra stuff in TLN is cool, but only if you have played a good amount of DOW already, and it adds to set-up time and makes the game just more daunting.

So, fantastic expansion and in some cases a component upgrade (in some case a component downgrade, such as the cards).

Keep in mind, I still think it's a great game and a great expansion!  But get regular DOW first.

#Coop

This game heavily depends on your group. We had a betrayer that was doing absolutely nothing to sabotage us. That was kind of boring. And I had the personal goal to have exactly 4 survivors. Which are the rarest card at every location. This is a very difficult goal compared to others.

But it's a very thematic game and I like the semi-coop part. But I don't like to discuss every action for 5min.

We tried playing it with 6 players and it was excruciatingly slow. I was worried that playing only with the expansion would limit the search decks, but it wasn't really noticed. The new crossroads seem better than the original, however the crisis are harder, so it balances out.

My comment on the original game still applies:
A great mix of mechanics that create a good and thematic game! The secret player goals combined with the traitor is perfect and the crossroads cards are always exciting. The problem is that the game is way too long.

EDIT: I'll add a recent post I wrote about the theme:
[q]I'd argue that DoW is a very thematic game, but that the crossroad cards are the least thematic thing in the game. What really sells the zombie theme for me is that you're in constant risk whenever you venture out of your comfort zone due to the exposure die and that you can never be sure about your friend's true motivations. 

What draws me to the zombie theme is not the zombies themselves, it's what the post-apocalypse does to the psyche of your fellow humans. It's your friends that are truly dangerous, not the zombies. I can agree that having everyone be forced into acting suspicious is a crutch for a traitor game, but I both think it's thematically brilliant and not an important part of the game. It can be played completely cooperatively, the traitor mechanic is just an added, optional difficulty as far as I'm concerned.

I prefer zombies to be not immediately threatening but eventually unavoidable, they continues to chip away at your defences day after day until you give up- those are the zombies depicted in DoW. They are only dangerous in large groups and you should be able to easily handle them, but if you ignore them for too long they can mess you up.[/q]

We'll play this two player quite often, purely cooperatively.  It definitely plays better with more players and when you have the hidden traitor.  I rank the original (Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game) a little higher since it has more scenarios than The Long Night.

The most memorable game was a three player game where someone had contributed an unnecessary card towards the crisis.  One of the players did not contribute at all, and accusations were had back and forth as to who had sabotaged the crisis.  The innocent player could not agree on whose side to take so there was no one was exiled.  In the end, we achieved the main objective, and when we revealed our hidden objectives, we all completed them as well... no one was a traitor.  We still do not know who added the useless crisis card (or how it got there).

Completely moved into stupid zombie territory with these, it all feels like a made up world like resident evil, where as the original was about the survivors scavenging and not trusting one another.  Really a big big let down.

Very similar to Dead of Winter. Great new characters and crossroad cards, but the additions are not very successful. The improvements are a good idea on paper, but normally there is not enough time/resources to make use of them. Equally, the addition of the bandits seems gratuitous, the original game was complex enough. The components, however, are better than in the original. I have it, but only because I don't have Dead of Winter.

Gave the original a 9, this one an 8 because all of its additions could have been sold for cheaper if it wasn't a standalone expansion. Upgrading the base game contents to second edition and selling the expansion material seperately would have worked better IMO.

The Long Night is barely playable without the original. There are not enough characters for 5 players to start a game properly if you're playing without the Raxxon module. There is also a very real chance of running out of characters in a long game. Many of The Long Night characters are strong combatants but not very useful in actually completing the main objective. Efficient searching is usually the key to winning, especially in Hardcore mode, and the best characters for that are in the original game.

The expansion modules are ok and definitely returned interest to a game which has been pretty thoroughly played.

If you don't have either, the choice between the original and The Long Night is a hard one. The Long Night has more stuff, but the original carried a long time by itself and is more consistent in its content.

I could play this game pretty much any time. I recently introduced this game to my mom, older brother and younger cousins, none of whom had advanced beyond uno, monopoly and cards against humanity, and they all grasped the mechanics easily and really got into it. This is wonderfully simple game that really delivers on the entertainment. Despite the straightforward core mechanics, the survivor cards, objectives, crisis, traitors and crossroads keep the game feeling fresh each time. Still not sure how I feel about Raxxon and the bandit modules (I rarely play with bandits), but the upgrades to the colony are great, and I never play without them. Also, I'm a sucker for a diverse cast of characters. This version has everything that the original has and more. Love it.

I tried this game out and although I loved it I felt that the modules were very uncooked. Having played the game more I've come to realise that the modules create a perfect balance once they are all in the game. Imo that is the only way to play Long Night - either use all the modules or none.

Bandit hideout makes the game potentionally easier for an exile since he can have the option to decide where they go. Searching the Bandit Hideout is risky and no one really wants to go there. Add the Raxxon module - superzombies make the game harder especially for the exiled player and its deck is especially dangerous to search. Fortunately the bandits do the searching for you and you can avoid the Raxxon search by going through the less dangerous deck at Bandit Hideout. Both modules make the game harder, though. And this is where the Advancements come in since they balance out the difficulties the other modules create.

The con of Long Night is the lack of characters. There's only 20 of them which can get tricky with 5 players. Also, they are very strong at killing zombies which I thought was a bigger pity. Players won't be as cornered as in the original game. There's also only 8 main mission and three of them belong to a story mode of Bandits/Raxxon, so in reality we are talking about 5 new main mission. Plus, only 5 exile missions. The missions aren't as plenty as in the original and some of them are quite odd. Although I felt the same with the base game. The crossroads cards have improved. Some of them made me fall in love with certain characters.

Long Night offers more options and more things to consider. It also enhances some gameplay features such as using food tokens to change the number on a die. This is a must with Raxxon module. After playing Long Night the previous game felt very boring. The perfect Dead of Winter experience would include this game with the characters from the original.

I wish Plaid hat games just released the modules for this game instead of releasing it as a full fledged "stand-alone" which it definitely isn't. Or better yet, released the space-themed crossroads game. Minus the modules, which need the base game to play anyway, The "standalone" base game that's included here contains about 40% less content. 

Even still the modules added add barely anything to the experience.  Not to mention Raxxon literally breaks the game. Most of the special infected just stay(actually all do) in the location they spawn, so go in, get what you need(food, weapons, etc.) and leave before they have a chance to attack. They're basically a non-threat. Not to mention Raxxon's items will let you steam roll quickly.

Improvements were great, but it's a small add-on that can be easily implemented and the bandits was ok at best. More annoying than ground-breaking.

Yes, the new characters, items, and crossroads cards are welcomed but there isn't enough here to warrant a purchase and call this a "stand-alone". The modules are lifeless and decent at best, but they don't really add anything amazing to the overall experience. Raxxon literally needs "nerfing." I hope they release a simple Character,Crossroads, or Item pack for the game, and I'll just purchase that.

RATING: 7
I do love the game, but it loses a point over the original for a few reasons.

Raxxon is a little too much. Having to deal with the audio logs every round is bad. I mix the audio logs in with the search deck of Raxxon so if you search, and it now comes up, you have to deal with it.

The Main Objectives feel like an afterthought. There are less of them, and other than a few of them, there is no story to them.

Love the bandits and especially love the upgrades you can get.

Dropping it a star. Recent play brought up a Crisis Card that stated if we failed it, everyone at the table had to tell a secret that nobody else knew about them. WTF? Not only does this 100% bring you out of the theme, it is just stupid. If I wanted to play a game where I had to do that, there are hundreds of games out there for it.

Also has a deck of crossroads cards, which could trigger on each players turn and change something in the game.

Its a Good expansion if you like Dead of Winter - But i find that I Dislike the Raxxon module because whenever i play it i feel as if something could have been done a lot better. not to mention how game-winning some cards *cough* Drone *cough* are in the deck i feel like rolling for exposure it not harsh enough a punishment for having the chance of straight up winning the game and worst case i suppose you could get a fuel card or a pill which isn't much of a downside. Each turn of the game you need to Secure two specific dice in Raxxon which is a completely stupid way of resolving Experiments. in larger numbers of players this will have very little impact on the game whereas with 2-3 players its just blind luck as to weather you get the dice. Even if you don't get the dice the Experiments aren't even that bad. You have to attack them before any other zombie at the location however this doesn't stop you from using cards like Sniper Rifle or Grenade launcher from killing the other zombies at the location which makes the zombies completely ignorable if you have one of these weapons.
On top of this, i find that the Base game has more replay-ability with more survivors as well as main objectives. The main objectives in the base game are also a lot better than the ones in this expansion. 
My final criticism with this expansion is that it aggravates me how much stronger some of the survivors are in this expansion in comparison to the base game. in some cases it's almost strict powercreep (at least until influence becomes relevant) : Compare Jamie Gilmour (expansion) and Annaleigh Chan (base) for example. in what circumstance is looking at ONE CARD in a players hand better than looking at their ENTIRE HAND, granted, Annaleighs ability is available anywhere on the board and she has a 2+ fight instead of 3+ but these differences are almost negligible.
The main reason you should buy this expansion is because of the additional replay-ability it adds, the Crossroads cards are good(few exceptions), New items are good (though there is still power creep going on here), New Characters are mostly Nice and in particular the Bandits module is very sweet-will use this in every game i play. I do appreciate the Improvements module but find that there are a few cards that are much better than others and since you usually start the game with 3-5 junk it tends to make the game too easy as you can immediately start the game with one of the few powerful Improvements. if you can start the game with bedding, the game is basically won unless there is a traitor. (i do tend to remove the powerful cards from the game)

RATING: 6.5
Have been trying to dip deep into the game and to see if I miss any fun of it, but most of the time I didn't enjoy it as much as I would like to because of few things that I dislike about the game:

1. Tedious to set up (even after I used a plastic container to separate and store different tokens for easy accessibility)

2. Too many things to keep track/ to do (characters ability, crossroads cards, player and colony phases, and tons of different actions you can do for each players)

3. Lack of excitement: you are either trying to search for something to fulfill your personal secret objective/crisis/game objective or killing zombies

3. Personal secret objective: probably the one thing I dislike the most in this game. The concept feels cool when I first played it, but then I found that most secret objectives are pointless/dumb (eg. put at least X barricades at certain location). Sometime is obvious that people are trying to achieve their secret objectives, rather than being suspicious as a betrayer in the game.

Rated as 8 as it's very similar to Dead of Winter which is still a great game however the Raxxon didn't seem to add much but complicate it and from what I gather, the bandits aren't great either. The colony improvements are a nice idea but I suspect are there to balance the game if the bandits/Raxxon make it harder. Main criticism is it's very difficult to tell the characters apart. They need colour bases or something.

It's a bit like a cross between Eldrich Horror and Resistance.  I like the fact that it has a good mix of both.  You get the coop work together feel and the paranoia that comes from a betrayer.  Eldrich Horror is nice, but after a while you can just "do the math" and beat the game a high percentage of time.  This game has "math" to do, but can be completely thrown for a loop depending on if the betrayer gets you just right.  This means you always have to think on your feet and go above and beyond as a team to handle unexpected situations both from the game and the player.

The mechanics make sense somewhat, but there's a few places where you have to use your imagination, such as how you can transport food and crisis cards back to the colony when you're out and about, but not anything else.

The Crossroad cards are genius, though.  I love the passive RNG triggers, rather than dice roll triggers.

I enjoy the improvements addition as well as the Raxxon facility, I would not add the bandits if Raxxon is in play as it makes the game go on too long for our liking.

Thank you secret Santa.

I immediately opened up this game and had to play with ALL of the expansions and what an amazing ad on. The game became tougher more than before and added a lot more flavor to the game. Yes, we were frustrated because we felt helpless to the onslaught of several different types of super zombies and the bandits consistently stealing our stuff. But with the new weapons in this expansion, it gives us a chance to help even the field. I had immense fun with this add on. We did lose the first game but ready to go again. Thank you secret Santa!

This game is dark, it is heavy, and it is one of my favorite games to play. The best way I've experienced this game is on a double date game night. The amount of laughing, yelling, comical decisions, and accusations made it one of my favorite nights of board gaming to date. Dead of winter will provide a very unique gaming experience that I want to recommend to anyone who is willing to spend a little time learning the rules. Additionally, although the missions have begun to feel a little repetitive, I still haven't made it through all of the expansion material even after a dozen or so plays. A wonderful game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Thematically mind blowing. There is so much storytelling in this game. Possibly having a traitor in your midst makes for so much tension. Compared to Dead of Winter, it is basically the same, with extra components. The only difficulty is teaching it in under 5 minutes, which is an important factor in a great game for me. If a first time player gets dealt a traitor card, he or she will usually be too overwhelmed by the game to fully enjoy the scheming that comes with the role.

Die Lange Nacht ist eine Stand-Alone Erweiterung zum Brettspiel Winter der Toten. Das heißt, man kann sie auch losgelöst vom Grundspiel spielen. Das empfehle ich aber nicht, da hier weniger Charaktere enthalten sind, als im Grundspiel. Am besten man kombiniert alle Elemente aus Erweiterung und Grundspiel. Es fallen sofort einige Verbesserungen im Spielmaterial auf, z.b. die wesentlich dickeren Orte oder das schick glänzende Spielfeld. Auch die neuen Mechaniken wie Banditen, Siedlungsverbesserungen oder mutierte Superzombies sind spannend und bringen zusätzliche Würze ins Spiel. Die Lange Nacht ist aber auch unwesentlich schwieriger als das Grundspiel. Trotzdem bleibt Winter der Toten das einzig wahre "Walking Dead Brettspiel".

Great co-op, but a bit on the LONG side so we stick with shorter objective cards. We often forget the Crossroads cards. The game has a lot of decks and pieces to set up before each playthrough, which sucks (it's the longest set-up time in my collection bar Gloomhaven). My group is slowly introducing more modules and hopefully we'll enjoy all of them. (Edit: we did not really like Raxxon. We found it to be too inhibiting because it takes your dice to prevent special zombie spawns).

While this is an essential buy if only for the pile of extra cards and survivors to add to the base game, I'm not sure that the three new modules add anything particularly great to the original formula. Perhaps if DoW was one of your few games and you'd played it a million times and you need to mix this up then you'll move on to the original, but I suspect I'll end up just adding in the new cards (minus the ones that require the new modules) to the original.

-Not trusting each other through the combination of secret objectives and a possible traitor

[b]Dislike:[/b]
-Crossroad cards
-The variant without traitor
-Downtime? (not played enough to say for sure)

Playing this without the traitor is meh, and the one time we played this with traitor we didn't get to finish this game. Love to give this game more chances but hard to get to the table.

One problem I noticed is that while I understand that this is supposed to be "a Crossroads Game", I felt like the Crossroads cards didn't add much. This might be because English isn't my mother language, but we found it hard to get into the story and at the same time remember all the decisions. Since the decisions are important to continue the game, we commonly forgo the story and forget what was exactly happening. It's also pretty annoying to check if a specific character is in play or not. At least it's not the person who's turn it is who handles these Crossroads cards so the game doesn't get slowed down and one person has something interesting to do if they have nothing to add to the co-op discussion.

Only played it twice so far - once with five players with one defector and once with two players collaboratively. It seems too easy! Most collaborative games have some mechanic that makes the game harder and harder as it goes on, for instance adding more or stronger monsters, or having harder challenges, as the game goes on. This game does not - once the survivors have stabilized, killing a bunch of zombies and picking up a bunch of cards every turn, it seems very hard to lose. Will try other modules and stuff in further playthroughs and adjust opinion accordingly.

Other than that, the components are nice, lots of zombies with different artwork, good character gallery, nice artwork. The Crossroads system, event cards that trigger only quite rarely, is pretty cool and will provide a lot of replayability.

Ridiculous downtime between player turns due to (exponentially increasing) abilities and sub-rules scattered all over the place, with practically no real decisions to make on your turn when if finally comes around again. Winning is not rewarding and anticlimactic.
I'd rather buy another copy of BSG or Dark Moon instead of playing DoW again. At least the production is great, but that's the only good thing I have to say about this.

Expansion modules are overpowered in the worst way.  Future games should be limited to bandits and colony upgrades if used at all.  Using all modules made the gameplay seem like an emotionless book keeping exercise.  If I had a consistent play group for regular multiplayer games, the balance could be overlooked once in a while, but alas - I don't.

Tout d'abord il est important de préciser que ma première découverte de Dead Of Winter était avec le jeu de base (voir mon commentaire dans ma collection à ce sujet).
La Nuit La Plus Longue ajoute pas mal de choses au jeu de base et en enlève aussi. Perso je regrette la disparition de certains textes d'ambiances lors de victoires de traitres par exemple ou pour démarrer un scénario autre que ceux spéciaux de l'extension sous forme de "campagne" mais bon .... ça reste un détail. Ce qui est bien c'est que ces extensions, ces modules plutot, sont au nombre de 4 : la construction d'objets (armes ou équipements de défense essentiellement), le cimetière (d'où pourront revenir les survivants morts), les pillards avec un repère et un chef de pillard (éventuellement un traitre banni) et un laboratoire qui génère des pillules et des zombis mutants surdopés dont on soupçonne être à l'origine de l'invasion zombie. C'est donc très riche et super top car modulable à souhait. Ca rajoute beaucoup à la durée et variété du jeu. C'est un de mes meilleurs jeux de ma ludothèque à ce jour. Quelles parties et quelle ambiance ! :-)

心得:
整體而言跟基礎的重點是一樣的
實驗室增加了難度跟多種特殊喪屍
也多了很多新的強力物品
暴徒模式就覺得比較無聊
設施則通常應該只會有幾個比較好用
遊戲雖然豐富了些，不過運氣需求更大了
特別是多了很多要擲暴露骰的動作或是很難殺成功的特異喪屍
規則:
*漫漫長夜提供三個模組，遊戲前選擇使用模組的卡片加入卡片堆中(右下角)，加入基礎的搜索卡則遊戲前移除20張
***統一新增規則***
*每輪結束時可以發起投票要不要把起始玩家標記給下一個，通過則起始玩家維持同一人
*隨機地點時擲六面骰，所以只會到場上的六個地點
*絕望標記等於一個傷害標記且不能被藥品治療
*不守規則倖存者(翻面)在加殭屍跟吃食物時一個算兩個，主動玩家可花一個藥品卡把她翻回來
*爆炸物同障礙物，只是移除時同時移除所有殭屍
*增加喪屍時，投擲噪音標記如果!!!面則增加
***設施模組***
*加入有槌子符號的危機，生存者，十字路口或目標卡
*一開始時洗勻設施牌抽4張開著
*當設施牌上槌子標記超過卡上標示時該卡啟動，效果可以使用
***混混模組***
*加入對應混混標誌的卡牌跟混混基地，所有混混立牌放在一旁
*當開一個危機卡時，根據上面指示放混混到對應地點(沒位置不用放)，如果用舊的危機卡則放兩個隨機地點，攻擊混混規則同攻擊其他生存者(花一顆大於等於攻擊力的骰，在骰一次要小於等於對方攻擊力)
*增加喪屍時，混混視為一個生存者，如果地點滿了但沒有生存者，移除所有混混
*結算完增加喪屍後，每個地點的混混抽一張該地點牌到混混基地，跟基地的互動看該卡
*被放逐的玩家如果不是背叛者則成為混混領袖，選擇每回合混混放置地點
***實驗室擴充***
*增加有對應骷顱頭標記的卡牌並放置實驗室地點跟對應牌組
*洗勻實驗室實驗卡牌放在地點牌上並把錄音面朝上，玩家可查看第一張
*旁邊再放置實驗室後果牌，可自由查看全部
*每次在實驗室搜索後，擲一顆暴露骰
*搜到Pill卡時，選一個控制的腳色拿，然後擲骰看結果，如果有對應後果卡可裝備則裝備到該腳色
*玩家在實驗室時可放一個沒使用的骰子，如果殖民地結算階段有兩個對應骰點對應實驗室卡牌上，則全部人可投票，棄掉該牌或是起始玩家決定一個地點增加階段少加三個喪屍
*如果該卡沒被棄掉則結算，放置對應的特殊喪屍，撞到炸藥跟柵欄一樣結算就棄掉該卡，如果有放置成功則該卡翻面，該喪屍只能被正常攻擊骰打死(物品能力 不用骰的不行，之後的炸藥也不行)，且也不能被移動，且必須優先被打，成功且生存者沒死丟骰根據卡片結算，如果喪失都被移除卡片就棄掉

This is playable as a standalone game or can be mixed in, in entirety or in parts, with the original game. It brings in a bunch of extra characters, each with their own special ability. These can readily be mixed in with the originals, likewise mixing in the Crossroads cards, tho' this will mean foregoing the Crossroads app (at least until an overdue app update appears). Downside of this is that the character-specific Crossroads cards are statistically less likely to be applicable. There are several new rules, including the introduction of 'Despair' tokens as a new type of wound, and explosive barricades. The game also introduces three individual expansion modules: one allows the colony to build Improvements. These give a benefit but they eat into the colony's time and resources. Another expansion module adds bandits to the game. The most interesting expansion is a government research institute: Raxxon. Raxxon offers very high-powered cards but also introduces zombies with special powers.

You probably wouldn't want to incorporate The Long Night elements in a game for those coming to Dead of Winter for the first time, but you'd definitely want to try to introduce them once everyone is familiar with the original game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
See Dead of Winter comment...  We love the new characters.  Improvements are pretty cool. Raxxon is tough and leave us 'meh'.  New zombies are challenging and I find distracting from base game feel.  They make DoW more of a "zombie game".   We have never played with Bandits.  Don't want to really...  Although they seem in line thematically, they seem like they would really ramp up the difficulty which we are not interested in.  We just wanted more characters.

Not into the theme which colors my opinion. Also the hidden traitor cooperative games are also not a favorite.
The common quest mechanic is not as interesting as BattleStar's Given the cost/risk of movement it seems best to spread out and stay put until forced to move again. However I do like the secret objective aspect to break ties among the "winners" that is most interesting design element.

The expansion includes several overpowered items which looks to force play.

Personally I don't see the reason for the hype. If I want to play this style of game I'll go with BattleStar and Shadows over Camelot.

Love Dead of Winter, looks like this gives more of what I love. 

UPDATE: After playing once I haven't gone back yet. I still want to explore this box more, but I'm not dying to after my singular experience. I'm thinking this adds more stuff on to a game that I don't really want it for. I think I will mostly use this for variety of characters and item decks rather than including the optional modules.

The character of the traitor is optimal from 4-5 players, but the goals become impossible with so few rounds. Less than 4 players it is better to enter the coperative mode and enjoy it all.

With the traitor's pj the difficulty is multiplied but it is more fun.

This is a very good and thematic game. There seems to be a lot rules and interactions to know. I really went through this first game just asking a lot of questions and trying to get advice. Considering it's "mostly" cooperative (possible betrayal), that wasn't a real problem. A follow up game will give me a better idea of how much I like this game. I think the enjoyment of this game will have a lot to do with the people you are playing with.

RATING: 7
Incredibly fun and thematic game. Needs to be with the right people. Frustrating that in certain cases the only way to "officially" win is by taking actions that greatly increases the chances of everyone on your team losing. However, the game tells a great story and is very fun to play, even if there is a decent amount of down time with larger player counts.

Rating based upon an initial 2 player play (purely cooperative, no betrayer).

We played a rule wrong and chose the easiest objective to complete so it was only mildly challenging.

I am excited for this one - rating will probably go up.

Big fan of Dead of Winter, so was excited for this, but first plays with this were not as good as hoped. Supposedly a stand alone but not enough characters for 5 players if you take out "Blue" (which you are supposed to do unless using one of the modules). Also less missions than the original and no read aloud text for the missions or betrayer (booooo).

The bandits didn't feel very impactful or interesting, but maybe it just didn't work with the missions we tried. The building module was fine but as a strict bonus for the colonists could be unbalancing. Some of the "adult only" cards were pretty tasteless too.

Интересные игровые механики, рандом есть, но он не бесит, а наоборот, добавляет ощущение неопределённости в каждой ситуации столкновений. Карты перекрёстков сделаны тоже весьма интересно, хотя играя короткую игру можно вообще не вытащить событие, которое сработает в игре. Это уж как повезёт. Ну и самое прикольное наверное, это секретные цели игры вопреки основной. Предательство это отдельный разговор, шикарная задумка и отличная реализация. Но игрок должен войти в роль, не дать явно понять остальным, что предатель  - он.

A slightly better version of Dead of Winter.  Essentially the same game with a few options.  That makes it slightly better than the original.  Not sure that you need both.

However, it is a virtually perfect zombie game.  It treats the Zombies as a scary backdrop with the emphasis on survival in a world destroyed, rather than individual zombie fights.  That works very well.

So far not as good as I expected. (only one play though)

I love the gory details in the crossroad cards, from the more vulgar scenarios, to the real life interactions required to trigger them.

I like the concept of adding the extra modules, such as Raxxon, bandits, improvements, etc...  but it makes the game more convoluted.  I suggest only using Raxxon or bandits, and not both at the same time, and leave the colony improvements out entirely.

The Raxxon zombies are interesting, but not all that game centric.  Their effects are a little distracting at best. Also some clarification may be necessary for when items can be used on them for attacks, such as the grenade launcher.

I feel like as a whole, these new main objectives and secret objectives are much easier than the originals.

More DoW goodness.  The Bandits totally feel like a story ripped from The Walking Dead.

For fans of the original, this will be a must-have: more characters, more stories, base improvements, and bandits. The Raxxon module feels incoherent, unfortunately, but everything else is so solid that it hardly matters.

RATING: 5
While ultimately in possession of all the flaws of the core game, and in fact having "thinner" content in terms of missions and events, if you enjoy this game enough to invest in it, this adds much as an exapansion, and if you only intent to buy one of the two, I still suggest this set... what it lacks in card-pile thickness, it makes up for with having more balanced events and cards, fixing a lot of the original games biggest issues doing subtle things like combining kill and move effects with a new gas item. Additionally, the biggest feature is three optional gameplay expansions... the upgrade system makes the game easier, bandits make it harder, and the mad science lab can make it both or either case depending (but all in all, is super fun and really spices things up). The game continues to be unwieldly, long, and unsatisfying, but what fun was to be had is higher in Long Night.

Great zombie game. Very thematic and fun. Not easy to beat. Specially with how traitor can mess things up.

The replayability is excellent with all the different scenarios and characters.  After playing multiple games that have always been fun no matter how the game end, this is one of my favorite games currently. 

Even if it is a cooperative game, the way eacvh player has his own agenda brings interesting dimensuon to the game and makes it less likely that one player takes over and dictates what other players do. Especially since every player has his cards hidden from the other players and everyone could be traiter.

I have mostly played with three players and found it very easy for traiter to mess everything up so we sometimes choose to take the traiter card out to make it more cooperative.

All in all a great game where theme artwork and design all come together to make a great gaming exprience.

Nice co-op with traitor mechanic. The "edgy" cards are ridicoulusly not edgy, it's just laughable that the "trigger warning" things in this industry are this kind of plain events that would never trigger anything.

Raxxon sometimes makes it too simple, and thus too difficult to be the traitor.

My comments for the original Dead of Winter, since they apply to this stand alone expansion as well...

"This is a nifty entry into the "semi-cooperative but there might be a traitor" genre. It does a nice job of forcing everyone to do things that seem a tad bit destructive, to achieve their personal win conditions. This sort of game has been explored quite a bit of late, but what makes this one special are the crossroads cards. They interject a ton of story into the game, as well as some gut wrenching decisions...especially if everyone is buying into the theme, which they should, to get the most out of it.

Like the best of zombie apocalypse fiction, the point this game tries to make is that the other people, the survivors...They are often the most dangerous monsters, not the mindless zombies. Focusing on those survivors, not the monsters, is this game's biggest strength."

This version adds three new modules. The first two are a fantastic addition to the game. Bandits, which are NPC's that run around and compete for resources are something I didn't know the game was missing until I added them. They are usually more of a nuisance than an actual threat, but there presence really pushes the "Walking Dead" vibe.

The second module revolves around building improvements for the survivor compound. These are tough to build without blowing a few crisis cards, but when you can pull it off, they provide nice effects. Again, this feels like something that should have been here all along, so kudos to the designers for making it work.

The last module I am not so fond of playing. It adds a fair bit more fiddliness, by forcing you to both go to the Rexxon lab every turn and then often, track a special zombie, with special powers, as more and more of them flood the board. The other thing that the Rexxon module adds is a bunch of over-powered weapons and ambiance breakers. This module is fine if you want a Resident Evil experience, with lots of jump scares and portal guns. If you are really tuned into The Walking Dead vibe however, all of this corny sci-fi kind of busts the vibe.

This game really blew me away with its sense of vastness. Its smorgasbord of subsystems really bring its theme alive and create a unique experience. Among the triumphs of this design are 2-player semi-cooperative play, mitigation of cooperative "quarterbacking", consequential death to player characters without player elimination, delivering on a different aspect of the zombie theme than usually seen, and even a simple system of character development and emergent narrative through the Crossroads cards.

My only reservation about this game is that zombies aren't exactly my favorite theme. But this game embraces and also transcends its theme. I'll be keeping my eyes out for a future "Crossroads" game with a theme more attractive to me.

Raxxon is crap, we immediately found the extremely OP drone card, had no betrayer and then autowon without any effort, no challenge, no suspense. I doubt this was playtested at all.
The other modules are ok but I would never ever buy this if I had the base game.

Better, cleaned up version of Dead of Winter. Stand Alone "Expansion" that is more like a final product where Dead of Winter feels like a Beta product. Characters and items have been rebalanced slightly. The power scale is different making some character from the original just feel bad in comparison. It also includes a variety of extra option pieces. This allows you to expand the game and modular control over what you want to play with. 

A very fun game that has lots of replayability and can be scaled up or down depending on the group.

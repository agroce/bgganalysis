WW2 Pacific naval whole campaign game (1941 - 1945).
Japan versus USA and British.
This might have been my favorite game, or at least my first favorite game.
My old copy was so beat up, the box was falling apart.

RATING: 8
Somewhat abstracted game covering the Pacific theater. This is not about forcing unconditional surrender from the Japanese.  Instead, each player earns points for controlling zones.  For the first half of the game, the Japanese player has the overwhelming advantage, and then it flips to the allied player at the end.  The winner will be the player who scores the most total points after 8-9 turns.  It is a very fun game and like I said, it's a conceptual game based on history.  Not a ton of meat, but worthwhile, nevertheless.

RATING: 6.5
It's a very interesting game that is more abstract than it first appears. It has the character of a go game underneath the wargame. Definitely rewards experience, with a set of opening moves and responses that can cause devastation if an inexperienced or inattentive player makes an error. Would like to play more, but cannot see this becoming a "lifestyle" game as it is for some.

RATING: 8
Victory in the Pacific is a 2 player game of low complexity. It's a strategic level game simulation of the war in the Pacific in WWII. From the first attack on Pearl Harbor to the decisive Battle of the Philippine Sea in late 1944.  All the major combat ships in the Japanese and Allied navies are portrayed. The game board shows all the Pacific battle areas from the Hawaiian Islands in the East, the Aluetian Islands in the north, the Coral Sea in the South, the Bay of Bengal in the West and the Indian Ocean. Most of the tactical details represented by artificial, simple game mechanics.
Special rules; marines, capturing ports and bases, submarines, night & day actions, airstrikes, raiding ships, patrolling ships and land-based air units.

Expected playing time is about 3.5 - 4 hours.

A classic from the 70s that has not aged well at all. Not a terrible choice to introduce your young-adult child to wargaming with, but I would say there are many more recent, superior titles (of comparable or less complexity) to choose from. You might start with Columbia games, We the People, or even Battle Cry. Basically works, but the state of the art has left it behind.

RATING: 7
Neat high level game on the War in the Pacific, with some simple-but-effective mechanisms (raiding and patrolling, turn order) to capture some of the flavour of the campaign. The nature of the game is such that the initial Japanese tide will eventually be halted by the gathering strength of the US, but there is plenty of good gaming here despite the abstraction and its venerable age
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Probably best enjoyed with someone who doesn't know the game that well.  Hardcore players will do cheesy things like have the Japanese take Hawaii, historically preposterous. I won't play without a house rule that the Japanese can never control Hawaii.  Great silhouettes, varying ship ratings, fast and fun combat, everything a Pacific game should have but so few of them do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Outstanding Game.  Playable, fast, easy to understand, and still, amazingly, a good simulation of WWII against the Japanese.  I have not played this in decades, but would play again if asked.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
There is a great deal of depth to this game, beyond what you might expect from the simple rules.

The sequence of play is straight forward, but the interplay of patrolling, land based air and raiders gives each side the opportunity to bluff, misdirect, and surprise their opponents.

Replayability is high, but hinges on the IJN player's willingness to experiment.  If he chooses the same approach each time, replay value will of course suffer.   

In my experience combat is very bloody, with more ships sunk then damaged, and almost as many disabled.

This is a classic worth exploring.  It isn't pretty, but it may well be the best treatment of World War II's Pacific Theater yet made.  Euro gamers may well discover it is the best Area Control game out there.

An elegant massive-wristage game that somehow manages to simulate the war in the Pacific Theater almost flawlessly.  A history lesson in cardboard.  Strategy counterbalanced by tension as the Japanese player strikes ruthlessly, then defends as the American sleeping giant awakens.  Spectacular.

I have super fond memories of playing (and often losing) this as a kid, so when my girlfriend bought this for me for Christmas a couple years ago, I was ecstatic. It's a relatively easy strategy game to get into, and doesn't go on for hours on end due to the capped number of turns. The simple tiles for unit markers are perhaps not as engaging or fun as the elaborate pieces found in games these days, but it still retains the old magic, for me.

The War at Sea system grown up and turned into a real game. This is design for effect at a fairly high level of abstraction, but the game actually has a fair degree of simulation value given the playable format and playable time. The "heavier" games multiply the complexity and components by ten, and don't get much bang for the buck in terms of outcomes that bear a greater relation to reality.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is a great game - I have played it over 100 times. Skill is the most important factor. The impulse movement system creates a lot of tension throughout the game.

RATING: 9
Avalon Hill game.  Simplistic grand naval strategy game of World War II in the Pacific.  This game, although abstracted with combat boiled down to generalistic combat, demonstrates the essence of the power of air and the surprising night actions that took place through out 1941 - 1945 in the Pacific.  This game can be a very tight 1:1 game and is played in tournaments across the United States every year.  This game is also very fun to play.  And if you are a naval enthusiast, all the major capital ships that took place in the Pacific during WWII are present.  Sometimes jokingly called DICE IN THE PACIFIC, the only draw back is that if someone gets lucky rolling dice at the right time, battles can be lopsided.  This element plays out well and situations like what happened at Midway or the night action off Guadalcanal after the initial invasion have the potential to be replicated. Numerous battles have had elements of luck to swing the battles through out history and VITP has this.  Of course, players that play the odds and stack advantage in their favor win out in most battles most of the time.  Victory in the Pacific also models very well the dynamic of Japanese invincibility in the early part of the war and the turn of the tide for initiative and then military naval dominance exemplified by industrial production and the sheer number of Allied warships built and deployed to the Pacific Threater from mid 1943 on.  Lastly, two players can play the whole Pacific naval war in under 6 hours with no down time and have a blast doing it.  The game can also be very tense when competitively close with two experienced players which is why this 1977 game has had such a strong following over the years.  Although simplistic, Victory in the Pacific is one of the most fun to play war games of all time and ranks in my top 20 war games of all time.

I've only played as the Japanese. Got badly hammered when I got behind the curve (I'm not a particularly aggressive gamer). I remember one bloodbath when I sent my carrier fleet to take India & got caught in a night battle by the canny Allied player. I also have the consolation of a perfect start that saw all the US carriers & most of their capital ships sunk for the loss of a single Japanese light carrier.

Don't let the age of the game obscure the fact that it is a very good one.

Simple but good PTO game. It's a cousin of [i]War at Sea[/i] but clearly the better game of the two, if longer. It adds surface vs air combat, land based air units, amphibious operations and even submarines, but manages to keep it all straightforward and the chrome is minimal. It is a bit too long, but not fatally so.

So, if you're in the mood to play a simpler PTO game and/or you're looking for something you can introduce to budding young wargamers, this is a good choice.

Combat is a little awkward and I'm not sure I like the fact that the US always gets to respond.  While that makes good historical sense it kind of kills the enjoyment of the game for me.  Additionally, I'm not overly fond of a point system to determine a winner for a wargame.

Well I'm definitely in the love it camp.‭ ‬I think VITP is an incredible achievement considering it is from the mid‭ ‬70s.‭ ‬Try and see past the garish mapboard and the lack of a CRT‭ (…‬.for so long the fundamental of a‭ '‬realistic‭' ‬consim‭)‬.‭ ‬My comments are as a newbie and based on only a few sessions but after a bit of stuttering start the penny dropped and I'm a fan.

Thing s I like best:

PLANNING‭ – ‬you need to figure out a war-winning strategy and then plan your moves accordingly.‭ ‬Of course there will be an element of improvisation here and there but do that every turn and your almost bound to lose.

FORCE STRUCTURE‭ – ‬lots of juggling and balancing to be done with patrollers,‭ ‬raiders,‭ ‬heavy slow ships,‭ ‬light fast ships,‭ ‬carriers,‭ ‬land air and marines all in the mix.‭ ‬Deciding on what is needed for each zone each turn is a real challenge

PRIMACY OF AIRPOWER‭ – ‬carriers and land air can easily carry the day if the search rolls work out.‭ ‬They can plug away at unprotected ships with impunity and the threat of their use is as scary as their actual use especially if you have a base that straddles two or more zones...Guadalcanal for instance‭ ;‬-‭). 

KEY STRATEGIC PACIFIC LOCATIONS‭ – ‬Well Truk,‭ ‬Midway,‭ ‬Guadalcanal all come out in different ways as key locations to fight over‭; ‬whether it is how the Midway zone juts into the Japanese areas or how Guadalcanal allows air units to pressurixe bothe the Coral Sea and the US Mandate area with their viatl Samoan base.

Some opportunities for improvement:

BODYCOUNT -  No morale problems here for our cardboard warriors. The amount of metal that starts littering the sea bed is staggering.  What with the normal slugging battle rounds followed by equally deadly pursuit rounds it’s no surprise. I’m not actually 100% sure that the sinking rate is unhistorical  but suspect it is...maybe I need to dig out some tonnage lost graphs or similar and do a comparison to one of my games.

UNLIMITED JAPANESE FUEL OIL - The entire IJN can sortie to the max every turn. Anyone whose played the Japanese side in Pacific Fleet and had to eke out the tiny allowance of fuel will find VITP a radical change. I’m assuming PF designer Hiroaki Sato is correct then the IJN in VITP should be severely curtailed in what they can do each turn...especially deep raiding. Mind you the game would not be as much fun

PRIMACY OF AIRPOWER - Yes it is powerful but the game mechanics allow you to shift airpower around just about to your heart’s content. One turn you can pile the entire Japanese airforce into the Indian Ocean if you so wish and next turn have it all descend on the Aleutians. Yes I know you need airbases in the areas to do that and yes I know each turn is 3-4 months long but....I suppose it’s down to choices; every model must simplify somewhere and that means, at the extremes, the effects can be odd. 
Overall though a most enjoyable sim.

&quot;Classic&quot; Avalon Hill wargame based on the Pacific war of World War II. After getting a few rules wrong in the Pearl Harbour raid, we restarted the game and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Simple mechanics but interesting decisions abound. The Japanese take a massive lead early then must hang on until the end of turn 8. Recommended, but I think Columbia&#039;s &quot;Pacific Victory&quot; just edges it out.

Having been taught (and soundly thumped many times) by Allan Applebaum, I can say that VITP has a lot more strategic depth than it gets credit for. The better play almost always wins--despite its reputation, luck is not overwhelming.

Terribly dated now, not that it was that fantastic a game to begin with. Very random combat system that encourages the Allies to take a gamble with its forces, hoping to score a decisive victory against the Japanese.

An excellent low complexity game that has aged well.

The day-glo colors of the map are my only negative.

I've always dreamed of playing the entire Pacific War. I've yet to get into a real monster rendition of it, but this one was lots of fun. 

These comments are based on only one play, as Japanese. I have a feeling the game will hold up for me though, I liked it a lot.

I've always wanted to play a war game that has the kind of big momentum swing this one has. As the Japanese, I did indeed run wild across the Pacific - until... I found the decisions I had to make very interesting, and very historically appropriate. I won't go so far as to say "accurate," because the game is abstracted quite a bit. In fact, at one point I realized it could be made into a pretty interesting abstract strategy game without too much tweaking. But I digress.

As Japan, I had the run of the place initially, but from the very beginning I had to decide what was important and what to let go. I could have sold out and tried to invade Hawaii, for instance. That is a valid strategy, and if I'd pulled it off, I'd have won for sure. In fact, I want to try that sometime. Instead, I took an aggressive but flexible approach. I found that left me with a series of very interesting, very tense choices on every turn. How to allocate my limited resources? 

Interestingly, once the tide turned (and US units started entering the fray), I had the same number of interesting choices, but very different ones. Where would the US player allocate his somewhat scarce, but growing, resources? Especially in air and amphibious unit placement, I found there to be a pretty interesting bluff element, although it was minor.

There are some pretty gamey elements. As the Japanese, in the final few turns, I was so intent on keeping the US battling on the perimeter that I launched an unsupported amphibious invasion of Johnston Island - and it succeeded! That was only to force the US to divert some resources to an unimportant area, but if I'd have more airpower, I could have damaged him some from there. If you could have seen the map at that time, you'd know how "unrealistic," even for an abstract game, that was. I found very few such complaints overall.

In summary, this game was something I'd been looking for most of my gaming life. An interesting, deep game about the entire Pacific War, but simple enough for me to not only play, but play quite well, on my first try. And, we played it in a single sitting.

This was one of the first war games that I owned.  My opponent and I had a heck of a time decifering all the rules, because we were quite new to war games.  I'm sure that if I still owned it, I could play it now.  This game was on a board and not a map.  Players had to fight naval battles as well as land battles on various islands.  Warships, planes, and Marines are the main-stay of this game.  The counters of this game were of better quality than others of the old Avalon Hill games.

I never really got into this game, maybe because it's too chess-like (i.e. the TKO in Three opening).  Bonaparte at Marengo is chess-like in that chance does not play a part in combat resolution, but there is uncertainty due to the hidden units.  Puerto Rico has a fixed opening, but there is still a good deal of tactical play.  VitP is chess-like in that it has too much perfect information and feels dry.

One of the best wargames of all time because of its design choices and focus on big decisions, all with great colour. The mechanisms and the quality of the production are excellent.

The flow is fast and furious and fate can swing in pretty dramatic ways. History is not insulted. Victory in the Pacific is never dull.Victory in the Pacific took the excellent system from War at Sea and made it more involved and slightly more realistic. Most of all they made it a better game. Once I did get to play Victory at Sea, which combines the two, and I hope to again someday. Still, for a balance of gameplay and history, you can't still can't beat Victory in the Pacific, going strong now for over 30 years.

So, when is L2 going to finally give this game the face-lift it deserves?

Game is fairly easy to learn. Game balance is adequate. Historical feel is, for the most part, maintained in this moderate-complexity game. The Japanese have an early size advantage, surprise attack, and a need to control vital regions, such as Indonesia. The Allies rely on strong manufacturing capability and late war surges to win. The game is playable in a few hours. 
On the down side, set-up takes time, and you shouldn’t lose any ship counters. 
When compared to its sister game, War at Sea, Victory in the Pacific's game balance is superior and replay capability is stronger.

One of Avalon Hill's classics, and one of the cleanest of the old AH games. Simple, yet rich in history and strategy. Great re-playability.

I don't want to be too hard on A&A, but the comparisons are obvious, and VITP is the hands down better game.

I really enjoy this very playable Pacific Theater game.  The rules and gameplay are much easy to implement that Flat Top, without losing much strategy or theme.

RATING: 7
Victory in the Pacific is a time-tested reduction of WWII Pacific theater naval combat, focusing on ships and the general swing of the war, and measuring performance by area control.

It nicely balances the early dominance of war-ready Japan with the later industrial dominance of the US/Allies, and once players digest the rules and flow plays very quickly.

Like a wargame management of odds and forces is key to victory/survival, but driving to take areas away from one's opponent can be a worthwhile risk to help swing the dominance of area controlled.

Points awarded per area also vary based on the relative strategic importance to the holder, so the Indian Ocean is worth 2 pts to Japan, but does not give positive benefit to the Allies for retention.

All of this adds up to what is almost a Weuro, but has a classic AH feel to it at the same time.

After a first play (on Memorial Day) I am starting this at a solid 7. It's an enjoyable wargame experience that will not kill your logistical brain, or eat your whole day, but is undeniably classic, and makes a compelling struggle for two players.

Rating for nostalgia only.

War at Sea was my first wargame. Victory in the Pacific followed shortly, as I got addicted to AH's mail order service. Victory expands upon the simple mechanics of War at Sea, and makes it possible to conduct a bunch of "What if?" The combat is abstracted, but it makes sense from an RPG aspect: roll more dice for more firepower, for every "hit", reroll for damage, and then place damage markers up to the strength of the enemy ship. This is similar in execution to Titan (but without rerolling for damage).

It is a neat, sweet game that plays relatively quickly for what it covers. There are some annoying abstractions, such as the effects of submarines, and lack of light cruisers, but this is minor. The game amply demonstrates the futility of the Japanese going to war against the Americans, as the order of battle clearly shows the economic tide turning. However, it is equally nail-biting in the first few turns as the Americans desperately try to keep it together. The game is more about conveying the feeling on both sides than it is about historical accuracy, and it delivers it in spades.

One of the greatest wargames of all time, this game was an unlikely gem.  It takes its system from War at Sea, a fun but historically silly game, yet produces a game that is not only fun but amazingly realistic.  The basic game features too many night (i.e. surface) combats, but the optional task forces rule lessens this problem.  The role of ground forces is downplayed by the game system, but they are still here.  Almost thirty years later, if you are looking for a game on WWII in the Pacific with a focus on naval units, you can't do better than VitP.

Well done medium complexity game on the Pacific theatre.  More detail oriented than its sibling War at Sea and much less abstract, offering a more channeled decision making process.  The basic mechanics will be easy for someone who has played WaS to pick up and the game moves along at a good clip.  I like War at Sea slightly better (more "pure" in allowing the players to formulate strategy), but VitP is certainly a design I'll play again.

If a historical critique is necessary, it is that the game overlooks the strangling of the Japanese access to natural resources by Allied submarines and interdiction (see Fire in the Sky for a loving look at that).  It's certainly a competitive design without this part of the war, however, so gamers should not be deterred from seeking it out on such grounds.

One of my favorite games!  A cross between USN and Yahtzee, it offers relentless action, a chance for both player to attack, a chance for both players to suffer, and so many die rolls that I'm tempted to wear an elbow brace.  Great counters are matched only by strange color combinations on the map that cause weird color-shuttling optical illusions when I'm tired.  People argue about which side is favored; my own personal feeling is that the game is at its best when the superior player is Japanese.

It is fairly simple and easy to learn, but not so superficial that you've got it figured out in twenty minutes - and the endless tumbling of dice can occasionally unmake the best strategy through sheer random chance.  Irritating?  I don't know - I kind of like that "adrift on the seas of fate" feeling - but I'm a notorious flake.

One of the great classic wargames.  VITP expands the rather dry and limited War at Sea system into a tense, exciting strategic game.  Often criticized unfairly as a "dicefest;" in fact, between good players the game is largely a contest of subtle maneuvers.  A dedicated PbEM and ftf commununity support the game and hold regular competitions.  The rules are actually not any more complicated than many Eurogames and this would be a good crossover game for a Eurogamer interested in trying wargames.

Surprisingly for a game having the same playing style as War at Sea, this game hasn't really caught my attention in the same way as WAS. It feels to be a bit too much of a "machine war" game. Hurl lots of ship counters in stacks of the same type at each other and see what happens while huge number of dies are rolling everywhere over the board. On top of this bomb out every ship you see with plenty of plane counters. A bit too much somehow...

The War at Sea system moves to the Pacific with Marines and a lot more ships.  This is one of those games where one side starts out fast, then must hold on until the end to achieve victory,  The Japanese run all over the Pacific during the first few turns, then must hang on while stacks of U.S. carriers arrive mid game.  Not quite as good as WAS, but very close.

Thanks, madmanrick, for the trade. I like the fairly simple rules for this one. It looks like a rare grand strategy type game that I'd actually want to play. I usually run from games set at that high level of abstraction.

Reliable sources tell me this is rendered obsolete by Pacific Victory.

One of the finest game in the hobby.  I have played this countless times.  I now believe that it is balanced towards the Allies.  Moving second in this game is a huge advantage.

RATING: 9
I love this game.  I think the Japanese have the advantage.  That advantage can be offset by bidding for the side to play or with special optional rules (I prefer the bidding method).  It does take a while to play and there is a lot of dice rolling.  The dice make it dated by today's standards.  I would nearly always be willing to play this if asked to do so.

Just a terrific game, with remarkable nuance & depth, as well as amazing replayability.  It took me ages to get into this game, as it's kind of ugly, the rules are rather dense and strategic treatments have never really been my thing , but I'm so glad I persevered.  Now I'm addicted.
Get the sequence of play flowcharts in the Files section - incredibly helpful for learning the many, MANY steps in the game turn.

Goes to show that some wargaming design *hasn't* progressed since the hey-day of AH in the '70's.  Using elegant, innovative systems, Hamblen allows the recreation of the strategic pacific campaigns in a refreshing manner, since heretofore they have never been my favorites.  Though the game is long, it doesn't feel long, because so much is being done and there is so little downtime.  A true classic gem and I look forward to a replay or three.

One of my earlier experiences with wargames. It was relatively simple and had lots of dice rolling but there were still a lot of tough decisions to make. This and the Russian Campaign were my most frequently played wargames many years ago.

The published rules need a little bit of tweaking but this is essentially a very solid, enjoyable, fast-playing and balanced little game which - remarkably - manages to produce results which are at least as plausible as other games which are much longer and more complex.  This is one of those rare wargames which I think all gamers should try at least once.  Lots of dice, but not really luck-dominated.  There is a lot of play and and a lot of strategy in this game.

RATING: 7
It took me about 10 play sessions to feel like I was getting a grip on game play for "Victory in the Pacific," but enough to see why experienced players have commented that although this game is relatively easy to learn (3 on the ol' A-H 10-point scale), there is a lot of strategy. 

Players do one special round that simulates attacks on Pearl Harbor and in Indonesia (vs. British units) and then there are a maximum of 8 turns. By Turn 6 the US is cranking out huge numbers of units while Japan is basically unable to replace its losses. 

There are strategy articles about how to play this game, which is wisely designed primarily to be a GAME. Even though this is supposed to be a low complexity game, I still don't find the rules easy to follow. The rules take up about 6 pages and although generally well-written, they are copy-heavy, in a small point-size, and could have been better cross-referenced. There is one page listing an example of play, and one page of Starting Allied Forces (for Turn 1). I finally rewrote the rules to three pages of condensed type. 

Even so, the game works within its design structure, as battles can go either way. It's not something I play often, but its positive reputation to this day is deserved.

I agree with Calandale when he says that while all the die-rolling does mitigate the luck factor, it is just annoying. I would not call this a "bad" game (hence the four rating rather than a three rating). I can understand the appeal. However, if I am going to play a game with this level of simplicity, it should take less time to play than this one does. As such, it shares a similarity to Axis and Allies - it is too simple and too long for my taste.

This game offers a very special approach to the players: Instead of giving a certain amount of choices each turn (like in modern games), you get all the famous ships of the conflict and complete freedom of action from Pearl Harbor to the final days of the IJN. After setting up the game and explaing the rules to my friend, we both set plotting strategy for about half an hour ...

This makes it a very fine game in my oppinion. Something like chess with dice to resolve "combat" and the Yamato/Iowa instead of the queen.

Absolutely excellent game of low-to-medium complexity, covering the naval war in the Pacific from Pearl Harbour to 1944-45.  Units are mainly warships, plus some counters for marines and land-based air units.  It's a development of Avalon Hill's & John Edwards' "War at Sea" system.  Victory in the Pacific is one of the few wargames that is as good now as it was 40 years ago when it was published.  Suitable for beginners or experienced gamers wanting a simple, quick, fun, competitive and strategic Pacific WW2 wargame.

Not sure I "get" the popularity of this one. I still haven't got my mind around the concepts of the "speed rolls." It seems as though it should end in a US victory about halfway through the game. Doesn't scratch my itch for a good PTO strategic level game, partially due to being almost all naval.

It plays like a mother, though, lots of tension, good action. It is nice that all the capital ships are named with ratings, but low sim value otherwise except at the most abstract level. Still prefer War at Sea, although that seems a minority opinion.

For a low complexity game, it really doesn't get much better than this.  Even though the graphics are dated by today's stardards, I still love to pull this one out.

A "fun" wargame that sacrifices detail for playability.  Fairly simple rules and engaging play.

This is a solid game with some big decisions to be made by each side.  I had a couple of quibbles with the rules, but those were just that, quibbles.  There are only two downsides to the game.  First is the length of the game, it is long.  Second, if I am playing a game that is this long, I prefer a little more beef to it.

RATING: 5
A lot like Dicing at Sea, er, War at Sea. It does suffer a lot from the buckets of dice syndrome, but at least there's both strategic and tactical play to the game. One of the worst game maps ever to be put in a wargame.

It is however fun to play if you like things at this level. It's a great filler game for those times you're waiting to start something more serious.

An excellent game of the entire Pacific war which is playable in a reasonable amount of time.  May be a bit too abstract and luck dependent for some grognards.

RATING: 7
One of the few wargame rulesets that I could handle - barely - in years long past.  Fond memories of this one.

Update:

Back in the saddle again after 20 years! Longer and (slightly) more sophisticated than its Atlanto-European cousin.  Still worth owning, but at 5 hours it won't get nearly as much play as it once did.

The choice between patrolling and raiding, and the associated timing of fleet movements, is still downright cool.

Good wargame for the naval war in the Pacific. Large area movement made it more about the fleets than the islands.

Same system as its sister game War at Sea.

Another game with lots of die rolling and I think it is balanced in favor of the Allies due to all the way raiding works in this game.

Very fast and easy.

Sencillo y apasionante, ideal para iniciarse en juegos sin motor de cartas. Para los que quieren sencillez y jugabilidad sin renunciar a la profundidad.

A simple and very popular game on the War in the Pacific, but somehow after several playings it never captured my imagination. The combat mechanics I can live with, but it's the 'area control' stuff that turn me off. Still, many consider this a classic.

From the perspective of a non-wargamer (but a history student) this was quite fun.  A lot of dice rolling which may not appeal to all, but very strategic and interesting.  A good deal of strategy available here in a simple setting.

RATING: 8
Great. So much strategy for such a simple game. Not very historical in terms of gameplay. But fun. It does press home one significant point though. Just by looking at the reinforcement schedule it is clear exactly how unavoidable a Japanese defeat was in the Pacific. Either with or without Midway, the U.S. Navy would significantly have outproduced the Japanese by 1944.

A great game that I've used several times to introduce newbies to wargaming. Plays quickly. A huge step up from War at Sea.

Terrific, fun and playable game. Captures the flavor of the WWII Pacific naval campaign surprisingly well.

This game certainly deserves more than just one play. At the first time it just feels too complicated and counter-intuitive for being a family game. I think that no other seemingly light game has caused this much analysis paralysis at the first play. But I can see how Kairo would evolve into a tight and fun game once all players have gathered several plays under their belts.

This one is like a cousin to [thing=9209][/thing].  You do one of 3 actions balancing victory points, money, and availability.  It has a lot of balance and a make-believe theme, which is par for a Euro.  It's barely more complicated than Ticket, which is to say it's really not complicated at all.  But in the end, I kind of like the aspect of solving the puzzle and this one has more interaction than many Euros, which I find interesting, so it's one I'd agree to playing when I have about an hour, and I'm going to have some fun with it.

Modified version of Finnish game Tori and the modification drive the game towards family friendliness. Theme is dull but otherwise I like the changes - scoring is simplified but works well and continuous scoring through out the game keeps the interest up nicely. They've also done a good job in keeping the essential elements of Tori in Kairo.

Suggest.

Light family game with a nice mix of strategy and luck, and some room to get better with repeated plays. I liked the rules for scoring the medals, which I thought were really unique: the first player to score a color gets both medals and scores both right away. After this, a player can take away someone else's medal, but it only scores once (though throughout the game this could happen multiple times). Blocking is the most useful strategy of the game, especially with the customers, and the timing of luring customers is critical: you want to lure one customer to get another of the desired color in his place. Pretty good game.

UPDATE: Played again and found it extremely repetitive and dry.

An interesting tactical game of balancing the growth of your market stalls with trying to lure customers to your stalls to fund even more expansion.

A neat balance of two different currencies, money and points.  You score points for expanding market stalls, but you can only expand if you've lured enough customers to your existing stalls to make money to expand.  An interesting problem!

Much of the game is simply responding the the board state when your turn comes around.  While you will probably have some long-term goals, good timing is absolutely essential in this game, so you will often find yourself delaying your plans in order to respond to the board situation on your turn.

There's also good room in this game for screwing over other players.  I don't care for screwage in "take that" type games, but I really like the way it is done here.  It takes clever play and good timing to screw people over, which I generally like in games.

Overall, a fairly quick and good game if you like a good dose of tactics in your games.

Piac építős, területről kiszórítós játék, aminek különlegességét a bevétel speciális megszerzése adja. A standjainkhoz kell megfelelő vásárlókat vonzani es ebből a bevételből tudjuk bővíteni a pultjainkat. Igen ám, de a vásárlók mindig a legközelebbi, számukra érdekes standhoz mennek, de szegények agybajt kaphatnak, mert a piac épülegetése miatt ez folyamatosan változik.

Queen gameshez képest meglepően sakk-szerű, nem annyira családi játék. Engem emiatt kicsit le is fárasztott, de összeségében nagyon ötletes, jópofa játéknak találom. Nagyon érdekes még a vásárlócserélős mechanizmus is. Kicsit fura, hogy nagyon hirtelen vége lehet a játéknak, ráadásul érzésem szerint elég nagy előnye van annak, aki befejezi, mivel a játék során nagyon kiegyenlített pontok születnek, így szinte csak a végén nálad lévő medálok döntenek a végső sorrendben.

RATING: 6
While you might approach the great bazaar of Cairo with some idea of a strategy it will fairly quickly drown in the din. Changing and expanding stalls, dithering customers, and building opportunities available require a very tactical course of action. It's mostly about reacting to board changes than formulating plans and executing them.

The beginning of the game is a bit slow but as stalls grow and the market labyrinth begins to grow things get more interesting. All through the game, however, its tactical nature is somewhat at odds with the need to carefully analyze board positions and count spaces.

And with the obvious thematic similarities, Stefan Dorra's Marracash is a more strategic game while Kairo is a bit more casual-friendly with a good dose of intentional and accidental screwage.

The crowded board is neat. The result of the board play is a sort of maze where previously great property can be turned into a back alley slum. That's pretty clever. The fiddlyness of exchanging meeples and different colored coin might get old quick though.

I have had Kairo since late 2013 and my desire to play it was low. I didn’t expect anything good from the game, but I was pleasantly surprised, it is better and with more depth than I was expecting.
 
The rules are easy to teach. You can do it under 8 minutes. Playtime is around 90 minutes.
 
The game´s components are from ok to good. The art is ok. My copy of the game came with a missing rulebook and Queen Games has always been a difficult publisher to ask for replacements so I’m not hopeful about this issue.

The theme isn’t my cup of tea, but you don’t feel it through the game, it is almost an abstract game.

The cards of the game came to be punched, that’s the first time I have seen something like this, but it works! I prefer regular card though but this doesn’t bother me one way or another. The cards have a weird size so sleeve them was a pain.
 
Gameplay is more fun than I thought it would be. On your turn you can do 3 different actions (move a customer, build a stall or take cards) and what action to do isn’t that obvious (it isn’t that hard either). Moving customers is almost automatically as they always will go to the nearest stall unless you play a card, but knowing when to build and what to build is fun. The game flows quickly.

There is luck of the draw with the cards and they determine where you can build but there are wild cards so the luck factor isn’t that high.

Best with 3 players.

Bottom line, I was expecting a very bad game from Queen Games and I was pleasantly surprised. Kairo is not a game for me though, but I could play again if requested. It is a harmless game that can be good to introduce new gamers to our hobby, but I crave heavier experiences. I will sell it ASAP.

Reminds me a little bit of Medina in the way paths must be maintained and the coloured money is similar to Alhambra.  It's a mix of game mechanics that works, but still feels like there's something missing.  I like the game, but I think with a little more development, it could be much, much better.

I've never played Tori, but have seen it played and have heard of the changes from the designer himself. This looks a lot better and is somewhat gentler. Although the approach to the game is totally different, Kairo reminisces a lot to Alhambra. Six differently valued colors, different currencies and tile placing in this case define a Queen game in my opinion. There's also a third ghost player for the two player game. What really makes the game shine though is the customers-changing-colors mechanism which is also thematically really reasonable.

For what is basically an abstract game, Kairo is inordinately complex, with six currencies, cards to determine placement of new market stands, cards to more effectively lure customers towards your stand, and so on. That whole fairly undigestible package is then voided of any strategical depth by making you very, very vulnerable to the actions of other players.

What is left is a purely tactical puzzle of mediocre interest, which seems not a fair exchange after digging through the rules. Queen Games certainly prettied this up quite a bit – in fact, the great material elevates my rating by a whole point – but they should rather have invested the effort into a bit of development. There is a game in here, possibly, but in its published state, it is very well hidden from me.

This is an excellent game. I have played it as well as its predecessor Tori several times. Although I liked Tori a lot, Kairo is even more balanced and polished, so definitely worth to try out.

Particularly the color-changing mechanism that represents the changing of the customers' preferences is something I haven't seen before in other games.

I have mixed feelings towards this abstract market game. On one hand, I like how you place differently colored market tiles to be closest to the differently colored customers and particularly how each customer is replaced once it has been lured to a market. On the other hand, there seems to be a strange dynamic in the game. Matching a customer and a market of the same color brings more money of that color to the game which brings even more markets of that color, which brings even more money of that color and so on until the exhaustion of the tiles triggers a pre-mature end game. My first game was over in just a few rounds.

I need to play more to assess Kairo but for the moment I'm inclined to agree with many comments that the game doesn't seem to be fully developed.

A combination of the old Marracash, trying to get the right stalls in the right places to serve as many customers as possible, and Fresh Fish, where the placement of new stalls creates short and long routes for customers to travel to get to stalls - they'll always go to the closest. Your actions on a turn are fairly limited - move a customer (hopefully to one of your stalls) to get money, use that money to expand a stall to get VPs, pick up cards that allow you to expand a stall in the area you want. There's some interesting mechanics in play because Marracash and Fresh Fish have fair pedigree, but both eventually hit the trade pile, and this doesn't rise above those not-so-giddy heights. Frankly, it's not exciting or challenging taking multiple short actions to build up the arsenal to expand and get VPs, and then repeating the same process multiple times with slight variations.

This game surprised me in apositive way. After reading the typical Queen-Games-not-so-long rulebook, I thought 'how can this be any fun?'. But I must say that it's harder then it looks and requires some good planning during the game. I think the only disadvantage is that the shining number of this game is 4 players, as it's probably the only number you will have a very crowded market and possibilities to cut of your fellow players.

I've played this game a few times now, and appreciate it a bit more with each play.  It seems to lack that special spark which would make it a *great* game, but it's definitely a good game.

Several good aspects:  The topology of the board and the placement of the pieces really matters.  It's tough to decide whether to lock up a lead in a color (to guarantee having the medals at the end), or to make a bunch of points off of having the lead bounce back and forth.  Because it's so hard to get the cards you need, you really have to seize what you want when they become available, but often there are several other things you'd rather be doing than drawing cards, making for another tough decision.  I like trying to time the "lure customer" action to bring the off-board customer back at a position that is useful for me.  Length is just right for its depth.

Jogo interessante, com caixa muito bonita e componentes apelativos, apesar de sem grande ligação ao tema. É algo semelhante ao “Through the Desert”, bastante táctico, com maior variedade de opções, embora com menos profundidade.

Good quality components - heavy cardstock and wooden bits for most, but a deck of flimsy oddly shaped cards that get handled a bit in play. Art & design is nice, but it may be a bit hard to keep track of which pieces are whose without your glasses since they're differentiated by icon not color (like Tigris & Euphrates).

I can tell already this is one of those simple to teach, hard to master games. 

First play was 2-player using the suggested setup, and was over quickly because we were scrabbling for control of one color stall instead of exploring other strategies. I'm looking forward to another round!

1 play, 3er

The game has a bit of Alhambra in it -- several different types of currency -- but is otherwise totally different. You start with a bunch of size-1 market stalls on the board, and a hand of cards corresponding to some areas of the board. All but one customer is on the board. On your turn, you either move a customer to the nearest stall of its color (hopefully your own!) for cash, expand one of your stalls (using money of that color; may sub other color pairs per coin), or take more cards (either more market cards, or market crier who allows you later to move customers past a nearby stall). If you do deliver a customer, he goes off the board and is replaced by the customer previously off-board. And the bigger the market stall, the higher the cash payout. In addition, when you expand a stall, you get VP according to size. Also, if you tie or exceed the current largest stall, you get VP chit(s) -- which pass around like Longest Road in Settlers. The game ends when expansion pieces in 1-2 colors run out: finish the game with players only building. The player with the most VP wins!

It's not bad, I guess, but it wasn't great. I'd try it again, if someone else brings it to the table.

A slightly older game I hadn't played yet. And like post Queen titles, it's got great art, great bits, a huge box and a nice set of rules. And it's family friendly. There is enough strategy there to be worth playing for gamers as well. I don't think the replay value is particularly high, there's not too many different strategies to try out. But it plays well, has the right play length for it's complexity and it is enjoyable.

Kairo retains the bazaar format and multicolored customers of MarraCash but little else.  The result is a modern, somewhat fussy design that wants you to be certain that it is different.  Kairo is a great game that friends ask for by name but I fear it is only because the theme is so rare.

The game is bone dry, very tactical and ultimately boring. I don't say that lightly since I do enjoy most Euros....dry Mediterranean trading Euros. To say that the game is not well developed would not be right. Yet, something is not exactly right. Case in point, there is a deck of cards for stall placement. Probably only twice in the entire game people drew cards to replenish their hands. That's it, twice. When that happens, it tells you that something is not quite right game development wise. 
Other than that, the game feels hurried, chaotic and purely tactical. As customers are swapped in and out of the board, it feels like building stalls and moving customers are two separate events on the board not really tied with each other.
I believe this one playing is enough to convince me not to play again.

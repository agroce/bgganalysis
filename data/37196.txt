What an enjoyable mass market game! I prefer the version with the yellow board, where a person is knocked back to home if their piece goes in the home. Mostly because I like yelling "Sorry!" in a slightly inappropriate voice. I highly recommend buying this game if you enjoy lighthearted dexterity games.

Well, I've been trying to track this down for some time, being a fan of loopin louie and pitchcar. But no luck - Hasbro UK have no information on the game when I emailed them (can you believe that?).

Good news is I've just finished a meeting in NYC at Time Square and the toys r us was right there. So I'm in the departure lounge at JFK with two copies in my bag. Business trips definitely have a silver lining!

Update - definitely worth carrying across the Atlantic! Had great fun with the kids tonight - started as a test run and we ended up 1 hour later having played all 4 boards. Great with teenagers.

Pretty much a kids game still, but fun too. For the price, it's a great buy. You'll find yourself playing it repeatedly because a game lasts about 10 minutes. Give it a year, however, and this game will be in yard sales across the country.

RATING: 7
This game reminds us that execution matters;  sometimes, it's more important to follow-thru on the little ideas than try to invent the Next Big Thing.   

The gameplay is glaringly obvious but deceptively rich.  And the ball-bearing pawns are so well-made, so perfectly designed for the gameplay, that you are constantly amazed at how well they work.  

Still, this is a small game that doesn't warrant a lot of table-time.  Play it, enjoy it, but in the name of all that is good, don't let it steal table time from the many better games.

1st play: Dexterity games aren't my ideal games and this one is a curling style game with good components and a fast playtime.  However the potential for people to yell "SORRY" and the frustration at getting bumped back to start take it down a notch.  Not awful, but not amazing.

Fun dexterity game that the kids enjoy. It's quick enough that you don't get tired of it. I was a little disappointed that many of our games ended up ties. Out of 5 games we had two two way ties and one three way tie with three players. I'd rather play something like Tumblin Dice.

RATING: 7.5
Fun game. Kind of like shuffleboard and crokinole but up to 4 people coming in at different directions with 4 sliders trying to advance 4 pawns on your scoreboard. At first I thought you just wanted as high score as possible, but in the later rounds strategy enters in trying to get the exact scores you need to advance your pawns exactly into home. Gets a little crowded at the end of a round with 16 sliders but that's ok.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
10 plays of this on my first night of owning and still wanting to play more. The beauty of this game is how simple it is. You shouldn't go into this game expecting the same type of experience you would have playing a game of Puerto Rico or Tigris & Euphrates. This game is pure, brainless fun.

It's worth noting that of the games I have played with this, over half have been with children and the rest have been with peers my own age, and older family members (40+). I have not shown this game to some one who has disliked it. The sliding, the bumping people out of areas, the danger dots, the instant sorry!'s, all of these make a great, fun, fast game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very quick, very simple filler.  It is very similar to table shuffleboard, except the boards are way to small!  I wish they were longer for some more difficult game play.  It is kind of like playing darts, but only standing 3 feet from the board.  Maybe there will be an expansion that "expands" the game board, and my rating will go up significantly.

A light game to maybe start a game night off, but nothing to get really excited about.  The idea is interesting, but frankly I think the "target" board needs to be bigger.  As a round ends there's little to no strategy to protecting your placed pieces.

Rating is based on playing with children. This is a fun and quick game that can be played with children of all ages.

A hybrid of darts and shuffleboard, played on a horizontal surface with these great colored pawns that you send sliding into the scoring zone (or other players pieces). You can also knock some others out of the scoring zone on the central board, and vary up the board configuration. A load of fun, and it doesn't seem the sort of game that could ever get old...though 'deep' it isn't.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Just seems pretty random to me. Maybe I am not good at sliding the sliders, but they always seem to stick so much that I feel it is just too random. I also think the game board needs to be bigger...game is just too flimsy to really get the feel of sliding.

10/20/08 - A few two player games with my wife.   Enjoyable dexterity game for those who enjoy others like Crokinole and Pitch Car.   Reminds me a bit of curling, which is a good thing.

The box shows very minimal shelf wear, however there is a crease and thumbprint sized gouge in the bottom right corner by the Parker Brother marking.  Inside, all the pieces are complete, accounted for, and in good shape.  This game has rarely been played and the scoring pawns are still in their factory sealed bag.  Complete and ready to be played.

Definitely a players'  or parts copy.  The box bottom has a split corner, with some creasing along one side, and the lid shows some wear on a couple of corners too. The thrift tape has been left on, as it is extra difficult to pull off and leaves sticky remains.  Both target boards are present.  The four tracks are present and accounted for, with some slight creasing on the yellow track.  Only 6 side rails reside herein, but 3 blocker rails are present, as are the score boards. Three of the red, yellow, and blue scoring pawns are making an appearance, but only two of the green. One large red rolling pawn is missing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Box lid is dished, slightly creased, and the right corner is split.  Other than that, this is a complete copy of Sorry! Sliders with all pieces, tracks, and targets present and accounted for.

[i]Posted: 12/27/08, Rated: 8[/i]

I realize that a lot of people think that rating "kids' games" is uncool.  Well, tough.  The original [i][gameid=2407][/i] game is well-named.  Therefore, my gut reaction to a similarly-themed game was not very positive.

Then I saw raving comments about it: "I don't know why it works, but it is so much [i]fun![/i]"  That didn't sound like the [i]Sorry![/i] I despise.  After an enthusiastic family reception for [i][gameid=37296][/i], I decided to give another Ameritrash-themed game a try.

And am I ever glad I did.

[i]Sorry! Sliders[/i] [u]works[/u].  There are no fidgety rules, no ambiguities.  Think of it as mini-shuffleboard, with players lagging from different directions.  The pawn-moving aspect is interesting, requiring you to try for specific values as you near the "home" space on your scorecard.

My family is rabid about this game, but I doubt it has the legs to be an eternal favorite.  Minus one point for this "one trick pony" feel.  One of my sons loves to play the role of spoiler: he doesn't care if he wins, so long as he kamikazes other players' tokens into the corners (the [i]Sorry![/i] move for this game).  Minus another point for encouraging this type of play.

Still, an "8" is a more than respectable score. When all is slid and done, [i]Sorry! Sliders[/i] is an easy, fun filler game that has yet to miss the mark.

NEW: My son is now 7. He loves this game. He is also very good at it. I have expressed this with a lot of my simple kid games, but the thing I look for is a game where my kids can defeat me and I don't have to hold back. This game does that. I also tend to really like dexterity games, even if my kids are better at them than I am.

Once again, another hit with my 13 year old daughter.  This was her introduction to a good dexterity game.  I think her favorite part was that I didn't win very many of the 10 games we played in a row.  But, the games were typically short and very close, so I have hope that I will get better at it.  Another thing to note is that the simplest mode is easily a game that could be played with very young kids.  I would have no problem enjoying a game with my 5 year old son or my 7 year old daughter or all of my kids at once.

Just the teeniest hint of strategy, but it's there, unlike regular Sorry!  Since you have some degree of control over what numbers you get for moving your pawns towards home, you can think a little bit about positioning, how to distribute moves early in the game, etc.  Nice little game for some light entertainment.

RATING: 8
This is a really enjoyable use of the Sorry brand name.  The game is a fun dexterity game that reminds me of a table version of shuffleboard.  The components are well-produced and I really appreciate the variety they offer with the target boards.  It's a no-brainer to learn (and teach) as the rules are almost 100% intuitive.  I also like that they have created variants and different ways to set up the boards so that players can mix things up each time they play.  If you want an inexpensive dexterity game that brings variety and fun, this is the one!

RATING: 7
This is on track to be my most played game. It's simple but that means it's simple to explain, set up, and play. There's just enough skill that every once and a while someone does something spectacular and everyone cheers or groans.

The variable board set up makes for some creative ways to play. A long track with people split into teams has made for a nice way to end the night.

Well, sometimes the big boys slip up and issue a good game in between the Hannah Montana Monopoly sets and Star Wars themed Games of Life. 

And this is a pretty darn good game. Not quite as good as Looping Louie but bags of fun none-the-less. Fast, irreverent and with a lot of take that. The sliders have just the right amount of friction so that you can make a controlled slide with a little practise and the board is well designed and well thought out.

Fun for kids and adults alike.

Okay, I like dex games but sometimes you can run into a dog of one.  This isn't one of those.  This game was much better than I expected it to be.  It has the shuffleboard feel (like Tumblin-Dice, as well). But, unlike TD, there is strategy, control and thought that needs to go into each turn, as you have to get to Home by exact count.  It's a quick game and it was fun.  There are four different boards and a few configurations you can set up to keep the game varied.  I was very pleasantly surprised and it was well worth the purchase price ($15). 

3/2009 - it is becoming a regular filler for end of the night.  Too cool of a game!

Great filler, a poor gamers crokinole.  I've modified the rules.  When a pawn reaches home you remove one of your sliders from the game.  This adds some strategy, do you keep more sliders and move all your pawns close to home and risk hitting a sorry and sending one back to start OR do you quickly move pawns to home and reduce the number of sliders you have to use.

Sorry Sliders is a fun and enjoyable game that succeeds perfectly at what it is designed to do.  Here's hoping for many more like this!

This is poor-man's Crokinole, and it's quite easy to learn, but it's a ton of fun!  Somewhat hard to do well at consistently, and the Sorry! elements add a nice few twists - more screwage than average for shuffleboard.  I highly recommend this for lighter sessions or for groups (of semi-inebriates), and at $15, you can't really go wrong.

As far as dexterity games go, this is a fun one.  Still, it is just a dexterity game, and it's rare I'm in the mood for one.  

The extra boards add some variety -- but they are very minor variations, so the game play is still 85% the same even with the different boards.  Hence, I worry about replayability.

If you like games like Carrom or Crokinole but don't feel like laying down the $$$ for a nice set, Sorry Sliders makes a perfect substitute without sacrificing much in the way of game play.  There are even several options here for the game you would like to play to change the game from a carrom feel, to a Crokinole feel, to a more shuffleboard-like experience.

For the price, you really can't go wrong here!

This is an exceptionally fun and addicting game. It's light enough that you don't really care who wins or loses (everyone has fun no matter what). It's really fast with little down time between turns and it plays in about 5 - 15 minutes which is good since it's so addictive that one game often turns into 10. If you're going to buy one game at Wal-Mart, this is the one to get.

I had heard this described as "Crokinole lite." I can see the temptation to make that claim. This isn't necessarily a bad game, but at least after one play, I feel like there's less control over the shot making. The joy with crokinole is the pseudo-billiards approach you can take, planning for combos, angles, deflections, and whatnot. In Sorry! Sliders, it struck me as more of a "fling it in the center and hope for the best."

Maybe I need to work on my "slider shotmaking," or maybe I'm self-conscious of the fact my crokinole board probably cost 8x to 10x the amount. But for now, crokinole is my go-to piece flicking game of choice.

This is a great little game for what it is. I wonder, though, if those who are raving so much about it have ever really played much Crokinole. There's no comparison.

The saving grace here is that Sorry Sliders is so much cheaper and portable. We played a bunch over the holidays with my mom and son, a three generation game. 

I'd be willing to play this one with the kids, but its a poor substitute for Crokinole with the adult game group. I'm still very glad to see a mainstream publisher producing games like this, however.

Everyone who plays it says it was a lot more fun than they expected it to be and is smiling.

Me personally, I'm not a fan of shuffleboard. I find it boring. This game is the same concept-ish, but somehow way more fun, maybe because you are bouncing the sliders off the walls and into opponents' pieces (thus more dynamic), or maybe because the miniature scale is inherently more fun, or maybe because the component quality/aesthetics are more appealing than traditional games. I don't know why it's more fun, it just is. By a lot.

It plays fast and has multiple ways of setting up the board, giving much more variety than shuffleboard.

Never would have expected this to be so much fun.  Great dexterity game with some nice variety for play - the kids love it!  Board warpage is a bit of an issue, but actually I like having the tracks a bit warped since it allows you to "curl" your shot.  The rings on our green/yellow board are assymetrical and the center hole is cut off-center.  Apparently others have noticed the same thing with varying degrees of assymetry.
2p game is much better if each player uses 2 ramps instead of one.

Christmas 2008 gift for family.

Now this is what a dexterity game should be.  Loads of fun with this one.  Played 7 games in a row our first sitting out of the box.  Kids have had a blast.

Tried one game with three "tunnel" pieces in a row and found it very hard to shoot for something.  Think I'll keep a shorter track so that we can target things rather than wipping our pieces down the track.

Great game to play with kids.  The components are fabulous, and well constructed, and if the young child can count, they can make most of the decisions themselves.

Plus, sliding those things and banging into other people's pieces is just plain fun.

Great!  Tabletop shuffleboard.  A simple concept, well-executed.  Kudos to Hasbro.

RATING: 7
Fun, light dexterity game that anyone can play. Quick set-up and play. Nice filler. If this was a Euro, there would already be a couple of expansions for it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The biggest problem here is that the sliders don't bounce off each other like wood - they just end up bunching up around the target, making the shooting far less interesting.

Does not add anything new to the slide-a-thing dexterity game category, other than the scoring which I enjoyed. It gave players a reason to shoot for a specific score (like in darts), which added some interesting challenge.

Easy brainless fun dexterity game that plays quickly. Great for young kids, non-gamers, and drinking. I picked it up for half-price after Christmas. I'm not going to lie, the whole family played 3 games in a row and laughed the entire time. I give it a 9 for simple, approachable fun but knocking it down for depth and replayability. It's about as light of a game as you can get, which is both a strength and a weakness.

I have crokinole which I enjoy more, but sliders is better with 3-4 players and I like that the configuration of the board can be changed.  Certainly its more portable.  If I find it on sale somewhere I'll get it.

Found at a thrift store for $2.  Box a mess, but contents new.

Ended up giving to my mom since she liked crokinole so much.  It's actually a very fun game.  The Sorry! scoring mechanic works very well and the different type of games are a good idea.  It's still no crokinole by any means, but I highly recommend it to those who don't have a board.

Can a simple dexterity game be strategic - only one play, but this looks like good fun to share with a child (21/6/09)  Update: No, It's cant be strategic. I'm not a fan, but my son likes it - rating from 7 to 6 (29/12/10). UPDATE: Actually, when setup as a long lane, this is not bad fun, rating back up to 6 (17/12/11) UPDATE The game now is starting to slide (Rating 6.142 Jan 17).

I bought Sorry Sliders because I like Crokinole. Sorry Sliders has too much "slide the marker and keep your fingers crossed." Croke involves geometry, skills, daring, etc. So little of it relies on luck. I can't imagine ever pulling Sliders out over Crok, so out it goes. Well, I did get it for free, so no loss!

This is one of the few mass market games that I've heard good things about.  I like simple dexterity games, even if I rarely win them, so I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.

It plays quickly and everyone that has tried it so far has enjoyed it.  My wife has expressed an interest in giving it a try, and if she likes it my rating will probably go up even more.

Sept 09 - I was actually quite disappointed in this crokinole-style filler.  It was just fairly bland with pick on the leader potential. I much prefer crokinole or Tumblin' Dice.  Even at the lower price point, I wouldn't bother.

My daughter LOVES this game.  I'm fairly indifferent. I would only play this game again if my daughter begged me to play or used one of her "Play a game with me" tickets I give her every Christmas.  So, in deference to her, I'm probably giving it a higher rating than I might otherwise.

Well, this one was on my radar for a while, and I finally picked it up. It's a fun, quick, and easy game (although I'm quite terrible at it) to learn and play.

My 10 year old niece and both of my kids just love it. 

Take it for what it is; a mass market, family dexterity game. If you don't expect this to be the 'next big thing', then you won't be disappointed.

Definitely worth the price tag.

Sceptics beware, you may have to eat your initial impressions on this one. I won many hesitant players over the very first time this one hit the table. We played 9 more times.

Perfect game to have set up on an extra table during game night. Not only fills the extra time between games, but makes you look forward to that downtime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
As a dexterity game, this is a decent entry. The box is much easier to lug around than Pitchcar, and once set up, the footprint isn't overwhelming. That being said, some variations aren't very playable on most dining room tables, and the components could be a bit more solid if they really intend to endure rigorous child's play. This is actually more enjoyable with adults than with kids, but that may be a plus or minus depending upon your preferences. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A mass market game I highly recommend. Playing this made me know I had to get Crokinole.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.4
A flicking game that can be a lot of fun.  Unlike, say, Ice Cool (where crazy wild shots can be lucky and get you points), this requires at least a little skill and finesse, and wild shots will cost you.  (This will be a positive for some people, but a negative for others).

Should be a very fast game, with people going in rapid succession; mysteriously, I often find myself telling people it's their turn.  The end of the round is somehow unsatisfying.  I find Ice Cool much more fun.

What a great, cheap, portable alternative to Crokinole! Crokinole will always be a favorite (and better), but this scratches a very similar itch. The pieces are just great, but the variable board configurations and different game options give this a lot more adaptability and replayability.

Mass-market games should not be this much fun... Hilarious dexterity game reminiscent of the ice-based sport of curling.

Multiple target boards, and different ways to connect the slider ramps means this game has a ton of replayability too.

A sort of customizable tabletop shuffleboard.

RATING: 6
I love the variety afforded by the various setups and various boards. Honestly, they could have just made this have one middle board with one setup, but they went the extra mile. Instant Home is my favorite one, and Danger Dots is great as well. I also had a blast with the triple set up. As weird as this might sound, hitting people's pieces off to send them back to start really does maintain a Sorry! feel. I really hope this one becomes a modern classic as much as it deserves to be. Boards like Instant Sorry and the blue one are a lot more chancey, but fun with kids or if you are in a more lighthearted mood. Craig Van Ness scores another winner and continues to push gamer friendly games out of Hasbro and into your local Target. The real drawback here is that if you already own Crokinole, there is no reason to play this one over that.

Lowered my rating from a 9 to an 8.  It still is a fun game to play but the opportunities grow more rare to play it as I get other games that are also light and fun.  Below comments still apply.

Now that I've played multiple times with four people on different board and ramp layouts, this is a terrific light game.  Easy and quick to setup and play with a lot of chaos and hilarity.

It is a bit light though and can get a bit dull after a night of repeated plays.  Playable by anyone and is a lot of fun though!

"Luke, you’ve switched off your targeting computer. What’s wrong?"

Picked this up based on raves from [b]Geeks I Trust™[/b] and busted it out first thing Saturday morning...  played so many games with my youngest son I lost count.  Our ruckus woke my lazy teen who then joined in for, yes, so many games I lost count.

[i]Sorry! Sliders[/i] has all the elements of the best dexterity games:

- It's rules light

- Instantly grokkable

- Uses skills or abilities everyone already posseses

- Observers think they have a shot at doing better than the person they just watched go.

I'm tempted to slap a 10 on this, and I expect it to end up there after a debut at a family function.  We'll see what my regular game group thinks about this—they're old and crotchety, after all, with none of the childish glee that comes from flick-slamming another player's pawn into the netherrealm... okay, scratch that.

UPDATE:  Okay, busted this out with my regular group of emotionally-stunted man-children who took one look at the box and made faces and directly questioned my manhood, mental state and geek cred... fast forward through More Games Than I Can Count™ and they were grappling with a new addiction, stunned and shamed that they just... couldn't... walk away.

Money Quote:  "We should play this for money—five bucks a game."  

Then, doing the This-Is-Not-Happening body-rock:  "Just five more dollars... five more dollars..."

UP-UPDATE:  It's a ten!  I'll always be willing to play this, and really, who wouldn't at five minutes a game?  The kicker for me was an extended session with my usual game group where we had five of us and hot-swapped the winner's seat.  It's so good, and short, that the odd man out never got bored.  In fact, the incentive to win became more than mere crowing-rights—it meant you could get a snack... and use the bathroom.

This charming little dexterity game takes a page out of Shuffleboard's playbook, then adds a few party game elements to make things more fun.

There are four (very similar but slightly different) boards, and the game is short enough to squeeze in a couple rounds in between other games.

I'm not a very co-ordinated individual, so a dexterity game that involves pushing or throwing a projectile at a target has a certain downside for me. This is really the sport of Curling done as a table game. Fun enough, but if I'm going to play sport I'd rather get some exercise at the same time.

Dec08: Now that is a darn cool game.  And it's a mass market game too!  *Much* cheaper than Cronkinole.

How does it play?  Very addicting.  The sliding and bumping is enjoyable.  There is some thought.  There is very much definitely skill.

The different boards do add a touch of variety.  The ones with the hole in the center are both very good in my book.

Overall grade?  Grab a copy if you can get it cheap.  This one rocks.

(BTW, 1 play = 1 play session for me.  So roughly multiply that by 5.  I just feel cheap calling this my "most played game")

You can get a Crokinole or Shuffleboard fix with this cheap great little alternate. Plays 2 to 4 great with 3 or 4 best just to add to the fun.  

My favourite set-up is to put all 4 tracks (or 3) all in a row and play it like Shuffleboard. 

Crokinole version is fun when you play aggressively trying to knock your opponents pieces off the track otherwise not so much. You are missing the pegs from Crokinole here which I do miss but you do have the middle hole, in the end I like Crokinole better.  

[u]Shufflebaord:[/u] Make sure you do NOT connect the tracks like the rules suggest, then the pieces are going too much uphill and it is too hard. You have to put them as close as possible and level (only the small little tabs at the end on top of each other) which leaves a small gap and it works WAY better! Once you have done that, I suggest you remove any pieces that do not get to the scoreboard since the track is too narrow and it becomes far too hard to get pieces past them, so the blocking aspect from shuffleboard is lost but it is necessary here IMO to have the game play better. You have the choice to leave the very end rail off so pieces will fall off the scoring board if shot too hard which I prefer. You can also change the scoring to be much more like shuffleboard which is not suggested in the rules. You can actually still have a "hanger" which is halfway off the edge, 7 points (automatic home), next closest spot is 6, next 5 and so on. Overall the shuffleboard is a great simulation of the real thing.

Great game that is nothing like the original [GameID=2407] and that just about anyone will like.  Even more fun once you get decent at sliding.

Within only a few days of owning this game, it turned into a game we would have monster sessions of: first to win five games... wait, make that seven.  In my "Plays" of this game, I only count these kinds of sessions as one "play": if people, rules, or boards change, then it gets another count.

Very solid 8 for me that could be bumped up to a 9 with the right group of people.

Not nearly as much fun as I'd expected, but it was still quite fun. I'd much rather play [thing=150][/thing], or [thing=41228][/thing]. Pitchcar is much more expensive, takes longer to set up, so that's a negative. Flickago is a PnP, so there's the need to get the pieces together.

I enjoy the game as a quick filler, but I don't see myself asking to play this again. If I want this kind of dexterity, I'd want something with a little more 'heft' in gameplay.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (December 2013)

It is an ok dexterity game. The components are great, very well done and they look amazing on the board. I have only played one game variant (don’t remember the name) but it was fun. It seems to me, that skills plays a minor role here, as the board get crowded very quickly.

For me, the jury is still out on Sorry! Sliders. I want to play again, and when I do I will re comment and re rate. For now, I’m rating it a 5.5. An average game I would play from time to time.

Current Rating: 5.5

The rules are very simple and leave a lot to interpretation. I will review the forums here on BGG. It is an ok game, I’m downgrading its rating because I don’t like to play this too often. The right game group is paramount to enjoy this.

Unfairly labeled as Poor Man's Crokinole.  The appearance and mechanics of the game may seem similar but there is less strategy as you don't need to hit the opponents pieces first.  All in all, a really fun mass market game but not a necessity.

Adds a dexterity element to the basic principles of Sorry that makes for great laughs when played with kids. The inclusion of two dual-sided center boards to give you 4 slightly different types of games is a great touch. Good value here, highly recommended over basic Sorry.

RATING: 5
Basically four-directional miniaturized shuffleboard played by flicking Sorry game pieces fitted onto rolling marbles. Players each have their own runway from which they flick their pieces into the scoring area, trying to land on the plum parts and knock other players off. There are two 2-sided scoring mats for game variation. Kids like it and they can compete evenly with the adults. Gets old kind of quick, though. Can you really expect anything more from Parker Brothers?

There are 4 target areas to use to score on and at least 4 ways to set up the rolling lanes.

A fun, low-cost, and quicker, alternative to Crokinole.  I don't think there's as much room for skill, as it gets really crowded on the board when playing with four, making it more chaotic and harder to target a single player when you really need to.  But for a mass market game, this is surprisingly fun and almost addictive.

Update 6/10: Now that Crokinole is in general rotation there is simply no reason to play this.  Down to a 7.

I wasn't expecting to like this game but it is actually quite fun as a quick diversion. Among the games in this genre, I still like Crokinole and Pitch Car better. However, they are also a bit more of a commitment and, in the case of Crokinole, can leave new players feeling like they don’t have a chance. At about 10 minutes a game, Sorry! Sliders manages to stand apart by providing some of the same fun factor in about 10 minutes (where everyone feels like they have a shot at winning) while offering a unique feel with the slider pieces and different game mode options.

Ok played for 90 minutes 3 different games and totalled 10 games. It was fun but I probably won't be playing a long session like that again. My nongaming friends kept saying one more so it was definately fun.

Game lends itself to numerous variations which is a good thing.

The sliders are of good enough quality. The board I don't know. For a dexterity game I think the only way to go is wood or hard plastic instead of carton.

Certainly will play this very light game again but won't be very high on my want to play list.  

I count 15 minutes as one play.

RATING: 7
The "poor man's crokinole" uses plastic pieces with metal balls which slide over the cardboard beautifully, better than crokinole pieces on a cheap board for example. Because of their slender shape and light weight it's harder to knock each other's pieces away though, especially as pieces which fall to their side are lost for scoring. This reduces the skill aspect of the game a lot and makes it more of a fun diversion than a competition. Still an enjoyable dexterity game, but by no means a replacement for crokinole.

RATING: 7
There are several boards that plays better with four than three.  The first two or three boards are plain and less interesting since all you are doing is jockeying for position to be in the center.  Boring...  The final two or three boards, however, are much better b/c there is more real estate to fight for and thus, more chaos involved.  For example, moving or getting your pawn bumped into the center hole is a penalty or having your pawn land on a red dot is a penalty.  More chaos is usually more fun with Sorry Sliders.

Nice little mass market dexterity game.  Certainly more portable (and cheaper) than a Crokinole board but it's ultimately no where near a substitute for that classic game.  This game is a bit overhyped on this site in my opinion.

I finally played this and it absolutely lived up to the hype.  It's amazing how gamers who are accustomed to playing serious strategy games can get into this simple, seemingly mindless game.  It's fast paced, exciting, versatile with all the different board configurations, and believe it or not there is some strategy in there.  I am looking forward to trying it with lots of different types of people, because I think it will have very broad appeal.

1-6-12-We're having a lot of fun with this, only play w/the green board with the hole in the middle and we get such a kick out of it when one of our opponent's pawns slides in!  The downside of this game is that it often results in ties, sometimes even 3 way ties!  We don't care though, it's the playing that's fun.

1-3-12-Surprise gift from Casey-he says it's my Christmas present!  I kept looking at this every time I was in a store, hoping to catch it on sale, so when he found a deal on Ebay, he snapped it up!  So we had to try it out and we had lots of fun with it.  So much so that we played 4 games in a row. (3p)

Simple sliding game done right! For a mass market game it works very well, sliding 4 ball-bearing-weighted sliders towards a target circle to score. Each slider moves a pawn up your scoring track. You have to get all 4 pawns home with exact numbers to win. This allows everyone to stay in the game, as last gasp comebacks are very possible. Great game, not too difficult, not too easy.

Just looking at the sheer number of people who own this game and have commented positively on this should tell you that this game is worth picking up.  Especially for the 15 bucks that I found it for at Wal-Mart.

While the game is really just a miniature version of shuffleboard... it's amazing how the Sorry theme is still used in the game.  

All the different variations on how you can set up the game helps to keep things from getting stale.  

This has obviously been an EXCELLENT seller for "Hasbro"... so, hopefully we will see either an expansion pack sometime, or a right-out sequel.

Despite the large box, this is a perfect filler game: short, fun, and easy to learn/teach. With four goal zones and multiple ways to play, there are more options than I expected, and all of the ones I've tried have been enjoyable.

I'm not sure why it isn't as good as PitchCar, but there's just something about PC that takes it up a couple of notches.

First Day Impressions - Fun, super fast and light.  Will play many more times.

The Red board is #1 in our house.  Yellow then blue in the middle.  Green board is big downer.

Probably have 30 plays or so.  The game is fun and so very fast that it is an top-notch family game.  Even my non-gamer son (11) really enjoyed it.

My physical issues impair my ability to play well and that makes it a bit frustrating (for me).  The game is great for my kids.

RATING: 7
Flicky/slidey fun. The scoring makes for interesting goals that change as the game gets close to ending. It comes with 4 main scoring boards and can be configured with a number of different approaches to each keeping it interesting. I think it'd be really easy to make up some variants with what you've got too.

Biggest downer is that the components are typically cheapish. Not enough that it's bad, but bad enough that they aren't good either. Though since I got it for $10 I can't really complain or fairly compare it to something like PitchCar.

Great game to quickly get everyone laughing.

"Curling on a board" where it's possible to blast opponent's pawns so hard they leave the board.

The "Sorry!" aspect of this game where you need exact number counts to finish is a really nice touch because it requires some skill and at the same time grants ample opportunities to thwart with a well placed collision.

It's not as fun as Crokinole, and it would be really easy to bend or crush the runways if you got overeager during play. But Crokinole costs real money and is not an option for some of us.

Sliders is a fun game in the right group, or with children, and for $10-$15 you can't beat the value. With the variety of board layouts, solo play, extended runways and the nice pawns, this is a good buy and has a lot of replayability. Kudos for a nice, mass market game that works for families and children. There aren't a lot of those that I like.

I was impressed at how well done Parker Brothers take on Crokinole was.  They're usually not the most innovative company... Sorry! itself is a ripoff of Parchesi.

RATING: 7
This is fun... I'd have to stop short of `awesome', but I can legitimately lose this game to my son, and enjoy the experience. We don't have too many games in that category. What gets under my skin a bit is that the game is too `chunky', by which I mean, scoring is done at the end of each round, and there are not very many rounds. So turn order matters a lot. I think I mentioned the same problem with Numble. We frequently both reach Home in the same round, and I do not think turn order is an acceptable tie-breaker. So we declare it a tie. And it's a family game, OK, but I don't like ties.

This is a light, nearly brainless game that's very similar to crockinole.  Players have four pieces that slide easily, and they must launch them into the center to attempt to score points, which are determined by rings on the board.  Players then assign their points to little dudes that walk up a score track.  And, since this is "Sorry", if your slider goes off the board, or lands in certain areas, one of your score-markers goes back to the bottom of the track.

The game is dexterity based, and does have tactics: players can knock their opponents sliders into other rings, or even try to knock them off the board.  However, it's overall very light - a perfect end to a long week or a long, meaty gaming night.

Bought this to play with my son and I;ve played it with him a few times now. He understood the rules, which are quite simple, and he actually played it to the end, which is quite an achievement! There are a number of combinations that can be used to play with the game "kit". I wouldn't offer this to play with only (sober) adults but its a decent family game.
UPDATE: Changed rating to a 7.5. Sliders isn't something I'd prefer to play but it has turned out to be a frequent family activity that doesn't drive the adults crazy. My son has become quite good at it and there's scope for some spiteful play, too.

Like curling, players are pushing pawns with ball bearings underneath to slide them into scoring circles.  Other players can knock your pawns around, though. It's fun, there are different variants, and it plays within 15 minutes. It doensn't have much to do with the original Sorry game.  It's something small children might enjoy.

Dexterity games are probably not for me, though this one was enjoyable. I'll play it sometimes, but I think I like games where its not timed and I can think more slowly and not worry about my physical abilities. It was a good experience though. Would probably play again if in the right mood - I didn't hate it, but I suspect dexterity games aren't for me. One small issue is that I didn't care for waiting on other players' turns in this kind of game. At least in other games, I could think, plan, or guess what the player was gonna do...but this one, I can't do any of that and is pure waiting.

My four year old son and two year old daughter request this game all the time - and they are good. We don't keep score (yet) but I'm sure I have legitimately lost games to my little two year old sliders ace.

Good: my kids love it, the components are nice.

Bad: one of the red sliders is kind of gimpy.

Gloriously silly fun with just enough life in it to warrant the 'go on, one more game' factor. Plenty of vindictiveness when in with the right crowd, and playing with the red or green central boards is pretty much the only way to go if you're going to be competitive. The cardboard playing surface doesn't exactly reward accuracy, mind you: I wonder if anyone would knock up a wooden version...

It is not nearly as nice as some other yet similar dexterity games (e.g., Tumblin' Dice) but it gets the job done and is certainly cheaper. It's also much more fun than the original Sorry! game. The 4-in-1 concept actually works, although we quickly found a favorite and played that alone. It is nice to see Big Names willing to "mess" with their success in an effort to create better games.

We had something of a Sorry Sliders marathon recently. Three of us played three games of each of the four scenarios, for a total of 12 games. What we learned:

- In a three-player game, the player with no player opposite might have a slight advantage.

- Three players might work slightly better if you all use the same ramp. Three ramps joined together on the same side is fun, but requires some good initial speed, making it a much more physical game.

- We enjoyed the green ("Instant Sorry") board most of the three.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very fun. Almost nothing to do with the game of "Sorry!" outside of the scoring track resembling part of the original game board. But who cares? This is a fun dexterity game with nice pieces. The best idea--beside the ball-bearing inside the pieces which allows them to slide nicely--is providing four different scoring boards and different game rules for each of those, as well as the ability to set up the boards in varying configurations. A breeze to learn and games are over very quickly. I think more interesting with 4 players, which ups the chaos factor, and, frankly, for guys.

Played once with 4 players on all 4 boards. What a blast we had! 4 ways to play and each with a different kind of feel. If only we could play it with more players!

This is one awesome game! Plays well with 2 or more players and is quick and entertaining! Never been a fan of the roll and move style of the regular Sorry game. So if this has been your feeling too, fear not purchasing this sweet little gem! I heard it mentioned as a poor mans Crokinole; I think this is true, but it also reminds me of Air Hockey too. Set up the board and slide your tokens, then score your points!

I was influenced by all the great comments to be interested in the game at first.  I almost pulled the trigger at $10 or $15 at Target a few times, but held off because I still had a niggling worry it would be monotonous.  Then we finally were able to try it at a relative's house and we were underwhelmed.  They don't love it and we played on the normal board and it was OKish.

A few months ago, I encountered a complete game in good condition at Saver's for $2.00, so I bought it anyway.  We pulled it out tonight and found the board with the hole in the middle, and had an absolute blast with my 6 and 4-yr-olds, and even my 2-yr-old.  We played one side where the hole = an instant pawn home, and then had an uproarious game of the side where the hole = instant Sorry!  My 4-yr-old was launching everyone's pawns into the Sorry! corners every couple of slides while my 6-yr-old played cautiously and won despite some of her pawns not reaching the end of her sliding board.  My wife let our 2-yr-old slide the pawns in the 2nd game and still was a close 2nd. (They might have won if the 4-yr-old hadn't blasted them off the board a couiple times.)  We had to secure the board from bumps when the 2 younger boys slid and pawns still got jostled, but what's a point difference in a family game?  

The Sorry! hole with the extra good bonus ring around it adds some great dynamics to the game.  It really clicked for us tonight, and we want to try the corners and the long, curling-style set-ups as well.

Sorry Sliders is for people who have never played Pitch Car.  The components are standard cheap plastic and thin card board.  The "Sorry" mechanism that sends pawns back to start makes the game over stay its fun value.  I suspect that it won't take too many plays before the ball bearings are completely gummed up.

All that aside, it does employ similar mechnisms to Pitch Car and Crokinole.  While the cheap components reduce the game to little more than a novelty the underlying game of accurately flicking stuff is fun.  I wanted to rush out a buy a copy of Pitch Car after my first play of Sorry Sliders.

Sorry! Sliders (S!S) is a wonderful tabletop dexterity game [b]for families.[/b]
It completely succeeds in what it tries to do - provide table-shuffleboard fun for ALL ages (a child of 2 years can probably play this game, which is amazing).
If you are a serious dexterity gamer, you may prefer Crokinole's advanced skill requirements, but for anyone who's just wanting to have fun, S!S is inarguably the better game.

Reasons:
* S!S plays with 2, 3, or 4 opposing players, as well as 2 teams. 
Crokinole is designed primarily as a 2 player game (or 2 teams).
* S!S has more than 1 configuration. It has 4 different scoring boards, each with different strategy. It can even change the board layout to allow diagonal play, double-length slides, or even triple/quadruple-length slides, using different sliding skills.
Crokinole is always the same - same strategy, same scoring conditions, distance from start position to posts and hole.
* S!S is handicappable in its components, not just different scoring handicaps. For example, adults can use 2 lengths of track while young'uns use one.
* S!S doesn't hurt to play, since you're just sliding a pawn down a track. 
Crokinole sometimes causes discomforts/injuries because of the flicking and impact on fingernails/tips.
* S!S doesn't require advanced skill to enjoy. Any kid or adult can successfully slide their pawn, hitting other pawns and even scoring an Instant Home (yellow board). 
Crokinole requires significant skill to be able to play it reasonably - otherwise, a player cannot hit what they're targetting, especially thru all the obstacles (their own discs, the posts). It is not only frustrating for players of little skill, they can't really play the game as designed, since if you can't reliably flick your disc between the 2 posts, the whole competitive gameplay is basically destroyed.
* S!S can be broken down and stored easily in the 12" x 24" box.
Crokinole is one solid mass of wood, with a border gutter, usually measuring 25" round diameter. The storage & wear concerns with a board that large are considerable for most space-strapped homes. 
* S!S is $10.49, at Amazon, with free SuperSaver shipping. 
Crokinole is a minimum of $200 for a good board and discs.
* S!S is disposable. If you lose something or it gets damaged, just pick up another.
Crokinole is so valuable, it causes problems - while a good Crokinole board is an heirloom piece to be used for decades, this value actually makes it harder to play - you have to be worried if a child is using it, or if it gets moisture, or even scratches from someone picking up the discs wrong (sliding it against the grain).

QED

I have picked up another copy of S!S and now have the optimal configuration available IMO: 8 boards allow for 2 per person, successfully extending the playfield to the proper length.  If you have room on a massive table, this is the best setup I think.

A simple dexterity game in the vein of carrom and crokinole. It lacks the finger flicking finesse of those games because the pieces just don't slide very reliably, and you can't plan rebounds and ricochets. It does however have a neat scoring system where more points is not always better, and a game can be saved by hitting an opponent's piece into the "sorry" zone. A decent mass market game.

Purchased 12/2010 for $15.00 @ Target. Impulse purchase... OK, not really, I've been wanting this one but just didn't want to desecrate my hallowed BGgeek collection list. Will break it out over Christmas holiday and do an update after kids break it... I mean break it in.

Update 1/17/2011 - game is now a fixture in our house. Sets up QUICK. Rules learned QUICK. Game play (you guessed it)... QUICK. It's Sorry on steroids and what else can I say but it's getting played several times a week, kids love it and I can even tolerate playing this with them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Quick to play, easy to teach dexterity game.  Good warm-up game or closer game as not much required (buts it in the same league as a Looping Louie).  Kids can play with adults.  But very much a light crokinole as the shots here tend to be repetitive with little skill (compounded further by the use of cardboard which warps adding further vagaries).  But as a light fluffy game - not bad at all.

It's a fun dexterity game! The game can be as harsh or as nice as you want it to be, with the different boards.

Also a challenging game for adults, if you put several tracks together.

I usually intend my comments for 2 players but this really is great with 2 or 4 players (I haven't tried it with 3).

Loads of fun for the 5 to 105 age bracket. :)

I really like the modular board set-up and there is a lot of game in this box.  There are many variants and I am sure a creative family or group of gamers can think of even more variants.

--Dec2008--  A fine and functional little dexterity game.  More functional, truth be told, than my disturbingly-more-expensive PitchCar set.  Yet, that said, my children seem far more interested in returning to PitchCar (despite its faults) than to pull Sorry Sliders out for a play.  I'm happy to play it, in any event.

I picked up a copy of this based solely on the buzz generated here on the Geek.  I tend to like a lot of dexterity games, and flicking games (like Crokinole and Pitchcar) are particular favorites.  This fits solidly in this group.  I find it to be a light quick games (usually about 5-10 minutes), with opportunities for nastiness as well as skillful play.  However, there is enough variability with the uneven boards to shake things up a little.  While I don't think of this as a "poor man's Crokinole" it is certainly good for what it is, which is something I'm not likely to pass up.  [01/18/2009]

RATING: 7
Sorry! Sliders is a very fun game and its cost (when compared to many of its flicking fraternity) is a real winner. The game has not too much to do with Sorry!, but, as a flicker, it brings a variety of play areas and track set-up to a game for under $20!
Hey, PitchCar is a great game, a better game, but do not frown on the less-spectacular Sorry! Sliders.

RATING: 7
I love Crokinole but never could shell out AU$300 for a set. When I heard and read that Sorry! Sliders was a 'poor man's Crokinole', I was sold. I wrangled a trade.

Sure, the components are attractive and sturdy enough (the rollers are nicely weighted), but remove the ability to use skill and replace it with luck, and this is Sorry! Sliders.

The premise is similar: slide your pieces into a center board and try to score points. Points are use to move your pieces up a scoreboard. First to bring all your pieces to the top wins. 

As the board is made of cardboard, pieces don't slide entirely straight or smoothly.The side walls are plastic and may or may not guide your pieces along depending on how much force you use. The lack of rebound posts actually make the game much simpler: slide your pieces into the middle and bump someone else's out. No brainer. However, you can't control the sliding of the pieces with the same level of control in Crokinole.

Having said that, kudos to hasbro for actually allowing a designer to rehash on of the best games out there. Oh, and adding multiple boards and various ways to play is sheer genius.

Will go down well with the kids.

This game is so simple to learn and play, but it was still interesting and enjoyable.  The flexibility of different layouts allows one to play it over and over again, too.

I always get little pangs of "That's it?" when I bring Sorry! Sliders to the table, but I still dust it off every now and then when we're feeling brain-burnt from heavier fare. 

If I'm in a finger-flickin' mood I'd prefer to break out Pitchcar. However, most of my friends are pretty wary of dexterity games and Sorry! Sliders sets up quickly enough that they don't have time to invent a good reason not to play a few games before it's ready to go. I guess it has that going for it.

Like Crokinole when you slide your pawns towards the middle.  Crokinole is much more challenging and open, whereas here the pieces are all bunched in the middle.  I think this game will entertain all ages, it's just too claustrophobic for my taste.

Sliders they may be, but sorry I am not - I will send your pawns flying without mercy!  In a nutshell, this is a remarkably simple yet surprisingly fun dexterity game that can be enjoyed by adults and kids alike.  In fact, it seems like it could simultaneously fill the role of dexterity game, party game, and filler game.  For your pawn-sliding fix, it is one billionth the cost of a nice "Crokinole" board (roughly) and takes one millionth the time to set up in comparison to a "PitchCar" track (roughly).  It would have been nice if they had thrown in a few more variations of the cardboard score boards, but there is still a decent variety of ways to play the game.  I can't think of anything else to add that might e helpful.  Sorry.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

Fun game to play with my wife and 11 year old daughter. They tied for the win in the game we played with my wife getting the tie breaker advantage because she went first in that round. I'd like a different tie breaker rule myself. But it was a well received and exciting little game with great bits. It reminded us of Bocce that we enjoy a few times a year over the past decade.

The thing that impressed me the most with SS is all the different configurations that can be had, from the # of players, to the four types of games, to the varying lengths of track, to the different track positions, and to the available scoring possibilities. This will help extend the life of a game that easily could have run its course in a few of plays due to its simplicity. I really appreciate its design being so much more thoughtful than its namesake relative - Sorry.

It's definitely worth 20 bucks.

The game can be equalized somewhat (if played with less than 4 players) by making one lane longer than the others. Four different ways to play the game too, which is very nice. Supports 2-4 players.

Quick to play, but if you play it more than three or four times in a row, you'll probably get bored.  Use it as a filler.  Another thing is that the pawns aren't that stable, so you can't really flick them with force into other players' pawns, so the excitement level is less than I expected.

Fun. The game comes with four different boards to play with, and we actually use all of them (unlike some other games that include "more ways to play!"). It's a lot of fun trying to knock your opponents' pieces off the board while also trying to score the points you need. However, there's obviously not much depth so this is a game you won't want to play very often.

Ordered 2/19/10.  Finally got on 3/6/10 after USPS screwed up the routing.  TWO weeks to go from FLA to OHIO.  Anyhow, received today and played tonight.  Lotsa fun and quickly played.  After the Olympics and the wife watching a lot of curling, I pulled it out as new game tonight (and didn't get shot for buying a new game) and showed the scoring circle first.  She loved it as well as sis in law and her husband.  Great filler/quick game.  We filled about 1 1/2 hours playing 9 games.  I was the champ winning 5 of 9.  LOL

Fun game.  Well worth thrifting a copy.

I am always looking for a fun game to play with young kids and this one fits the bill very well.

It is NOT Crokinole.

Update: rating lower from 5 to 4. It works about as well as a crokinole-like game can work,at this price point. I appreciate it for making a crokinole like game accessible to even the thriftiest shoppers, but it just doesn't work well enough for me. 

I do, however, recommend this to families with kids because kids do like it and adults can have a bit of fun as well.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1

SOLD (8/25/11) --- Sorry! Sliders is the hot new game on BoardGameGeek, where Ben Lott has written a glowing review and Scott Nicholson has uploaded a nice video explanation. I picked up a copy on Amazon when it was on sale for only $10 and I’m amazed to see the price up to $40 on Amazon. I think it’s a fun diversion for $10, but definitely not worth $40. It is the poor man’s Crokinole that everyone says it is, which means that I’m unlikely to play it at home since I have Crokinole, but am happy to have a more portable version of Crokinole at least. It’s not quite as portable as I was hoping, given the fairly large box size, but it’s still more portable than an actual Crokinole board. I do enjoy the variable setups and rules variants that come in the box, which have made my 15 plays so far feel quite varied.

[thing=37196][/thing] is a dexterity game in which the players push a slider into a central board, trying to hit some spots. I played in the way that the goal in to advance 4 markers into a final spot, and you advance them accordingly to the number your sliders reached in the board. So, say, if the sliders stopped in the 4, 2, 2 and 1, you will be able to advance your markers that number of spots (you can advance one 4, other 2, other 2 and other 1, or one 6 spots (4+2) and other three (2+1) or in any other way you want to use that numbers). It is necessary to have the exact amount to reach the final spot, so if you need a 1 to advance a marker into the final place, and will need at least one slider in the 1 on the board, because a 2, 3 or 4 won't do. The winner will be the player that puts all the 4 markers first in the final spot.

[thing=37196][/thing] is a fun game, like most dexterity games are, since they allow for a whole lot of funny situatios do to the lack of dexterity - like, in a round, I tossed 3 of my 4 sliders into the central hole in the board (the slider is eliminated this way); in other times, it was funny to see someone trying to do something (taking someone out of some place, and trying to push it out of the board) and failing miserably.

It is a quick game, one that everyone can play and even groups of different ages can dispute toe-to-toe, as [thing=37196][/thing] requires no strategy nor really a level of preparation for future rounds - you just do the best you can each round and try to use the scores you got in the best way possible.

[thing=37196][/thing] is a good game for a quick fun time, but I much prefer other dexterity games, like [thing=150][/thing], [thing=380][/thing] and [thing=17329][/thing], since I see more meat in the bones, while also being as much fun.

Bought this game on the basis of the surprisingly positive reviews here on BGG. And I do like it, even though I am not a big fan of dexterity games. Still think that PitchCar is a little bit better and has better components (Sliders comes with great components considering its price, but I am still a bit worried that he cardboard track pieces are warped next time I take them out of the box). The little ball bearings inside the pawns are a great idea though. Also, I like the fact that the one closest to the starting player wins when multiple players reach the Home space during the same round. Makes for a lot of desperate (and funny) attempts to prevent these players from winning.
Also on the plus side: It is very easy to get this game to the table. Rules are explained in half a minute, gameboard assembly is quick and painless, and a complete game clocks in at about 20 minutes with four players.

An OK game for adults. More like a fun party game for a bunch of folks. Certainly not for two. Will play it sporadically at the end of a gaming session. However, the game is just not that thrilling
The component quality is decent and the design is solid. The pieces themselves are quite durable. 

If I had kids, this would be more of a blast playing with them.

Replaced by Crokinole.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's no replacement for a nice [gameid=521] board, but it's certainly a lot more affordable.  The basic ideas are the same.  The pawns aren't as good at hitting other pawns out of the way as they are in a Crokinole board.  A large part of this is the lip on the board, which means you can abut your piece against your opponents sliding track, and it is next to impossible for them to do anything about it.  If they go after your piece, often theirs falls over, and they gain nothing for their throw.  But there is still satisfying play in the middle of the board.

We really enjoy playing this with the kids - even our 4 year old can participate.  The only thing it really has in common with the original Sorry! is the shape of the pawns (which is a good thing).

Slide, COLLIDE and SCORE TO WIN!

Grab your roller pawn and take aim - then skillfully slide it down your track onto the target board! A good slide could score big points, but watch out! An opponent's pawn may slam your pawn onto a Sorry! space - and out of the game!
\13\\13\
This is a new twist on the Sorry! franchise with 4 different ways to play:

  * Race For Home\13\
  * Instant Home\13\
  * Instant Sorry!\13\

A nice, inexpensive, dexterity game. It's great for the kids, but as an adult I found it to be more than a little dull. It certainly didn't live up to the fanfare of the BGG hype machine that was generated when it was released. It's not much more than a table-top shuffleboard game. Sorry!

RATING: 5
I should preface by saying that I don't really like dexterity games and that this is one of the better ones I've played. I thought the two Instant games were less fun than the others (they went too quickly). I think I was a bit spoiled by getting Tumblin-Dice shortly before this one, as the production values here seem really low by comparison, but that's probably more of a statement of how well-made Tumblin-Dice is. This is still a bargain at its price point and I'd recommend it to people who enjoy such games, but I suspect most gamers who aren't on a tight budget (and don't need it to be portable) would probably want to opt with Tumblin-Dice or Crokinole instead.

A light, fun dexterity game that is great for kids and fun for adults.  The multiple ways to set up the board would help keep it from getting stale or change the challege level if anyone outgrows the basic game.

A sorry attempt in trying to convert the concept of the original title into a dexterity one.  If you like finger-flicking games this may appeal to you, but I failed to find anything special about it.

This game is a great example of American ingenuity and cheapness being combined excellently.  Sorry! Sliders gives you shuffleboard, [thing=5072][/thing], [thing=521][/thing], darts, bocce, and even some [thing=150][/thing] pleasures, and I got it new for $15.  It's made with cheap components — < 2mm thick cardboard, plastic pawns, plastic rails, plastic pawns with ball bearings — but it's done in a clever, effective way, permits playfield construction, and the translucent pawns actually look pretty cool.  Graphic design on the cardboard has a nice, multi-layered digital art style (sort of like a simplified spin on [url=http://wirestyle.deviantart.com/]wirestyle[/url]'s technique) that pairs well with the translucent pawns.  The vivacious colors and graphical style deftly misdirect your attention from how very far from a [company=1562][/company] production this is.

The differences between the following games barely qualify as variants, so I won't say much about them as separate concepts.  Due to the short length of the score tracks, games are typically very fast, leaving you hungry for another go.  Additionally, þe olde American standard mechanism of "You must reach the goal by exact count," that usually serves only to lengthen a game with a shoddy attempt to hinder the leader, in this case provides some darts-like constraints:  "Oh, I need three ones and a two now.  Anything three or higher is useless to me."  It works well.

The configurability of the layout picks up a smidgen of [thing=150][/thing]ness.  It's not like you even have curves at your disposal, but that any configurability whatsoever is present is astounding.

[b]Race for Home[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] [thing=5072][/thing]y/shuffleboardy goodness!

[b]Instant Home[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] This gets a little [thing=521][/thing] feel, having the insta-home hole in the middle.  The game goes even faster.

[b]Instant Sorry![/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] Having an extra way — smack in the middle of the target — to send yourself and others back to Start is not such a good thing, even if it is pretty much the trademark mechanism of [thing=2407][/thing]; however, the inner ring of the bullseye is upgraded to a from a 4-point to a 4-5-6-point space, which nearly compensates for it.  With consistent players, this game is fine, but with kids or other erratic players, it can be frustrating to watch them kill themselves turn after turn.

[b]Danger Dots[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] I like that the dots merely "explode", sending your piece off for no score.  It's a stingless Sorry! shot, basically.

Lots of fun.  Every time we break this out, we play multiple games.

Update:  The boards for sliding are starting to bow a little bit. :(

Even in a world of Bach and Agricola, drums and Sorry Sliders both have their places. Kinetic, baby.

After 2+ Plays: It seemed far too easy to knock other players off the board, thus sending their scoring pawns back to home.  Once we discovered this, the game started to drag in a two steps forwards, one step back sort of way.

Awesome as a 5 minute filler.  I am obsessed with the pieces.

Not nearly as thematic as the initial reports inferred and no way would I class this as "Civ-lite". Instead it's a typical abstracted euro offerring with just a touch of conflict that Wallace likes to bring into his games. Not brilliant but worth exploring a bit more

RATING: 8.5
Very smooth easy to teach light Civ game.  After several plays with 4 and 5 players enjoing it more.  Raised my rating.

Just wish a better job was done by Cafe Games as the game is over priced with several problems with the pieces.  Colors are not matching from board hexes to the game board table.  The board does not lie flat and the colors of pieces were poor choices.  The purple and black are almost impossible to tell apart with out very good light.

Area control/action selection game.  It was pretty good, and the age advancement competition was interesting.  Would play again, but probably not request.

RATING: 7
An area control game with a civilization theme.  Probably the biggest strength of the game might also be the most off-putting aspect for some, and that's the fact that everything you do the whole game, means very little until the very last round.  It also works out that everyone is within one level of development the whole game, and the final scores end up being very close.  I found this to be a positive, as it felt like you were never out of the game, and it was a tight, tense finish.

Gameplay is fast, smooth, and seamless.  The turns are quick and easy, and you can easily plan out your moves in-between turns.  It's enjoyable to have several options to choose from, but thought provoking as your actual actions are fairly limited as are the number of actions.  As you evolve, so do your actions, but so does everyone elses.  Excellent use of the cards, as they can be used for their abilities, for fighting/defending, and for scoring/bluffing.  Modular board is a nice touch, and it seems to scale well from 3-5 players (too bad it doesn't play 2).  No game can live up to the hype of being 11 months behind production, but this is a very good game nonetheless.

Excellent game; the intial rumblings had merit. It definitely feels more civ-themed over actually having civ mechanics, but it's really cool. The rules are succinct and easy to teach, the design is clever, and the game keeps me engaged the entire way through. I would have sat down and played another game immediately afterwards... that's always the sign of a great game!

Hmm...interesting.  From many of the comments I read at BGG, I was expecting to really dislike this game.  Actually, I quite enjoyed it.  Since you can play it in about the time it says on the box, it's not the deepest and heaviest of games, but then it's not meant to.  I'd place it at the high end of light-medium.  Anyway, there are enough decisions to be made here.  It doesn't feel totally like typical Wallace - there's a bit of Clans and various other games were you move stuff around different terrians to score points or try to expand into new territory, but I don't mind that.

A nice game to play if you have just over an hour.  Certainly better than some of the other games that last the same time and have come out in the last three years or so.  Perhaps some of its bad press is due to over-expectation before it came out?

Technically, the design of the game is excellent, no flaws there. Unfortunately, the game misses something; it only gets exciting in the last two turns. The first 75% of the game it just plods along. I think the game could be easily improved by adding two extra scoring rounds. The components look good, but quality is mediocre.

This one simply didn't do it for me.

The battle aspect seems odd to me.  Although there is the potential to make gains while hurting another player, it seems like the non-combatant is the real winner since it is likely that the attacker and/or defender will spend precious cards from their hand.

The bonuses/catch up mechanism/limited number of turns (10) almost works.  Some of the bonuses are insanely nice while others are more or less junk.  This inherent inequality affects the importance of winning the round.

It's very possible to plan far in advance.  In fact, such planning can form the cornerstone of a good, successful strategy.

Apparently needs a house rule to avoid encouraging turtling.

I would play it again, but it just doesn't feel right.

This is a good game. It is "prettier" than my edition of Age of Steam by the same author. It plays in a different terrain every time. 

I prefer this to Age of Steam actually, mainly becasue there is no chance of a player being knocked out of the game unless they foolishy make all their population tokens into cities. Then they have nothing to do!

We`ll play this one again.

A very good game! But....when a game is themed as a civ building game, I expect it to be rather realistic, which Tempus is not. Therefore, my rating of 7.9, whereas it would have been a 9 if it was a more realistic civ game. If Mr. Wallace totally rethemes it as something totally different, then boom! it's a 9. Sorry, but I'm a stickler for realism in civ games, be they ever so abstract.

Better than I thought it would be, even playing 2 player with 6 map segments. It worked well, the game was fairly easy and quick, and the scores seem to be close. With technologies, "catching up" on the leader is a good concept, so a bad start is not punishing unlike some games as people advance more or less together.

RATING: 7
An interesting design, this is a nice, straightforward, streamlined civilization building themed game.  We played with 5, and it worked quite well.  The rules are very simple for a civ game, the decisions are interesting, and the game peaks, by capable design, in the final few turns with ostensibly just about the right amount of conflict.  

While it is true that there is a certain "dressed up abstract" feel to the game, that feeling is perhaps caused more by the fact that the game is intentionally streamlined for playability, than any fault of the designer.  Tempus is something of a sleeper Wallace design that probably deserves a bit more attention.

this looks like yet another martin wallace prototype.  the much-discussed 3-stack turtling thing became apparent to all of us as we were going through the rules, and i have no idea how the concept went unnoticed during playtesting.  even without that, the game is totally sterile to me and has many flaws.  setup/turn order, hate the line-based upgrades instead of having player-selected individual ones to advance, etc.  most importantly, i found it utterly lacking in fun.  there's a chance that i'd give it another shot with an anti-turtling house rule, but i'm far from optimistic.  i think la citta is way better, vinci is way better, and antike is still better.

RATING: 8
I really enjoy this game.  I think it's a little underrated on the geek perhaps due to its reputation as "civ-lite."  It does have some facets of civilization building, but plays more like an area control game.  The trick is that the Idea Cards are vital to success - and for tying together the theme and mechanics.  Overall I think this is a very positive offering from the talented Mr. Wallace.

Opinions on this game will be torn.  There is something really neat in it, but the game play experience may leave players feeling frustrated and wanting more.  That's not more as in play again, but more as in its lacking something.  The key to the game experience is the map.  Inexperienced players are very likely to create a poor map layout and to place themselves in even worse spots on that map.  This game could definitely use a starting map configuration for people to learn the game on - then introduce the variable layout.  A good game, but not one of Wallace's strongest.  [GTI: AGSL]

Played once with 5 players. The game last 2,5 hour, which is really too long for me. I don't know how this game can be much shorter. I've counted that with 5 players at least 218 moves must be done. So our 150 minutes divided by the number of moves gives 41 seconds per move. OK, it could be a little shorter but not much I think. (You need also time for resolving battles and bidding beetween the rounds) And apart from the lenght there is nothing much interesting in this game that I want to return it to. Yet another euro game.

RATING: 6.5
Played just once, would happily play again. It captures the flow of time and advancing technology nicely, giving an edge to the better civilisations without leaving others stranded. Couple of reservations: I think in a five player game one player can easily be choked at the start, and I'm not sure I like the idea that attackers do not risk losing any casualties if an attack fails. But those are quibbles in a lovely game.

Played with three - incorrectly as we unintentionally only left out one land tile.  The result was an excellent game which I am sure I enjoyed more than I would have done with the extra conflict that would have arisen from fewer boards or more players.  The game grows in many ways and I was thoroughly absorbed throughout.  After Und Tschüss! and possibly AoS, Wallace's best.  (Rated as played - with the extra tiles!)

A pretty good game. I like it, however, it drags on a bit. Most games we play with 4-5 take almost 3 hours and no matter what, the scores are 1-2 points apart. I.e. it all comes down to the last turn. If it was shorter it would be ideal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
An abstracted, area control (light quasi-civilisation) game with good replayability and scalability due to the modular board and the well-balanced idea cards. Initial placement is very important as the tempo is somewhat slow at the beginning of the game. Some players will dislike the sudden change in focus from city building and consolidation to proliferation that occurs in the final round but I don't have a problem with it. A solid design by Wallace.

First play.  The game is pretty cool.  I like it that you always get to keep up with the technologies but gives you those boosts for discovering them first.  I am not sure yet if I like that scoring doesn't happen at all until the very end.  I like the modular map setup to increase replayability.  The card system is pretty cool that they have two uses; one for the special ability and for defending/attacking/technology advances.  For a multiplayer war/civ game it is pretty good.  The problems I ussually have with multiplayer wargames is minimal here; at least from what I can see.

Played once as a 5-player game with the rules explained to me.

Hmmn... perhaps I expect more from Martin Wallace than most designers, but I really found this game to be sort of lackluster.  My favorite aspect of Tempus is that everyone moves up the progress line at the same rate (with the exception of the winning bidder advancing an additional space.)  My least favorite feature is the random "idea" cards.  Some are always good and some are more situational.  One other positive is that the included player boards are exceptionally helpful.         
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
 After several plays Tempus has really improved in my esteem. While abstract it does now provide me some thematic satisfaction and there is much room for good play. It is another excellent Martin Wallace design!

Update: I'm beginning to question how much real decisions a player makes in this game. While there are many ways to play badly, it seems that if you follow a few simple rules you should be contending for 1st:
1. Never run out of ideas (cards)
2. Always have two green fields to have babies
3. Don't leave 1 counter next to stacks of 3 or 4 counters, as it is easy to kill.
4. When facing off against another big stack either attack if you have offensive cards or build a city.
5. Maximize use of movement and baby actions by combining them with cards.
6. Reproduce and build cities as often as you can.

I need to play more!

Being a huge Martin Wallace fan, it pained me to continue to have to wait for the release of this game. I scooped it up quick but my initial playings have left me a bit underwhelmed. There doesn't seem to be that much of an advantage to be the "civ" that advances to the next era and then everybody catches up automatically. The card play is cool but many times it just doesn't matter. Maybe more plays will reveal something deeper than what I have seen so far.

Concept of the game and the mechanisms is very well thought of and works really good. You have to be very aware that you can't win every epoch so you have to choose your battles. It seems however that your actions are pretty straighforward and there's not so much too choose. Also the player interaction could have been higher. Look out for some ambiguous rules and translation errors (if you own the German version) which can have a lot of influence on the game.

What a disappointment! I waited a year for this game and as a civ. game it sucks! Progress isn't real important till the Train era. The three hex rule, designed to prevent player elimination, breaks the game. This rule alone makes no sense and should have never made it past play testing. VPs that only score at the games end make all the other turns seem pointless. Another great Wallace idea squandered by poor play testing. Hopefully I can trade this one to a "type A" Euro gamer. 

11/1/07: I've decided to keep this game based on a few variants I've developed.
Wallace had such a great game here and Cafe Games had Disney do the play testing. "Have a Fight" action... What the?.. I don't think I'll be buying any more Cafe Games."If it's not Wallace it's Crap!"

Got to play this one prior to purchasing and I'm glad I did.  I can see where there would be stratgies and the places for clever play, but the game just didn't cut it for me.  I didn't care for how the turns went, as the game got deeper, you had more turns and choices, but also it got more futile if you were in a bad position.  I didn't like the naming convention...have babies, have an idea...it seemed a little juvenile, especially for a civ game.  The mechanics have been done before, and I feel better in different games.  I found myself waiting for the game to end, and I haven't done that in awhile.

Very easy to learn and quick game. The quality of the components are very 'made in China'. This games doesn't have a big replay value for me because the development track is fixed. There is not a lot of clever stuff to do. Initial placement of population has a great influence on the game.

RATING: 5
Not a bad game - but not the 'civ-lite' game many were expecting either.

Feels a bit like Evo - but I prefer the latter. Biggest downside for me is avoiding conflict is the best strategy, if you get sucked into a war - you will lose the game if one player avoids it no matter what the outcome of the conflict. This means once players realise this the game gets very samey, with everyone simply spending 2/3rds of the game building their empire.

Conflict becomes inevitable in the end game, but for me the flow is wrong - and I don't much like the advances mechanic where everyone catches up, there's no real tech-tree where you pick a route to victory, more a set of short races where you try to jump ahead and milk the advantage for the turn.

In summary, not a bad game, just not one I'm in any rush to play again ...

** Update, traded, doubt I'll play this again

Conflict was scant in three-player game.  Hopefully, it improves with more players and repeated play.  This generally seems like the right game theme/abstraction quotient I am attracted to.

Adquirido a Bicho en Ene 10.
Tarde algo de tiempo en probarlo. Es un "mini-juego" de civilizaciones. Cada turno es una era y en cada turno se decide quien es el primero en avanzar a la siguiente era (lo que dará ventajas). En cada era hay que escoger entre cinco posibles acciones (moverse, tener hijos, luchar, contruir ciudades o tener ideas).. aunque el desarrollo concreto de cada acción depende de la era (cuanto más desarrollo mejor se realiza la acción). Al final se puntua por las posiciones ocupadas, el valor de las ciudades construidas y la obtención del vuelo.

Está bastante bien. A mí particularmente me gusta mucho. Tiene el sabor de un juego de civilizaciones, pero con una duración mucho menor (1h y media, aprox).

Cambiado en la bsk a Sguerrero por un Graenaland. Enviado el 4/10/10. Me dió algo de pena deshacerme de él, pero no había manera de que viera mesa.

Not easy to see who is in the lead until the end scoring.

RATING: 5.5
Finally played it after much anticipation (5-player game), and it's a solid okay for me.  Not as many interesting decisions as I expected -- maybe this is because our game didn't feature too much combat.  Cards seemed to vary widely in power (though this may have been the usual "the grass is always greener..." syndrome), and drawing cards was treated almost as a gambling mechanism.  Weird, weird endgame mechanism that encourages a last-turn spread of population.  I definitely want to read through the rules again to make sure I didn't miss anything, but if we were playing it correctly I doubt it's going to climb much in my ratings.  Could be wrong, though!  

Additional info:  plays more like an abstract than a civ-building game.  It especially annoys me that you're forever shuttling your poor people back and forth across the landscape instead of allowing them to settle somewhere!

Not enough real decisions to make over the course of play.  Combat seems really wonky, it's way too easy to expand and then compress down to 3 spots (and thus being unattackable).  Here's a hint for you: draw cards, lots of them.. then decide to move out a little, or make babies.  Then make a city, get down to 3 spots... Repeat this over and over and over again... ta da!  You have Tempus.  Yawn.

The actions are well balanced, and time seemed to fly by.

Martin Wallace's games seem to fall into two categories: games that basically work, and games that don't. Some of his games that don't quite work are still fairly interesting: Age of Steam would be a prime example, as would Die Weisse Lotus. Unfortunately, his games that basically work are almost always abstract and pretty boring. That would be the case here. There are no pointy edges to Tempus, no game systems that are out-of-kilter, and all that's good. But there is also an almost complete lack of any tension, any interesting decisions, or any theme to drive the game. You push pieces around, and at the end of the game you score. The scoring doesn't seem to reward good play or doing intersting things during the game; it just is. The action cards you can acquire are utterly banal, giving you basically a +1 modifier to one game activity - they could be deleted and it would cost the game almost nothing. The game is so incredibly damped, with little skill being applicable to the proceedings, that even though the pace tends to be glacial the outcome will usually be decided by a) who got the better setup area, b) who people choose to attack, and c) the usual egregious last-turn free-for-all.

Now, recall I did say that the game basically works, so that's something. That would have been enough for me 10 years ago, I suppose. Today, though, this joins Il Principe and Parthenon as "blender" games: some game mechanisms were thrown together in a perfunctory manner and pureed. What you get is a flavorless paste. It'll work if it's all you have, but it's not satisfying.

Preliminary rating based on 1 play (with 3 players): Fun lightish civilization building game with a reasonable playtime. I'd definitely play again (I wouldn't be surprised if my rating went up with more plays/players). The game progresses at just the right pace so you always feel like you're accomplishing something. My only quibble is that with three players fighting is definitely underutilized. We only had one round of combat! I'm sure things get more cutthroat with each added player.

This light civilization game was quite pleasant to play! I love civilization games (the computer game I’ve played most, by far, is Civilization) and this scratched the itch. Granted, Tempus is on the lighter side, but this also means that it plays much faster than other, bigger civ games. 

I like how you start with only three actions and get more along the way, so there is some sense of development throughout the game. The technology cards are varied and can all help you out in different situations, though it seems quite clear that some of them are a bit better than others. The combat system is straight forward, but due to the cards, you can never be sure that you will conquer a territory (as you can in Small World and such games).

I like how your civilization gradually evolves over the rounds due to which land you control and which cards you play (which also adds a twist as you can never be sure if your civilization will advance to the next step; but even if it doesn’t, there’s a catch-up mechanism which is good so there isn’t a run-away leader problem). However, it does seem like the free techs and the rounds in which you get extra actions are much better than the others. But if everybody agrees upon that, they might be harder to achieve as they are more fought over, so it evens out.

One concern is the end game; you can calculate the scoring of your opponents which can lead to AP as you will try to maximize your own VPs, and the possibility for kingmaking certainly exist. It didn’t happen in our game, so it’s just a thought. I do like the game and would happily play it again with 4, but I think it’s got limited replayability compared to many other civ games.

The euro answer to Civilization.  I think Antike fulfills the "civ lite" category for me better than Tempus, but that doesn't mean Tempus is a bad game.  It's just a more abstract interpretation of the concept.  Still, it retains enough of the key ideas of a civ building game that it is in that vein.  Some aspects also seem a little unintuitive to me.  Such as cities not being able to hold citizens and somewhat hampering movement.  That's forgivable if the game is engaging enough.  Age of Steam, a game I love to play, has the unintuitive notion of shipping goods in the most lengthy, rather than most direct, way possible.  But is Tempus as engaging as Age of Steam?  Probably not, but it is a fun game.

Rating based on One Play

Much Hyped "Light" Civilisation game by AoS designer Martin Wallace.  The evo-esque game play was easy, quick and relatively fun, however I don't think this will have much replayability, and in addition the competition for getting more advanced than the others didn't really seem to matter when it came to the end game that much.  While the gameplay was fine this means it comes away with a slightly odd taste when it comes to the final scoring up.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very provisional rating.

Each of Wallace's empire games has an entirely different feel.  While I think I prefer Struggle and Rise the most, I think this game has great potential.  
It seems underrated here on the Geek.  Interesting rule set coupled with a very reasonable play time and an easy explanation would seem to make this a winner.  I'm not sure exactly what about the game repeals so many players.  I find the card play/combat/age progression to be fascinating.  This rating could see lots of fluctuation as the game gets more plays.

Instantly beats Mare Nostrem for my choice of "civ-lite" game.  What really struck me was how much like the civilization computer games this feels - the strategic choices are very similar, but the multitude of details are compressed into a very simple and intuitive set of rules.  Being on a peninsula is a great advantage - until everyone gets ships and starts planting colonies behind you.  The late game erupts into large conflicts as transportation technology improves and the land fills up.  Fighting limited war for specific, achievable goals can propel you to victory, while protracted slugfests will inevitably drain your resources and lead to crushing defeat.  Superb abstraction of an entire genre.  The only problem is the terribly-abusable 3-stack rule, which serves no real purpose since the only way someone is going to be wiped off the board is through overwhelmingly dumb play on the part of multiple players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'll preface this by saying I definitely need to play this more, as many folks seem to be finding "something" in there....but I don't see it. This is the most disappointed I've been with a game in.....about as long as I can remember. 

Thematically, it fails, for me. I never had the feel I was nurturing my civilization. There is no real development as you go. There is a gradual increase in actions allowed, which everyone will experience whether they've earned an upgrade or not. 

This initial setup seemed to create a turn-order disparity that never was alleviated. By going 5th of 5 players, I had a crappy starting spot that was difficult to overcome. There is no mechanism to balance this out.

All the scoring comes down to the final round. There was a worse beat-up-the-leader effect than even Vinci has. You can't really defend against it, because defense exhausts your hand...which, when depleted leaves you wide open. 

The 3 stack amnesty rule is rubbish.  It creates very gamey situations where players keep expanding, building cities and then keeping in only 3 stacks so that they're safe. Then, on the final turn there is a blitz to occupy hexes. 

I rarely felt like I was making an interesting decision.  Most of the time I did what I COULD do...which was not often a very wide menu of things. Possibly the game plays better with less players, and we also had a map that left 3 tiles unused, probably creating more congestion and competition than there might have been, but there are issues I see with the game that are hard to imagine changing with more play. 

I'm a big fan of Martin Wallace designs. Age of Steam, Princes of the Renaissance, Struggle of Empires, Liberte...all big winners to me. I really wanted to like this one. I was let down in a painful way. I'll play it a couple more times to be sure, but right now I would be ready to trade my copy away and be done with it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice new, fairly streamlined combat heavy effort by Wallace that plays in a short period of time for what it offers up. In around 60-90 minutes players build up an empire, have babies, and pillage each other repeatedly in search of prime real estate. The combat mechanism is streamlined with basic stack size comparison and very bloody results (if you lose outright the entire stack is removed from the board) but stays interesting due to the "idea" cards. The game also has built in replay by using the ever enjoyable modular board concept...let me put it this way: games which have very long, thin landmasses are going to get very nasty when the age of sail arrives.

The key to this game's success with me is the extremely well done cards though. The dual function aspect of them means there are often tough decisions involved with when and how to use them. The fact that they use the terrain also adds some interesting tactical choices into the mix. In addition, there are constant hard decisions about where to build your stacks, how aggressive to get with your neighbours, and when to load up given areas to pull ahead in the tech tree for a round.

Minor points of annoyance though: Wallenstein syndrome. This is a game like that one where avoiding combat at all costs is the best road to victory, as the players who repeatedly spend resources hacking each other up are wasting time compared to the other folks at the table. After several plays the game is starting to feel patterned as players spend most of the game, 2/3 of it or so, simply building up their empires. The last segment of the game forces people into conflict for city building room, but I'm starting to be bothered by this flow in general. 

I do like the game for what it is though, and it is the only combat heavy game other than Struggle of Empires that I've played to date that has much of a chance of hitting a table that I'm seated at, but I sold my copy because it still never was something that I particularly wanted to bring out. This is medium-light at heaviest, and I do not recommend trotting this out too often, because I think repeat play could end up killing it for most people.

One more final aside: you absolutely have to play with the 3 hexes occupied including cities variant rule. I teach the game this way, and I have tracked the army buildups over my last plays, and in those games I frequently have found myself with 3 stacks because of aggressive city building. Not being able to be attacked at all from that position, when combat against cities is already brutal, would be way too strong, and would, IMO, throw the game out of whack. I would not play the game with the rules as printed, because they would rob almost any chance at actual conflict, which is a bad thing when combat is such a bad idea most of the time anyway.

I'm torn on this because I really want to say that this game is absolute crap but I'm not tryign to come across as a reactionary- it isn't "Civ in 60-90 minutes" in any way, shape, or form but that's not necessarily my problem with the game.  It's much more like Vinci or Evo in 60-90 minutes but not as detailed or rich as either of those games and in fact I think that anyone that owns either of those games is probably going to feel some redundancy.  I thought that the civilization building theme was suprisingly arbitrary and was completely stripped of any actual decision making- you either go up or wait a turn, don't expect to plan your way through a tech tree.  Everything about this game is the very definition of "gamey"- rules for rules sake without thematic justification and with all sorts of checks and balances in place to make sure everyone stays in the game.  It makes no sense to me that you can only reproduce in grasslands (but not in cities) or that you can advance in all kinds of technologies at once just by controlling the most hills on some turns.  Or that all the players advance just for playing the game.  And don't get me started on the Idea cards, which somehow can always be used to fight if they match the terrain you're in even if it's a medicine or education card.  This is a area control game with a few suggestions of tech development, nothing more.  It is also one of the least exciting games I've played in a long time (at least since Caylus) but if you enjoy folks sitting around trying to maximize their turns you might love it.  Bad things aside, I have to say that I do appreciate the approach and it was a noble effort on Mr. Wallace's part to try to pull this off but I think it really demonstrates that there are limits to which grand-scale themes can be stripped down before they're completely meaningless, as Tempus seems to be.  I generally like (or even love) Mr. Wallace's designs and I think this is likely his poorest attempt in very long while.  It doesn't have any teeth, it doesn't have any flavor or tension like his best designs exhibit.  It's just another boring Euro with a tacked on theme and idiot-simple rules that don't capture any sense of atmosphere, development, or competition.  A big disappointment, particularly after the anticipation and the advance word from reliable sources that this was going to be a contender.

One play, will probably increase to 7-ish with repeated plays, but I don't own it and I"m not sure how often the group will get back to it, although I'd like to play it 2-3 more times and get to the point where I know what I'm doing, but I think I would rather try out some other new games during my limited monthly "heavy gaming" meeting. Not the game's fault, just my gaming context is rather limited. A few things I learned during my first mistake-ridden game:

1. Initial placement is very important--you need to expand

2. Combat is ill-advised except for important point-grabbing at the end, perhaps. I activated another player's vengeance instinct early in the game, which cost us both dearly.

3. City placement and numbers will start to matter more as the game progresses and you're trying to race for the next level.  Of course, I didn't convert to cities early and often enough--hosed.

4. Playing a game like this with people who are much better than you isn't too rewarding.  Tragically, I find that almost everyone is better at games like this than me, yet I keep coming back for more punishment. Hm.

This game recieved a very mixed reception. Personally, I did like it. It was a rough game for me most of the night. My initial placement was horrible due to going last and it being my first game. Then I put a city in the wrong spot. After that, there were at least 4 turns where I really couldn't do much that effected my game.

Once boat travel opened up, I had a chance, but it was too late. Though, although a bad game, I did come in second. First place was 29 points, then 19.

The only other comment I must say, this game is not a civ game in any way other than "theme." This is an area control game.

Rating after 1 play. LIked it a lot. I like that there are cards with abilities, but also can be used simply as terrain types for battle. I like that battle is a little encouraged than many Euros (defender loses all in a loss, attacker only loses one in a loss). I like that there's a reward for getting to a new age first, but everyone gets there for free on the next turn. I do wonder whether the game goes on a few turns more than necessary, but I need to play more. I'm POSITIVE that religion is way out of balance. I need to go check the forums for feedback, but I think you at least need to make it cost an action.

Tempus suffered from a great amount of hype when it was announced that Martin Wallace was working on a civ-light game, but due to printing issues the game was delayed for so long that people started confusing their withdrawal symptoms with the game's actual performance. The game took another hit when the awful graphics of the ProLudo edition began circulating amongst the gamer population, and hohum-reviews quickly pushed the game into oblivion. I got it very late, when the publisher was dumping his stock in a vain attempt to get at least some money for the boxes.

The first game, with 5 players, suffered from a major rules mistake. I completely forgot that you cannot build cities next to each other—correcting that rule will cause a [i]lot[/i] more contention and bickering for sure. So the game was rather tame and dull. Then I played with 3, using the corret rule, but it was [i]still[/i] a tame and boring affair: If players pick a good spot to start off with, they won't see each other until the game is half done, and then combat can be expensive and annoying. So I'm still not sure about the game's actual performance. I think I'm going to bring it out during a session with 4 players, as the wisdom of the Collective seems to indicate the game is best that way. I certainly do not intend to play the game anew with 3 with the current ruleset, in any case.

As for the game itself: it is pleasing in its simplicity, but the tech tree is awful. There is no clear incentive to be in the lead as the game's mechanics make sure you are swept up no matter what. As a Civ-light game, it fails; I tend to think of it more as Vinci-light. Then a few words for the production quality: Although my ProLudo-edition is absolute shit in this department, I soon discovered that you don't need the horrible player aids at all. The actions themselves are very straightforward, the effects of various improvements are on the cards, and the era effects can be gleaned from the table. I might be tempted to create my own deck of cards: even with the cards in sleeves they still shuffle badly. 

In conclusion: a typical Wallace in that a good idea doesn't seem to work as well as you'd have hoped.

[b]Update[/b] Further experiments with Tempus will not be conducted as the game has now left my collection, and I've not seen it elsewhere to date. That alone speaks volumes about its popularity and/or greatness.

A very enjoyable game with the right balance of abstraction versus theme for me.  The mechanics fit the game situations, are efficient, and trigger interesting choices.  Please note, however, it is not a simulation and does not have representative mechanics of several aspects ususally associated with "Civilization"-type games.

This is [b]not[/b] a civ game, and if you expect it to be one, you'll find it dreadfully lacking. It's a positioning/area-control game with a civ theme/progression, and judged as such, it's interesting.

Tempus does have some of the "When A and B fight, C wins" dynamic, but fighting (or more specifically, attacking) does have one benefit not achievable via peaceful expansion: it enables an attacker to move more units than generally possible in a single action. Also, it can often be done for half an action via Idea-card play. (All this is scant consolation to the one being attacked, who stands to gain very little.)

I've read about degenerate strategy exploiting the "no fewer than 3 spaces" rule. We play with "no fewer than 3 spaces including cities", and haven't had a problem.

Although I applaud the effort of creating a Civ light, 'Tempus' is too light. It is just too colorless for me. A few plastic pieces would have done wonders. Also more tech development would have been nice. Although the modular board might increase the replay factor it also subtracts even more from the already thin theme.

For me, this game felt like unfinished. The turn order may be too important given the restrictions in actions and movement at the beginning.

Streamlined, rather abstract, area majority/empire building games with a civilization theme. 
Somehow soulless, to me works a little bit like a fixed Evo (or a reworked Vinci). Good card mix (balanced thanks to the available double (triple!) use for each card). In the ProLudo version, materials are noting to scream about.

RATING: 6
First play went well - placed a strong second.  Production is really nice on this. Cards are a little thin, but you were going to stick them in sleeves, anyway.  Has a pretty standard action point system, but the flow is good and it progresses at a decent pace.  Didn't really give an epic civ building feel like I'd hoped it would - along the lines of Vinci without the repetitive attacks.  The action cards are neat and have multiple uses.  Very much an optimizer gamer, which isn't always my favorite.  Not bad, though.  I'm looking forward to playing it again.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I missed out on the hype, so there was no disappointment factor for me.  I really like this game.  I like its level of abstraction.  I still feel the theme, and I get very excited as my Civ develops.  I think that it should last one more era, with the bonus era being nuclear technology (mwafwahwahaahahah....).

Update: I haven't played this in a while.  It's not b/c I've soured on the game, but I've definitely lost my fire for it.  This is partially due to going on a game buying binge shortly after acquiring this one.  Add to that my high win %, I find myself wanting to play something more challenging.  I think that I grok this game, whereas my opponents just flounder around.  The victories feel stale b/c I have little doubt that I'm going to win.

Of course, sometimes I'm wrong.  I miscalculate, or fail to see an outcome, or whatever.  Those games are more fun, b/c I usually don't see them coming.  Or, if the miscalculation is early, I feel a real challenge to recover.

What this means is that either there is an optimal "groove" in this game that I'm adept at falling into, or that my opponents have a fundamentally flawed understanding of the game's strategies.  If future plays point towards the former, I will definitely need to rate this lower.  If it's the latter, then there probably won't be many future plays.  My hope is that others in my group will start to see the game the way I do, and the game will open up to new lines of strategies.  For example, Puerto Rico is succeptible to the optimal "groove," but with skilled play by your opponents, finding that groove can be tough.

I'm being hopeful for now and leaving the game at this rating.

One play in, meh, it didn't really grab me in any way. Overall it felt fairly dry as a 2-hour abstract civ builder of sorts.

There's a bit of tension and decision making when it comes to selecting your actions, but not enough to keep it interesting. This is in part due to the somewhat wonky mechanics that severely limit early movement, as well as tech advances that happen automatically, with only some players getting one level up on their opponents in any particular turn, giving the lead players a temporary advantage at best. In addition, you can only grow population in plains (huh?) which severely restricts your growth and expansion. And, as others have harped on, the 3-hex amnesty rule feels quite tacked on and is susceptible to abuse. A restriction based on population would have been better.

Last but not least the VP scoring is just way too coarse. Combined with the overall lack of meaningful decisions I mentioned earlier, the result is a game where even semi-random play can win you the game. To wit, the person who won our game was screwing around on her phone the whole time and wasn't paying attention to the strategic situation at all. Any game where that's possible is an automatic thumbs down from me.

Some folks have tried to address these issues with some house rules. They might improve things slightly (mainly by altering the setup and amnesty rules) but overall the whole thing just feels underdeveloped and basically unsalvageable.

Anyway, [i]Antike[/i], [i]Vinci[/i] or [i]Clash of Cultures[/i] are all better choices to get your light civ fix. Play those instead.

Rating based on one play at Origins.  This is a good, but not great game.  I have a lot of issues with the quality.  There will be complaints about board warping, but the copy we punched and played was not too bad. Cards are very difficult to use and cheap.  Disks that are suppose to stack, slip off one another easily.Just be prepared to deal with a a cheap production.  A lot of small things like the wooden disks being different diameters and thicknesses shows that it was made in China.  It is really quite light and for all of the appearances of a lot of interesting options, there really is not that much going on there.  This was a good effort at "Civ-Light", but I really wonder whether Civ-Light is possible.  This may be about as good as it gets.  If you listen to all the hype you may be dissapointed as it does not live up to the hype.  Nevertheless a good game.

I was really disappointed with this game.  You take all these actions, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of point to them.  Everyone is doing basically the same thing.  You can gain small advantages here or there, but the entire excersize seems devoid of strategy or tactics.  And geesh, if you are in the middle of the board and get picked on, forget about it.  The game just feels very artificial in many ways.  The goal, the theme, and how you get there.  The cards are an effort to throw chaos into an otherwise very static game.  Unfortunately, it doesn't help.  I would play it again, though I'd suggest playing something else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players develop a generic civilization on a hex based game board.  Every turn players take a number of actions, which increases as civilizations develop and expand.  Actions are simple - move pawns ("people") around, breed, fight, develop cities.  Each turn players get to advance based on what terrain they need to occupy in the coming "epoch".  The winner is the player that occupies the most territories and cities, with a bonus to the final advancee.  The game works well, but has nothing really to excite or engage.  I'll happily play it again.  Component quality is average to poor (especially the player colour choice).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The mechanisms are put together well, but the blind bidding for both combat and progress, combined with the random card draw, kind of sours the game for me.  It feels like it should either be more deterministic (like Vinci) or shorter (like Evo).

RATING: 6
This game falls into the "I won, but I didn't particularly like it" category. Those in my game group may understand exactly what I mean.

There are options. There are strategies. There is a modular board.

It went on a little too long for my liking. Also, the turns get longer as the game progresses - something I don't like to begin with. The number of useful options/strategies seemed to quickly disappear as the rounds went on.

Just not my thing, but I can see why others might like it. It fits a game niche that I don't particularly enjoy (see also: Vinci).

A game with some nice concepts, but somewhat uninspiring execution.  The changing abilities of your tokens as the game continues is cool (greater movement, stacking, etc.).  But much of the game is taken up with dull, procedural solitaire actions like producing a couple tokens and creating cities. Attacking someone is sometimes, but not very often, worth the expenditure in actions, and so player interaction is too low.  Vying to be the leader in progressions would have been a fun interactive part of the game, but most progressions are not worth that much and so this fun part of the game can be mostly ignored by players looking for an efficient way to win.  Also, starting position is way too influential in determining who wins.

Uneven game. Early game plays frighteningly fast with a ton of nice strategic and tactical decisions. Then the game slows down and ends
in a crawl as players are able to ship around the board and that web of interconnection slows the game to a halt. Plus the game can be decided
by some card draws on the last turn.... So plenty to like and plenty to hate. seems to be a game that was only %80 finished.

This seems to have some potential to become more enjoyable with more experienced players.  Our first game showed our naivete, as we tried to be the top gun for the next phase without really thinking about whether or not the rewards were worth it.

The one player who had played before beat us with superior city building, and I think it would be more competitive and interesting with a second play.  However, the game clock felt very arbitrary and too abstract for a game like this, and I hope this   game-shortening mechanic will not be repeated in future Wallace games.

Was taught the game in a 3 player game. The teacher pointed out that the printed rules are easily misunderstood and don't cover everything needed for a smooth good game. (There are tons of rules related threads about this game.)However, the game we played went really smooth. Since we were 3 players, there wasn't too much fighting going on. A lot of expansion and city building. The idea cards can be used for either the face action or as a landscape matching progress point when moving into the next age. This was an interesting twist and we newbies definitely underutilized the cards.A 3er game can definitely be family friendly and seems to play in the 1.5 hr time frame or shorter. Looking forward to playing this again with more players to see the dynamics change.

I had a picture of a glass of water while playing this game:  tasteless. This attempt at a light civ game is distilled to such a level where there aren't enough compelling decisions.  Take an action to fish the deck for cards. Take cards. Play rather dull cards on opponent.  Move up level. You're all at the same place now. Repeat. The game's rep was "don't expect a civ game but it's a good game on its own", but I found it lacking in both regards.

(3-5 players) I like it!  And as usual (or so it seems lately) it seems like things barely get off the ground before it's over and before you get to really attack anyone.  There has been scant fighting in the games I've played and the investment in battle hardly seems worth it.  Things accelerate rapidly in the final turn but if you know that then you can set yourself up for it in the preceding rounds.

RATING: 6
I'll readily admit that I am not a great fan of Martin Wallace's designs.  Three plays of this.  I have concerns that the Religion card is disporportionately powerful compared with the other cards - it doesn't need an action to be used which it enhances, aside from it's actual game effects which are also powerful.  Winning on the progression track is counter-intuitive as it is the space you are moving to, not the space you are on.   5 player game on 30/7/07 - too long for me, I think this may need to stay at 4 player max.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Game is terribly broken without a house rule variant that allows players to attack an opponent (under certain circumstances) if he only has 3 hex's with discs.

Without such a rule, it's too easy for a player to expand, then move & convert into towns bringing him back down to 3 hexes again.  Whenever a player is down to 3 hexes or less, he is IMMUNE TO BEING ATTACKED - no matter how many towns he owns!

The method in which players automatically catch up in technology is obviously there for balance and perhaps to speed up the game, but is also another aspect I'm not overly fond of.

With a house rule in place, the game is improved... possibly to a level I would rank close to 7/10.

It's hard to point to one particular flaw because the design is lean and clean.  The actions are easy to manage and the scope of the game is just right to keep each turn in a reasonable amount of time.  There is a fair amount of thinking to the starting position, much like Settlers, as it will impact the early slow going turns.  But the most critical element is that to protect yourself from attacks, you need to look for an area which will allow you to grow unchecked by occupying only 3 areas.  Favor grassland for babies and spring a few opportune sanitation to build bigger cities.  While there is nothing wrong with the game in general, there isn't much that I found very compelling.    Would play again with a different number of players to see how the game scales.

I've played the game a couple of times now, with 3, 4 and 5 players.  By far, the most interesting game was when there were 3 players.  We saw symptoms of a runaway-leader problem in a 5 player game, but I attribute that mostly to a combination of poor starting conditions and bad game decisions by some of the players.

I enjoy the game most everytime I play it.

I can't wait to mod this game! I at least want to make a more detailed or indepth tech tree (using the extra cubes!). I may also make a new World Map version, where you can actually play different Civilizations. I want to get a grip on the game as-is first though. 

The game as-is is fun. I think it's a fun game with just enough theme to keep it interesting, but abstract enough to make the game quick. I personally enjoy it. So far so good!

O jogo é bem interessante. O tema é civilização. Basicamente os jogadores, alternadamente, escolhem algumas ações: movimentar, aumentar população, fazer conflito, pesquisar conhecimento e construir cidade. Isto é, exploração e controle de área, movimentação de exércitos, construção, conflitos, tudo executado com o auxilio das cartas obtidas na pesquisa. Ao final de cada rodada tem uma fase de desenvolvimento onde podemos avançar ou não nas eras. Quem avança tem mais e melhores ações. É um jogo que vale ser conferido.

This is NOT a civ-light. The civ theme fits well, but this game is intrinsically mechanical. The mechanics are great, but initial positioning is crucial, although you might not know it until the end of the game. 

The action cards are nice because they serve two purposes, although they are shamelessly unbalanced. Some of them are really hard to use or give advantages in rare situations while others, particularly the religious conversion card, are powerful in almost any occasion.

Tempus is a civilization game, but it's of the simpler kind both in relation to other civ games like Civilization and most other Martin Wallace titles. That's far from a bad thing, though, because among other things that means I can actually get it onto the table once in a while.

While the (German) rules of the Pro Ludo version are absolutely horrible, once everything has been clarified the game is actually quite rewarding. While waging war is possible it's usually detrimental to all parties involved so most of the time the game centers around expanding your civilization as quickly and widely as possible.

So far I get the feeling that there's somewhat of an imbalance with regards to the different epoch bonuses but that might actually be intentional. It certainly makes the race for those great epochs even fiercer.

After the first play with an outstanding turtle strategy win, we played with the "you-can-attack-cities-anyway" house rule and the game was more fun. By the way, I don't like this tile: IMHO it's slow and uninspiring BUT I need more plays to judge.

It's an interesting balancing act, but it does disturb me that my well considered plans can be disrupted by some lunatic with a vendetta. The political factor probably costs 2 rating points, because I really don't like that. I also didn't find the technology tree to be very interesting or useful - the winner of our game went for hills from the very start. When I had the technological advantage I struggled to use it, which made me wonder why I'd bothered.

If the palette is cleansed of all pre-conception, hype, and expectation Tempus is actually a very solid and enjoyable are-control/ confrontation game.  It is rather light on the civ-based promises but, as aformentioned, if Tempus is approached as simply a new game then it becomes something quite interesting with challenging decisions.  The variety in uses for the idea cards, plus the necessity for developing a strong strategy with ample foresight make Tempus a winning design.

One play...very interesting choices to be made.  I like the catch-up mechanism for the advancements.  It means no one is really out of the game.  I imagine the game would play very differently each time out because of the tile placement at the beginning of the game.  In this respect, it reminds me a little of Keythedral.

Good game...I don't agree with much of the criticism on the Geek about Tempus.  There is a lot of strategy involved and the advancements are excellently ballanced.  Underated gem.

Lots of tense decisions in a fairly compact design. Everything builds turn-to-turn, and towards the final turn. The small bonus available each turn can be quite meaningful as you jockey for grassland and settlements. Points are hard to come by, so each action is meaningful. Small gripes: terrain differentiation could be better, and the theme is a bit light.

Not a terrible game, but did not grab me.  I would play it agan if asked, because it is fairly simple to grasp and not very time consuming.  However, I felt that luck had a fairly significant influence on the game, where the cards you draw can make or break an era, and a few of these added up can turn the game completely.  I hope to like this with more plays -- perhaps the hype was too much and I was let down by the game when I actually played it.

Plenty of game going on here, but felt a little forced in parts - the theme of advancing through the ages doesn't come through at all for me.  Will happily play, but needs to be played reasonably fast, not over-analysed.  Is not the 'killer app' expected.  Colour choice in components is in the 'what were they thinking' category - I do like the suggestion to use the extra bricks to mark city ownership clearer.

People love the Martin Wallace!  I want to like his games, really I do, but so far, he is 0 for 3 for me.  There are still plenty of his that I need to try, including Struggle of Empires and Liberte, so hopefully my opinion will change.  Tempus is a game that sounds great, looks great, and I am glad that people like it.  For me, it ended up being an abstract exercise, with an odd rule of having many cities, but you can't get attacked if you only have 3 stacks of people on the board.  It didn't do it for me at all.

So many things to dislike and nothing that really makes this game worth playing, which is usually not the case for Martin Wallace games. He usually has at least one innovative mechanism that I can appreciate. Here the game is devoid of many, if any really meaningful decisions. Turns should take about 5 seconds most of the time. I suppose the advancement mechanism is somewhat interesting as it drives competition, however direct competition is strongly disincentive and the ability to affect another player's position significantly is very minimal if they are on the other side of the board. Generally uninteresting and I would highly recommend avoiding unless you must play all Martin Wallace games. I should note I love several Martin Wallace titles, just not this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
For me this game was only so-so.

Pros:  Civilization type theme (one of my favorite themes), modular board (enhanced replayability), time under 2 hours, reasonable rule complexity, solid, though not exciting, components

Cons:  Rubberband technology mechanic adds little impetus to do anything to grow technologically.  Was a bit dry with no real theme to any civilization (only discriminator between civilizations was piece color), game grows somewhat static at the end as cities are very hard to knock down.  It seemed to long for what it is and too short for what it could be.

Overall:  If you are looking for a game that allows you to grow a unique civilization then this isn't it.  If you are looking for a game that plays in a reasonable time period and has a civilization type theme then you may like this one.

Components (ProLudo edition) = 2 - While the game is a good area control game, the components and art are the worst i have seen lately: The hex grid on the gameboard is printed too big for the hex tiles, the board and cards wrap, the color of the player tiles doesn't match their pieces, the player aids are unreadable because of the heavy background and tiny type and the lake on the board is purple instead of blue. After 3 games the cards show wear and the board is about to split in two!

After 3 games, with 3, 4 and 5 players I still like this quite a bit. It's not that popular in my gaming group, for one reason or another all Wallace games seem to be like that. It's abstract game with a "civ" theme with average lenght. This is one of the games where you absolutely have to plan ahead but still you have to react to what other people are doing, what cards you draw and so on, I really like that in a game. From the first game on, we changed the cannot be attacked rule to prevent the turtle strategy, nobody has even complained and the game works fine (so that cities count as occupied hexes).

Tempus wants to be a logistics game, but regrettably it fails to present the players with interesting dilemmas.  So instead it becomes a game about drawing and playing the bland action cards as well as avoiding the ire of the other players.  I would be willing to try it once more, but I was thoroughly unimpressed by my first play.  In this genre (light, highly abstracted games of generic civs fighting for Lebensraum) I'd much rather play Vinci, and even Vinci was not good enough to stay in my collection.  The physical quality of the Chinese-made Tempus is very slipshod.  Cards that stick together, player boards that were already warped when the game arrived new, black and purple player colors that look almost identical in low light.  Martin Wallace has been on a very bad streak the past few years: Struggle of Empires, Runebound, Byzantium, Tempus - all rubbish, or perhaps just not matching my taste.

I'm torn on this. The game is fun with lots of choices to make each turn...yet I feel it's let down by the "catch up" mechanism employed. It seems that playing well doesn't give you much of an advantage over someone who's playing poorly as you're only ever going to have a slight advantage in choices available. But, for players looking for a "Civ-lite" game...this isn't too bad a choice.

Decent game but the material provided by Pro Ludo is a shame! It's so inferior. Printing errors both on rules and player aids which are not good readable furthermore. Color matching problems with playing pieces. Color is easily wearing off the city tiles.... I never saw such poor material before in a full priced game. Does Pro Ludo do a quality check before they send out their products? However kudos to ProLudo because they sent me replacement tiles in early 2008 for the ones that lost its printing.

Played 5+ times  3&5 players. What a smooth design. Plays like a dream, scales fine and finishes within about 90 minutes. The rules are simple to explain. All players will start their first game understanding how to play. All players should have a shot at winning right up to the end. This is a most appealing package to me; aesthetics, theme, mechanics. A professional polished game. I hope Martin Wallace continues to work with the same team on future projects. The only downside - The last turn can get heavy going with players pulling short their ponderings more because they are conscious of the time they are taking than because they have settled on the best end game play. This game walks the line between elegant and sterile, for me it is elegant for others it might feel sterile. *UPDATE* I have played 5 games now and my interest is dropping rating down to 7. Feb 07

With three players, it seemed pretty dull yet inoffensive.  There was almost no player interaction (combat seemed very illogical), and most of the decisions were obvious.  With five, it was nearly as dull, but combat and interaction was more prevalent, as the board was very tight.  My main problem with the game is that the first half or more of the game is practically just setup, and WAY too slow with far too much downtime.  The game isn't satisfying enough to justify the long rules explanation.

I only played this once and it was at the end of the evening, so I may have been a bit slow in picking up some of the rules. I placed my initial pieces in a bad spot (which later I found out why) and it hampered me somewhat. 

I could possibly see bumping the rating up with more plays. The random layout of the land tiles makes things change for each game so that helps make it replayable.

A fairly light civilization building game.

Certain things (the religion card, or the ships advancement) seem a little too powerful in this respect.

RATING: 8
In Tempus, players will navigate their civilizations all the way from the stone age to the modern age. Although many of these "civilization games" exist, Tempus is much simpler and thus plays a lot faster than is typical for games of this ilk.

The bulk of the decisions are about how to spend actions and how strongly to compete with other players. Virtually every action has an "idea card" that allows players to get a greater benefit when selecting that particular action. In my first game, I found these cards to create too much luck, and other first-time players often feel the same way. However, I've found that crafting a strategy around the cards you have rather than hoping to draw cards that help you is much more effective. Perhaps this seems obvious, but it doesn't feel as important when you first start playing. 

There are two main parts of the game which create direct competition: combat and progress. Progress consists of controlling certain types of terrain at the end of each round (and can be supplemented by idea cards). Combat of course consists of taking territories from other players. Learning when to concede a fight or accept that you will not progress this turn is an important skill to develop. Over-committing to either of these can cripple both your hand and your board position. Planning a round or even two rounds ahead becomes important as well because of this.

The game does a good job of allowing players to stay competitive until the very end, so it does create a good amount of tension, even if games do end with a bit of calculation to see who won. 

This game does not give you the feel of really building a civilization, despite the theme. It's much more akin to Risk or Small World, though perhaps not as combat-centric. I think it fills a niche and rewards repeat plays, which makes it a keeper, even if it's not destined to be an all-time favorite.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I've only played this game about 3 times, and it can be somewhat slow (e.g. 3 hours), but that's not terrible for a Civilization-type game.  It's definitely a little more aggressive and contentious than most Euro-type games that I play, but not nearly as bad as most war games.  One major reason for the aggression is that there is less of a risk to the attacker than to the defender -- the defender loses their entire stack of people if they lose a fight, whereas the attacker only loses one person.  Furthermore, if the attacker wins, they can move as many people as they want into the new territory, which can give them an extra point at the end of the game, or even more if they have just claimed a spot that allows them to build a city.

One major factor in who wins is the luck of the draw in Idea cards.  Religion cards (which allow you to convert another player's unit into one of yours) can change the balance of power significantly.

It's important to stake out some territory and make a nice packed grid of city-sites that are all 2 hexes apart from one another.  It's also a good idea to use sanitation cards to get a stack of 4 people on the border of your civilization and then make a size-4 city, because those cities are hard to attack, especially before the stacking limit hits 4.

Doesn't really give the feeling of building a civilization, but rather of a recurring land grab, as players compete to control a different type of terrain each time.  Whoever has the most influence on that terrain type at the end of the turn gets a one-turn advantage on the progress track.  Still a good game, but overall a rather underwhelming experience.

Ugh.  A clever idea (simplified civilization building game) marred by a few horrendous "gamey" rules.  Babies can only be born in fields... no where else, not even teeming population centers like cities.  When you build a city, you replace the baby/person/wooden disc there with the city token.  This means that you can, if you aren't careful, birth yourself into extinction as you can develop all your fertile people into infertile cities.  Huh??  Also, there is a card called medicine that seems to serve no purpose as it allows you to have an additional baby within the confines of the rules.  The confines of the rules DO NOT ALLOW FOR AN ADDITIONAL BABY IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM!  The card is meaningless.  You would have more effect on the game by throwing a Magic card in or something... then perhaps you could "Tap" a land for another baby or something.  The game seems like they had a lot of good ideas, but couldn't figure out how to implement them logically, so they just arbitrarily threw in some regulations to make the game "work" at the expense of any sense or logic...or fun.  Don't believe the hype.  Hungry Hungry Hippos has more to offer than this turkey.  The Waterworld of boardgames.

This rating is based upon one full play at Origins 2006. I understood the rules after one complete round, and I find this to be the best game to come out this year. Take my rating as you will, but all fans of Euros should try this game at least once. There is NO doubt I will buy this.

I liked it a bit better then Antike.  Antike is very clever with unique and compeling mechanics, but I feel the overall game play is hampered by the victory conditions.  They tend to drive the action in strange ways in noticable stages.  Tempus may not be as clever a design, but the victory conditions allow for the presuit of more constant objectives.  What am I trying to say?  I may have to make a geek list to really explain it.

An interesting attempt at Civ Lite, Tempus is a highly streamlined civilization building game.  Interesting and enjoyable, if a bit dry.

It took me a few plays to really appreciate this game but I think it's awesome.  It's quite 'elegant' but the theme really works for me.  I think that if I ever designed a game this would be a big inspiration.

I play with the random turn order variant now but still haven't decided on how to include the 5 point cities.

Prefer to play with 4 or 5 players.

It's always a good session when there's lots of attacking so don't play nice...

[q="Heliconia"]Each player's first city is their capital city and is marked with one of the little colored cubes. If a player can take another players capital city they get to keep the little cube and it is worth 2 points at the end of the game.[/q]


[q="4ndrew"]Each player starts with a level 2 city and one disc. The city and disc must start the game adjacent to each other.

Discs on grassland can no longer produce babies. Instead, cities produce babies. The city does not need to be built on grassland in order to produce a baby. The baby/disc is placed in any hex adjacent to the city, provided the hex is not occupied by an enemy disc or water. Normal stacking rules apply.

The rule preventing a player with three or fewer occupied hexes being attacked is replaced with a rule that a player's last remaining city cannot be attacked.

Clarification: Each city may only have one baby per "have babies" action. Therefore, if the era allows you to have two babies per "have babies" action, they must be born in two different cities. If the two cities having babies are separated by only one hex between them, the player may choose to place both babies on the hex between the cities (normal stacking limits apply).[/q]

I thought this game was interesting.  I didn't like the end scoring being worth 3 points, that was too much for a lucky draw at the end.

UPDATE: after reading everything very carefully, it looks as I got progression wrong.  I only counted hexes for Progress points, not tokens on the hexes.  This would change things a bit.

A VERY abstract civilisation game, one which feels as though you're just moving coloured disks across a variable board in order to optimise your score each turn rather than building the next Roman empire. With all the scoring depending on the last turn, everything leading up to that feels slightly irrelevant and some kingmaking can creep in.

There has been much discusion on: 1) Can't attack player with less then 3 stacks of tokens and 2) if this is really a civ game.

I really like this game and it accomplishes what it claims.  It plays in about 2 hours or less and you gain advances in the form of increased: population rate, movement and distance, idea card draws and hand size, etc. as the game plays.

Again, basing this rating on 1 play, but it's a little too abstract for my liking. The theme just didn't fit in very well. Move, Make Babies, Build Cities, Draw Cards, Attack Opponent, Occupy Territory. That's pretty much it. Sort of boring now that I think of it. Oh well. Will probably not play this again or be talked into it.

For me, this game is lacking something.  It is a little too linear.  I'd love a game that was like Civilisation, but simpler (and doesn't take a whole day and more to play!).  This is a brave attempt, but doesn't quite get there.

BROKEN!  B-R-O-K-E-N

That is what Tempus is.  Any game where a player can sit back in a position where he can never be attacked, but can attack you at will is an unacceptable game mechanic.  Mr Wallace, you drop to a B tier level designer for me immediately for thinking such a thing is reasonable.

Let me tell you what happened:

- player sits back the entire game, can't ever be attacked, but makes opprotune attacks to bolster his position.
- player is runaway leader in last turn, but decides he should just add insult to injury, so he attacks me
- he sails to a mountain, converts one of my guys, attacks another stack in an adjacent location, THEN uses a government card to build a city such that the first 4 actions I took the last turn ammount to nothing as I can't build the city that would have put me in second place as HE can't be attacked!

I can't even begin to explain how ridiculous this game mechanic is.  No chance I'll ever play this again without a house rule eliminating this issue.

Don't get me started on the power of 3-4 of the cards.  I never once saw a government or attack +1 card, and only got a sanitation at the very end.  Government is EXCESSIVELY powerfull on the last turn as it allows turtles to do what I described above even easier.

Has to be the biggest letdown of all-time

RATING: 6
I may review this game more formally, but I think the hype surrounding this game is indicative of a larger trend.  Grow and kill games are a staple of American multiplayer wargames.  Yet, for many euro gamers this design type appears novel.  Well, it wasn't novel to me.  I love Wallace.  Most of his designs speak right to me.  I found this dry, and lifeless.  Vinci is closer to Civilization.  This was more like Trias, or Evo with a thin "human" veneer. While it has it clever flourishes, I just did not see it as worth the wait.  In short, too much tempus, not enough fugit.

RATING: 6.5
Compact 'civilization' game.
Elegant, smart mechanics coupled with some innovative ideas.

Some problem I can see is that a player can be shut off the chances of winning not by his own fault, but by the other players' moves and he can do nothing about it.  Nonetheless, fun, quick game which I enjoy playing.

--

The original non-attack rule (->you cannot attack a player with 3 or less spaces occupied by his discs) is ABSURD.  Was this ever playtested???
The correct rule (->you cannot attack a player with 3 or less spaces occupied by his discs AND CITIES) was confirmed by Wallace himself.  Pity it was a year after the release... :-///

Less daydreaming and more focus on solid work, Mr Wallace!!! :-//

EDIT: The game has worn off for me.  Sold.

RATING: 7
Good game, it felt more tactical than strategical however and reminded me a lot like La Citta but I like that a little better. Big plus for this is how little AP there is keeping turns fast and thus very little downtime and also very easy to learn and very simple rules for ease of play. Card play was a nice feature and had a slight bluff element to it. 

It felt a little odd that all the scoring in every round but the last round did not matter at all to the end score, this does allow others to catch up somewhat but a leader can still make a breakaway. The combat is a nice thought but as in other games like this, not usually a viable option as it takes away an action without much to gain, really it is only there to beat on the leader but it often can't be done or especially done well. 

The game takes awhile to ramp up, only 3 actions for the first few rounds makes a slow starting game without much action. Scoring is a little similiar to Clans with terrain bonuses but as I mentioned, it feels very anti-climatic. I think some variants especially to do with combat could maybe push this to a 7.5 or an 8.

Rating could increase with more plays.  Really enjoyed my plays of this game.  The components of the Cafe Games edition could be better.  For example, the colors of the cards, board and eras don't match well making it difficult to match the terrain types.

My game group and I were able to try out a prototype of this back the 2005 WBC. They liked it a lot, I liked it ok. Now that it's been released I've played it a few times and while it is a very good game, it was way overhyped. The battles leave much to be desired but the rest of it is pretty interesting although quite bland.

I like this game, but my first game was a 3 player game and this format (a mild wargame) doesn't seem to play 3 players well. In our game, two players fought and the third player easily won.

Either, this result or one player sandwhiched in between the other two would seem to be the most likely result.

Not bad, but there are better civ building games out there.  Also this one suffers from very poor graphic design issues... the black and the dark blue player markers are really hard to tell apart, the terrain colors on the epoch track don't match the terrain hexes on the terrain pieces, which also doesn't match very well the terrain backgrounds on the idea cards. The city markers themselves are hard to tell apart (and hence which ones that have been played belong to who).

Based on three plays.  This game has real possibilities, and may easily move up.  There is obviously a variety of potential strategies, and the luck of the cards is mediated by the panoply of choices available, and by their dual-use nature.  The balance of the various styles of play makes for interesting decisions and tight play.

My 2nd favorite civ game, just behind VINCI. The card system adds variety but introduces a lot of luck. The 25 copies at Origins sold out in minutes and the game is very enjoyable. No problem, as is usual, with Martin's rules because the publisher of Cafe Games revised them before printing.

RATING: 6
Whoever said that this game can be played in 75 minutes must have been dreaming. Over the course of the game, each player will have 43 actions (not including any any idea cards played).  Even being generous at one minute per action, our five player game lasted well over 3 hours... probably closer to 4.  Much too long for ANY board game.  I doubt that I'll ever play with 5 players again.  Which is probably just as well, you can't tell the dark purple pieces from the black pieces anyway. (NOTE - I have since repainted my purple pieces a lighter shade.) I was expecting an exciting, quick game and it wasn't there.  What I got was a draggy, repetitive slugfest with an illogical last minute grab for Victory points. Martin Wallace just misses the mark with me again.  Tempus IS better than Age of Steam, but still doesn't match Liberté in value.  Considering all of the hype over Tempus, I was a bit disappointed.  There are some good game mechanics, but even they can't compensate for the length of the game, which is VERY prone to analysis paralysis (very noticeable during the final two turns as players set up for victory points).  My initial rating is a 6 (which might improve if only playing with three or four players), but with five players Tempus is a dud.

Addendum:  I got to play with only four players at our last Games Day... it is a completely different game with four.  There seems to be more space to expand, there wasn't as much conflict as with five players, and the game played in just over 2 hours (which still isn't close to the 90 minutes listed on the box, but bearable)... better game play, but not enough to improve my rating.

The last game also showed up one other flaw... going last is a BIG disadvantage at start or in the final round.  Next game we are going to attempt to allocate actions and resolve them simultaneously and see if it helps.

Played 1.5 times.  I'm not sure why I don't enjoy this game.  It's just kind of bland.  I can see how it -could- be really fun, but it would take a dedicated group willing to play enough repeated games to see some emergent strategies come to life.  Unfortunately, that's not going to happen.  There are just so many other games that deliver from game #1 and continue to get better and better.

Tempus is a commendable approach to a light abstract civ game (though it is more area control and resource management than civ building). The mechanics are smooth and intuitive, and there is enough going on to keep play tense and engaging. Is it an amazing game? Not quite. Does it work well for what it is? Absolutely.

Too constipated. I can appreciate the design and I understand why some folks really like this game. It just felt like an abstracted mental exercise to me which I think is a symptom of both the poor theme and the illogical placement of differing terrain types next to each other - JUST for the sake of closing a players options. With arbitrary rules such as not being able to attack a player with only 3 population counters, this is a below par abstract strategy game, NOT the civ-lite game some make it out to be.

The mechanics are streamlined and elegant for a Martin Wallace game.  This game still has most of the problems that are inherent in multi-player conquest type games in that despite all the cleverness of the mechanics, I believe the winner will mostly come down to diplomatic elements -or who gets messed with the least.  For that reason I tend to shy away from games like this, but if you like that genre you could do a lot worse than this game.

Tempus DOES have some really nice thematic elements - the progress 'tree' is very cool, as it seems to broadly follow reality. It is REALLY hard to move around effectively early and this can be frustrating - better to have babies and ideas. Fighting is rare but the fights can be pivotal in determing the winner.  In short, Tempus does 'feel' like civ game, even if much of it is abstracted. Its in the same way that LOTR Confrontation really feels like the actual story, even if it is also heavily abstracted. Even Lost Cities 'feels' like you are going on a risky expedition. These kinds of games don't necessarily capture the theme in a direct way, but are successful in capturing the essence of the theme. I can't say that for games like (for example) Goa and Princes of Florence, which might have better 'direct' theming but I simply don't get the 'feel' of the theme when playing the game - both are still good games though, just for different reasons.  Tempus has a semi-realistic technology progression, where everyone gains the technologies but the person who 'discovers' them first has a significant advantage.  Tempus is also genuinely fast - it really does play in 90 mins or less - and it plays fine with 3 to 5 players.  Quick word about the rule regarding not attacking players with tokens on 3 or less hexes.  Get over it people - this rule does not hurt the game at all and if you don't like it then you don't have to play it!  Biggest problem with Tempus is that I just can't win it  :-)

RATING: 7
This is an engaging, meaty game with plenty of opportunity for both strategy and tactics.  Players begin with 3 population tokens and must use actions to move them to fertile areas, reproduce, cluster into stacks, and form cities which score the most points.  Lack of suitable areas to form cities forms the crux of player interaction as there is a race to the best spots - and conflict as players attempt to push each other off.

The abstract nature of the board does make it dryer than other games of its type.  However, I prefer it over Antike because it makes a more active use of the map and so feels more interactive.

I'm disappointed in the components.  Apparently produced in China, the surfaces of both the board and cards have a glossy stickiness that is below German standards.  This might be tolerable, but a bit more than usually annoying because the game carries a premium price.

RATING: 6
This is an interesting game, it's well produced and has several neat mechanics. However, I enjoy the game a lot more in theory than in practice. I think the main problem comes from the conflict, which I tend not to like unless it's the entire point of a game, and the odd invulnerable rules which are well motivated but have a very pasted on feel during game play.  I like the game but I don't care to own it, or play it more than two or three times a year.

Comes off as a well designed game that merely provides average levels of fun and engagement. Wallace has provided some of my favorite games but this won't be one of them. The action system is very limiting (no surprise there!) but maybe to the point that the board seems static. Unsuccessful attacks are double penalizing because it cost you one of your precious actions; it reminds me a bit of how initiating gunfights in Way Out West was such a last resort. The theme is kind of weak, aand production is mediocre. An OK game.

Initially I had no idea what to do (well, we were playing really late in the evening), but as the initial game progressed, I began to see all of the different options.  This is very abstract, containing really only a veneer of civilization building.  But there's enough of a theme there to be believable.  The components are of very poor quality, but the game is sufficiently intriguing to merit further plays to plumb its depths.  I have heard of long, drawn-out games of Tempus - I would flat out refuse to play it if I thought that it would take longer than 90 minutes.  Once the rules are clear, it really seems like a one-hour game.  As such, it would be very enjoyable.  Over 1.5 hours though would just be unbearable.

[Won off the BGG giveaway contest!]

A dry civilization game based on an Action point mechanism. For a civ game, its pretty light and quick (an hour for 4 people), but I think Wallace sacrificed theme for smoother gameplay. There weren't any strengths or weaknesses for different civilizations. Everyone started the same way, and everyone had the same options available to them.

Components were shockingly bad (particularly since the game was delayed by a year). The board warped heavily, as did the player mats. The cards were thin and hard to shuffle because they had some weird laminate on them. And the terrain/color scheme (a major part of the game) was extremely hard to identify properly.

First civilisation building game I've ever played. The game is quite quick and interesting. I like that in the end of every turn those players who are stuck in more ancient eras are brought to the same era as the leaders. This is the way to make sure that there will be no run-away leader, and the only thing left is to fight your way on the game board.

Pirmasis mano žaistas civilizacijos kūrimo žaidimas. Žaidimas vyksta pakankamai greitai ir įdomiai. Man patiko tai, kad kiekvieno ėjimo pabaigoje žaidėjai užstrigę vėlesnėse erose pritraukiami prie lyderių. Taip užtikrinama, kad niekas per toli nenubėgs ir lieka tiesiog kovoti dėl vietos po saule.

Ratings after one play (with several rules played wrong, including adjacent cities).

I went last in my first play, and I immediately felt that I have no chance to win the game, but rather I was the kingmaker.  All three other players have space themselves out, and I can either settle with one of them (pretty much throwing the game to the other two), or settle in the middle.  I selected the middle, but I felt I already lost the game--before my first turn.  Most of the game, all attack possibilities involved me--nobody was adjacent to anybody except for me.  Lucky for me, everyone was pretty peaceful and we played a couple of rules wrong which helped me out (we forgot about the no adjacent city rules, which greatly diminishes the need for conflict).

Regardless, I feel the same way toward this game as I toward La Strada, another Wallace game.  I thought it was fun until I had the chance to go last--when I felt that it was dreadful.  I really dislike games where you feel that you lost before your first turn (even short games like La Strada).

It just seems like in most games, an equitable starting setup is hard to achieve, and the game is decided in the initial placement.  Whoever ends up with the most area to expands wins (and it is probably not the last player, who becomes basically the kingmaker).

Mechanically and also thematically a surprisingly strong civ-lite game. There are enough opportunities to beat the leader and game keeps itself close all the way to the end.

I wanna think this game is going to get better with more plays but something just doesn't work for me as best it could.  I think it is the "don't attack me even though I have 4 cities but only 3 hexes rule"  we will see how this holds up over time.

Edit: The more I play this game the less I like it.  It seems simple, not very strategic, my moves always feel obvious, my opponents moves always seem obvious and the luck involved in fighting battles where everyone's forces are nearly always equal and it comes down to who drew the best cards makes me wonder why this game is rated highly.  Maybe I just don't get what there is to like here.  I would LOVE to play this with someone who loves it and can show me what's so great.  As it stands now.  This game will for the most part be avoided by me.

Rating after one playing: 6. Many elements that I like, one big one that I don't.  But it just may be that I got royal screwed by it every time.  The cards effecting the battles just did it in for me.  I like other aspects of the cards, but even when I had cards to use for battle, they'd still screw me over.  Bad draw, bad luch... who knows.  The game we played also went too long, ~3 hours.  And there was no prolonged periods of AP, there was just a general slowness to the game, possibly just our group.

I'll give this a break and say "maybe I just disliked it because I started learning it at 1 a.m. and played until 4."  I'd be willing to try it again, but I didn't really care for the game.  It felt like "move, have babies, move, have babies, fight, lose, repeat, etc."

Played at BGG.CON in 2005.  

The first time I played Tempus I thought %u201CThe Emperor has no clothes!%u201D But I kept such heretical thoughts to myself.  Tempus is an area majority game.  The difference here is that it has a %u201CCivilization%u201D theme pasted on.  It%u2019s not really a %u201CCiv%u201D game, but it pretends to be one.  Is it a good game?  One play isn%u2019t enough for me to decide, but one play was enough for me to decide that I didn%u2019t absolutely have to have the game.  (A good thing too, given the delivery delay...)

I found the game to be pretty abstract with a thin theme.  Not sure if there's enough here to keep me coming back.  I'd like to explore this game further.

Tempus is not a bad game, but coming from Martin Wallace, it is something of a disappointment.

I like that card driven combat - it´s not very deep in civ-theme, it is very abstract, but it is much more fun than the combat system in most other civ-games. Beside this it is easy to learn, a bit like chess (with fog of war because of the battle cards) and plays very fast. I only think it's a pity that Wallace didn't incorporate a real tech system. This way it feels a bit to flat... and that's why our gaming group in the end does not play this game.

Again a bit too boring game from Wallece. I've seen this same "feeling" in so many Wallaces' games, that maybe I should start avoiding his games, BUT not the railroad -games (those are brilliant ones). I think the biggest problem in Tempus is, that those bastards (=pawns) moves slowly and that's why there aren't enough action on the gameboard.

Very disappointed after two plays.  Very light civilization building game that is about making babies, making a bit of war, learning a bit of knowledge and making a couple cities and that's about it...Found it fairly boring with some choices but not to the extent of what I normally expect from Martin Wallace.

RATING: 8
Interesting take on the Civ theme. Very tight Euro design. That might also be the problem of the game - at least regarding its average rating on the Geek. It is very different to the usual Civ game and many might have been disappointed since they expected something like AH Civilization with resources, trading, fighting, exploration, development etc etc and all playable within 2 hours. However, Tempus is a Civ-light game and it is a good one. And with everything "light", something is missing, of course. Just play the game without expecting it to be a Civ game and you will most likely enjoy it, at least if you do like Euro-games.

RATING: 7
Somewhat disappointing effort by Martin Wallace. Far more simple-minded than expected from a renowned brain-burning game designer. Still, the game rates a respectable 7 based on the players jostling for position, some tense moments, and re-playability. Pricey given what comes in the box. It's good.

RATING: 7.5
This is an enjoyable, highly abstract, short civilization game.  It has some of the elements that I admire in Advanced Civ. (e.g. building cities costs tokens, combat is possible but generally damaging to oneself (or at least potentially so), civ. progress allows you to develop powers not shared by your opponents) and some unique touches of its own (the multiple uses of "idea" cards for progress, combat or for its printed function).  It's certainly NOT thematically immersive -- one is generally trying to maximize one's actions in ways that don't have the feel of "building an empire."

This hidden gem fulfills most of my "Civ-lite" expectations. I wrote a review about it here: [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1068988/my-quest-for-the-civ-lite-holy-grail-tempus]My quest for the civ-lite holy grail: Tempus[/url]

After some years (when it became one of my most played games (topped only by the three games I rate a perfect 10), it just showed its age. I'm under the impression that when everybody learns how to play well (and this is not a game with a steep learning curve), the winner may be decided by luck of the draw, especially as scores are usually extremely close.

While I conced I'm not as excited about it as I was when I wrote that review, I still enjoy this game. It has that nice particularity that [i]everybody[/i] I play it with enjoy it. It may not become their favorite or an all-time Top 5 game, but everyone I played it with at least liked it.

UPDATE: While an intentional design, the no attack rule if under 3 controlled hexes irritates many I've played with. 

And something seems missing but that may be just part of making a short Civ game.

Rating after several plays. Have played 3, 4 and 5 player games with preference towards more players.

Game delivers on the Civ game-in-under-2-hours. There is a huge amount of variability that should keep the game fresh - from initial tile and population placement to managing your idea cards.

Warfare exists but it has to be out of a strategic need - vedettas would lose you the game, I expect.

Played twice at Prezcon '06, and taught to me by the indominable Morgan Dontanville. Tight gameplay that builds increasing tension over each round of the game.

RATING: 2
I really dislike the rule preventing attacking players with only three hexes.  It spawns spoiler players that can't be dealt with.  This greatly magnifies the problem of kingmaking.  Play Vinci instead, which has a much better mechanism to prevent player elimination.

I played Tempus at BGG.con 2005. It seemed like a decent game going into it. I found it interesting as the rules were explained and we got started, but a neighboring player immediately started a scuffle with me and was beat back to 3 hexes. For the rest of the game this player's sole remaining objective seemed to be to cause me grief and there was basically nothing I could do about it. I still ended up winning, but found it completely unsatisfying.

So, my issue with the 3 hex amnesty rule is not that it is a good strategy to hole up in just 3 hexes, although it may well be under the right circumstances. It is just that it is poor game design in my opinion. It shows a lack of playtesting and incomplete thought in rules writing. Or maybe I just really dislike the rule.

In any event, even if I didn't mind the rule or there is a house rules fix, I find the game itself is rather abstract and blah as a whole. I find it no better than Vinci for a civilization game and Vinci does a much better job of keeping everyone in the game without leaving spoiler players. 

The fact that the game needs house rules out of the box leaves me with no interest in playing it again. There are plenty of better Eurogames that can be played with the rules as written.

Preliminary rating after two plays, may go up or down a bit. I'm not sure whether I have grasped the depth of the game
(and whether there really is some), but it seems very promising. Definitely worth a try (if you don't like it, at least it's really short). 

Update: The german edition is a shining example of how _not_ to produce a game. Almost indistinguishable colors (dark blue and black). Different pieces that are supposed to have the same color but haven't (cities and playing pieces). Useless/wrong info on play aids. Badly translated rules. Low card quality and the list goes on... I would give the game an 7 out of respect for the original design, but the production makes me want to puke.

[Played once]
It is NOT a "civ game" (no "tech tree" leading to asymmetrical play, no trading, limited war, etc.). It's an abstract game based on area majority and limited actions.
Some rules are quite annoying (no attack VS "three zones or less" players, the auto-progressing of every opponent the turn after you did, the random combat).
The final turn is odd, due to the way VPs are awarded (everyone simply tries to spread as much as he can). Kingmaking can easily take place. 
In the end, you do not feel any "accomplishment". 
An average eurogame deceivingly advertised.

RATING: 3
After one play it gets a slightly less than standard 6. It falls to 3 after 2 playes. 

I am not sure what there is here to like. This is not a civ game in any way. The theme is as pasted on as can be. There are few decisions to be made and not many that make all that much difference in the end anyway. The rule about not being able to attack a player with 3 or less spaces containing their units makes it so that late in the game, no one speads out. They stay in 3 large stacks and continue to build cities whenever possible. In the end it comes down to victory points that have little to do with anything other than building cities and spreading out. Giving the guy who goes last on the last turn a huge advantage. The scoring only at the end of the game makes it seem as though nothing but the very last turn matters.  

All in all a pretty poor effort by a designer I usually like. The wait on this one was not worth it and when the new game hype passes we will see this thing fall off the charts.

RATING: 3.5
Tempus is a finely designed game, however it is abstract at its core and lacking in flavor.  Overall, I have to say that this game was overhyped.  Combat is mostly meaningless and felt tacked on.  The lack of variety in the different nations (everyone gets the same abilities, although some might get them a turn earlier) is the big problem.  There is no tech tree, per say, or feel of building up an unique civilization - all players get all of the same things.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Only played with three players and there's an issue that all players want to find their own little space on the board to develop as early conflict with other players is a sure way to lose the game.  Another issue is that the third player gets penalised in setup (less tiles to place) and then choice of starting location.  Typically this player ends up playing kingmaker leading to unsatisfying gameplay.

Miscellaneous notes: blocking is important, the luck of the draw isn't insignificant, and there is some leader-bashing.

Man, a decent abstract that so dissapointed me... I will be the first to admit, I'm a Martin Wallace fanboy, but his last two offerings (this and Byzantium) have just fallen flat with me and my crew. This game offers some neat ideas, and some cool atmosphere, but it just doesnt seem to accomplish much with it. There was basically zilch player interaction, besides a couple of combat instances that turned out to be completely lame. And cmon now, babies only can be breed in a grassland? (Some ideas just didnt click). The only reason this game might get a second playing is because deep down it does sorta feel like a 2 hour Civ game, but not much else.

A great game marred by one flaw. The game ends after a defined number of rounds and all scoring is done after the game. This leads to a brutal final round of points optimization. All of the civ building strategies and style from earlier in the game are thrown out in favor of chasing VP's. Not the taste I wanted in my mouth after this game. 

If you can get past this it's a great game with good mechanisms.

After another play I lowered my rating one point. We saw the "get out to a lead and turtle behind 3 stacks" strategy win. I need never play this game again.

This is NOT a civilization game in the strict sense of the word; more like an abstract with a civ theme. That is not to say that the game isn't good (it is), but a lot of the theme disappeared in the streamlining. I'm not sure what all the complaints about the endgame are all about, I really enjoyed the jokeying for first position in the last couple of rounds. In fact I think it's kind of neat that you can't really be first in all the land types, so you have to decide which one to "specialize" in.

RATING: 7.5
Wallace's civilization-themed war game is extremely elegant.  The technological track, use of terrain types, fog of war (idea cards), action selection and the simple combat system all work together seamlessly.  Although the defender has an advantage in battles the attacker has much less to lose, thus encouraging attacks.  I like the rubber-banding technological track as it gives players an edge in an extra ability for a game turn but more importantly it encourages movement around the board.  As per usual you're not going to be able to do everything you want to do on your turn so players must choose actions efficiently.  Wallace has put out some brilliant games recently and this is one is tops.  UPDATE: decreased rating 1.5 points as I'm finding I'd rather play other Wallace offerings instead.

A disappointment for me. The descriptions sounded quite good, I appreciate the artwork, and I enjoy Wallace and civilization games.

It seems that all game you do not have enough moves for your units. Not being able to move simply all of them feels rather gamey and does not fit the time scope (not like fast warfare where that might be suitable).

After one play (which I won) in 2006, it struck me that I saw no reason to ever play the game again.  I seem to recall it being more tedious than fun, and didn't include a lot of long-range planning.

What can i say? this civlite is up to the challenge (and what a challenge!). A new Settlers of Catan without negotiation and with fight? Yes, approximately. You manage your civilization and armies through time, fighting your way between resources and your enemies. Most of all, you get a notion of territorial domination usually only wargames give you the feel. And also you have a sense of evolution of mankind (simplified, all right in a 2 hour game) which is the center of your activity. Simple and brilliant. The kind of game many BGGeeks tend to consider too simple. Well, brainburner games are just the kind of games many people don't like. I am one of them. This is Martin Wallace at its best, with quality gaming very near Age of Steam. In terms of fight, as pleasant as Antique but much shorter, which increases the rate for me. The only negatives aspects are the abstract theme and the lack of more interaction in some games (war is not really rewarded sometimes).
Recommended to gamers and lighter players.

I hate to sound petty, but here it goes:  I cannot stand that your options include "have ideas" and "have babies"...HAVE BABIES??? C'mon.  Try EXPAND POPULATION.

Also, some weird rules (see the forums) and a sense that the game design is incomplete.

Still, it feels like Tempus could have been something solid.  It ALMOST teeters on the edge of greatness.  Unfortunately, in certain situations, the edge of greatness doesn't mean shit.

As long as you know what to expect, Tempus delivers. No, it's not the "civ lite" game we've all been waiting for. Knowing this going in, I was actually pleasantly surprised by what Tempus had to offer. It has the feel of a "dudes on a map" game with a thin civilization theme. It works with two, but both players are pretty much doing the same thing until the end when they fight a little bit. With more players, things open up for there to be some minor alliances here and there, some deals brokered, and so on. My main problem with the game is that it seems to take too long for the complexity/decisions it offers. 75 minutes would be okay; 60 or less even better. But this has generally come in at more like 90 minutes, plus one 3.5 hour stinker with some APers that I won't hold against the game, but still...

This one really grew on me. It's fairly abstract, so you have to learn not only how to play it by the rules, but also how to play it effectively. e.g. It can turn into a pretty dull game if there are no fields remaining for having babies in.

Well, I'm no Civ game expert.  But after 6 plays I believe this game delivers a Civ-lite game in 3 hours.  Some elements may be a bit abstracted.  But in my opinion everything works & works quite well, while delivering a Civ game feeling.

IMHO, this game is easily as good as Small World (probably better).

I was thinking of buying Through the Ages or Sid Meier's Civ Game or Clash of Cultures.  I'm not sure that I need or want a deeper and longer Civ game than what is offered in Tempus.

After many plays of Through the Ages (100+, mostly online), I can honestly say that Tempus is the BETTER game, for me.  Both are abstracted, but at least Tempus has a map, terrain, cities and plays in 3 hours (even on your first play).  TtA "may" be the better game, but in my experience it is too long for what you get out of it.

Played the pre-release version of Tempus three times today with the publisher in a demo and I have added this to my "must have" list. I already enjoy the design and gameplay of Wallace's Age of Steam and Struggle of Empires, so I went into this one with high expectations and was not disappointed. 

To play a civilization progression from writing, farming, cities, roads, trade, ships, printing, industry, trains, and flight in under two hours on the first attempt, with teaching, is incredible. Closer to an hour once you know the game, I suspect. Plays well with 3-5 players as we tried each number. 

Martin Wallace has once again demonstrated his uncanny ability to simplify yet enhance attractive game mechanics (18xx/AoS). This is a fast paced game with no down time. There are constant difficult decisions to make with limited actions and it is fun (you get to "have babies", "have ideas," "have fights" in the advancement of your civ). We were having a lot of fun with the terminology and laughing constantly while playing a very thought-provoking and challenging game. The graphics, when completed, are going to be very nice from what I saw.

Good. Incredible civilization game. Under two hours, absolutely no downtime, you see your civilization grow, collide and fall :). Loved this game. Probably it will get a higher rating after more plays (with more players).  Beautiful and elegant indirect interaction between players.

RATING: N/A
Players construct a map by putting hexes onto an ocean. Each hex has a number of land spaces, such as plains, mountains, forest, etc. Each player starts their tribe on the board. Players then decide whether to draw idea cards, have babies, move, build cities and conflict with other people. At each round, people bid cards to advance to the next civilization, earning bonuses. At the end of the round, all players will catch up to the most advanced person. Starting order is important, as it appears those going first have the best choice of land, and that appears to be the most important factor in how one does in this game. If you have lots of land to yourself, you will do well. If you are cramped, you will be watching helplessly. Yes, you can do things to mitigate going last, but there is no compensation for going last.

RATING: 7
I am far from unique in this regard:  I think this is too abstract to fit into the "civ-lite" category with Vinci, Mare Nostrum, and Antike.  (Also, the category itself is of questionable legitimacy, in my view.)  Tempus has a fair amount of stuff going for it -- I particularly like the quick turns and unrestricted action selections -- but, as a big fan of the three aforementioned games, I really like the sense that I'm building an empire, or at least making something grow, and that sort of play just isn't on the agenda here.  I like Tempus but can't see myself loving it.

P.S.  You can "have babies".  I'll "spawn brats".  Yes, that is my terminology.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Rating based on only one game. But enough to say that it didn't excite me at all (even if I can play it on occasions). I prefer Antike so much more that I don't know why I should play Tempus instead.

RATING: 8
There are things to like here (the progression through the ages, the modular board), but the game feels too constrained and the endgame left me with a bad taste.  Too much bash-the-leader coupled with dash-for-points.  

That said, I'm willing to try it again.  This opinion is open to change.
--------
Update - I like it better with four, and the negatives listed above are less harsh when you know they're there.  Nothing spectacular but certainly a solid Civ-esque themed game.  Expect the rating to settle at 7.
-----
Update -- I like it even better with 3!  Even less downtime, and the number of neighbors and space to work with feels appropriate.  Everyone worries about everyone else.  Everyone gets involved in everyone else's business.  Good stuff.

RATING: 6.5
More a wargame than a civilization game. There is a tech-line (no tree) and techs only enhance your basic capabilities rather than grant you new abilities (Seafaring excepted).

As a wargame it's not bad, though cities are very difficult to destroy. It suffers from a traditional problem of being determined by who attacks who. This happened in my only play so far (which was also more than 3 times the expected length).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Feels like a point driven area control game. The need to expand into certain terrain types to advance reminds me a bit of Evo. You need to decide when it is important to advance, since if that's all you concentrate on, you'll likely fall behind in cities. You probably want to start building cities as soon as you can, and position them to encourage other players to place elsewhere.

Tried the 'Turtle' method. Didn't work out at all. It seems to be ok early on, but eventually, you've got nowhere to go. I was behind at endgame since I couldn't expand and make more people.

Martin Wallace has looked at the elements of civ games and condensed them into a shorter but rather abstract game. There is no 'tech tree' as such, as players don't have a choice in what they want to develop. Instead, technological development is determined by a simplified era track which all of the players move along, all gaining benefits at the same time, except the player(s) who 'invested' the most in technology in the prior round who get boosted one era ahead (and gains the corrsponding tech benefits). The track works well and players have to balance building cities, maintaining farmland, waging war and developing technology. 

It is a bit dry and mechanical, but it's a fairly enjoyable and balanced game. (8)

A relatively simple Wallace design that gives one a civilization game that can be played quickly, in more of a Euro fashion. I find it a little dry, but it's a good design and something I certainly would play every once in a while when I felt like playing a civ game less involved than others in my collection, like "Antike," "Mare Nostrum" or "Azteca," for example. It's a good design by Mr. Wallace; on the whole I don't find it engaging enough to play more than once in a great while, and I'm not entirely sure why that's the case. Ultimately, I put it away in my attic and didn't miss it. Traded, January 2014.

looks like a very nice game to me. Explanation has some lacks (ex. the 5-point-city-piece : who can tell me what you can use it for : in the dutch explanations there is no ref to it.) Maybe the board itself is a bit to small to play it with 5. The box is rather basic.

RATING: 6
A nice little Civ game. All of the game is just posturing for the final turn - scoring comes at the end, and is based on how much terriotry you control, plus points for big cities. However during the game, it is more beneficial to have your tokens piled up on the territory of the moment, and to have many small cities rather than a few big cities. However, cities cannot be upgraded, and building spots are precious, hence there is a trade-off between having the ongoing benefit of a small city now, or a bigger one later. The combat mechanics are fairly elegant, with scope for bluffing. 

It's criticised as being overhyped and has gotten some bad ratings, but I still quite like it. Some of the actions you take are obvious (but that's true of any game), but you still have a lot of choices to make when it comes to where to move to and when, hand management, which auctions and battles to compete in etc. Having said that it also feels like it is lacking an 'I don't know what'- I wish it had an expansion that added an extra layer of depth/complexity.

RATING: 7
It's a territory-grab-and-grow affair. Each turn there's a competition to have the most people in one particular geography, with the prize being to have the next turn with a tech advance that no one else has. That encourages movement , but you don't want to be too fixated on winning these because it may come at the expense of actions better spent having babies and building cities (ie trading in cubes for a city tile which earns more vp's, usually a hex is only worth 1 point, plus you get your limited cubes back for further expansion) and these actions are the surer route to victory. But tech advance competition may be worthwhile if it's something you need to do anyway to spread out and if you can use the advantage next turn. Tech advances include how many people can move, how far, how many babies you can have, how many cards to pick up / hold, sea travel, etc. It's a game that almost demands combat because the attacker only loses one guy while the defender loses all, but each combat is a very lose-able affair as cards can be played to supplement defense and the attacker has to play cards first. It feels like an efficiency affair. Spread out, have as many babies as possible, go to war if you need lebensraum or if you're losing. The moral of the lesson is always hold lots of cards to warn people off. None-the-less, I can't help feeling the winner in the end will be determined by 'player luck' - who hits who, who takes who's space fastest - the bugbear of multi-player wargames.

RATING: 5
What I like:
- LOVE the pretty modular board
- The tech mechanism works really well, and is more thematic than most tech trees
- Multiple-use cards are really slick, and they work very well with combat
- Rules are pretty simple, and the game ramps up the complexity so it's easier to get started
- The action tracking components are great

What I don't like:
- This game forces you into combat
- It's pretty long with 5p (3 hr learning game, including rules)

This is a really well-designed game. I would love it if it weren't so oriented around conflict. Unfortunately, just playing on a bigger (looser) board would mean that all the conflict-oriented cards would now be useless. The game needs the conflict, but I don't like the conflict. So I might play occasionally to make others happy, but it's not a game I would ever want to play. Too bad, really.

I would put the weight around 3.0. The rules really are pretty simple, but there is a lot of depth, as it can be almost like a chess match. I would put this up with T&E as a great thinky game, but I like this one far more (because I dislike the shared objects in T&E even more than I dislike the conflict in Tempus.

Per essere un gioco di civilizzazione è breve e le regole sono poche. La meccanica di gioco è semplice e tutto sommato scorrevole. A differenza di Antike - simile per genere e tempi di gioco - gli equilibri sembrano meno statici e gli scontri più frequenti. I vantaggi associati all'epoca, e la corsa per essere un gradino più in alto degli altri sono azzeccatissimi. Lascia però un sapore di astratto in bocca, a dispetto della grafica che è superiore agli sciatti standard di Wallace. Non vedo però un motivo per rigiocarlo.

An attempt to condense a civilisation game so that it plays in 1.5 hours. The game succeeds in this although while playing didnt really feel convinced that I was moving throuigh the different eras (the theme seems a bit pasted on). Tempus, however, is a great game to play, lots of different decisions to make every turn, and you need to plan ahead. It's a game that i keep thinking about the next day trying to rethink and plan strategies for further games. That's got to be good, hasn't it?

This is ostensibly a civilization-building game, but it's really abstract.  You're trying to expand your group of discs to cover as much territory as possible; at the end of each turn, there's a reward for whoever has the most discs on a specific terrain type.  There are also cards that help you do various things, but I found the cards to be pretty swingy--ideally you'd want the expansion-focused cards in the beginning when the board is empty and the conflict-focused cards at the end when there's no room left, but you don't really have any control over that except in trying to draw more cards.

Quick Civ-building game with simple rules and solid gameplay.  The advancement mechanic is the most interesting part, requiring planning and timing and should be calculated to use as quickly as possible, as the rest of the mechanics are taken from other games.

Tempus could be considered a companion game to Vinci. In both games planning turns in advance is required. It is critical to know when to decline in Vinci and Tempus requires that you plan for the final turn when scoring occurs. In Vinci you play several civilizations while in Tempus you play one civilization and attempt to expand and progress throughout the game. There are a lot of decisions to be considered in both games and no 'perfect strategy'. *** After several additional games I find Tempus even better than I first believed. There is both long term and short term strategic considerations that rival those in the best of games.

2 plays 30 min + 20 min / player (after at least one play)

The pace and related strategy grown on you as the game progresses. Once you understand the relative merits of each of the actions and the true value of each advance the game becomes very deep while also becoming faster to play. The notion of national borders (or the lack thereof) is key to getting all the game has to offer. Some still find the 3 hex unattackable rule disturbing but as the strategies mature, I'm sure it will become a non-factor.

RATING: 6
One 3-player game. While just learning the rules the game wasn't that much fun. Initial (8 random tiles) layout turned out to have an abundance of Mountains with much of it badly positioned. It might be suggested that the first 3 or 4-player games add two additional tiles to let everyone test out the qualities of the game system without feeling confined to a hopeless cause. An additional note would be the reminder that, in the 3 & 5 player games especially, the leader needs to be kept in check using the power of the 'extra' player. Rating may well go up if I can get the other, less pleased players, to try it again.

Fun game that mimics that generally shows the flow of empires in terms of advancements and slow use of terrain.  It is not for everybody.  People who want more involved civilization experiences need to look elsewhere but this scratches an itch.

The 'civ-light' label is unjustified, imho. Granted, you make some progression, but there is too little customisation to get that label. This does not mean it isn't a very enjoyable game with simple rules but quite some depth

Area majority/resource management game with a civilization building theme

Pros:
* For a game as streamlined as this, it implements theme very well

* The game flows very well and there isn't much downtime. Only one action per turn, and the actions themselves are simple, so emphasis is on strategic planning rather than calculating permutations of moves.

Cons:
* There is only two sources of player interaction: direct fighting and competing for increased abilities by having the most units on a specific kind of space. The first kind of interaction doesn't happen often enough to make any strategic significance. This means the second kind of interaction -- the area majority part -- is much more important. It feels so important that it doesn't allow for much flexibility in terms of strategy.

* Your abilities are so limited at the start of the game that the game really only becomes interesting later.

Played my first game last night. I had seen the game played before, so I had a decent idea, but not strategy. The cards didn't go my way, so it wasn't too enjoyable. I will play this a few more times, and my rating may go up. The mechanics are good, but the theme was ust advancement, it wasn't carried throughout the game very well.

Wow, I've never had my opinion of a game drop so quickly.  I had initially rated this game a 9.  The tiles slide around on the board and the people tokens are hard to stack.  The rule preventing anyone from attacking a player with 3 or less stacks, regardless of how many cities they have, is ridiculous.  The player can still attack others.  The winning strategy is apparently to take advantage of this rule.  Other rules are bearable but just weird.  Only expand population in the plains?  No new population from cities?  No cities in mountains?

Who knew that I could have so many babies while playing a game?  This game was fun and felt like it had a reasonable number of strategic and tactical decisions while still moving along fairly well.  Nothing about this game really stands out, so it probably won't get played frequently, but it offers some variety every now and then.  A solid, but unremarkable game.  The tech tree is well done for the short length of the game.

I've played this game once, at my local club. I'm unlikely to play it again in the near future, and I can't say I'd be too sad about that - but this was still somewhat fun. It didn't really feel like a "civ" game to me, but it was an interesting little game of tactical positioning and card-play, with plenty of competition for board space. I'd definitely be happy to play again. (For the record, I am not generally fond of Wallace's designs.) It didn't grab me hugely though, and while I would certainly be willing to play again, I'd often choose something else.

RATING: 6
Reasonably enjoyable game but too dry and abstract.  It does not feel at all like a civilisation game. It reminds me of a mixture of Settlers (terrain hexes and need to claim certain terrain types) and Vinci (movement to optimise particular terrain needs).  Whilst there is an attempt to add the flavour of civilisation by adding various era advancements, this is way too abstract and it feels like hoop jumping rather than any real civilisation development.

Not fully explored, but catch-up mechanism is very nifty. There is definitely a place for military conflict, but in the games I've played so far, I only recognized it after the opportunity had passed. Because the only randomness is in the card draws, I think there may be a way to break the game (calculate an optimal course to victory.)

RATING: 7
While playing, I found it strange that there were no terrain modifiers for combat (I kept wanting to run screaming down the mountains in a power attack) but it certainly streamlines battles. I also usually dislike when a game decelerates all the way up to the end as the game progresses, but it didn't bother me much here as you could see that it would happen by looking at the progression track. You could plan your brain and butt for it.

I don't like it as well as Vinci (which I rate a 9) but I'd make Tempus an 8 if I found it could speed up a bit.

I was completely underwhelmed with this one.  I dont like the economy of actions as compared to the power of the idea cards in this one.  With a Wallace game I expect to feel like I can't do much- turn to turn, but the ideas cards can wipe out those tough descision, and there is nothing you can do about it.   

I was also the 5th player in our game...  I ended up in a terrible location.  I've only played once, so im sure I would learn to choose a better location, but it seems to me like this game would benefit from a 'First time player set up rule.'  

I would play this again, but wouldn't be thrilled about it.

The production of the game is not exactly top notch (PS Games version). The players aid's background is terrible and the text on it is almost unreadable.

It's a fast civ game and provides a decent experince of advancing and gaining better abilities for your civ.

RATING: 7
Tempus keeps a fast pace and downtime is minimal. I feel engaged throughout. I certainly feel as though I'm planning ahead to get the technology gap, but at the same time I mustn't lose sight of my overall positioning, especially with regard to the spacing of the cities. The cards are my only gripe - to be able to steal an adjacent people counter is too strong a card - it really is blind luck whether you're going to get cards that are of questionable use or these very strong ones. I don't like the feeling that the cards I blindly receive will end up dictating how I will play. I do enjoy the game and am especially impressed at the speed at which it plays. It doesn't overstay its welcome. Much better with more than three players.

RATING: 5
I've never tried a Wallace's game that I haven't like it, but this one almost did it.  This is suposed to be a Civilization game, but at the beginning it feels very abstract and dry, and its gameplay can be described as a multiplayer solitaire, cause everyone is on their own territory making their own business.  I think it suffers from the "long setup syndrome", because the game doesn't really start until half of it has been played.  Nevertheless, at the end it is very tense and all the pieces begin to fit together with the theme.  That good close saves the game from the burn.  Anyway, this is the Wallace's that I like the least from those that I've played; still a nice game though, but not mighty.

Is it Civ Lite?  Depends on what you think Civ is.  If you like customizing your culture and dealing with disaster, then No, this is not Civ Lite.  If you like a rules structure that actually feels like progress during the course of play, then Yes this is Civ Lite.  I happen to think this hits one of many possible Civ-based sweet spots.  The tempo and feel is spot on, it's just the right length, and it has just the right amount of luck in the cards.  Most impressive, and it is a shame the overhype has left a stain on the game's reputation.

RATING: 6
Tempus is an ok game. If you don't have any other civ building games, this might even be a good game. I didn't mind the "catch-up" mechanic, nor the card randomness, those were fine. I like the random start. What I did mind was the overall blandness of the game and the feeling that "I've done this before." I was reminded a bit of Taj Mahal (which is one of my top 10 games) because you need to look ahead to later rounds to determine when you will fight for an area or not. But Tempus doesn't have the sort of tension that Taj has. The final straw was that the last few turns bogged down considerably as everyone started calculating everyone elses moves to figure out the best play. The group I played with isn't particularly prone to AP and I'm usually the worst offender when there is, so if I'm complaining about it... Shades of Vinci here, but I've never experienced it this bad in Vinci.

If you have any other civ game that you like (I have Vinci, T&E, Civilization) then you'll want to try this before you buy. For me it didn't offer anything new and would likely rather play any of the aforementioned games before Tempus.  However, if your game collection is small, you might look into it.

10/28/06: I still like to play this game. I almost dropped the rating to 7, because it doesn't hit the table much, but I decided I really do like it, and I have been known to suggest it. So 8 it stays. Maybe 7.5.

We've played solely without the rule that counts cities as part of your total occupied hexes.  While I can understand the complaints leveled when played otherwise, when played like this, the game is certainly an interesting, light, civilization building game.  

While not the next big thing, it is certainly a solid game.  I wish it were easier to get people to play this with me.  I like the use of the cards in this game, much better than in the later game, Brass.  [01/08/2011]

RATING: 5.5
Somewhat pedestrian empire building game. NO, it isn't the 'civ' game we've all been waiting for. It's an action point driven Euro where players move, populate (which should have been the term instead of 'Have a baby'...which sounds ridiculous when taken out of context by gamers at the next table), attack, build a city or draw special cards.

The game is sound and works as it should but it's a strictly cut and paste affair for Wallace fans. In reality, the game doesn't have a good thematic feel, the special cards can overpower the games and the strict nature of the actions allowed force the game into a fixed pattern until the all out last gasp duking of the last round.

I think some extra development would have helped the game alot. The rewards per era could have been tweaked to allow more dynamic movement and attacking. Definitely a contender for overhyped game of the year.

My one play has me itching to play it again.  Some very interesting decisions to be made about where to expand and how to time your expansion.  It's not Civilization-lite for the simple reason that there's no trading, but it was a very snappy empire-building game.  

My one game was a five player game and the last player really got hemmed in.  But he did pretty good in the end, so maybe it isn't a problem.  Still, I think I'd rather play it four players or less.

Ok, first of all, I am affiliated with Cafe Games so feel free to take this with a grain of salt.  I played this game twice in two nights at Gama and twice at PrezCon.  Then given the next opportunity I played this three times at Origins.  Well, I don't care what company I work for, I'm not going to play a game this many times in my spare time if I don't love it.  

Martin Wallace is a genius.  This thing is going to be a solid 10 for me.  There are a ton of brilliant choices here.  For me this really comes down to the multiple uses of the idea cards.  I love the fog of war aspect to the game that these cards create. Even when in dead last if you make some solid decisions you still have a fighting chance to win. I think that it is a modern masterpiece. 

UPDATE: Again, if you think this is being hyped, I'm sorry.  I didn't rate this a 10 for over a year's worth of playing it as I didn't want to unduly influence the ratings, but now that I've played the game almost 30 times (along with having hundreds of other ratings) I feel confident in giving this a 10. 

UPDATE: Holy Crap!  I can see why people might complain about the three hex protection.  I always played that you can't attack a person's last three tokens.  This is the best way to play the game.  You can still attack cities, and they can still lose them if they choose to attack with them.  With this iteration of the rule I still give this a 10.

Very accessible medium weight game with movement, diceless combat, hand management, short and long term goals,  and minimal downtime.  The board is serviceable, the bits are M. Wallace standard Spree and cube.  Comes with fantastic player aid that helps in teaching.
The only complaint I have is the severe movement restriction for the first 6 rounds.  The game can feel really static, especially if you spend actions drawing cards.  Then again, VPs aren't assessed until the end of the game, so you can afford to tank a round or two without serious expansion.

Interesting civ game but it seems to be a little too streamlined to capture my interest.  I like the interaction with other players but a civ game should have tech that is more usable instead of you get there on the board and you just get the tech.  Also the cards are interesting but you should be able to get the ability instead of having to draw a card and you only have it when the card is played.  Just something strange about that.

RATING: 6
2.5 plays. Feels like a light empire game rather than a civ game. Yes, there are civilization elements (knowledge advancement, population growth, city building) but they just don't seem all that important. Instead, it's a game about controlling your territory so that you can breed and build cities.Don't get caught up in the technology race - concentrate on having babies and building cities instead.

I would like to play it more - why does everyone love this so much? For me, this is nowhere near as good as Age of Steam.

I have a feeling my rating will increase upon further sessions.  I like civ-building games in general and while it felt a bit claustrophobic, that might actually be to its credit once I delve deeper into the game.  Took at least half the games to understand what I was doing.  Good potential.

I like the game. I don't think it's a civilization game, it's more like a "posicional" "tactical" game, but I like it either way.The victory condition is the only thing that makes me remind a civ game because the winner is who has the biggest civilization.

This sort of simple almost family game is not very usual in Martin Wallace's creations but I like the flow of the game and I have lots of fun playing it.

The hype before its release is the main reason why it is rated so low here at BGG.

Nifty civ game. I find the limited movement in the beginning annoying, but I like that you can't fall too far behind on the advancements. Combat isn't too random, but is not as dry as Antike. Variable map setups should help with replayability. I suspect rating will go up with future plays.

I like Tempus. I'd play Civilization instead if I had the time, but I don't. Some feel that the baby was thrown out with the bathwater when paring this 'Civ' game down to manageable proportions, but I think that what remains is an intersting game in its own right. Be sure to use the Designer's suggested rule to prevent turtling: cities [b]do[/b] count toward the three hex limit for attack immunity.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  It is cool that it is a civ game that plays in about 2 hours.  The game moves at a good pace.  It seemed like a tight game, everyone was in it till the end.  Has a good amount of strategy and planning, has decent player interaction as you can fight and block off and compete for area on the map.  It was very easy to learn the rules and seemed to be a very clean design that is easy to catch on to.  I enjoyed getting a chance to play and would love to play it again.

RATING: 6.5
Not a civilization game as players have no choice in technological advances. It is more of an area control game with a civilization theme. Despite it's misleading pre-launch hype, this is a decent game. My only concern is replayability as there seems to be only one path to victory, but we'll see. I've only played it twice. Who knows? Maybe as players become more familiar with the game the wargame side will shine through and conflict will keep it fresh.

Update: OK. I've decided that this game is just not that interesting. It's very predictable and the "cannot be attacked if you only control 3 or less hexes" rule sucks. I can understand players tokens not being attacked to prevent player elimination, but their cities should be fair game. The rule is very exploitable and if everyone uses that "loophole" the game really becomes tedious. My copy has been traded away.

I really want to like this game, but it is somehow not "there". I like the theme, the bits, the mechanics, but the entire game feels "not finished" in a way that many Martin Wallace titles feel (at least to me).
Sad.

RATING: 6
Abstract game that really feels detached from it's theme, however this shouldn't detract from what is still an enjoyable gaming experience. Plays with two if you reduce the tiles down to 5, and plays quickly enough as to remain interesting. I fully accept the comment that you aren't going to get the full civ experience in a game that plays so quickly.

I played a very early prototype of this, a couple of years ago and I couldn't wait to buy a copy then. 

It's a very good game in it's own right providing you weren't mistakenly expecting Civ Lite, as many were. Well balanced gameplay. Beginners fall in to the trap of thinking that the offense needs to be more and that the technology advances need to be much greater. They don't!

Another strong game from Martin Wallace.  It perhaps fails as a civilization game because the theme is so thin but as a eurogame it definitely succeeds.  Solid game design packed with a fair amount of difficult choices.  I like it.

I can see how this gets its reputation as "Civ Lite."  Fun to play.  I like the way that everyone gets "rubberbanded" up to the same tech level at the end of each round.  This doesn't seize my imagination the way some games do, but it's good, and I'd cheerfully play it again.

Disappointment! This game is a big disappointment... the first analogy that comes to me in mind is like when Donnie Darko did come out in Italy after two years its release in USA... great expectations, hype and hype, and finally when I was sure to see THE film of the year... oops!! What's this?! Why so damn hyped?! Yes I know what you're thinking (hey man this movie IS great) but you have to catch the feeling of what I'm tryng to explain... MY feeling! So back to Tempus I have to say that this game is boring, luck dependent, nothing of original, low quality material and bad color/text choice (PS-Games). Try before buying... absolutely!

I only played it once, but at the moment I am completely disapointed. The whole production seems flawed: The rules are really, really bad, there are quite a few typos, the winning strategy seems quite obvious from the start and it doesn´t even remotely feel like a civ-game. The artwork is good - but obviously nobody really thought about it. The background makes the text very hard to read and while I like the cover, it actually is a kind of camouflage (I had to look quite hard to spot the box at the different retailers in Essen.) Also, whoever came up with the idea of including black and dark purple playertokens should be smacked over the head! Black and dark purple are almost undistinguishable!! This is my second game by Martin Wallace. The fist, Runebound, got a second edition within a year because the design was flawed. To be honest, I see a trend here...again it is potentially a great game with a lot of problems. Sadly, this Pro-Ludo production also adds lots of production flaws, which at least were absent from FFGs first edition Runebound.I will propably try it again but the game obviously has not fulfilled it´s potential. Very disappointing.

First Wallace I own. Bought on the BGG Marketplace. 

Update: What a crazy game! I can't believe it's so underrated here on BGG. 
It has almost everything I like in a game: area control, hand management, bluffing, a bit of luck, direct conflict/high interaction.
I knew that me and my group will love this and I wasn't wrong!  
Hats off to Mr. Wallace!

Too repetive for a two-hour game, not enough meat in the game which stays the same from start to finish. There's not really any relevant choices. But the part I most despise are the action cards which dictate the whole play, especially the fights: if both have an equal amount of people when attacking each other, it comes down to which one of them happens to have the most suitable cards. 

How is that strategic or even tactical? It's not. 

Also, I screwed up and covered my one of two plains with a city and therefore couldn't make two babies in a turn which cost me hugely. Of course, my mistake but I can't understand thematically why I can't have babies anywhere I want? This makes Tempus feel very game-y.

This just isn't my type of game. Generally I don't care for games where any kind of elimination through fights or war is possible.

A rare Martin Wallace game that doesn't seem to get the same love as his other titles. I'm guessing that's because the game was overproduced, blown out at bargain basement prices, got into the hands of a lot of casual gamers (where most Wallace titles are pricey and/or limited in quantity and end up in the hands of rabid fans only) who found the game too long or complex or ... who knows? I also think this was hurt in the ratings by people who thought it would be the next great civilication-building game (it's not, but it is an excellent area-control game with a civilization theme). In any event, this is actually one of my favorite Wallace designs - like other good examples of his work, it's a fairly simple, elegant game engine wtih a lot of depth. I have to agree with folks who have groused about the components of the Cafe Games edition - the terrain graphics on the cards, board and promotion track don't match up as they should, and the purple and black player pieces are almost impossible to differentiate from each other. But don't let that or surprisingly low ratings stop you from trying what I think is a mid-weight area-control gem, especially because it is pretty easy to pick up a copy of Tempus cheaply!

Yay, a supposed Civ-building game where you play randomly drawn action cards as cultural or technological progresses, but in order to be able to use for instance the aqueduct technology again you need to find another card in the draw pile. So after having succesfully built an aqueduct all engineers from the time suffer from an instant case of amnesia?I can hardly put in words how superlame I think this mechanic is. Same with any other progress. Really makes you think you build up a civilization - not!

Another Christmas gift. Played it with two of my brothers and I had a blast. It's got some good depth to it, making it not too heavy, but above a medium weight. I liked the choices available during the turns, and I like the catch-up method. If it weren't for my brother (who seemed to be falling behind) constantly yelling about a supposed "Runaway leader problem," (who then eventually won) it would've been a great experience. Can't wait to play again, but I'm sad that it's a three or more player game as I more often only have my wife to play against. Wouldn't mind trying again, but not likely to happen.

RATING: 6
Not a bad game, but it's a little long (2 hours + about 25 minutes for rules explanation), and it can take some time for your turn to come around (in a five player game). Components are fine, and gameplay is relatively simple and straightforward. I made some newbie mistakes in my first game, and would definitely place my starting pieces differently next time. Has a bit of rich-get-richer problem, since the 'leader' gets some advantage(s) each turn. I'd be more inclined to give it another go if it weren't so long.

I picked Tempus up on the cheap. I find it a fun game that is easy to teach and play. If you expect an in depth Civ game, prepare to be disappointed. The game does provide this to some extent, but it is highly abstracted and quite light.

I have used this when introducing a new gamer to a group. It has enough merit as a game to keep the gamers satisfied and enough design choices to introduce newcomers to the world beyond Monopoly etc.

Well this is NOT Wallace's best game created.  It's got it's strong points though.  The main thing I'll say is that it's fast.  It doesn't really give you that full civilization development feel like a good civ game will but then you can't get that in such a short game.  I like it and once everyone is familiar with the game I think a more strategies will develop.  Looking forward to playing this a few more times to flesh out my full thoughts on it.

UPDATE: On further plays I found it be pretty samey in the way the game plays out. Further it really isn't as interesting as I thought after the first play. I don't like the catch up mechanic at all. BLECH This game really didn't live up to it's hype. Glad I moved it on to someone else who might be able to appreciate it more.

Pre-ordered in October of 2005, and later cancelled my pre-order in May of 2006.  Finally tried it out once, and found it was an okay game, but with such high expectations after waiting so long, there wasn't really any it could live up to my hopes.  I certainly wouldn't mind trying it again, but it's not a must-buy for me now.  My biggest problem with Tempus is that I don't like when games allow for fighting but strongly discourage it by making it too difficult and unrewarding, like in Twilight Imperium for example and Antike from what I've heard (e.g., on the Board Games with Scott video review).  I'm a huge fan of Martin Wallace's Age of Steam, but I may be able to pass on this one, and wait to see what else he has in store for us.

A fairly simple game of the civilization-building genre, it preserves enough of the essence that it scratches the itch for that type of game passably well in 60-90 minutes.

Hmmm.  Should have been superb, but somehow just doesn't have the depth of things going on I was looking for in a Civ game.  Vinci has a similar feel to this in terms of the ingredients of a Civ game it includes (ie. still no trade, and a rather unsatisfactory technology development idea) but is much more interesting and fun to play.
Likely to trade this...

I played a prototype of this at Origins 05.  Tempus is a great game, and I really look forward to it's release.  Of the games I have played it is most comparable to Vinci, but it brings a great deal more to the table.  The combat is extremely simple and has a great mix of luck and predictability.  The dual nature of the cards forces you to make choices about how they will be used.  The board is variable and I believe different setups and starting positions will have a nice impact on the feel of the game (I have only played once, though).  The technology track is very abstract, but it works quite well and seems balanced.  I have been looking for a game like this.

I won a copy in Cafe Game's contest, and I also played it again at BGG.CON.

Decent area control game with a light civilization theme - a clean and elegant design whose simplicity also comes with downsides. All the factions are the same with no room for customization (save for fleeting moments spent one step ahead of the others on the one-dimensional tech "tree"). The combat is inevitable, deterministic, and brutal, meaning that whoever can best avoid it will almost certainly win - and too often this is directly determined by the starting positions. Tempus gets many things right, too. I'm on the lookout for a similar but better game to replace it - but haven't still found one.

RATING: 6
Tempus really felt like the ultimate 6: "OK. Will play sporadically if in the right mood." There really isn't anything wrong with the game-- I suppose one could justifiably complain about the luck which is a larger element than most games I like, but that is not really the source of my Tempus malaise, rather it just feels sort of lifeless (which has the side-effect of making it feel longer than it should feel.) For all the teeth gnashing and posturing, the tension felt wholly artificial. While I could see that spending my actions wisely was quite important, I never really anguished over which way to spend them or had that juicy pain of wanting to do ten things at once. Further, while the tension on the board-- created by how tight the game is-- is palpable, I felt a little like a dog thrown in a fight by a malevolant underground betting ring. In Vinci, you fight because you are greedy or you fight because you are agressive or you fight because it feels good to conquer or perhaps it just might be that you fight because you sadly feel that war is the last resort. In Tempus, you fight simply because you are thrown into a ring that has been space-constrained because the puppet-master insists that you will fight. Arf, arf. ps. Way more games need the mechanic of having babies! That part was great!

I played this well after all the hype and the subsequent backlash had died down.  I've only had the chance to play this three-player, which makes it less confrontational, I would guess.  While it was alright, I anticipate that this will get juicier with the required conflict that five- and possibly four-player games would feature.  Smart city-building is key to staying ahead on the progress track.  Do not play with the three stacks of tokens = invulnerable as written in the rules!  Instead, make it so that it's three locations including cities, but that you can't attack the last stack of tokens.

Случайно на блоге встретилось название Tempus, и по найденной об игре информации мне она очень приглянулась.

Возникла такая идея по введению новой фазы - Торговля, прямо перед концом эры:
1. Определяется торговый лидер (по числу городов, при равенстве - по населению городов, при равенстве - по числу карт идей в руке, при равенстве - по близости к первому игроку)
2. Торговый лидер заявляет количество карт идей для торговли в этой эре (от 0 до торгового рейтинга эры (0-3), который надо конечно "дорисовать")
3. Все игроки лицом вниз кладут заявленное число карт идей. Игроки могут вместо карты снять с поля или своего резерва фишку и положить ее вместо карты идеи.
4. Карты вскрываются и торговый лидер первый начинает торговлю:
А. Договаривается с другим игроком на обмен карта на карту (взаимовыгодная торговля), либо забирает чужую карту просто так (агрессивная торговля). Вместо карты можно брать выложенные на торговлю фишки.
Б. Ход переходит к игроку у которого забрали (выменяли) карту. Игрок может передать свой ход любому другому игроку.
5. Торговля продолжается пока не будут разобраны все выставленные карты (фишки).
6. Собранные фишки можно после торговли либо добавить к своему стеку на карте (обменяв на свой цвет, если отличается) или сохранить на будущее.

---

Также возможны следующие хоумрулы:
1. Темпус - НЕ остров, и все что примыкает к краю карты не имеет выхода к морю. Не знаю как это отразится на балансе, но интересно иметь на карте территорию "в глубинке".
2. Горы не проходимы вообще. Или на них нужно остановиться и нельзя десантироваться с моря. Чтобы добавить вопросы к логистике. (Полностью непроходимыми делать нельзя, т.к. города легко затыкают дырки).
3. При создании карты, после того как большая половина кусков уже выложена, новые можно не присоединять к какой либо части суши, а формировать острова.
4. При "захвате" города, у противника отбирается случайная карта из руки.
5. Кубики могут использоваться как армии силой 2, вместо круглых фишек силы 1. Недостаток армий: более подвержены Религии, одна армия создается два хода (сперва круглая фишка рождается, потом она заменяется на куб), при этом вне боя она равна простой фишке.
6. Города силой 5 могут быть созданы двумя игроками, которые договорились между собой. Один из них тратит 1 действие "Build a City", другой сбрасывает карту какого-то цвета и снимает все свои и "союзника" фишки с двух соседних гексов (числом не менее 6) и на один из них (по цвету сброшенной карты) кладет город силой 5. Этот город приносит очки обоим игрокам. 

И по поводу спорного правила, что нельзя атаковать игрока, если у него фишки меньше чем на 3-х гексах. Я думаю его можно трактовать так: "нельзя атаковать (или применять религию на) _фишки_ игрока (не имеются ввиду города), если этот игрок имеет не более 3-х фишек на карте". Не важно сколько гексов они занимают, и при этом всегда можно атаковать города (если есть). А еще проще - нельзя атаковать в первый ход.

One problem is that in the attempt to be "2 hour civ", the game is abstracted beyond the point of being a true civ experience. Moreover, things move at too slow a pace in the first half of the game to really be exciting. Overall it's decent, but the magic just isn't there.

This almost crosses the threshold of fun to work, but I see some potential, despite some frustrations I had with my first playing.  The card draw can play a huge advantage toward one player, but there's a lot of different things going on, and different ways that you can focus your strategy.  Not bad.

Great game.  We played with four players and found it very interesting.  All of us have played the Settlers of Catan game and found this very complimentary to it.

One play, and had fun. Typical wild-swings in the end-game, it seemed. Some colour problems with the components. Not the holy grail of "civilization in an hour", but wasn't realistically expecting that. The "catch up" technology track was an interesting feature. Reminded me much more of Keythedral and Settlers than Civilization.

This is an area control game with a civilization theme.  The rules are frustrating because it's been very easy to miss rules, or to misunderstand them.

RATING: 5
Yet another civilization game promissing swift delivery of the goods (i.e short playing time) without achieving results as advertised. Despite copying many different game mechanics (Catan, Avalon Hill Civilization, etc) it doesn't quite manage to capture the player. Too complicated for players who want a light, quick game, too short and random for players wishing a more acurate civ simulation.

RATING: 7.5
A quick civilization building game. The landscape is random (similar to PocketCiv), and cards are multi-use (battles, tech advances, and special goodies). The game is simple to understand, and the possibilities for game play seem limitless. I'd like to try it again.

Played at Great Hall Games.

Strange components (not bad, but...odd): a [b]very[/b] thick box that is hard to open, redundant action chits (use undocumented extra cubes), warped and "sticky" cards with a pronounced linen finish, same finish on the warped (but fixable) map and tiles.  Graphics are a bit muddy, and gods know what they were thinking on the black/purple (or dark blue) choice.

Game feels a bit too processional at first, but that clears up in the midgame. Wish there was more differentiation available here, not because I want a "true Civ game" (whatever that means), but because I love asymmetry and this doesn't have much of that.

RATING: 7.1
For me, this is not a Civ-lite game because it's not historically based.  It's a Civ-themed game that is meaty enough for gamers to enjoy but loses some of the flavor that Vinci or Mare Nostrum provide.  Still good but overpriced at retail IMO for what it comes with.

RATING: 7
First play was a long time ago.   Lots of actions,  lots of scoring...I remember it ending with a bit of kingmaker "who do I attack if I'm not in a position to win" at the end when everyone is scrambling for points.  I have no idea how to handle the 3 stack rule,  but I guess it hasn't really come up yet.  Having all the scoring at the end makes it tense,  but also doesn't give you much of a gauge of how you're doing.  Bogs down a bit near the end with all the actions you can do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An excellent area control game using actions for the turn mechanic.  Love the fact that each player will only ever be 'one behind'.  I may even give it a 10 if it works for 2 - I must try it.  It is Vinci meets Goa/Torres etc in my book - my fave type of game. I'm dying to give it a ten so may do after another play.

RATING: 7
This rating could go up to 9 or down to 7 with another play or two.  I ended up winning, but did it by having virtually no interaction with anyone else on the board.  I sat in a small secluded corner of the board surrounded by mountains, and built up my cities.  I snuck out near the end of the game and grabbed a little more territory, but the bulk of my points came from my spot in the corner.  

I'm a bit concerned that there isn't really enough stress/interaction between the players.  We'll see . . .

Dropped the rating down to 7 for all of the reasons I wrote after the first play.  The winner seems to be the player that has the most room after the setup.  There are a few things you can do to change this, but only at the margin, and only for the last couple of turns.

After three plays. I don't see it as a ten, but it is a clever, quick game. Don't like that technology only gains you a little bit of an advantage, but I may not think that's so bad after a while. Expect ratings to go up after more plays. Went up a bit. Not sure how  many viable strategies there are to persue.

Played once (with 4 players). I knew I should not expect a "Civ-lite" game, and was not surprised it wasn't one. However, I was still disappointed by what it was. Some ideas are nice, there are some mildly interesting decisions, and I would certainly play better in my second game than in my first one. However, there is a lot of randomness in the cards, initial movement is really slow, the rules are unclear - and all that doesn't help me liking this game.

I like the rapid pop growth and staking out your territory aspect. (It's much like AH's Civilization).  The cards are a bit annoying in that some are a bit weak, but they do make each game play differently. I love pre-game map building games. I wish it was bigger and longer with more terrain variety!

definitely a Wallace game.  Lots of different paths to victory.  We had one person focus entirely on breeding and city building for the entire game, and she came in second by one point.  Everyone was fairly close in the running to the end, and we finished in a decent three hours -- which includes learning the game.  i'd like to play a time or two more.  It's not, and doesn't look like it will become, one of my favorite Wallace games, but it's okay to good.

This is a fabulous concept that feels wholly incomplete. Nice components, and I like the evolution of the civilization tiers. But other than a few neat ideas, I am actually surprised it was published in its current form. Tempus as released feels like an early concept prototype. There are several major issues with the game. 1) The mountain spaces are worth no points and cannot have cities built, yet are the most common terrain element, severely restricting space and creating a lot of game clutter. 2) Movement is so incredibly limited early on that you can accomplish very little at the point in the game where you need the most flexibility and planning. 3) Meanwhile, the board is so cluttered by the end, you find yourself with the most actions available in the game (5 or 6 actions per round) with nothing to do because you can't have babies, can't build new cities, can't move into any better positions, etc. Lots of churning Idea Cards. 4) Combat is incredibly difficult to pull off, especially against a city. The stack limits prevent all but a massive card investment to succeed in taking on any sort of city, and then only if you guess right about what terrain the defender is going to call. 5) The artificial restriction of not being able to attack someone on 3 or fewer hexes is ridiculous -- buy a bunch of cities and then consolidate your stacks to make yourself immune to counterattack. It may prevent leader bashing, but it completely eliminates any sort of catch up mechanic... the only people you can go after are the people out of contention.

Tempus and [thing=60]Vinci[/thing] do the best job (in my limited experience) of providing a map-based civilization game with interesting decisions to make.  As the conflicts arise in Tempus, you get at least a little sense of unforeseeable danger, which you will have to choose to riskily disregard, or with which you must deal.  Still, my award for civilization games goes to [thing=25613]Through the Ages[/thing]; however, it is a civ card game that uses no map, so it's not a fair comparison.

The particular multipurpose use of the cards in Tempus is quite nice, but still can leave you with cards that are useless for your situation (other than for bluffing, which can bleed off your opponents' cards).  Also, the Cafe games edition is beautiful, with cards that shuffle perfectly.

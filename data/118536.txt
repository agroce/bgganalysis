RATING: 10
10-18-14: I only played it once (at the 2014 Dice Tower Convention) but it was probably the greatest time I've ever had playing a co-op. You really had to work together as a team, there was a lot of interaction even when it wasn't your turn, and I'm sure the "dirty cop" element would make it even better. Would definitely play this one again. If it wasn't so hard to find right now I'd probably already own it.

7-11-15: Strike that. The best actual game experience I ever had with a co-op was our second game of PP at BGG.Con 2014, which we played with The Chief, who completed our 11th hour comeback win by making the clinching arrest of the suspects.

9-8-15: Even though we Kickstarted the latest and greatest version, 2nd edition copies started appearing online so I snagged one. We played it again for the first time in a while, but first I had to do some shopping at local toy stores to pick up some police car toys to [-]play[/-] game with, and realized this must be what it's like for people who really, really love playing Arkham Horror. Doing the game master function for the first time was exhausting, but exhilarating. I can't wait to play it again. Now that we own a copy, I'm finally bumping it to a '10'.

RATING: 7
Great and thematic theme. Being a police officer is so cool! The whole investigation part is a neat mechanic but gets a bit useless with too many players because with e.g. six players you always find evidence and so its hard to play the dirty cop and say you found nothing without being suspicious. Anyway Police Precinct is a very nice game and maybe will increase in my rating if tested with fewer players and played more often. PP asks for expansions. Also great components. Thick cardboard.

Very enjoyable game.  I still like Flash Point: Fire Rescue better, but that is due to the luck mechanic.  I prefer my luck being in what happens to me (dice to place fires) rather than in how I perform (dice to deal with events or drawing cards).  This game provides a lot of ways to deal with the luck, though, so I think I will get plenty of plays out of it.

RATING: 9.25
Another example of a theme I have been begging for in games for the better part of a decade. This game tells a story like few others can. The most recent play of it I had myself and my two friends were each separately taken out of commission by a belligerence drunk at a bar. The third attempt we even had air support. While this drunk was kicking the snot out of us a guy with a bomb was holding up the bank. That I remember this well enough to share it here is the highest note of praise I can give any game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very difficult. Once things get out of hand by bad luck or not being able to get to a crime spot quickly enough, you're on the way down. There seem to be too many blank cards in the investigation stacks, but a couple can be removed to get a better balance. After a second play it is clear that while you do need some luck (where the evidence is for example) it is quite well balanced. Second edition has smoothed out the rules and was a very good purchase.

A cooperative police procedural.  It was interesting enough, and I may end up liking it more, but we played with the dirty cop for my first play and I wasn't too crazy about the variant.  Mostly because I was the dirty cop and didn't have much I could do either way.  The printing errors were a distraction, and the addition of donuts as a power source seemed more insulting to police than thematic.  I'd like to play again before coming to a more final conclusion, but for now, there are other co-ops I'd much rather play.

This is a cooperative game that does not encourage co-op behaviour and, despite wanting to love it because of the theme, none of the group thought it particularly interesting.

RATING: 8.5
Very entertaining co-op with a possible traitor 'Dirty Cop' element you can mix in for variety, I was a little reluctant to check this out because I found the artwork a little bland, but this 2nd edition is solid, the art is kind of cool in its own cheesy way and the mechanics are really fun and thematic, even if the game takes a pretty stereotypical view of the police. Hoping for an expansion somewhere down the line, with more Emergencies, gangs, characters, etc.

RATING: 6
A good co-operative, although sometimes tends to be repetitive, because of the three options available, investigation, arrest and emergencies, often, for example, those who dedicate themselves to the arrests gets just that. but still a great collaboration, the use of dirty cop, makes the game more difficult and fun, even if all the players become paranoid thinking that the policeman sitting next to us is corrupt.

Fairly straightforward cooperative game with tons of levels of difficulty.  We found the initial level to be pretty easy so have tried stepping up the difficulty and introducing the traitor.

Was hoping for more with this game, but as it is now, it has some interesting choices to be made, but plays very similarly to most co-ops. There's always a bunch of stuff going on so it's impossible to deal with everything, you really have to pick and choose what you're going to work on.

I do like the ability to upgrade your base skills!

Don't see this one getting a ton of plays, but every once in a while we might bring it to the table. With all the thematic elements one would think that Police Precinct would be a highly engrossing and thematic experience, but in the end kinda fell flat around our house.

RATING: 5.5
I love cooperative games, but this one is perhaps a little too long for what it is; it’s a quite basic game and in my experience it’s not that difficult to win – and if a cooperative game is relatively easy to play and win, it shouldn’t last for 1½ hour or so. 

First, let’s talk about the good stuff. The special character abilities and the police cards make the game interesting; you always need to evaluate if you want the symbols or the ability of the cards. The special character powers shape your strategy but they don’t determine it (the fact that you can upgrade the 3 symbols with doughnuts helps towards this).
I liked the fact that you can lose the game in two different ways; while you’re trying to find the evidence so you can eventually capture the killer, you constantly need to be aware of the crime track. The boxes you put on some of the emergencies are a very good idea as they bring some uncertainty and element of surprise, and finally the urgent marker is a great feature as you’re constantly under pressure. Or, at least in theory, because in 2 of my 3 games the crime rate didn’t move too much and we never had any trouble winning. This brings me to the negatives.

The game doesn’t have the same tension as other coops like Ghost Stories; actually I have won all of my 3 games so far. Yes, I know that there are at least 14 different ways of increasing the difficulty, but I don’t have the time to experience with so many different setups!
The gameplay is kind of boring. The ways you”investigate” isn’t such a great mechanism, and you basically do the exact same with all of the four decks of cards… I feel like there should have been major differences in the way you find evidence – then my enjoyment of the game would increase drastically! Finally, at least with two players (it wasn’t a huge issue with 4), we spent the majority of the game just staying afloat and getting the evidence, before we could finally arrest him, and it felt a little wonky.
I’m sure that the traitor element would have added something to the game, but if I want to play a game with a traitor I’ll just play Shadows over Camelot, which I anyway find a better pure coop than Police Precinct.

I would put this in the 2nd tier of co-ops, behind the likes of Robinson Crusoe, Ghost Stories, and Legendary. But it's still an entertaining and challenging one. Also, the 2nd edition is a fantastic production. I have not played the Dirty Cop (secret traitor) mode yet.

Of course you might say that I'm a tad bit biased, but I have always loved Police Precinct, and now that it's out in App form, I play it all the time with others and solo.  I like to boost the challenge up to where it's almost impossible to win.  This is the case at the "Chief" level in the app.  As of this writing, I have tried to beat it 32 times.  All I can say is.... "Someday!"

RATING: 6
The game is great; the art is terrible. I desperately want to make a full conversion just so I don't have to look at improperly scaled cars and every bad font that comes stock on a new computer. If you're not a picky artist like me and you can look past its looks, Police Precinct has some neat mechanics and can be fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not bad at all, the game's got some charm to it and I really like how while trying to get to the killer, the players still need to focus on keeping down the crime rate as well.
I do hope that the rules booklet will be updated in a future revised edition though, as there are lots of grammatical errors in there. I would definitely rate this game a 7 or even 7.5 if it weren't for the rules as they stand right now (July 2013).

Juego cooperativo de policías donde hay que atrapar al asesino antes de que escape de la ciudad y al mismo tiempo evitar que el índice de criminalidad se desmadre y nos haga perder la partida.

I like cooperative games. I like a well-integrated theme. And I like to have fun. Police Precinct only delivers on 2 out of 3. I'll bet you can guess which one it failed on. Our game was at turns frustrating and painful, and I was inwardly hoping we'd just lose already so it would be over.

My issues with this game - it is far too long for what it is. There are several needlessly confusing rules that mess everything up if you get them wrong. There is a lot of downtime. And at least with 5 players, it's too difficult to win.

A final note - who let this get produced with so many stereotypes put into it? The mechanism of "donuts" is silly enough. But then we immediately noticed that all the gang members are brown-skinned. ALL OF THEM. And of course you keep putting them in the "bad hoods." Seriously?!? I can be thick-skinned, but I found this game to be borderline offensive.

You're constantly shifting focus from arresting punks to handling emergencies to investigating; thus, this game is better than Atlantis Rising and Flash Point, both of which quickly become repetitive.

RATING: 6
This is a neat cooperative game (with an optional corrupt cop betrayer) that simulates being a police officer.  Since there aren't many games to choose from in this theme, this game is one of the better choices.  Players must solve an open murder by examining evidence, interviewing witnesses, and apprehending the suspect, all the while handling calls for services and dealing with the local thugs.  The graphics and artwork style are quite lacking to me, but the game play captures the hectic, non-stop nature of crime fighting.  This isn't the best cooperative game out there, but the theme of playing as a police officer is fairly unique and comes through well.

So this one is quick. I think even with rules explanation this was only about 45 minutes and we stomped to victory very easily. We have already as a group discussed some house rules to up the difficulty and in 6 players we will be taking a leaf out of battlestars book and adding 7 loyalties so you may have two dirty cops, you may not.

We also need to give the decks a damn good shuffling as we were lucky to get a lot of the pink topped events which do not sit on the board and thus do not hinder the investigation. 
Whilst the game we actually played was not very good I can see potential here and I am looking forward to more games in the near future.

Only played a half-game solo to get the feel of it, and I can tell already that it's going to be enjoyed quite a bit. The components are top-notch. Card stock is very nice, chits are sturdy, and the game board...lovely. Just a few comments for those new to the game. When you open the box, be careful how you take out the board and set it up, and close it up after plays. It's gigantic and if not carefully, I can see it tearing. Also, the card sizes are odd. If you want to sleeve, get the Mayday pack specifically for Police Precinct, and the smaller cards, sleeves have to be at least 46mm x 71mm. The mini euro sleeves will not fit.

Can't wait to really start playing this! There is so much to explore.

Fun police co-op game that starts out too easy but gets hectic fairly quickly, especially with Dirty Cop in the mix. It's essentially nothing much more than "draw cards, hope for the best" kind of game, but the various emergencies and punks and whatnot make the gameplay very thematic. I like how the town degenerates into a hotbed of criminal activities in the space of about 3 turns :-P

The theme is great, but the mechanic of going to a location, and drawing a card gets old after repeated plays. It feels as if the game needs something else where that is concerned. The art on the 1st edition (mine) is bland- the 2nd edition is nicer, with business rooftops standing out more so. All in all, I'd rather just play Pandemic or Ghost Stories to satisfy this itch.

RATING: 7
this is the kind of original games I sometimes look for. Some years ago, before this one came out, I always wandered if they whould ever make a police simulation game and here we are. in Police precinct, players use investigators and cops characters in a coop game trying to solve a murder case in the background while keeping the city safe from the everiday emergencies and crimes. there is an investigation sistem that permits a card draw on the murder principal places(randomly placed at the start) that allowes players to look for evidences the greater their investigative skill is. A good game playable even in solo that goes from 1 to 6 players

RATING: N/A
Fantastic co-operative game! I really like how there's mild to severe panic the entire game as the players scramble to allocate resources and manage crises in order to keep crime under control while investigating the murder. Great game, lots of fun. The Mad Men promo cards can make the game [i]really[/i] difficult.

RATING: 5.5
On first play, I was definitely not impressed. Gameplay seemed a bit blah, and the actions you had to keep track of from different card effects felt very fiddly.

The graphic design is pretty weak, unfortunately. The cards and board just don't look professionally done. It was enough to make my graphic designer wife almost refuse to play the game.

And don't get me started on the typos. The rulebook is forgivable, since I can figure it out anyway, but "Autoposy"? Sigh...

I'll give it another try, but for now this is looking like it will be a trade or sell.

It won't ever replace Pandemic in my routine, but it's not a bad change of pace, even as I tweak the variables to find the happy ground between winning and losing. The primary mechanic of determining the number of dice to roll or cards to draw is excellent.
Other players have already noted the negatives I'd mention: The rules are a mess (three editors credited, and none can figure out singular/plural, or the spelling of "vice"?), and the unwieldy board could be a third smaller without losing anything.

This game is NOT fun. You're chugging away, doing your murder investigation, when suddenly this ONE card comes up on the event deck which basically says "game over", despite how much time you have left. It doesn't matter how close or how far you were from winning. Sweet game, guys.

You will either win this game in first several turns or not win it at all.  As such, my biggest problem with the game is that there isn't a flow to the game where it becomes progressively more difficult each turn; rather it just turns into a win or lose situation.  If the murderer appears on the board, although you can still technically win, good luck doing so.  The theme is great though.

Really enjoy this game--very strong thematic elements all throughout, and very strategic play similar to Pandemic (almost).  Long game--be prepared for 2 hours.  It does seem a little easy to win, at least after the first two plays.  Next play should probably be a 5 player game with a possible bad cop, to balance out the difficulty a little.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Of the negative comments I have read here, I agree there are typos, the tokens/counters are a little small, and the rulebook could have been better organized, but apart from that, this is a pretty decent game.

Played 3 games in a row, 4-player configuration without the dirty cop.  We lost the first two, and one the last one, on the very last turn and player action of the game!

The theme is well integrated, there is some randomness which can be mitigated by player cooperation.

Downtime is limited, as you can always interact/assist with the active player.

Game is fairly simple to learn, and pretty well balanced right out of the box.

The sweetspot appears to be a 4-player configuration, since adding more player reduces the over # of turns, and increases the time between turns.

Components are of good to medium quality, except for the crime track and evidence boards, which are too thin (and start warping as soon as you open the box).

With the variable setup, the game is different enough to make it an interesting puzzle to solve.

A co-op with an unusual theme. Like other co-ops, the trick is that the game gives you one goal but a lot of other distractions so that you don't complete it efficiently. In this case, there's a system in which you don't want to get multiple cards of the same color. It doesn't really stand out that much among all the other co-ops out there, but I did like how each of the characters had two characteristics, some of which were repeated.  (1 play)

Get in your squad car, respond to domestic violence, gangs showing up on every other block and car accidents as you try to scramble and find the clues that will let you catch the murderer.

You really get a lot for your money with this game. Haven't played any games that really get the feeling of the theme like this one does.

Love playing and hope to play many more times and maybe make up some scenarios.

You have a limited number of turns to collect all the evidence and take down the murderer, all while keeping gang violence down to a minimum. The concept is solid and the challenge adjustable but, really, when players coordinate right in this cooperative game, their special abilities turn out to be the way to win every single time. Not as intense as Flash Point or Pandemic, but it may improve with future expansions.

PLUS: ease of learning, theme, cooperation required
MINUS: luck/challenge needs to be adjusted from game to game

Definitely one of the more intriguing co-ops of the year. Players have to balance between solving a murder, arresting thugs and responding to emergencies -- in a very thematic setting. If you were a fan of the Police Quest games, this is probably as close as its going to get.

The components and artwork were brilliant. The only niggle I had was that once we left the police station, we never made our way back. There are just too many emergencies every turn to be able to do it. It would have been nice to have a breather once in a while.

Not a huge fan of co-op games but saw it through in a two player game. Some interesting themes but the over all concept of the game was a little boring with no major events that were worth getting excited over.

May be better with 4+ players with a bad cop in the mix.

I was one of the lucky ones to pick up my Kickstarter copy at Atlanta Game Fest.  I played the game and it was a blast: it seemed easy at first, but we ended up barely winning with 4 players, and no dirty cop.

I'm surprised it's rated as high as it is. Maybe I set my expectations too high because of the theme. Played with co-op with one potential traitor. I love hidden traitor games but this one had me snoozing. Everything seemed very random (keep drawing cards until you find the evidence/ shuffle the deck when you don't find anything.) Randomly add bad guys, roll to kill bad guys. Fail the roll too bad. Was this playtested? Play Dead of Winter, Battlestar, or Shadows over Camelot over this nonsense.

1) I am an actual Police Officer
2) This game is Police Themed to the max!
3) The board is AMAZING! Have you seen how BIG it is???

I receive this game as a gift and it was on my list of MUST haves. After reading the rule book which was written nicely and watching a run through video I took to the streets of Commonville to try and track down a murderer. I played a 2 player game with my shift partner which took about 2 hours. We lost when our crime tracker hit 0 and we were only 1 piece of evidence away from going after the bad guy. 

What did we think? We would DEFFINETLY be playing this game again. The emergencys are very realistic, the unknown circumstances put you on edge, the Urgent marker makes your stress go through the roof and on top of that the gangs have started forming. ( can't we all just get along? ) this game is very well done and I like hat there are lots of different characters to pic from even if the art for them isn't to my taste. 

I would rate this game a solid 7/10 after one game play but I'm giving it a 10/10 because I know after getting the rules down pat this game has LOTS of potential. As far as I know this is the best Police themed game out on the market and I am really interested in the expansions that are available to add on. 

If you have a cop friend/relative I highly suggest you purchase this game for them!
Until then, stay safe out there brothers/sisters!ans watch each other's 6.

You really feel like a team of police officer while playing this game. It is not an easy game and every time I play with new players we always lose the first one and let the crime rate go sky high!

The big down side of this game is the production quality. The fonts are hard to read and it's hard to see where things go where when you need to find it. 
There are several typos too and tokens being single sided is extremely annoying.

But still a great game!

RATING: 5
As a co-op this felt like a bloated version of Pandemic, both in having a lot of little rules and having double the lengrh. In the end I don't think the bloat was worth it, most prominently because how to resolve everything was just to go there and roll x or higher with extra rolls by playing some icon, which prevented the bloat from conveying the theme it was supposed to. I know FFG's cthulhu themed games have a similar mechanism, but somehow the die resolution just felt more immersive there, possibly due to the art and flavor text accompaniment. Another nice thing about Pandemic and Flashpoint is it makes you spend a lot of your actions on dealing on the high tension stuff (preventing epidemics, and flash points rescuing people and putting out fires are both high tension). Here, a lot of your actions are the boring search action and not the zooming around dealing with enemies, and it's not even like dead of winter where you get cool stuff while doing so. The other thematic however were pretty cool, as in the undercover vs marked car, and the unknown tokens both being mechanisms that were simple yet made a lot of thematic sense. Nonetheless, they weren't enough to add enough theme to justify the large increase in length, and I miss the elegance of the both themativ and mechanically soud infection deck stacking for spawning he infections of Pandemic.

Police Precinct, in many ways, reminds me of Arkham Horror. Random events or challenges pop up to be dealt with, some with a built in timer imposing negative consequences unless addressed. In fact, the game makes you plan well, coordinate well, and be proactive at all times.

Tension is high throughout, players are always engaged, and certainly the theme rises above what seems like a boring old cop game. 

I own the 2nd edition, whose production values are second to none. If you're a coop lover, definitely look into this game.

Police Precinct is a simple cooperative game in the world of police officers. It is easy to learn and to play very much like other standard cooperative games (such as Pandemic, Flash Point: Fire Rescue). One if its strengths is its ease of customization to increase or decrease difficulty. There is also a hidden role (good cop / dirty cop) variant which may please some fans. The game also has multiple small expansions to increase difficulty. However it remains rather simple and brings nothing new to the genre when compared to similar games already published. I would only recommend it as an alternative to games like Flash Point,

RATING: 6
-Base game playing full-coop (no traitor) seems straightforward & fast gameplay. Have played two games so far and both seemed a little lacking in complexity & edge of your seat excitement and both games were easily won before the murdered emerged - I should try it on the Underbelly map which is harder.  I can see this being a great game to play co-op with kids, maybe 8+ if you are okay with the theme, as it is not too gritty. 
-Well written rulebook designed not only for learning the game but for ease of reference.
-For me Pandemic's base game was only so-so and it was really the expansions such as on the Brink and in the lab that really made that game exciting. I feel the same here- the base game theme is great but the game gets old fast and it needs something to give it an edge and changes things up more.  Having looked at the promos etc I'm not sure that they will do it. With such a great theme this needs an expansion that gives it a real kick. I will play this many more times to see, but it already feels a little stale after 2 games.
-Having checked out the additional content/promos/mini-expansions it doesn't seem that they expand on the base game and only seem to be adding more of the same.

Have only played this twice with 2 players in co-op mode - Both times we won before the murderer entered the city.
This game really oozes the cop theme - Hopefully the expansion will fix the easyness in 2 player mode - Looking foward to player in a bigger group using the dirty cop mechanic - will score it 7.5 for now but may re-score after player traitor version


3rd play (2 player) started turn counter on 3 and no dognuts for murder board cards still wom before murderer entered play

This might beat out Freedom: The Underground Railroad for the most thematic cooperative game I've played. Police Precinct is OOZING with theme! You feel like a cop, which makes the gameplay tense and meaningful. I can't really think of any flaws right now, and for that matter, any reason why this shouldn't be a 10. I would speculate that "alpha-gamer syndrome" would not be as big of a problem in the game, because there is so much going on, and no clear "best" way to handle it. I don't see the game as a puzzle like Pandemic; rather, it's more like you are starring in a cop movie. Maybe the worst thing about this game is setup/takedown time? I'm not sure, and that's fairly petty to fault it for that. I have to mention that the production is phenomenal. I think you could swat (and kill) a bat with the rulebook. It's not an easy game, which is a plus. Several coop games have failed to make the cut in our household because they don't provide enough tension. Everything just works so well, and it doesn't get stagnant at all, so I'm sort of wondering what's up with all of the expansions. More plays will ascertain the need, if there is one, I'm sure. Nevertheless, a MUST HAVE coop!

This game is a lot of fun and is really strong on theme. I have found the game to be very challenging so far. The board does have some issues but just because it has east and west mixed doesn't mean you have to. The cards that make use of directions are easily sorted out. I only hope that more "Big Cases" come out via expansions to keep it fresh.

Would've preferred if it were like Ghost Stories, X cards in deck, remove Y and play with Z. After a few plays, you start to realize, hey event "A" hasn't happened yet, maybe we should prepare for it... Would've loved wooden meeples for the Street punks instead of cardboard.

Quality of cards and cardboard tokens are very high quality, over all glad I purchased, hope to see an expansion in the future.

A fun game experience.  Not completely fair, but that's going to be true of any dice-heavy game.  This doesn't really detract from the gameplay experience though.

It fares well against its closest competitor, which is probably Shadows Over Camelot.  The Dirty Cop (traitor) role feels a bit more involved than in Shadows, and with a more interesting decision tree.

Some downsides include a rulebook that has a few mistakes, and some card texts which could be written more clearly.  Also, the artwork on some of the components and in the rules is so tiny as to be useless, even with young eyes attempting to see/read them.

That being said, if you enjoy co-ops, it's hard not to recommend Police Precinct.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A medium-weight cooperative or hidden-role game where you play as police officers cracking down on crime in a city and solving a murder mystery at the same time before the city falls into a state of anarchy or the serial killer escapes!

Decently challenging when played strictly cooperatively but a little on the predictable side due to how the characters you can pick have obvious specialties in terms of what actions they will get a bonus with. I'm looking forward to playing this game again with more players and see how it is with the "Dirty Cop" hidden-role variant!

You don't see too many police based games, as opposed to detective type games. Here you roam the streets trying to find the evidence cards you need to solve the murder while being distracted by all sorts of emergencies which escalate the game clock if they're not dealt with in time, a la Pandemic. Fixing stuff is a generic dice roll, get enough hits, where other players can contribute cards to give you more dice to roll. Finding evidence is drawing cards from one of the 4 evidence piles - again draw more cards if other players play cards to increase the number of cards you draw. If you don't find them all, you re-shuffle the deck Thebes style, so basically you want to go all in and look at as much of the deck as possible so you only need to do it once. The ease with which you can all pile in made it a bit of a no-brainer on how to play, with other players defaulting to handling whatever emergency was closest and easiest to handle. Which meant there didn't seem to be a lot of tension or discussion on what was the best way to go as a team. There's a Shadows Over Camelot traitor to make life trickier, but he can have a fairly lame game if he's outed early (same as SoC really). Though the co-op decision-making process felt lacking, the game captures the feel of a police theme quite well, with competing priorities, emergencies to deal with, a crime to solve, advantages to going plainclothes vs uniform and so on. A shame about some of the embarrassing component glitches. In the end, it's a playable co-op but not top shelf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
"I want to like it more than I do. It's a solid co-op, but the tedium of digging through evidence decks repeatedly just isn't fun for me. It absolutely works as a pure co-op, but I suspect it would be more fun with a traitor, for those folks unlike me who enjoy traitor games."

What I like:
- Events and street punks are quite thematic
- Strategic goal (murder) hampered by tactical issues
- Straightforward (not a lot of abilities; modifiers, etc)
- Lots of opportunities for actual cooperation
- If you like traitors (I don't), this one looks very well implemented

What I don't like:
- Rule book could be better organized and formatted
- Investigations can feel tedious and overwhelming
- Minor nitpicks: Board is bigger than necessary; tokens should be double-sided; East/west reversal.

I really like that the game tells a story, and the map is used to great effect. It definitely doesn't feel very much like Flash Point, or any other co-op I have played. It's a really solid game, and yet for some reason I don't feel compelled to rush out and buy it. I probably will get it at some point, because my wife and I love co-ops, and she prefers ones with theme and story arc.

I don't like traitor games, and haven't played this with a dirty copy, but it seems like this one provides TONS of ways for a traitor to secretly mess things up. I have to wonder if the game is even winnable with a traitor.

Our 4p learning game took 105 minutes, and I could easily see that going to 90 now that we know the game. I would put the weight around 2.6, mostly due to the sheer number of bits and decks.

I like this game quite a bit, but the typos are a bit annoying, and the fact that they didn't know their west from their east is REALLY annoying.

If you can overlook that, though, the gameplay is great!  You're really struggling to keep the city's crime in-check, while investigating the murder.  Quite a thrilling game.

I thought this game was fairly average and formulaic for a cooperative game.  Players are given roles that help determine what they'll do, but the roles aren't very differentiating.  Some players end up taking care of urgent issues, like thugs and emergencies, while others chip away at the game's win condition: solving the murder case.  Players do occasionally do things in each others' specialties as location dictates.  I didn't find the game to be particularly compelling, though I'm not a coop fan.  I can't imagine what the "dirty cop" variant adds.

This is for the 2nd edition and all it's corrections.

This game can either be fully co-op, or have 1-2 traitors. My preference is to play with a random number of traitors. Players take on the role of officers who are trying to solve a murder before the timer runs out. Solving the murder requires drawing cards out of different piles around the board. Each player's character is bent towards one of several action options, which adds a nice asymmetry.  

At the end of each player's turn a new disaster spawns, and disasters left untended push the endgame marker forward. Resolving the disasters does require some die luck, but it's mitigatable, so I don't find it that troublesome. The game is thematic and fun, and really intense if you can't discern who the traitors are in time.

A cooperative game with 2 tracks. Complete the victory track by filter decks of cards to grab the one that furthers solving the case. While at the same time trying to fend off emergencies leading to anarchy in the city - which after a set number of failures, causes a loss.  
The players have roles, but there doesn't seem do have much differentiation, so the players seem to do a little bit of everything. 
Not bad but not tha compelling either.

I enjoyed immensely the theme of this game.  

Things I don't like:  The game has some obvious cosmetic glitches.  Hard to believe some got through all the play testing but they did.  Come on, you can't put the correct compass on the finished board?  Plus the rule book pictures are very tiny and hard to see to figure out at first what the tokens are.  I would have like to see some more examples of game play while learning. There doesn't seem to be that much strategy, more luck driven.  And lastly, some rules were not very clear on what to do.  

Things I do like:  The theme, it oozes theme.  The theme is well represented in the game too.  I love that it is co-operative, solitaire, adjustable in difficulty levels (excellent game component), has a bad guy element that works nicely.  In fact, this game works very nicely.  The board is huge and the artwork is top notch.  The game looks great with lots of little pieces which I like.

Game play is rather simple once you figure it all out.  It is easy to explain to others and plays within the time limits on the box.  The game reminds me of the game "Clue" but in Clue you have what seems more actual crime investigation.  This game has the same elements of clue, but the execution of the method is more tame and luck driven.  It plays nicely as a beer and prezel type game for our group.  Not too deep but thematically enjoyable.

07-10-2014. Rated after 1 play. Police Precinct is a relatively simple coop with a lot of police theme. But you have to add, everyone who would live in the city that the game plays in deserves the crime they get.

The mechanisms are quite straight forward. But are a little simple. You continuously play cards with icons. We have seen it before. It's good, but not novel or exciting. The theme is what makes this game interesting.

I do not like the artwork in the game and the execution of the game is not what it could be. A newer edition, upgraded artwork/miniatures would help alleviate my concerns here.

This game is quite good - very similar in feel to Flash Point, but more text-heavy with the different events and card effects, and of course the bad cop traitor mechanic. The only reason I do not rate this higher is that I'm not a fan of traitor mechanics (apart from Betrayal at House on the Hill and The Resistance), but for those looking for something in between The Resistance and BSG in weight, I would highly recommend this one.

Great co-op with trader game.  I enjoy Shadows over Camelot and thought Battle Star Galatica was an OK game.  This game is much like those games where the game is a lot about hand management and how to play the cards in your hand, the board for the game is more of a marker to show what the playing is doing.

This game is simply fun.  Pretty random with the cards and random events taking place, but with co-op play the randomness can be minimized.

Errors to the board dropped this from a 9 to an 8.

Fun and love the theme (esp the "donut run" for the cops), but it is a bit repetitive after a bit.  I would've kept itk, but my son doesn't love co-ops, and the theme wasn't a winner for him, so i lost my playing partner.

A fairly heavy cooperative slugfest.  Players attempt to solve a murder by drawing clue cards from a variety of piles while desperately trying to keep the city from going up in flames.  This game is pretty tough and features a lot of tactical thinking and difficult decisions.

OK, so I bought the 2nd edition and do not like the 2nd edition Event cards. 
So this edition will have the 2nd edition Event cards. Opened, but never used. 
It also comes with the newer (glossy) rulebook. (And the original)

Just another co-op game, with the fairly standard do an action, advance the game, try to beat the game before it beats you. The police theme here is decent, although not one that I got really excited about. Maybe I'm more of a pyromaniac which is why I really like Flash Point, as I'd fight some fires rather than arrest some street thugs, any day. I would like to try with the dirty cop to see if it adds enough intrigue to up the rating.

RATING: 7
An excellent co-operative police game, in the vein of Pandemic and similar ones.  Very nicely produced components, apart from the fact that there are errors, misprints and omissions from the rules (big time), cards and other pieces to a very poor degree.  You need to play with your wits about you (regarding the rules and errors, as well as the normal game challenges) and using various FAQ, corrected pieces, play aids, BGG Rules Forum Q+A etc.  Takes the fun out of playing.

A great game lies within, but the quality control was just insulting to Kickstarter subscribers and subsequent purchasers.  The designers/publishers are admittedly very active on BGG with clarifications and corrections, which is admirable but not the right solution.  My rating score will increase if/when existing owners are offered the corrected rules and components (in physical form not just as downloads) for free or a small sum.  Great ideas, but poor execution.

RATING: 7
This is a good cooperative game where players play police officers in the most crime infested 4 blocks in the world.  They have to work together to manage crime as it breaks out, all the while also investigating a murder to capture and arrest the killer.

When I first heard about and saw some reviews of this game I dismissed it as another Pandemic clone with a different theme.  After playing it, it feels very different and I actually quite enjoy it.  Players take turns moving across a board to locations with crime or investigation decks and either make arrests, assist with emergencies like traffic accidents or bank robberies, or investigate the murder which is our win condition.  Most of this is done with dice rolls which adds some randomness and chance of complete failure to the formula.  I don't mind this but many others may be discouraged by the fact that a few bad rolls in a row can spell the end of the game.

What I like most about this game is the variety of different things you get to do.  Each turn a different event happens and while these are typically bad they produce a wide array of challenges to encounter and handle which gives this game good variety.  Managing the most important tasks while all the while investigating the murder provides a wealth of strategic options to the players and makes the game tense and exciting with some very interesting and often difficult decisions.

I'm kind of sad I completely passed up on the reprint Kickstarter back when I thought this was "Police Pandemic" now that I know how good the game is.

Easily the least interesting co-op I've played in a long time.  There was very little pressure on the cops, and the dirty cop did not seem to have a lot to do.  It felt like it needed a lot of tweaking from a difficulty perspective, but even then the choices don't seem nearly as interesting as any of the really good co-op's out there.  Also seems to take to long for what it is.

RATING: 5
Pretty basic co-op in the Pandemic genre. Move around a board attempting to deal with immediate threats while working toward the long term goal. Most actions are resolved randomly, so control is limited. You can play cards to help other players, so there's a bit more feeling of having everyone in on each action than in some co-ops. You can also get bonuses from having multiple players in one location, but that's generally hard to set-up constructively without special cards. Difficulty scaling is poor; game is very easy with two cops, somewhat challenging with 4. Components are ugly as heck and could have been a lot better designed. If you don't have many co-ops and like the theme, this is probably a fine one to start with. If you only want one or two in your collection and already own a Pandemic variant, skip it.
Includes a traitor variant. I haven't played this; it really doesn't look very good.

A cooperative game of deduction that involves a good amount of dice rolling, similar in some ways to Firefly.  Players work together to handle random emergencies, but have an ultimate goal of solving a murder within a predetermined amount of rounds. A highly detailed rulebook may seem a bit overwhelming at first, but the game plays rather smooth after a round or two and actually feels kind of easy.  The theme is very strong and the pieces, although mostly tiles, are very nice.  The game has really good rules for solo play.

The game is okay. When I play, it's fun to draw the different events & see what kind of craziness can happen next. However, whenever I resolve an event or receive something I need for the murder crime, It doesn't excite me. 

I don't feel as if I'm making progress, especially in regards to the event cards. I think to myself, "Well, I finished this event but another will probably come at the end of my turn & replace that one!"

To be fair, I have only played the solo version of this game, which includes myself & One extra character I also get to play. Perhaps with more players the game will be more fun & appealing to me, but as of right now, it's just okay.

The manual was amateurish and needed errata. Police Precinct took me an hour to setup even with the errata. The nine panel game board is needlessly huge. Consider, by contrast, that Pandemic managed to fit the entire world on a four panel board! The dark colored tiles get lost when placed on the darkly colored board. The compass rose is misprinted. I wanted to like this game. But it was so disappointing.

My Dad was a Sheriff.  I remember going on ride-alongs with him as a kid.  I was immediately drawn into this game.  The theme is thick.

The game offers a lot of decisions.  Do you take down the street gangs, clear a traffic accident, investigate a murder and more.  You only have a limited time to get it done.  A great co-op game with a cop theme.  My rating will probably go up.

It's fun, and it's thematic.  I don't think it's perfectly balanced, or at least it feels a little undeveloped.  There are lots of levers to pull to make it harder or easier, shorter or longer.  Figuring out which levers to use takes a few plays.  I would have preferred it to be a little tighter in that regard. Other than that, the mechanisms are cool, and thematically grounded.  I like the artwork and oversized board, it's different, and that's a good thing.

Honestly this is a great game. The challenge is completely adjustable and boy sometimes the heat is on. Gangs are cropping up, emergencies piling on...
Yet it doesn't hit the table as much as I'd like. I think my group isn't into the theme like I am. I wish I played with the dirty cop (traitor) but I've been unable to try so far :(

'Police Precinct' was played as a co--operative game, without the bad cops, and was new to everyone who played so we did forget our abilities. I think we failed in solving the case because we didn't start on the case early enough, sidetracked by the 'gangers', abilities not being used (both collective failures) and not co-operating with investigations and police cards, but it is still agreat game, nonetheless.

This is a fairly challenging co-op that does a great job of recreating the atmosphere of a network cop drama. Players try and solve a homicide by collecting evidence and witness statements, all while responding to smaller everyday crimes and gang problems that pull time and resources away from the investigation.

It does this all very well and based solely on that, I'd give this a very high recommendation. However, the game does have one weakness. There is only one murder to solve. Every time you play, you will be finding the same evidence and solving the same murder. That's an abstraction and sort of just a timer for getting things done, but it is compounded by the event deck which represents all the minor crimes happening around town. You will see nearly the entire deck every time you play. This makes the game feel samey after a few plays, even as it remains challenging to beat. That may be a silly complaint in a world where most folks only play their games three or four times anyway, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it.

Watch this gather steam this since the Kickstart. Even watched Tom V's review of the game where he went gaga over it (probably because the named one of the streets after him). Still, its all very thematic with excellent tough choices on which crimes to address and how to team up in addressing them, all while worrying about solving the main murder issue. I don't think it will solve any of the alpha leader issues in co-ops but I'm not so sure that the team choices will seem overly obvious, which makes individual choices more justified. Also interesting is the "dirty cop" aspect making it tougher to win with one in the bunch.

We have played this with 2 and 3 players and each time was  quite disappointing. This game looks like it should be fun and engaging but the mechanics are awkward and our games lacked passion. Before we deep six our copy we will try it one more time; at this stage I am of the opinion that they put as much care and attention into game design as they did into its production (East and West confused- even on the event cards?).

Update... we traded this away. In our opinion it was unredeemable.

Juego al que llevaba siguiendo mucho tiempo y que nunca me decidi a comprar de importación por la barrera del idioma y las complicaciones de aduanas al pedir a EEUU. al fin una tienda española se decidio a traer una importación y ni lo dude. Me encanta la temática de un grupo de policías que mientras realizan su trabajo cotidiano, pandilleros, robos, trafico...... tienen  que tratar de resolver un asesinato. Como cooperativo me gusta mucho. aun no le he probado con la variante de policía corrupto :(

This game is almost even an 8, depending on how well it holds up to repeat plays.

When this was coming out of the box I was completely unimpressed. While playing it, I really got into the theme, controlling the flow of the rounds, and buying the ingredients. I may pick up a copy of this, if it continues to be enjoyable.

I bought this on the strength of the Dice Tower's Miami Dice review, seeking my first economic game.

Instead, I got a game that's probably better titled, "My First Economic Game". It's just horribly straight forward. There's no real interesting decisions. Buy the lowest set of numbers that can sell at the highest set of numbers. That's not really a decision, it's just straight math and there's no bluffing or negotiating or anything about it. Whatever the best set of numbers are on the field, that's what you should do.

There's no predicting what will appear in the market at what price, so you can't plan for anything. So again, there's no real decision making you can do in that respect.

Theoretically, you can steal recipes from others, and maybe halt a runaway leader. But the leader can ramp up so quickly that there's probably not time to do that, and it will probably be at the cost of whatever you were trying to do on your board. I don't think it works very well, for this game length. But with a longer game length, the lack of decisions would make it far too bland to keep playing.

For the same amount of play time and roughly the same play length, I'd really have to suggest Isle of Trains if you want a small, fastish economic game. Otherwise, of all the games I know so far, I'd say you're better to buy something bigger.

I really like this.  Our first game was quick, because most of us weren't trying to maximize the profit margin.  But, it was still fun.  I think I'd like to try it again...but, slower paced and attempting to squeeze out every dollar I can.  10 bucks well spent!

Decent Cheap Ass Games game.  

I like the idea of the variable market prices, but things like being able to steal someone's recipe simply based on a die roll is such an unnecessary mechanic.

clearly by my score I like this one, I am not sure if it will go down over time, but I like whats here. It is not terribly deep but it is not trying to be. this one will lay equally well as a pace changer palate cleanser OR as a main attraction to newer gamers who you are trying to get deeper into the hobby. Get yourself some specific dice for it so there is no waiting and get ready to have fun. lighthearted in its confrontation it allows for the sock it to me to be mitigated somewhat, but when you win by making someones recipes better than they do, it is awesome!

This is a deceptively simple recipe filling economic game that is surprisingly tight for how very quickly it plays and how well it scales.  I've played a lot 2 player, but it's great with more too.  Highly recommended.

Hmmm.   I don't know.   This game is fiddly to the max:  tons of rolling dice and putting them onto charts, stocking and restocking tiny bits, making tons of change constantly.   It aims to be a Euro-style cooking game and sort of succeeds.   The combination of Japanese dishes and an anime art style does work well - that was my favorite part of the game.   I'm just not sure that the fun and strategic options are worth the effort.

// We tracked money on paper a few times, and also played with chips //
This is a game that warrants good components (because it's a good game); we added wooden ingredient tokens and colored dice.

My friend made this as a PnP and we really enjoyed the game.  There is a little bit of randomness in the number and type of fish and ingredients available throughout the game.  But there is a lot of strategy in what you buy and what recipes you play. I had to have my own copy and I didn't want to cut out all the ingredient tokens, so i bought a copy.

Three of the 5 folks I played with dismissed it as too light, but the 4th liked it. I found the theme charming and the gameplay quite interesting for the short timeframe. I feel like 5 may be too many (the farmer's market got empties out very quickly), but obviously I need to play more to be sure.

A solid little game, gameplay-wise - plus it is free for the DIY crowd and cheap for everyone else.

It's a basic math game, meaning solid fast arithmetic is vital, but also a bit of a Euro game in the phases and initiative.

I first played a friend's print and play version with my wife and we instantly loved it. 

Then I made her a copy of the print and play version for her birthday. We've played five or six times since I gave it to her and are finding more and more strategies and depth to the game. I've also played it with my seven year old son, who loves it, and my play in public lunch time gaming group at work, who also enjoy it.

It is definitely on the top of my favorite quick to play games right now. We really enjoy playing it.

I'll probably pick up a deluxe version once it comes out on the market, but I hope they go all out and include money in the form of cards (like those in Las Vegas) and include nice little "lucky cat" pawns for the day markers, a little chibi fish cook mini (like the one in the rules) as the first player marker, dice, and nice ingredient counters. If it is just the market boards and recipe cards, I'll be a bit disappointed.

Parts I had to provide aside this is a great game.  I wish it had a nice solid game board, but other than that no complaints.  It kind of reminds me of Scoville one of my most favorite games ever (even though I am a wimp on the spicy foods front).  Check out the Dice Tower review... they were right on on this one.  :)

A charming and simple economical game with a cute sushi chef theme. It perhaps is missing a mechanism or two that keeps it from greatness, but it does a lot of things (e.g. player controlled round length, variable pricing) cleverly. There's a bit too much fiddly money changing here, and the strategy seems limited compared to some euros, but this was a pleasant play.

This game was a surprise for me.  As a Cheapass game, the production values were small.  I liked the market implementation--it was simple however did supply/demand well.  I liked some of the competition of the fish and stealing some recipies.

Game was fun to play, however nothing too notable for me to be a regular request to play.

Fish Cook is a seriously underrated little economic game, but it's marred by an ill-fitting rule involving rolling dice to steal items from your opponents. Still, I really like Fish Cook in spite of its minor flaws.

 A fun, fast, and well designed little economic game. The theme is awesome, the gameplay is tense, there's great player interaction and it plays fast. It was a little bit of a pain in the arse to gather the extra compnents needed to play the thing, but it's all good.

I won this as a second place grab bag prize for playing the second-most amount of games at the LexiCon Gaming Convention earlier in May 2014. 

My wife loves to play this game.  This is her most requested game to play in the final quarter of 2014. This is an economic game at its core and has fun cooking Japanese cuisine as its theme. I hope to upgrade my components with some colorful mini poker chips in the near future.  This is by the far the best Cheapass Game I have played from Mr. Ernest.

Quite a fun little game! Even my wife, who has no interest in "business" games, quite enjoyed it, and I may be trying it out on family game night soon. Really the only drawbacks I've seen is that the "restocking" part of the turn can be a bit of a drag (though it's not that bad), and once several recipes are out on the table, it can start causing players' AP to badly kick in. There is also of course a ton of money handling back and forth, but this went quite quickly at least using chips. (Also, the game made us hungry for sushi. Not sure if that would be considered a positive or negative). PnP edition. Yes, including the bell :)
[Update: Played a 6P game on family game night with mostly non-gamers - everyone dug it.]

This is fun, cooking theme game with economic aspect and set collection. The game comes with no coins and dice, the reason why it's cheap. The original reason for the publisher is to make the game cheaper in production cost, hence using dice or money from other games, but most of us just buy these replacements to complete the game.

I never thought I'd say that a Cheapass game was one of my favorites, but this one has really grabbed me. The market mechanism is solid and provides a lot of variety, which is thematically appropriate, since it forces players to adapt to the uncertain "daily catch" of a fish market.

My only complaint is the speed at which the game ends. Most sessions I only have time to make a recipe or two before  it's all over. The end game is somewhat player controlled, so it might just be my group...but if there is a short stocked item you can be sure it will be bought up prematurely to screw everyone else out of cooking.

That's part of the game and admittedly, it is funny when it happens. I guess I just have so much fun playing I want it to go on a little longer. (Easily remedied, by just playing more days...so that's not even an actual issue, really.)

For 15 bucks, this is one of the best purchases I made this year.

One of Cheapass Games' best. Take turns buying ingredients from the market in Phase 1. In Phase 2, use the ingredients to make recipes and score points. Very well designed, one of my favorite economic games. The economy is in the availability of ingredients and balancing that with the available recipes both in your hand and in the "school".

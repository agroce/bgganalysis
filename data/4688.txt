MMP Reprint: A truly unique experience. Playing a wargame on a team is unusual and fun, especially considering the teams are more like bickering brothers than a cohesive unit. The Secret Foreign Aid bidding is a hoot, each and every turn. Combat is somewhat procedure-heavy, but once you play through four or five attacks it speeds up considerably. The secret orders can create great surprises, especially as the game goes on and your order deck increases; at times it becomes hard to remember what you placed where with everything else going on. All of the mechanics work well together to simulate the feeling of being part of a disorganized war. The only downside, I think, is the endgame tends to get a little long and drag a bit. I much prefer the tautness of the first 4-5 turns.

The MMP edition of the game may or may not be better graphically than the original, but still had room for an update. That wasn't done.

The game could have used fewer die rolls, changes to the reinforcement cards and a reduction in length to play and it would be at least as good, if not better, than what we got. The game can be tense, but it is mostly long, at a minimum of four hours to complete.

A beautiful game with an exciting theme. I don't know what to say. Just get it and try for yourself.

You can solo this quite good. Choose one alliance or one faction. You use your cards the normal way. For the other factions you just pick one of their cards per phase at random (turn the top card). After the turn you reshuffle all the non-player factions. In the covert foreign aid phase you bid as usual and roll dice for the other factions. That's it. With a little afford this could be made into a full solitaire game. But i am not good enough a player to do a decent bot like the ones in Labyrinth or the COIN series.

[u]Pros[/u]:
* The command cards and the order game mechanism are nice and works very well.
* Assets such as anti-tank missiles, mines and air groups adds spice to the game.
* Modern warfare is reflected well and in a simple manner.
* Interesting geopolitical situation.

[u]Cons[/u]:
* It would have been nice if historical designated names would be on the counters, such as South African mercenaries, Cubans, airplane and tank types.
* The game is long. We played 5 turns in 7 hours.
* I miss the communist vs. capitalist feeling.
* The counter mix is limited and you may not break units. Even if a sole infantry unit is stuck in the bush bush.
* Unit stacks could be high. Larger counters would have been nice.
* No rules for two or three player games.
* Movement of units is limited. You may not drop units.
* Games can suddenly ends if you have many victories in a turn. I would have prefered a fight-to-the-end game.
* Counters have two sides but the 2nd side is rarely used.

[u]Thoughts[/u]:
* Simplification of the map could have speed up play.
* Modernization and a different approach could have improved the quality of the game. It would have been nice if this was a four player block- or card-driven game.

RATING: 8
+ A 2-on-2 team game where the game play pretty much unfolds around a dynamic victory condition. The teams earn victory point tokens from the other team by conquering towns and cities. If the number of VP tokens reaches the victory condition in the end of round, the team wins, if not the tokens return to the other team and the victory condition is lowered for the team winning the round by one.
+ Chinese congratulatory faxes / Bulgarian culture attache visits :) 
- A bit long play time
- Combat steps are multiple and some steps are easily forgotten 
- Based on one play, it's hard to tell if the game is too scripted (i.e. follows the same path a play after another).

RATING: 9
It's not exactly easy to find a good multi-player wargame. My first good one was Friedrich, then its sibling Maria and then finally I played Andean Abyss, my first game of the fantastic COIN series by GMT Games.

All these games were great in the sense that their creators were able to design an engaging strategic puzzle with factions that have asymmetric forces and objectives. 

But the "oldie" Angola is still the best of them all. Even better than Andean Abyss and possibly all the games in the COIN series.

Angola is simpler in rules and deeply engaging as an strategic challenge for all four factions involved.

The mechanics fits (very well, actually) the theme and the historical developments of the actual conflict, specially with the rules for the support from foreign powers.

The dynamics of column management is brilliant, along with the catch-up mechanism that keeps everyone engaged with real chances to win until the very end.

I also like the fact that you don't have diplomacy in the game, since the factions inside the alliance are aligned in their ultimate objective of winning together.

The only drawback is that Angola is a long game. Our first match lasted for a little more than six hours, which is OK by wargaming standards, but not OK for my (mostly) eurogamers group.

Angola is a game created in the 80's that hasn't aged at all when compared to modern multi-player designs. It is, IMO, THE BEST multi-player wargame that I've ever played and will always have a place in my collection. I'm glad to have participated in the MMP kickstarter campaign for the new edition.

If you are looking for an engrossing wargaming experience to share with 3 other friends, you owe it to yourself to get a copy of Angola.

Pre order from MMP 6/6/09.

Finally arrived 26/6/2012

First time to table on 15/5/16. Rulebook is somewhat verbose and this game cries out for some graphic play aids. Once the sequence of play is understood the game flows smoothly. Each faction has their own strengths and weaknesses. Not overly complex but some nail biting decisions to make each turn as to move order etc. Only drawback is without four players many of what makes it an excellent game would be diminished.

RATING: 9
A full day of playing.  Might try with two, but really designed only to play with four.

Fun how the pressure ratchets up as foreign powers pour in technology and troops.  The initial placement is randomized so that play is different each game.  The nice thing about 4 players is that there are portions where there is blind bidding, and you have little idea how your ally is going to bid.

The MPLA cards have a misprint.  One of the cards is supposed to come in at the start of the game.  Another person commented that the FNLA is the easiest and the MPLA is the hardest.  I'd agree with that.  The MPLA needs towns to recruit troops from.

I think that the game needs some more/better player aids.  We spent too much time referring back to the rulebook.

Plan on a full day.  My first game took 8 hours and we only got to Turn 7.

RATING: 7
Very well balanced, but can run a bit too long and become somewhat monotonous.

With only two games played I'm still unsure about how the semi random start affects the game and how much the MPLA can do.

There are so many fantastic and singular mechanics in this game, and every one adds to the overall theme of a chaotic, close, and unpredictable war.

Intriguing team play game. Preprogrammed actions (from

Quite excellent game. Would be a 9 (and still could be) if it played quicker. How incredible that this game was made 25 years ago! It is so slick, with so many well-developed gears working so smoothly. Things I love:
- how combined arms are simulated: air-to-air, air strikes, anti-aircraft, arty, anti-tank... So much diversity with such sweet flow
- how the foreign forces come on if you lose turns, but how losing too many turns leads to a crisis of confidence
- how strong stacks and good maneuver are equally important
- how the board builds up over time with things going from little skirmishes here and there to a full-on brawl
- how the board is random at the beginning with players all in each other's business
- how the hands grow and the programming can be so flexible and constraining at the same time

Picked up MMP version August 2012. 1 play (Sept 2012)--learning game! Lost as the MPLA/FAPLA team. Learned the MPLA recruiting woes, but did beef up with Eastern Bloc help. I don't know what initial town draw means for fortunes, yet. Rules seem easy, but very procedural. Turn segments went fast. We finished in about 6 hours. The strategic ebb and flow tendency is amazing. Luanda did not fall, even if the cause did. Need to play again!  Session pic: http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1410577/coffeebike?size=original

A real hidden gem of a game. I managed to purchase one of the last few copies of the game form Ragnar brothers in a ziplock bag rather than a box. Have never regretted it and have been a frequenly requested game in our gaming group. The mechanics of aorganising your orders deck creates tension...hoping you get you orders correct and second guessing your opponent's. There is a game balancing feature with the side doing poorly one turn getting better reinforcements the next and potentially bouncing back. Just don't do it too often or you have to roll on the Crisis Table.

Wow, what a great game even though I know nothing about the original Angola civil war!  If it's anything like my first game played out, it was bloody.  I really dig the command card system and the notion of columns to time and conduct your attacks.  The combat system is nice and simple, even with large stacks of combined arms units with foreign-aid supplied weapons conducting combat.  And the supporting region mechanism along with the movement rules and restrictions really creates an atmosphere where you can wage a guerrilla war.  I'm looking forward getting this on the table again soon!

One mostly complete game in, results were positive. It's rare that you get a 2v2 wargame, but here it is. The action planning is an interesting touch, especially for those players with a "dead" card that they have to plop in their queue. The little bits of chrome with the aircraft, AA, mines and AT guns are a nice touch.

I think there's some concern about megastacks dominating the game, but even by the end of our first game we were already realizing ways to beat these via single-unit road blockers, since that megastack can only be activated twice and there are no overruns. Consequently, we started adapting into more medium sized stacks, which make things much more interesting, too.

Probably my main concern for now is the playing time if the game goes the distance, though I imagine most games will end early around turns 7-8 or so. But, perhaps that's something that will improve with repeated play.

2016-09-18 :Low complexity ruleset that is so easily internalized that the gamers can get on with what's important in this game : having a good long-term strategy, executing it at the correct moment hereby getting inside the Boyd cycle of your opponents and then shattering their forces.
It's fascinating to see how the history is recreated, not through complicated rules, but almost organically through easy rules, the map and reinforcements
As you're fully involved all the time - no long player turns - the 6 hours we needed to play the game almost flew by.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An interesting game. The use of the operations deck, combined with the columns rule, gives players plenty to think about in terms of planning their offensives. The rules for combat, while seemingly daunting, run smoothly after the first try or so. The theme shines through reasonably well - the artwork on the counters and cards do evoke a Cold War feel to the game. All in all, the game is relatively simple and plays smoothly, while evoking a decent theme. 

Bad points about the game has to do with 1) the combination of random set-up and set recruitment and 2) the long game time. Having a random set-up but having set recruitment is a strange thing. The set recruitment means that as the game progresses, each faction will have their own area of influence. So why go through the trouble of a random set-up? It doesn't do much except add to the game time as people spends the first few turns sorting out the front lines. Also, for a relatively simple area-control game, 5-7 hours is way too long for a game. I would prefer starting a game at 18 or even 17 points, although a faction that randomly gets a very favourable set-up would be at a strong advantage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A bit too rock-em sock-em - it's not clear to me how much (and how varied) strategy there is here, although it is certainly fun to move big stacks and roll dice.  The win conditions are clever and the recruitment mechanics feel really fresh.  The team play is also nice, because there is no hidden information, so you can easily integrate different skill-level players in one game, since plans can be spoken aloud.

RATING: 7.2
A really solid medium war game.  As far was wargames go, this is a great intro one.  The command pack building mechanic forces you to keep your turns simple and the amount of reactionary tactics keeps you from overthinking your long term strategy.

I've always been a sucker for games regarding low-intensity conflict, but none seemed to come close to the idea until this item fell into my hands in 1990.

I like having to play a bit more "on the fly" than is usual.

First play did not go well and I had a lot of concerns. I gave it another try and this game really is a fantastic partnership war game. I'm amazed it came out when it did, very much ahead of its time. It has several great mechanisms that I wish other war games would adapt. Great arch too, starting with smaller skirmishes and ending in larger higher stakes combat. The action selection prior to the turn is the highlight of the game but other mechanisms are very fun to use such as air/artillery/equipment/major units, etc. Great game, make sure you give it a fair shake.

An absolutely wonderful 4-player 2-team game where lack of coordination, uncertainty of firepower, and confusion during operations really comes out.  Very good representation of the conflict.

Diplomacy is absent, but the amount of player interaction is key, because if discussions are made by a team it is open information and their foes can take advantage of it.  The way that other nations become involved and prop up your collapsing cause is brilliant and it means that after a bad turn you are almost guaranteed to come roaring back.

This game requires time and 4 smart players, but is AP resistant and tons of fun.

OK, I've played it twice now, and I can't say enough about this terrific game.  Mechanics are deceptively simply, but taken together make for a very deep gaming experience.  First time played with three, short one of optimal, but still worked OK.  Crazy thing is nobody had read the rules, and we were able to fumble through it to really enjoy it.  Among the many things: partially randomized setup, creating chaotic and unpredictable start; victory levels slide to meet you, based on your performance each turn; built in balancing factor of supporting powers to losers; inability to plan, since those outside partners give you all manner of equipment.

A game that was well ahead of its time when it was first published; several of the mechanics are more modern than many games published today, yet fuse very well with the old school counter style system that forms the core of the game.

Things that I particularily like: the randomization of starting conditions (makes for replayability and uncertainty), the activation system (creates a fog of war and also simulates a command situation were you do not have absolute control), and the movement system (organized columns and spread-out irregular units both have their uses and disadvantages). 

The subject matter is also intriguing; I'm always interested Cold War era proxy warfare and Angola really does the job in a splendid way. A similar quality game on the Bush War would be awesome.

It made the P500 cut. Probably will have to wait a century before it will be shipped, but it's worth the wait...I hope.
(pre-ordered on 14-Jul-'10)
Received an e-mail...I should be on it's way...

Update: finally it's in (30-Jun-'12). Checked the box box today. Lovely counters. Colorfull rules. Cheap box. Looking foward to playing.

UPDATE: played my first game, and the concepts it promises, it delivers (most of it).
The combat is system, although somewhat different then most is pretty smooth and after the first few combats require relative little rule checking.
Direct and covert aid as very nice touches and provide your faction with really powerfull equipment (You will need it to make a differance). 

Set recruitment is in my opinion the weak part of the game. Unita receives reinforcements in South-west Africa and FNLA does the same in Zaire. these areas are (although far away from most of the action) safe from direct intervention by the FAPLA/MPLA. So Unita/FNLA can build up their forces and then, make 1 move towards the front.
MPLA has almost no set recruitment,basically is doesn't ever control Luanda, so only 1 infantry will go to Cabina, After Cabinda falls it receives no further set recruitment.
FAPLA receives in Luanda, which will be the center of attention most of the games and can not be abandoned ever, so a large part of the recruitment will have to stay put.

The same principle is present for covert foreign aid, which for FAPLA/MPLA arrives at the ports in the west, were it can be attacked on the spot, and makes it more difficult to get assets to the MPLA forces in the east (which works historically, but not so good game wise).

Variable recruitment is a fun and very believable priniple, which works nice in the system.

Has a great 'poker' feel to it as players guess and 2nd guess the intentions of enemies and allies alike.

Probably the best 4-player wargame. It has perfect balance between randomness and control. The rules are very nicely streamlined (and very easy to learn) while still allowing for some nice chrome and variation. Very nice depth, but, amazingly, even with analytical players, there is little or no downtime -- this is not only because of the streamlined rules, but also because the really big decisions are simultaneous (and so easy to reign in those prone to over-analysis). The game rewards smart play and punishes recklessness, but it also avoids one-sided contests while still moving everyone forward to a resolution. The combat has just the right amount of room for lucky swings, but still preserves a very mature and balanced probabilities in the determination of outcomes. Just the right balance between hidden and public information.

It is really hard to imagine something topping this.

Angola waited quite a while to get played but hopefully will come out again sooner.

The mechanisms of the game balance the sides cleverly, and the command deck preplanning makes the game very interesting, even if it goes all the way to the final turn.

Angola isn't like anything else, and it's different in a good way.  Outstanding as a 4-player game, but it seems like it would lose something as a 2-player.  Great counter art and map in the MMP update.

RATING: 9
Terrific design, with highly interactive, swirling gameplay that results in a constantly evolving board position. It has some really neat interplay between the victory points subsystem, the recruitment rules, and the board play.

Bridge-like 2 v 2 partnership play works very well, with the victory conditions and the foreign aid bidding rules rewarding the partners that collaborate most effectively.

While I don't normally like catch-up mechanisms, here they're thematic and very well integrated. That said, at times you would prefer to lose a turn for the benefits that the catch-up mechanism provides - although you can't lose too many turns due to the VP impact and the consequences of letting down your cold war sponsoring superpower too many times. It's a question of balance.

The elephant in the (game) room: it's long. Very long. Play it in under 5 hours and give yourself (and your friends) a cigar. It doesn't drag and wouldn't make me turn down a game, but that length will limit how often it hits the table.

Fun, challenging game with very innovative elements.  Original version required no adjustment, 24 years later - way ahead of its time.  This game is a real testament to the designers, who have succeeded so well in so many genres.

RATING: 8
Very immersive 4 player game, with lots of flavor. The variable set up leads to different situations each game, and the random allocation of shiny toys like armor, aircraft, missiles etc makes for a tense bluffing game.

RATING: 8
Very cool game with a lot of clever bits built into it.  There are programmable turns, hidden information and lots of exciting chrome (missiles, airpower, afvs), while the actual game mechanics are easy to pick up after a turn or so.  The victory conditions deserve a second look for their cleverness - players gradually lower the total their alliance needs to pull off a victory, but a player who falls behind early is likely to collect help from his big brother (Cuba, South Africa or Zaire) to put him back in the hunt.  

The primary disadvantage is that it runs long - I'd estimate eight or so hours for a game that goes the distance.  Also, while not terribly hard to implement, the mechanics are often unintuitive, requiring some experience to be able to run smoothly.  For these reasons, it gets on the table less often then I would like.

In its favor, it can be played quite easily with three or four players and even managed by one or two.

Update: recently played a game where we knocked out a decisive result in 9 turns in 4.5 hours.  If I could play this consistently in under 6 hours, I'd get it on the table a lot more often.

Update 2: Communists may be just a bit too weak in the 4-player game.   We haven't seen their side win in the group I play with, although they have come close a number of times and everyone always enjoyed the game.

RATING: 9
This Ragnar Brothers multiplayer title languished in the shadows for years, but now is in the hands of the IGS team at MMP. The subject is the Angolan civil war, and the system is unlike just about anything you’ve seen before. You assemble your assault columns from a variety of riff raff infantry, armor, professional intervention forces and mercenaries, add in some air support, and go steal a town off your neighbor. Aspects that make it fun include blending of the military and political dimensions, the bidding for reinforcements, and the touch of chaos offered by the command cards. I’m also actually a fan of the *very* rough presentation - third world graphics for a third world game! What they lack in crispness they make up for with sheer colorful exuberance. Lee Brimmicombe-Wood is reworking the components, retaining the funktastic sub-Saharan color scheme while dramatically upgrading the icons and map work. Get Angola into your life, and mine - preorder today!

RATING: 9
Personally, I have to say everything I've ever read about the balance and dynamics of this game proved to be true. In my opinion, it's one of the best multiplayer games I've ever played, if not the best. It's got an intriguing combination of innovative features: hidden move orders, random turn selection, chit pulls, secret bids for assets, zero-sum scoring for VPs each turn, a dash of chaos from card draws, variable reinforcements, a combat system with just the right amount of tension and unpredictability without being too random, top graphics, and on and on. Somehow it all comes together like no other game I can think of. 

The rules are straightforward with chrome aplenty, and the balancing mechanism seems to be really well-designed.

A really clever game crammed with wild and woolly action. I'd play this again in a heartbeat.

Playtested twice alone. I thought this game to be a simple euroboardgame with innovative features. Counter mix seemed very similar for the 4 player. 

But in fact it is a real simulation of the war, with strength and weaknesses very well presented, a general tendency of the communist to grow in strength and professionalism, while the rebels need to rely more on mines, mercenaries and missiles.

So far an excellent feeling. Not much of a challenge though playing alone. It definitively has its flavor in a multi-player game. 

Played with 3 novice players. Explanation was quite easy and game ramps up in terms of complexity, so rules can be explained while advancing in game.
We won with the communist combining as well tactical as propaganda victories for a final victory on game turn 6. 
Second play with 3 new players also an excellent experience for all. We had to stop turn 7 with a score of 15 to 16 for the communist. Very balanced game.
Next game we train again one newbee, but 3 veterans are around the table. End game at turn 7 with Communist reaching 13 token (overall situation was 13-13)

Some innovative mechanics combined with a unique hidden orders system make for amazing experience .  Add on the fact that you are paired with a partner with whom you have limited knowledge of their actions and the final bidding at the end of each turn which provide nerve wracking tension, this game has it all. I wish this system was used as widely as the boring COIN system. Truly an underappreciated gem.

I have the MMP release, never played the original. I've no idea when or if I will be able to get 4 players for this, but just from having read the rules and fooled around solitaire, I *love* this design. Gameplay keeps all the players involved (the game turns involve each player turning over a card in their self built deck, doing actions that the card allows, then moving on to the next person, until the player decks are exhausted), and it seems players will always be wondering how best to use their action. The only downsides I see are that it plays best with four (2 teams of two), and it takes a while to play. For people with a regular group who don't mind wargames, don't hesitate to try it. It's more complicated than a Euro, and it is a legit wargame (rather than an abstract), but extremely straightforward and playable. Love the components, too, quite a nice looking game.

A very good 4 player war-game that is engrossing, plays fast, and there are continual swings of fortune.  The game does run a little long, but the unique setting coupled with a system where every advantage has a counter makes this a fantastic group game.

RATING: 8
Wow, I like this game.  Lots of chaos, but I think it probably accurately reflects the era and locale.  Wildly disparate forces, random initial setup, an intricate battle sequence, interesting victory conditions.  However, looks to play long: I estimate it could be done in 5 hours if the card planning is sped up a bit.  Too bad the other guys not as enamored but really unlike any other wargame I have, a lot more adventure and 'gung ho' because you need to take new territories every turn, or you are not going to win.  I hope I get to try again: the rules not bad, so I can explain it to a new group pretty quickly, I should imagine.  One of the last Ragnar brother games for me to play, albeit the MMP version.

RATING: N/A
Only played a few turns. I can see the appeal even though it's not my usual cup of tea. Fighting flares up all over the country, towns and cities change hands, and the conflict intensifies as foreign aid and more sophisticated weaponry arrives. Led me to read up a little on the history behind the game. Would certainly play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Highly recommended for wargamers.

Angola is quite an entertaining 4 player wargame (best with 4 playing as teams of 2, not really recommended for 3p but possible) with clever and unique mechanics.  This is a design that was far ahead of its time and still distinct several decades later.

Playing time:  one long session or two evening sessions.  Roughly an hour per turn. Game length is 10 turns max, but can (often?) end earlier if an alliance meets the vp requirement.  Sustained success (capturing towns and cities) improves the chance for an earlier vp win.

The reprint from MMP is an excellent upgrade of the original edition with much improved graphics, particularly the map that is less garish, more functional and easier to parse.  The original Ragnarok printing had a DTP like quality and was the edition that I first played back in the early 2000s.

Can be hard to table given the game length (+6 hrs) and the requirement of rounding up 4 interested players.  Feels nicely thematic.  Game play requires successfully managing chaos and seizing opportunities as they develop.  Good stuff.

RATING: 9
This a great game about a certainly unknown war. I've played solo and against a human player and in both modes it's an incredibly intense experience. Rules are well written and components are more than OK (I have the 2012 edition from MMP). I don't give a 10 because of some minor historical issues and a little disagreement with victory conditions. However, I'll recommend this game to anyone interested in war games, a beginner or a grognanrd.

Of interest as spent 18 months working out there right after the end of the Civil War.

Mixed feelings about wargaming this terrible conflict given the number of amputees I saw on the streets of Luanda and the continuing human cost from all the ordinance still littering the country.

For those wanting to learn more about the conflict I recommend "Another Day of Life" by Ryszard Kapuscinski for this flavour and human interest and "Angola: Promises and Lies" by Karl Maier to get a feel for the nature of the fighting.

RATING: 7
This first edition (pre-errata) has some significant issues that prevented the game from being totally playable, but the second (post-errata) game was really well crafted. I would give the pre-errata game a "6", and the post-errata game an "8", so I settle in on a 7. The game is much more fun multi-player, not as interesting two-player, but still not a bad game. 

Game is a little over-complex for the subject, but the components are top notch.

This is a good, relatively simple wargame (like Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage or Rommel in the Desert).  It is designed to be played by two teams of two, but can be played by two or three players.  It uses some clever mechanics to cause a bit of strife between partners (secret bidding for foreign support being the most important).  The game starts in chaos with various factions spread all through the board, then there is a race to establish perimeters and plan assaults on key targets.  Great fun - main problem is finding 4 people to play a 6 hour game of some complexity.

A wild ride and a fun, goofy game!  The rules aren't dense or difficult, but the decision making can be, and watching your order pack play out over the turn can be triumphant or agonizing.

As a Euro gamer, I'm not generally into war games that much, but this one is not too complicated (for a war game) and contains several neat mechanics.

RATING: 7
Mixed feelings on this game.  I like the asymmetry and the limited number of forces (prevents one army from growing too strong).  Combat is a little weird, but it makes sense after a couple rounds.  That being said the game became a bit repetitive and long.  Having to program your moves for 4-7 rounds in advance is hard with 4 players and not knowing who the starting player will be.  It's easy for things to change early and then many of your plans fizzle and you end up with inefficient/waste turns. Even when your plans were not disrupted, too many turns ended up being a pass because there was not really anything productive to do - like when you are in a defensive posture or you have a bunch of troops outside of a column. I think the game would have benefited from some card driven events.

The game seems a bit unbalanced and not all sides are as interesting to play.  Once Cabinda falls, MPLA loses set recruitment which is a drag for the rest of the game.  Meanwhile, FAPLA has to stay pretty close to Luanda because if he loses that, the game is pretty much over for him.  Meanwhile, UNITA and FNLA get plenty of recruits in a protected part of the map.

GAME: Sicily: Triumph and Folly
RANK: 3378
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Played the para, Palermo and Gela beach scenarios only so far. Like the system. Looking to have a solitaire game of this to really brush up my knowledge of the rules again. Italians tend to surrender at the drop of a handkerchief.

RATING: 10
One of my favorite OCS games and my first real campaign game play.  The Gela scenario was my first intro to OCS, and I was hooked.  This is probably the best of the few games on this operation, and covers the units and situations well.  Hard to get now, but worth every penny.  A two-map campaign game that plays quickly.

Tremendous. For OCS, the length is quite manageble - if you play at a con, you can get the game in over a weekend - don't laugh, most OCS takes much longer than that! - if you push the slow players (which I always recommend). Both sides have non-trivial firepower in most areas (air, armor, high-quality infantry, even paradrop capability on both sides!) so there are plenty of options for both players. Probably the optimal number of players is 3 - Brits, US, Axis. Although the Axis have many units at start, the Italians will evaporate very quickly.  Only weakness is that scenarios are a little thin, so there isn't much in terms of smaller games - although still, it's better in this respect than most OCS games except Burma. Supply is also not the headache it is in some of the games, and the counter density is quite manageable, so it's a very good first OCS game (although again, not as good as Burma). If you like this, you should try GMT's Invasion Sicily, as the two games compliment one another very nicely.

A good OCS game.  The main points:
Allied naval power is a killer. There is little point being on the coast, but you have to as the axis.   Axis air power is strong and anti port, and shipping missions are worth doing.   It seems to take either a turn with poor axis reaction air or a double allied turn to see breakthroughs.
German supply is a big issues once the ports get bombed. Hence they must be protected (had to do every turn)
An allied auto victory is very possible.

The most beautiful OCS game. But way too slow.  People saying you can play it in a weekend must be from another planet.

All OCS games are good and this one plays excellent with three players and is not impossible to finish in a weekend with three dedicated players.

It should have been, the lite OCS title. It is not. Try Burma or better Tunisia. Very one sided situation. A lot of rules to scuffle about about landings, airborne operations, and some other seldom used stuff. After the first turns it becomes a slugfest.

2017-05-20 : my very first encounter with the OCS system and it pretty much had everything I expected from an operational level game in the sense that it had rules for everything I thought it would have. And most of the time those rules were pretty streamlined, at other times not so much. Terrain and supply are king and stacks can get pretty huge and butt up to each other, so this is a type of game that's best played digitally and not FTF. I'm glad I played it, but this is a bit too far removed from my comfort zone.

Very nice game.
its nice to play with two allies that keep arguing on the strategy and tactics to follow.
Both sides have alot of opportunities.
The axis airpower is really devastating.

Like all of the games from Gamers (MMP) the quality is excellent, in all aspects.  I particularly like the the Operational games from Gamers.  I have either owned, previously owned, or played, most of the games in the series.  But, of all of them, this was my least favorite, and I eventually sold it.  One reason I didn't care for this game too much was because I had the most trouble with these rules than all of the others.  I particularly had a tough time with the Allied invasion part of the game.  I just had a hard time getting the game down pat, and I had to refer to the rules constantly.  I'm not saying that the rules were not clear, but just not clear to me.  Others may find this game to be easily learned.

The entire island of Sicily on the map, the ability to choose where the allies stage their amphibious assault, air drops, etc.  This game has just about everything I could ask for in an operational level wargame.

Now I just need to find the time and space to play it!

Played the full campaign once as the Allies. OCS is a magnificent system. Sicily was my second OCS game and now I felt in command - well, at least after the initial couple of turns of beach landings.There is a lot to manage as the Allies: both American and Commonwealth armies and the full panoply of land and air forces, with some naval artillery (courtesy of the battleships) and landing craft thrown in for good measure. 

Sicily may not offer long-term replayability as there is a single optimum strategy for the Axis, but I can nevertheless highly recommend it.

This campaign has a slight "funnel" problem, in that the frontage narrows as the Germans get pushed back near Messina.  Uses the 2.5-mile scale, and so is more "tactical" than most games in series.

I own all OCS series except this and Korea.  Don't know why, I got the feeling of wheeling around a system for a different kind of war the OCS intends to simulate.  So I lost track of OCS.

Played with v4.0 rules. Invasion/naval rules fit smoothly into the OCS world. Plentiful, but weak, Italians, and you never know if they're going to hang around. Strong, but few, Germans need to be everywhere. Allies want to attack everywhere, but don't have the supply to achieve everything. Latter part of the game gets a trifle boring for Axis with nothing to do except get beat up on. In our game they didn't make a single attack in the second half of the game.

Invasion of Sicily at half the usual OCS scale (units are Bns, 4 turns a week, 2.5 miles a hex). I think OCS plays better at a small scale. Rating based on playing 2 scenarios solitaire.

Like the map and counters, like the OCS system.  It's a little puzzle-like, it's easy to get lost pondering your moves, in taking a long time to play.  You definitely want to play this one hard and fast, not the slow way.  Things are grim for the Axis side, but it is a challenge for the Allies to get to Palermo within the historical timeline.  Would work well with 4 players, you REALLY need two Allied players.

The OCS system is the best operational level system out there at the moment, in my opinion. The subtlety and sophistication of a system that requires you to think about logistics and combat on this scale is superb!

RATING: 8.5
Fun game that covers a major amphibious assault using the Operational Combat System (OCS) series of play, a system standard pioneered by The Gamers.  Eight major scenarios are challenging and the Allies have a tough well armed German/Italian army to dislodge from the Sicilian country side.  Probably the best in the series due to a short playing time compared with other titles of the OCS series.

Looks very good, there might be a problem, if the German player decides to withdraw early and create huge stacks along the Etna. Have to play again to see if that really is a problem...

A less than stellar OCS title.  Lots of action in a manageable setting (compared with Hube/GBII) -- not the BEST OCS starting point but a manageable one for players new to the system but interested in the battle.  There are issues of scale.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
definitely a great game.
I appreciate the closed combat zone (island). it doesn't need rules to simulates what happened just next the map (like in Hube's pocket).
Allied runs against time as the ground is in favor of defender (and german with their 4 and 5 rating are good ones). The situation is stressfull for both sides anyway.

Another favorite of mine in the OCS series.  Another one that combines land, sea, air and amphibious operations.  Although the Axis doesn't have nearly the counter-attack opportunities as in other OCS games.  A methodical defense falling back into the mountains is the focus for the Axix.  I think the Allies are more fun to play in this one.

My personal favorite in the OCS system.  

Something quite interesting and enticing about an island game. Plus this one includes all OCS elements of land, air, naval and beach landings. 

A big cookie with the Allies nibbling around all the edges, eating it's way inward while the Germans and Italians converge upon the inland networks, giving ground as necessary while jabbing with timely, well-planned counterstrokes.  Truly a grudge match of the highest entertainment order.

Just starting in on a VASSAL match with this one... this is definitely a rules-heavy game by the standards of OCS. Just about every conceivable OCS rule comes into play here somewhere. At the same time, it offers a sense of completeness (the whole island, land/air/naval ops) that the others lack. It's also nice that the subject hasn't quite been done to death. It's too early for me to really rate this, but it looks like it will be a challenging but rewarding game.

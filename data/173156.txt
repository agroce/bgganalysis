A clever game that reuses old timeline decks in new, interesting ways. My biggest problem with this game is that it just seems too difficult. It appears to target a family market, but I can't imagine kids (or many adults) being able to accurately guess each of the 4 digits of the date that the mandolin was invented.

Mini Games were pretty meh, usually just play the standard way with the time cards. (Place them on the timeline, if your placement is wrong, you have to pick up another card.)

Nice variation of Timeline.  The different game styles mix things up a bit.  I prefer the simplicity of regular Timeline.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Covers 6000BC-1998AD, but less than 20% covers events before 900AD.  Deck midpoint is 1710.  Contains three cards duplicated from Americana.

The box has room for four other Timeline sets.  Too bad I have eight of them.

This edition does have less downtime between turns than previous editions.  I like the Challenges as a catch-up mechanism, but they are too little too late for a lagging player to catch up.  (Possible house rule for a game with four (or five) players, also issue a challenge whenever the second (or third) player crosses the challenge line.)

RATING: 8
Timeline has always been a solid game, but T:C adds incredible variety, tension, and a great race to the finish line. The mini-games are quite fun, and the time card dials are clever. This is a real crowd-pleaser, and I highly recommend it for family gatherings with non-gamers.

It includes 5 variations of how you can use Timeline cards built into the game. More than one player can score each round so it moves along nicely. There are two points where the bottom players get to play 1 round to get a chance to gain bonus points. It includes some new Timeline cards but you can add other Timeline decks that you already have to it.

I'm not a huge fan of Timeline, but I do think it succeeds as being a dead simple family-style filler game that anybody can play.   This takes that premise and turns it into a Cranium game.   The board is unnecessarily huge and over-produced.   The player wheels are loose and don't fit together properly.  I would expect better from Asmodee.   If you want a Timeline experience that is tripled in length, this might fit the bill, but it feels a bit forced (especially the catch up mechanism) and overall more like a name brand cash-in.   Was hoping for more.   But that's okay, there's always Timeline itself when the mood strikes.

Better than its card counterparts but requires at least 4 people to be interesting. A game of two players went very fast and while it did come down to a wire, it was not at that satisfying. Played with 3 players recently and same thing happened, came down to the wire but not all that intensely?

Hasn't hit the table yet. All other Timeline decks included.

For regular Timeline: Perfect in it's simplicity. Great art and component quality. Only problem is replay ability. I'm already starting to memorize cards. Will probably rate higher when I get the different editions and mix them together. 

*Update: Improved rating to 8 because of expansion decks. No replay problem. I mix all the versions together. Everyone has really enjoyed this simple trivia game. A hit. Highly recommended to any but those who truly can't stand any sort of trivia game.

We were interested in a party game with variety and challenge, for when we needed a break from Codenames. After hearing about Timeline, my interest was piqued but I wasn't fully sold.

Our FLGS showed us a copy of Timeline Challenge, which adds five mini-games and two additional challenges to the basic trivia experience.

To me, Timeline Challenge is perfect at what it sets out to do: It can be played quickly by gamers and non-gamers, offers loads of variety, and is fun. The fact that we're learning as we play is a bonus.

Timeline Challenge is a good idea, but it needs help in the execution dept. I understand that it's clean to incorporate the wheels in each challenge, but in the ordering game especially, I wanted a more tactile way to do it. Trying to read 4 events upside down and decide which gets 1-2-3-4 on my dials alone was a bit cumbersome. I'd rather order my own personal cards (with the shape symbols perhaps?) so I could see it spatially. The dials had a tendency to spin on their own, as well. And I know the material is largely dependent on which expansions your host has, but the events didn't feel accessible or interesting enough. Maybe we got bad draws. But compared to other games in this space (Times to Remember, etc.) I didn't have as much to sink my teeth into - I felt like I was guessing 80% of the time.

Trivia games are not games, they are [url=http://www.human-memory.net/types_declarative.html]non-interactive skill[/url]  contests, played on an uneven field, which are fun for equally matched players/teams, but usually devolve into which team gets lobbed more softball questions in their weakest category, à la Trival Pursuit.

Timeline Challenge is not the best entry point for the Timeline series (especially because so few cards come in the box), but if you are a Timeline fanatic that already owns multiple sets of cards, Timeline Challenge is definitely worth considering. It successfully adds new ways of using the cards and a way to organize a session of multiple rounds of Timeline into a more cohesive game. If the idea of Timeline Challenge sounds good on paper, it's likely a pretty safe investment worth picking up.

NOTE: My rating is for what's in the box itself; if you already own one or more sets of Timeline cards, I would give this a 7.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (March 2016)

A couple of years ago, I really liked Timeline. In fact I bought every set I could and I still have them on my game collection, but nowadays, I’m kind of tired of it and almost never want to play it. Due to this, I was keen on trying Timeline Challenge so I could see if it can revive the game for me and the short answer is YES!

The rules continue to be pretty simple, but as there are many mini games, explaining them can take now around 15 minutes. Playtime is around 45 minutes (much more than vanilla Timeline).

While I was writing this, I just saw in the Timeline Challenges´ entry that the game can go up to 10 players. As I haven’t read the rules I’m not sure how this works, but I guess it would be with partnerships of some sort, so for now, I think the game is best played with 4 players.

The game components are ok. The player boards are nice, but the dials move way too easy (they are too loose), perhaps this happens only on my friend´s copy and you could tight them better, but I’m not sure. The player markers are very nice (and reminiscent of Monopoly). The board is overproduced and way bigger than necessary, but it looks cool on the table.

I love that the game is compatible with my previously bought Timelines, all except the Star Wars one work.

The mini games are a lot of fun to play. There are 6 new ways to play the cards and all are fun. It adds a lot of replayability to the old sets. 

On the bad side, I’m not sure I like the artificial catch up mechanisms, but I need more plays to verify this point. It also can be too long for the simplicity of the game (previously, Timelines could finish under 8 minutes). In general, I have always disliked that there are some repeats cards between the sets, and this edition also comes with repeat cards :/, I have never understood why Asmodee does this, it seems pretty easy to print different cards in each set. This edition is harder to get to the table.

Bottom line, I think I will buy the game if only because I already have all previously released Timelines. I really love how it incorporates them together giving them more life. If you didn’t like Timeline perhaps this new iteration can change your mind, but if you liked the game, I’m pretty sure you will also like Timeline Challenge. Great family game and an improved way of playing.

This variation of Timeline is a really good way to fix the issues with the original timeline. Even if you remember every date, the different games in this mess up your goals and can make it hard for even the biggest history buffs, which is a nice way to even out the game for others. I like it, but find most people are too put off from the history aspect to actually play it.

An absolutely spectacular game that uses the existing Timeline standalone games that are out.  This is the kind of game that I wish was given more of a chance at the mass market, it really is a trivia game of sorts that all people can play and have a chance to win.  I wish the insert could comfortably accommodate all the Timeline games, my box is busting at the seams with cards.

Timeline Challenge incorporates the original mechanic of the series into progressive game track, of which players can move between 0-4 spaces per turn. Players will have to make use of pre-determined time periods and guess where the incident depicted on the card occurred. There are four different challenges, and they are played depending on the color of the game space of the lead player. Additionally there are two further challenges which allow the two players at the back of the pack to catch up. Although the game comes with its own cards, it can be integrated with any or all of the previous sets.

Solid entry in the trivia space.  Just wish there were more dynamics here.  It kinda hums along with no real peaks and valleys or big "wow" reveals.

Also, still trying figure out a the best of mix of cards from different decks to use.

I haven't played any of the Timeline games or even Cardline games. I can't compare. But I can say I think that this does offer more variety to the small tin games. Dan explained this was more of a gamers game. I agree there are a lot of different challenged revolving around the time period of random happenings. I think if you enjoy the tin games it would be hard for you not to enjoy the board game. I am actually quite happy with this game and plan to hang on to it for a while in hopes of picking up some timeline tins to use in it! All tins can be incorporated with the challenge game. I think it is very clever. Let me tell you, I am not the brightest bulb.

RATING: 7.5
'Party'-game-ised reworking of Timeline, with a good selection of different ways to play the game. The 'exact date' rule is silly, so we just 3pts for nearest, 1pt for next. Making the game 10 player (not teams) is doable with some spare tokens and pen/paper.

If adding cards from other sets, be aware that the 1970s+ comes in a lot (especially with Music/Cinema, which is best kept separate).

This would be a 6 if not for the fact that you go, "Really? That happened THAT far in the past?" on a lot of cards, so there's some real novelty the first time you see a card.

After the novelty, the game can be difficult still, but that's a major part of the fun.

-More of a formulated game when you want to sit down and play some timeline.
-Extra cards

Sort of Trivial Pursuit plus Timeline that plays out as a series of Timeline mini-games, such as: work out the order of four Timeline cards; determine into which of 10 brackets (e.g. 1930-1969, 1970-) four cards fit; bet on which of the 10 brackets a single card fits; guess the time between two cards, with the closest getting points.

I'm not convinced that the huge box is worth the new features, but it works with all existing Timeline decks and does add some nice variety. The way the scoring works, including a heavy-handed catchup mechanism, possibly increases the impact of luck. All up I'm inclined to think that it's strictly better than the original -- but only for those who play often enough that the original's simplicity is no longer a compelling feature.

Some of the mini-games can be trivially proxied, e.g. with cards numbered 1-4, so I am tempted to include them in one of my regular Timeline sets.

I got this on impulse. I thought that I'd like it a little  bit. It's actually a lot better than I was expecting; which is good because my girl loves it and we'll probably be playing often.

Timeline is probably the best educational game.  Teaches but manages to remain fun.  This big box version introduces a half-dozen or so new ways to play with your existing decks.  Fun and fast.

I enjoy a game that makes me think and I love a lot of pop culture and history related things. This blends together well for me and I enjoy the board game aspect of it. Although it is rather a short game if you get a few correct answers in a row.  So a few plays are encouraged.

It's nice to see Timeline expanded like this. I do wish the component quality was better. The year selector boards for the players felt cheap on the copy I played; the number wheels didn't fasten as tightly as they should have.

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Steve

Why we culled it: This "big box" version of Timeline actually adds in a lot of mini-game shenanigans to Timeline in an effort to...I'm not really sure what. It distracts from the history, making it more accessible to folks who just want to do activities, and it makes it more random, which mitigates the advantage for players who actually have historical knowledge. So all in all, it feels like it really dumbs down the game in flashy fanfare, and I didn't really care for the experience over the traditional Timeline game. To each their own.

Makes a great game even better! The original Timeline games are fast and simple and can be played with gamers and non-gamers, and "Challenge" takes the game a step further. The only complaint of this game is the ridiculously big board in combination with the extremely small cards, its not a good combination. But this is not a big issue. Great game!

I'd never played Timeline before, but apparently this is that game with a lot of bells and whistles added. The core idea of the game is still the same. This is a trivia game where the goal is to have a good idea of the dates of various historical events.

Unfortunately the "bells and whistles" just add complication and futziness rather than anything enjoyable. As an example, there's a challenge where you have to guess the year of an event. You get points for every digit correct. So if the answer is 1860 and you guess 1260 you get more points than the guy who guessed 1859.

Another challenge is to order four events chronologically. But you get points only if you get the third event in the third slot, etc. So the guy who orders them 1, 4, 3, 2 (i.e. the guy who only knows the correct order for one item) gets more points than the guy who orders them 2, 3, 4, 1 (the guy who only got one item out of order). Those types of tweaks just make the game painfully tedious.

I get the impression that I'd like the base Timeline game better than this, but even then it wouldn't be a game I particularly love.

Playable either as a bunch of minigames or a single timeline, and fun either way. Not for everyone but great with the right group.

Takes Timeline from a good game to a great game.  Has multiple clever ways to use the cards.

Timeline the Boardgame. Overly complicated compared to the regular Timeline. Any cards from the series can be used.

Best Timeline. Amazing game for almost any group. It's an absolute crime that this didn't get popular.

Takes what were very mediocre card games at best (the Timeline series) and makes them into a bunch of more interesting mini games. Without Timeline Challenge I wouldn't own any Timeline games as they can become very stale, very quick.

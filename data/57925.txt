A real hidden gem - thematically, this could be anything, but the mechanics are excellent. The way role selection ties in with turn order is genius, and managing the availability of roles is also an interesting point. This is also a very fast game, with experienced players. Best with 3P - 2P is a bit cut-throat, 4P a bit too busy.

[ESP] Un entretenido juego en el cual los jugadores podran usar dos de los 13 roles que poseen en cada ronda. El tema está en que los roles que tapen no los recuperarán hasta que les queden 2 cartas en la mano, por lo cual les puede ser dificil obtener los materiales necesatios para construir los edificios que hay en la mesa y que son la manera de obtener PV.

La baja nota es porque si bien me entretuve mucho jugándolo, si lo pienso friamente preferiría jugar otro juego.

It features the beautiful artwork of Menzel's Cuba, but it is a very simplistic euro. There are 4 buildings available to build if you gather the needed materials. Buildings do not have abilities, they just score vp. In your turn, you refresh one of your 2 played cards and follow their action, which would be take/steal X materials. Pretty simplistic. Not my choice. Looks like the beginning of a promising game that was left undeveloped.

One play:

I liked this more than my '6' rating would suggest.

What I liked was it had the feel of an economic engine card game like Glory to Rome or San Juan...but it had no way for any engine to be built.  That is, there was no possible way to create a snowball that stomps the other players.

The downside though, with the 4 players, it was really hard to feel like I had a control over my own destiny.  It was my first game, and I really think this needs probably 3-4 games to get the feeling for what gambits other people are going to run vs. what you're running.

I don't know if this game is "my thing" or not, but it's DEFINITELY a solid game worthy of its pedigree/box/manufacturer.  

One of my geekbuddies put it accurately: it's like an economic citadels.

Nice simultaneous action selection mechanic where your action selection also decides turn order. Twist is that it does so in combination with one of the two actions you took last turn. You have to do some clever thinking to get the resources you need and manipulate the turn order to your best advantage. Nothing spectacular but a pretty good game.

I've played this once with 3 players and it was a quick-playing game a lot of the same ideas as other games but implemented in a way that was fun and felt newish.  Play 2 cards on your first turn and those provide benefits and determine play order.  Each turn thereafter, play 1 card to replace one of the cards on the table.  Buy buildings and earn points.  First to a set number wins.

RATING: 5
Originally, Havana was off my to try-list for Spiel 2009 as eggertSpiele took their bloody time releasing details for it. But when they released the rules, I nearly immediately put it on said list. The best way to think about Havana is really 'Cuba—The Cardgame'. Players attempt to build buildings which do nothing besides taking in resources during construction and then yielding a fixed amount of VP. The game is in actually obtaining those resources. Every player has an identical deck of cards, picturing various characters we've already met in Cuba and its expansion El Presidente. These cards carry numbers, and also an action. Like, for example, 'take one worker from the supply', or 'take all the waste from the supply'. You begin by selecting two of these characters, turning them over and then rearranging them in numerical order. The 'number' thus formed indicates your place in the play sequence: the lower, the earlier. The actions on those cards are the two actions at your disposal. Every new turn, you are obliged to cover one of those cards with a new one from your hand, altering your position in the turn order as well as having you do something different. When you can exchange a number of collected resources for a building, you do so; and whoever reaches a number of VP first, wins.

The game is rather delightful in conception, but to play it well is an entirely different matter. It's not just about playing good cards, it's also about timing them correctly. This is not easy given that the other players are after the same resources just like you. I find that especially at 4 players, card and resource contention can create really nasty lockout situations beyond the player's control. You must then play rather more agressively and opportunistically than I deem proper for a game of this stature. With 2 players, the game is plain boring; so I prefer it mostly with 3. As a result, despite its simple appearance I'm not too enthusiastic about its scaling properties, hence the somewhat lower rating than it could've gotten instead. But it remains a nice in-between nonetheless.

[b]Update[/b]   The more I play this game, the less I'm liking it. I already mentioned the card and resource contention issues above, and these are not going away with more plays. If anything, they become more and more apparent. There is too much randomness in the buildings and too much value placed on being first player to the point where you basically do nothing in order to avoid getting taxed or stolen from. This creates unpleasant tension and pauses in the game: sometimes you have no choice but to aim for a high-valued building, and thus need to collect a lot of resources; but then your main aim would be defensive. If you need a specific card or resource you can plan all you want: it amounts to specific targetting of other players and then hoping that you get to them first, [i]and[/i] that you get to hold on to stuff long enough for it to be used for a building.

I expect the rate to drop further, and I even foresee me selling it off.

Probably can be categorized as a "super-filler", with a little bit of euro and a lot of potential "take that" mayhem. Nonetheless, you can't help but feel like some careful thought will get you to rise above the chaos. Then again, I'm a sucker for anything with a simultaneous selection mechanic, so maybe that's the biggest lure for me.

Individual aspects of Havana might be derivative, but collectively they add up to something not quite like anything else in my collection...maybe in the same family as Libertalia? I'm not really getting the Citadels vibe others are putting forth.

Don't have time for a full-blown Eurogame... Havana is a very quick resource gathering and building construction game.

The role selection cards are also lot of fun... trying to out-guess what the other players will choose, so that you get the most resources and/or the first choice of buildings, etc.

This may be a really good "gateway" game. It has victory points, buildings, resources and variable action roles, but it can be taught in 10 minutes and played in 30-40 even with new players. Really great in that regard.

This game is a light, yet fun, simultaneous action selection and city building game. It was not difficult to learn, but I always find these type of games very difficult to master.

The artwork is nicely done and is very thematic; gameplay is not but it doesn't bother me.

2016-09-26 : Fast playing, easy to explain game of gathering resources and buying victory points with them. This is so basic that it doesn't get in the way of what makes this a fine game : watching your opponents status and trying to figure out what their pick will be, so you can counter it and mess-up their plan. Player order is crucial and who can manipulate it best will win.

A bit of a dissappointment. Seeing all the pieces in the game makes you think there will be more going on, but sadly this is not the case. There are no interesting building powers (rather they are all just boring victory chips). There is no worker placement action, rather EVERYTHING in the game is just some dull form of money to buy static victory point buildings (worker bits, resources, ruble, money, etc.). Also, things are too random to predict a sensible move. The one redeeming point to note is the unique role selection mechanic. I would like to see it used again in a game.

In the end, it is still pleasant to play, just dissapointing there isn't much more going on here.

A clever role selection game that can result in some nastiness. You play two role cards to collect resources and then use them to build buildings. The catch is, the role cards are numbered and determine turn order. For example, a 4 and a 3 card would count as 43 whereas someone else might have 1 and 8 for 18 and go before you. Some role cards mess with other players, so you're torn between wanting to get something done and playing cards to go before everyone else. Ostensibly, that's the fun of the game.

Might be fun for people to balance these two layers of roles and turn order, but felt like guessing for me. At some point, you're going to have to expose yourself by playing cards that push you down in turn order. I got lucky in my one play. My opponent used his protection card early, I saw he was vulnerable, and I played the same card every turn to steal a resource from him and cruised to victory.

It's pretty hard for a blind-action-selection "take that" game to do well with me, and Havana fits squarely in that niche.  The only good thing about it is it's short.  Now, I'll admit that I enjoy Die Glucksritter, which is another game in the genre, but it's an exception.

My partner rates this one lower than I do which means we probably will never play it as much as I'd like. Havana isn't strategically deep, but it is fun, fast-playing, and tactical game--my kind of filler. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a clever game that requires optimization of your card use as you lose a card every turn.  This is tempered by anticipating what your opponents will play and by the uncertainty of what will come out of the bag and whether you can use that to buy the buildings. This plays pretty well with two (I would rate 6-6.5) and very well with three players (7-7.5).

A játék nagyon szép (micheal menzel), bár nekem kicsit kiveri a biztosétok, hogy ugyenezt a grafikát már legalább a harmadik játékban látom viszont. Biztos nem olcsó Menzel úr munkája, de ez akkor is kicsit túlzás.
A játékmenetben vannak érdekes, számomra új mechanizmusok. Érdekes a két akció kijátszása, és ebből mindig az egyiknek a kicserélése. Nomeg a két akcióval kialakuló körsorrend is jópofa. Sajnos az angol és a magyar szabályban egyeránt voltak nem egyértelmű dolgok, főleg a szürke nyersanyag nyersanyag-e vagy sem témakörben. Ez egy kicsit rányomta a bélyegét az első játékunkra. Tipikusan olyan játék, ami több játék után áll csak össze, mivel ismerni kéne hozzá mind a 13 kártyát készségszinten. Ami elsőre kicsit fura volt még, hpgy nagyon gyorsasn vége lett, hamar össze lehet gyűjteni a 15 pontot. Mondjuk ezen a pontok megemelésével lehet segíteni.

Jópár év tán újra előkerült. Ez egy kifejezetten gonosz játék, ahol nagyon sok fronton lehet kitolni a másikkal, akár akaratlanul is. Így elég nehezen is tervezhető.

Havana is a terrific game at all player counts; great components, quick set-up and play and a nice variety options, dependent on the buildings and building materials in play.
Yet, for me, it is one of those rare multiplayer games that really is at its best with just two. The only negative thing I would say is that the box is way too big – maybe it could double as a cigar humidor.

After several plays this has revealed itself to be quite the lightweight gem. Unlike most games the playing time on the side of the box is accurate; I've found the 3 player game passes in around half an hour. All the time there are interesting, if not overly taxing, decisions to be made. A mixture of role selection and hand management is the order of the day and though you can plan for the turns ahead you have to be relaxed enough to realise those plans may fall through due to luck. All in all, an ideal 2nd or 3rd gateway game or warm-up, warm-down game for more experienced players.

The "keep one role, change one role" mechanic produces a rhythm unlike anything I've played before. The closest thing would be La Isla's power cards, but among other differences, those only really affect you-- while in Havana, the 'business environment' created by other people's role selections massively affects the value of your roles.

I'm normally allergic to arbitrary cube recipes on cards (I can get 2VP for a blue cube and a red cube, or 3VP for a red and two yellows...) but in this case it's saved by the extremely limited supply of cubes (only three new ones each round, including the worthless grey cubes) and the long lookahead on which buildings will be available.

Very nice and very good card game which gets more chaotic the more players are playing the game. As a 2-player game, this is one of the best. With more players it´s still a good game though, just not that great as with only 2.

The game has a very neat mechanism, offers different strategys and options. The only downside are the buildings that arn´t balanced, BUT they are open for everyone, so it´s not a big deal at all.

The turn ordering is a good idea, but nothing happens in the game. You pick up a couple of things per turn but there's no real drama, and no real opportunities for big game changing plays. It works, but I wish it had tried to do something more.

RATING: 7.5
Citadels has grown a pair!

The combination of the mechanics is marvellous and very elegant. The idea to drop all functionality away from the buildings and have them just be used as a method to convert resources to point makes choosing right actions at the right time the focus of the game, like it should be. I also like that the buildings still differ in their efficiency, unlike in Stone age where you knew precisely how much points a wood is worth.

Short, enjoyable, awards bluffing and gives possibilities to wreak havoc on other players resources. So much better than the boring Cuba while sharing the same gorgeous graphics. Siesta is also the best idea for a card ever. :)

Cuba könnyed kártyás verziója. Itt embereket, pénzt és nyersanyagokat kell gyűjtenünk az épületek építéséhez. A játék lényege a mindenki számára lehetséges 13 karakter használata. Mindegyik egy-egy akciót ad, amelyek ismerete fontos (nyelvfüggő játék, de a magyar kártyák megjelentek a JEM-ben). Érdekes a két akció kijátszása, és ebből mindig az egyiknek a kicserélése. És ezzel a két akcióval kialakuló körsorrend is nagyon jó. 
A játéknak nagyon gyorsasn vége lehet, mert a győzelemhez szükséges pontok könnyen összegyűjthetők. Valószínűleg érdemes ezen a pontok megemelésével segíteni.

I appreciate the unique mechanism of management of characters' utilization (numbers manipulation, player order etc), but the gameplay is too chaotic (you can't effectively predict other players' moves) and way too dry.  The racing element is also what I'm generally trying to avoid.

All in all, rather pointless exercise...

When playing Cuba for the first time, I was surprised that there really are similarities between both games in the mix of role selection with turn order and builds.
---
Solid but nothing really new. The game reminded me of Marquis and A Castle for All Seasons in its character selection. The twist is that you have to choose two roles at once and consider being at the right position in the player order at the same time. Decisions matter but you have to enjoy simultaneous action selection, i.e. enjoy bluffing and live with potential resulting chaos. Not sure if it is unique enough to buy it.

I know that everyone refers to how chaotic the game is, and I will admit that there is some luck involved in the game, but I think it is very manageable and to be expected in a light, quick-playing title.

Even though Havana has nothing to do with Cuba, they do feel somewhat the same due to the recycled artwork and simultaneous selection of action cards.  But Havana is much quicker and easier to learn, much more abstract as well.  You're essentially playing to earn money and colored cubes which you use to buy buildings.

I really like having to choose which card to cover, and the turn order is very important to consider.  While not a total classic, Havana is a solid game.

I really enjoy the twist of changing only one of the two cards you play every turn, and how you can guess what the other will play based on what they've gotten rid of already. The actions that get you to interact with a pool are interesting because of their changing nature, but the others are much less interesting. It's a card game with solid, intriguing mechanisms, but too many boring cards.

I wish I could rate this game higher because I really like the 2 action card mechanic with one card that can carry on in following turn, but I can't because of the pasted theme.  The theme "havana" is completely absent from the gameplay, it could be anything and it wouldn't change a thing!  As an exemple, there is really no difference in the gameplay btw a worker and a piece of debris or a blue cube.  They could all be simply cubes.  And what you get from those cube could be anything, the only difference on the buildings is the VP they award and what it takes to get them. Dry-dry-dry, there is zero atmosphere as a result. I would compare it to Mikerinos in that department.

Meh.

LIKES:

* Role selection device is both similar and unique all at once.  You have two roles which allow you to take two actions on your turn and those same tiles have numbers on them to help determine turn order (which plays a significant role).  Each turn you will cover up one of those two cards while keeping the other action to do again.
* There is some nastiness in this game.  That can be a positive or a negative depending on your preferences.  I like it at this point.  You can steal goods and money from your opponents and destroy building options.

DISLIKES:

* Box is way too large for what the game has component wise.  However, the components are excellent.
* My ONE play didn't seem overly exciting or dynamic - repeat plays may change that perspective, but I'm not certain I will give the game another chance.

I've wrote a review for this when I first got it, and probably over-estimated the depth of the game. The game has nice components, and I like the role selection mechanic whereby you have two roles, and only one of them gets replaced each round. Unfortunately, buying buildings is prone to swings of luck, and it often feels like the end of the game came out of the blue.

This game sort of fell flat.  It took a while to wrap our minds around and then when we restarted the game it ended too quickly and initiative determined who purchased the winning building.  Perhaps a variant could correct this but it just didn't last long enough to satisfy (less than 11 rounds).

Eh, not a bad game, but it felt a little too random to me.  I felt like I was getting lucky rather than playing strategically.  The idea of playing each card for two rounds is very interesting, and I think it would make for some very interesting decisions as we got more familiar with the gameplay.  However, the whole thing felt a little too abstract and uninteresting to me.  There's some good ideas that I would like to see incorporated into better games.  I'd gladly play this one again, but I likely won't be the one to suggest it.

Fairly unique action selection game that's simple, yet so elegant and just works well.  The rules are easy to teach, but also offers some great room for strategy, mainly in trying to anticipate other players and managing your action cards.  There's a bit of an attack element with a few of the actions, but nothing severe.  Every time I pull this out I tell myself I should play it more often.  Great little sleeper hit that deserves more appreciation.

Whatever the case, I found it boring and repetitive (now I choose this role, now you choose that role, now back to my role).

Variable player power game where each player has the same roles and chooses from the same random tiles common among all players.

The rules and overall flow of this game are shockingly simple. The whole game is based on individual role selection from each player's deck of cards. These roles also dictate player order for the game. Turn order can make a big difference on a turn. The game changes each play with the variety of buildings and how they enter the game. The randomness of the buildings materials also make the game very tactical. This is a fast and easy game with several interesting decisions for a player to make.

Another converting resource to victory point game, it's done in a very simple way. What's interesting about the game is the Citadels-like role selection, which you not only have to factor what you need, there's a psychic battle in which you have to predict what your opponent might choose to maximize your benefits. The game can be played in a reasonably short time-frame and is packed with decisions.

The edition has some contradictions. The meeples are quite bad, but the cardboard is very good. The illustrations, by Menzel, are just gorgeous.

The action selection mechanic is quite cool, and it limits the control you have over what is going on. This control is also limited because you don't get to choose the resources you want with these cards, you just choose where you'll get from and you just hope there will be there when it's your turn.

This mechanic also determines your initiative, and since you use 2 cards and you can only change one per turn, you get an idea about what your opponents might do and what you need to win the initiative (very important!).

This limit of control allows for great comebacks. IMPORTANT: by "limited control" I don't mean the chaos you find in other games; in this one, you get to do what you plan most of the times, but the more powerful the actions are, the later you will act and you find that some of what you wanted/expected is not there anymore.

I only played once, but I think the experience will improve once you get used to the characters after a few games.

Fun, dynamic and short.

RATING: 6
The action selection and turn order system is a fine design but there just isn't enough content elsewhere in the game. Had they added even a slight engine building aspect to the VP tiles, this would be a far better game. Now you just try to gain enough resources any way you can. Which very often means stealing from other players.

Gioco di carte privo di tabellone che fa storcere il naso quando, aprendo una scatolona 35x35, si scopre che il contenuto non riempie una scatola delle dimensioni di un espansione di Carcassonne. Il gioco però fa tornare il sorriso perché non è affatto banale e gira molto bene in 4 (forse in 2 si perdono gli effetti di alcuni ruoli). La durata media di una partita supera di poco la mezz'ora risultando comunque avvincente e strategica. Le illustrazioni sulle carte sono le stesse di Cuba e Santiago de Cuba.

The whole thing didn't really click at first, and trying to monitor the contents of your opponents' hands is dreary, especially with that tiresome 'Refreshment' card in play. It's probably best to look at this one as a simple optimisation game - the jury's out for now.

In mitigation, it plays swiftly and the component quality is absolutely not to be sniffed at.

RATING: 5.5
This should be a good game, but design decisions make it almost impossible for me to play (below).

There is a very clever role selection mechanism which also determines player order and the usefulness of the actions - some are more powerful early, others may prey on other players success. The components are OK: the art is nice, and the cardboard is heavy and well printed...

But...

The publisher (designer?) have chosen colours for resource cubes with scant consideration for usability. The game has to be modified before a colourblind person can cope. So far my plays have featured repeated questions- [i]What colour are the cubes on this card? What about this? And this? What was that one again...?.[/i] Very frustrating. Disappointed. 

There are many similarities with [thing=38386][/thing]: if you already have one, the other is probably redundant.

Each player has a hand of identical characters which have a numeric value according to the strength of the action it provides. These allow you to acquire or steal (from other players) the cubes, money, people you need to build the VP earning different buildings on the table. You get to action 2 characters each turn, with 1 allowed to hold over for next turn. The weaker they are, the earlier in the turn order you'll go, the safer you are from being stolen from, and the more surety you'll have that the things you're after will still be there. The problem is that the buildings are diverse. You can't stockpile because you'll be stolen from. So you need to go for exact things, hope that you get them, then hope that the building is still there (they can simply be knocked off by 1 character, or built by other players obviously). That's a lot of hope to be dashed throughout the game. Combined with the many steals, the game can strike a sour note. Interesting character mechanic, but that is the whole game.

Based on one play: A simple to learn, light Euro where you play two actions a turn based on the cards you select. The sum of the cards determines the turn order with the better cards having higher values and the lowest total going first. One card remains from round to round. The mechanics are simple to learn and you use your actions to gather resources to buy point cards. Well worth a try.

There are two kind of unique things in this game. One is the way the tiles are placed in the display. Players can only acquire the tiles on the ends of the display and new tiles are added to the middle. The other is the way players play cards, everyone has the same deck of choices, in two piles, so that one is always covering one previous card with a new card.

A card game featuring simultaneous card selection, variable player order and a bit of role deduction? It's going to interest me then. In this game you're playing role cards from your hand simultaneously with your opponents, trying to steal pesos and materials from the board or from other players. What's interesting about it, is that your cards define your player order; powerful cards usually play last and simpler cards play earlier, so you want to make a combo that helps you play at the right time. Moreover, players memorizing the roles of other players will also be rewarded, since you can start deducing what will be played next, as the game progresses.

The twist on the action card mechanic is quite nice (having two cards of which one gets replaced every round). However, the game feels a bit all-or-nothing. There are many variables that influence whether or not you get to build something (luck of the draw, other player's actions, other buildings) and it is easy to get stuck with resources that you cannot use to build, but do leave you as a nice target for thieves.

Played twice as a 2p and once 4p. Loved it both ways, but it was better with 4. The game is quick, elegant (not a lot of moving parts, easy to setup, easy to explain), tense and fun. I'm sure it will end up one of our favorites and so far the game mechanics are pretty unique in our collection (closest game would probably be Citadels as both games revolve around character selection an purchase of buildings for VP)

I had a discussion with someone about whether or not it would have been better for some of the buildings to have powers (get an extra cube each turn, treat certain building materials as wilds, only lose half as much when robbed, etc) and it was decided that the game is excellent as is. Building powers could add "depth", but would distract from the well designed core of the game.

OMSCHRIJVING: Strategisch kaartspel met bluf-elementen.
In de hoofdstad van Cuba proberen de spelers prestigepunten te verwerven door het optrekken van strategisch gekozen bouwwerken.
De spelers beschikken over een set karakterkaarten en kiezen steeds gelijktijdig welke ze telkens zullen inzetten. Hoe sterker de ingezette karakters, hoe groter de kans dat deze speler later aan de beurt komt en een tegenspeler de buit voor zijn neus wegkaapt.

good game working for two players driven by very clever action cards mechanics
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Just played two games on Saturday. I found very little luck and chaos in the game. Information is open but not too complex, so you can not only deduce what card an opponent is going to play, but you can make a good guess what your opponent will play because of the card you were going to play, and make a response to *that*.

Turn order is *crucial*, forcing you to make tense decisions. Do you play the card that gains you the most of a resource *if* all the players let you (yeah, right), or do you play the card that gets you some of a resource while letting you a better chance of using it?

Each turn, you only discard one role, and your opponents know which one you keep, allowing them to play in response to it. So if your opponent keeps a role that allows him to go earlier in the turn, you need to pick a card that takes this into account.

I think the attacks are brutal, but not dull. You have enough information to know which of your resources your opponents think they need to steal or destroy to prevent you from purchasing a victory card. If someone out-thought you, if your calculated risk failed, or if you thought others would be "nice" to you this round, that's your own fault, it will hurt, and that's what's brutal.

Phenomenal little game full of double guessing, bluffing, interaction, and lot of chances for clever card play. Plays excellent with 2 players. the fact that it's a race to 25 points makes every turn very tense. Like it a lot.

I like some of the mechanics of this game, but it a) seems to go too quickly for what it is and b) points seem to snowball as soon as someone reaches a certain level. Ben's not enamored, so this one needs to find a new home.

An enjoyable card playing mechanism. Easy rules and easy to explain. You're playing two cards down at the beginning of the game then each round replacing one of them with another from your hand. Turn order is determined by the number your cards make. Lowest goes first, but generally the lowest are the least useful at gaining you goods required to buy buildings worth victory points. Because each round one card is replaced you can see half of what your opponents going before you are doing. This is the interesting bit as you constantly try to stay ahead of them and their plans.

It's a fast game with plenty of quick decisions made throughout the 30 minutes it'll take you to play. Probably three players is the best number because there's a bit more control and it's a little bit quicker to play. At 30 minutes it works really well and doesn't outstay its welcome. I wouldn't mind some advanced building that have abilities on them. It feels a bit like the base game of Stone Age in that respect as you buy buildings that are just points and nothing else.

UPDATE Jun-27-2010:
Broke this out with four players. Quite good, although the ending was briskly upon us. I like the mechanism for choosing the playing order. I like how thieves are poised to do the most damage from first OR last position. I like how you get two card actions, and have to replace one of them, so an action you like a lot can stay out as long as you want it to. I like how replaced actions go away and have to be fished out using a Refresh card. I like using Conservation to create combos. Much to like here. Raising rating to 8.

RATING: 7.5
Quite a high rating for the first impression (2 plays, 3 player), but the game really exceeded my expectations, even after reading the rules, I wasn't sure how it would play. The game seems like a German take on Citadels: less cut-throat and crazy, but more planning and elbow pushing. Given how I like Citadels, this one is a good take on that style of interactive second-guessing euros. Also the game feels "deep", meaning there's more game than there are rules.

I've bought it for my GF, as she likes the (graphic) style of Cuba, but I'm not so fond of the gameplay and because she likes building games (which this is actually not). She liked it.  Even though its a Dutch version (hey, it was 10 eur).  

Note to publishers: had I known this game was not designed by Cuba's author but by inventor of Edel, Stich und Reich I would have tracked it down much much sooner. (Makes no sense this being paired with Cuba).

[2 plays] This was a wonderful 2 player game and I'd like to try it with more. The action selection card system is very nice and brain burning. The confrontational elements are interesting, but beware if some players don't go in for that sort of play.

It's an exercise in pure chaos.  One part Citadels one part Basari, none of the charm of either.  In Citadels you can get punched in the face a couple of times, but you are building up an engine to work with, there is a story arc to the game and as you play people can make more educated guesses at what you are going for.  With Basari, you intuit people's immediate needs and you flip your guess to what might serve you best, if you fail you still have trading.
 
Here if the stars align you resources that you need are available, the VP card that you need is available and no one screws you out of your goods that turn.  Often times I felt like it was two steps forward then two steps back.  I think it is a dry soulless set collecting point accumulation game made "fun" by a persistent and irritating take that system.

Many people in my group enjoy this, so there must be something worthwhile for other people, but for me everything felt so short term.  There is such a high level of luck with the cube distribution (random pulls from the bag) along with the VP tiles that were available that already I was at my limit. Then you throw in the crazy chaos of simultaneous role selection/turn order, well, I had my fill.

1 play, 2er.

Only a 7 after 1 play, but I'm still thinking about this one -- could easily go up a bit. 

Very clever use of action cards: play 2 to start, then replace 1 each turn. Each card has a number (0-9) and a power. The 2 numbers create a 2-digit number (lower digit always first); players take turns from low-to-high. As you'd expect, the low-numbers have weaker powers as the price for earlier turn order.

Also nice building pool setup: start with 2 random rows of 6 building tiles each; may only build tiles on either end of the rows. Tiles cost some combination of cubes/workers/money, and are worth varying VPs. When a row shrinks to 2 tiles, move them to the edges and fill the row in with 4 new (random) building tiles.

Good player interaction: you see which of their 2 cards each player is discarding each turn, and you've seen what they've played so far (cards in discard pile; do not recycle until down to 2 cards in hand, or use one of the action cards). So you have some information about what they'll be doing next turn. If you can figure out what they want to do next turn, you can play an appropriate response. There are cards which allow you to steal cubes/workers/money from other players, but there is also a protector role ... fun little decisions to make with each card selection!

Good pace, as well: the game can probably conclude in 30-45minutes (VP targets aren't unreasonably high).

My guess, though, is that I'd like this less with more players (where there would be more opportunity for players attacking each other, stealing resources, slowing the game down and making it annoying?).

Geek Santa gave me this game in 2009. 

Played it once with three players. It has nothing to do with Cuba although the resemblances in terms of artwork are more than obvious. I don't like that in a game because it lacks personality. 

The game play itself works pretty well. Characters are very well designed and they seem very well balanced and putted together. A solid medium weight.

UPDATE
Played the game with two players only and I think it's a better game in this format. Some cards don't actually work better with fewer players but the sense of control is much higher than with more than two players and the tactical feeling is really great. A solid option for a two player game IMO.

Si stanno costruendo e ristrutturando molti edifici magnifici per donare a l’Havana, la capitale di Cuba, un rinnovato splendore. I giocatori possono ottenere pesos e materiali da costruzione, assoldare lavoratori, far scendere in campo un architetto, riscuotere tasse, prezzolare furfanti, ostacolare gli avversari o semplicemente fare una siesta protetti dalle proprie guardie del corpo. Havana si distingue per le poche regole ed il meccanismo ingegnosamente semplice che richiede approcci differenti ad ogni partita. Risulterà vincente giocare in maniera intuitiva per adattarsi alle situazioni in perenne evoluzione e riuscire a pianificare a lungo termine. Non esisteranno due partite uguali e, alla fine, la giusta scelta dei tempi determinerà la vittoria!

Excellent game of action management and out-planning your opponents. Very fast. Can be very aggressive depending on how much people use the attack cards.

One complaint is that if turn order comes to a random tie-breaker, it can give a rather unfair advantage to whoever wins.

RATING: 6
Card driven Euro with simultaneous action selections. The idea is to construct buildings (which provide victory points to the player who built them), each requiring different materials in order to do so. Each player has a matching deck of cards and two of these are played to obtain the materials in various ways e.g. take money from the supply, select materials of various colours, steal from an opponent etc. Each turn though one of the cards has to be discarded therefore reducing the choices available. The game is OK, and the ever-diminishing hand of cards requires some strategy and makes that aspect of the game interesting. Overall though the theme of collecting materials to meet building requirements has been done so many times, the result of which being that 'Havana' feels too derivative to be memorable.

I like the changing of one of your actions every round and the tie-in to player order within the round.

Some frustration factor in trying to accumulate resources only to have them stolen, or cast out of the game, or someone else swooping in to build the building that you had been targeting. But, overall is entertaining.

Might be better to adjust each turn's production rather than the VP requirements when changing number of players.

An interesting game of blind bidding, but much more forgiving than most (you'll get to do most of the actions you select even if another player has selected the same action, albeit sometimes you'll receive fewer resources). The hand-management aspect of Havana is the truly interesting part ... which cards to play, which to cover up and when to worry about a low number combination to ensure taking your actions early. The game length is both a plus and a minus: many players will like that Havana plays very quickly (well under a half hour) but others will bemoan the game's lack of depth. For me, it's a game I'll gladly play if requested, especially given how quick it is, but it's not a game I'm going to rush out to acquire.

Besides the gorgeous Michael Menzel artwork, the only thing that Havana has in common with Cuba is its lack of natural rhythm.  With an ever-changing turn order, Havana is the greater offender.

Continuing the fine 2009 tradition of branding unrelated games after their predecessors to suggest a relationship that doesn't actually exist. Friedemann made the savvy move of branding Factory Manager as a member of the Power Grid line despite its being an otherwise distinct entity, and now Eggertspiele has done the same thing by branding Havana as a successor to Cuba (which particularly makes sense in a year when Cuba is getting an expansion). What doesn't make sense is why Cuba would get an expansion or why branding something with the Cuba imprimatur would be worthwhile given that Cuba is a perfectly mediocre game. Nonetheless, Reinhard Staupe's (designer of the fantastically amusing Der Plumpsack, reprinted in the U.S. by Playroom as Sherlock) newest hand/resource management game has joined the family alongside Michael Rieneck and Stefan Stadler's 2007 creation (best known for The Pillars of the Earth). Havana is a game of playing role cards to gather resources and spend those resources to purchase buildings worth victory points. The only thing it offers in an attempt to stand out is a clever turn order mechanism by which the combined numbers on your role cards for a given turn determine the turn order (which significantly impacts the resources available when your turn comes around). I found the game fairly mundane and unmemorable, but inoffensive and fast for what it's worth. In a year when many games have impressed me with their high quality or shockingly poor quality, Havana stood out for its mediocrity (and for that I suppose it belongs in the Cuba family).

One play, Essen 2009. Didn't enjoy this, and would avoid playing again.  One issue I had was the combat mechanism, which is an automatic loss for a player with fewer combat points on their revealed cards - or nearly automatic, since that they may have a card in hand to add to their defence. However since a player can only use one hand card in a turn, they then become predictable prey to the rest of the table.

Vicious little role-choosing game, where you collect money, workers, and certain colour cubes to buy buildings for VP's. Lots of interaction as you can steal from your opponents. Neat twist that one of the two roles you use this turn is new, and one is left over from last turn. Also, once a role goes into your discard pile, it can be difficult to retrieve it.

There are some neat things that this game does with the way you pick your role cards, the way that future role cards can affect turn order, and how the roles work based on how you fall in the turn order.  It feels like a race game, since it's the type of game where the first to X points wins (as opposed to "play X turns, and whoever has the most points wins," which doesn't feel like a race to me).  I wouldn't mind playing it again, but I probably wouldn't ask to play it.

For the first time I played, I loved it right the way. Complex bussines when u try to overtake you oponnents being the last to play, but sometimes it was the key point to succeed.

Hm...this one is difficult to rate. It has a neat mechanism but feels way too random to be really fun.

The box could be smaller. Like the artwork. Simple game to play. Really like games where pick a role and love the action that pick two roles to start and change one thereafter and what you pick determines turn order. Can't wait to play it again.

RATING: 8
A fun filler that is easy to explain and easier to play.  A bit chaotic, but ok given the playtime.  Fair number of choices packed into a tight little package.

simple and fast game but with a very nice way of using action cards. probably not exceptionally varied or strategic or deep, but a good filler

One of the simplest, most down to earth Euros you'll find. It has character selection in it, which is a bonus for me. Very simple VP system. Decent gateway game that reminds me of the light heartedness of Thurn & Taxis. Probably because the artwork is mostly brown, but what can I tell you.

I didn't get this one or my friends are smarter than I am. The system rewards out thinking your opponents because turn order is based on your card play each turn. The cards have different actions. I could never get the cards in the right order. I played twice and would play again, if asked.

The '8' is from one play, but it seems like a game that is fully grasped after a few minutes of play.

There is a good amount of strategy to it, and it should be a 30 minute game once everyone is acquainted with it.  It is nothing particularly new, but the way the desirability of going first or last changes in the 2 phases of the turn is well designed.  There is only a small element of chance, and the rest of the time you either make or break your own own destiny in Havana.

this to Cuba as San Juan to Puerto Rico...at least in theme connection, it's a fun action card game, some of the take-that actions can hurt at the wrong moment...

Really clever game. Shines brighter with more players. Nice end of the evening type game.

Pure role selection mechanics. Great gameplay with lots of interaction. I hope it plays well with two.

-- edit --

I rather play it with 3 than 2 - then there is more interaction between selected roles. Chaos in this game is something I can stand but many of my coplayers didn't - Sold.

The game is extremely dry

Un muy buen filler, bastante original, con caos, bluf y estrategia al mismo tiempo. Tiene bastante azar, pero se deja jugar muy bien.

I didn't like thiS game, the box is 90% wasted space. It should have been a card game and not this big ass box.

The game itself is light, forgettable and a lot of the materials are worthless (debris). I have now given it to neighbours who have kids thAt might enjoy the game more than I did as I could not wait to get shot of it.

Too expensive for what it is and the compartible size of the box compared to components really frustrated me. But I can see this being a simple mobile game

For a game with such a short play time, this has a tremendous amount of tactical decisions.  What little randomness there is mostly affects all players equally, at least if they are playing well.  The only exception being the starting goods.

RATING: 3
It's quite the blind action selection, cancel-each-other-out sort of game, despite it having some cool mechanisms in it.  Almost entirely not to my tastes, but if your family enjoys action cancellation, it would probably make a good family game for you.

The ratio of decision-making to game weight is quite good.

Lekka, łatwa i przyjemna. Wiele osób zarzuca losowość tej grze. Ja natomiast świetnie się przy niej bawię. Polecam.

RATING: 7
For those that enjoy special powers and games with rules-bending characters, this is a fun offering where timing and strategy are more important than other games of the same kind (such as Citadels).

++ Components are very nice and functional, as is the artwork.

+  The game plays quickly and has an excellent hand-management element.

-  The theme is not very robust, or exciting.

-- For what's included in the box, the cover price here is unacceptable.

Puedes usar 2 de los 13 roles en cada ronda. Los roles que tapes no los recuperarás hasta que te queden 2 cartas en la mano. Ellos indican tu iniciativa y permiten obtener los materiales y dinero necesatios para construir los edificios que hay en la mesa y que son la manera de obtener PV. [FR]

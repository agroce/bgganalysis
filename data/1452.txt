RATING: 6
Seems an okay game for two, although there are probably better point-gathering card games. The problem from my side of the deck was that once you set the hand you were chasing (which was about 1/3 of the way though the deck of 150 cards), the game boiled down to draw-discard until you or your opponent gets the card you need, which was kind of meh. Still, the hand building was fun, and I liked the convoluted credit-to-point scoring method.

Mediocre. I want to love it, but I can't.

RATING: 8.5
Great Mah Jongg varient card game and one of the best set collection card games. Great 2 player game but supports more just as nicely. The scoring is interesting, and more complicated than Mah Jongg, in that you can come back from a scoring deficit by coming up with some of the more complicated, higher scoring hands. If you like set collection games then give this one a try. With 4 or more players the game can get a bit more strategic if you keep an eye out for "Chow" and "Pung" claims since you can skip players using these plays.

If you like Mahjong, you'll like this, esp. if you often have fewer than 4 players. It's basically the identical game, but with cards and different scoring (though the scoring could easily be applied to full Mahjong as well). Two players is definitely not as fun as the original, but it's a suitable replacement.

1 learning game (2p)- Maybe I'm mentally ossified from decades of trick taking games, but learning this was a bit humbling for me. So I'm humble about rating it. I don't know how much luck is a factor. I think there's more to it then Rummy. I'm curious to see how it would play with 3 or 4p where speed-claiming the discards out of turn becomes a factor. Shocking update - was this my unknowing first game of Mah Jong? Gasp!

Components: Beautiful cards, with suits that are easy to distinguish, despite all the different types and colors. Color-blind friendly.

Experience: Tense, capricious set collection. The many different ways to score have me scratching my head, trying to find the best way to play a hand, but also having to decide how risky a stance to take, especially if I'm already behind. I don't yet see all the possible credits as they appear in my hand (especially from Nothing Connects), but the restrictive set rules (with suits never cross-pollinating) helps. My favorite Rummy game.

I first picked up this game in the early 80's strictly based on a GAMES magazine review that recommended it for the rules if nothing else. One of my employees had brought me a Mah Jongg set from a trip to China and of course there were no rules. Well my Mah Jongg set has been rarely used but my cards are worn so bad they need replacing. The rule book is very well written and introduces the rules slowly. The way I teach new players is to add a new section every round. After one game everyone knows how to play. The game itself is just a supped up game of Rummy (or probably Rummy is a simplified version of Mah Jongg) but I think much more fun. In the early days we used to play for a penny a point which added a spice to the game; after all, Mah Jongg is a gambling game. The biggest advantage of Mhing is the convenience of the cards--after all, those Mah Jongg tiles are just too hard to hold, let alone fan out so you can see them.

Mah Johgg the card game.  The game basically comes down to either trying to go out as fast as possible (for low points), or trying to build up your hand into something that scores well ... however somebody else goes out by then!  The clunky tactile play of real Mah Jongg is much more appealing.

Picked this up at a thrift store for $1.  Bought it for the card holder but then realized it was essentially Mah Jong with cards.  The cards are in great condition except I'm missing two of the 5-dots.  I'll have to keep my eyes open for another one in the thrift stores.
Turns out this is fun to play two-player with regular mah jong tiles.  Although we play without wild/jokers and give 1 credit for a kong and 2 credits for a kong of honors.

[countless plays] A favorite of many years' standing.  This is based on Mahjong, but since I have yet to fulfill my dream of learning/playing Mahjong, I can't compare them.  But Mhing is very groovy, and is the rare card game that plays well with 2 people.  I've played most with 3-5; with higher numbers there's a different dynamic, in which people get skipped a lot. It's not bad, just different.  Definitely a game with higher scores and faster play as the players become more experienced.

Thrift store find. After my first partial game I am delighted with the play of Mhing!  This game has a much more sophisticated game play than cribbage and gin rummy.  I want to play this one again soon, and hopefully sometime with multiple players.  As it happened, Mhing lead me to Mah Jong but the scoring system of Mhing is really very good, especially when the number of players doesn't happen to be four.  My wife and I play Mhing using a Vietnamese set that has eight flowers and 8 jokers.  We arrange the tiles in a 19x8 block and draw from the perimeter.

We also require five credits to go out, not including flower credits!

11-16-2010- Received this hilarious trade request:

"""
I have to offer 1 TOTALLY MINT shrink wrap sealed Suntex Mhing Game...
I sold one in December last year for £55 on ebay... hence I KNOW it's got value... and highly collectable in its sealed unplayed state.
I recognise however, that Agricola alone is far heavier than a box of cards... therefore my suggestion is to trade the games... whilst I would pay for postage to the uk.
What are your thoughts?
Best regards, "some anonymous BGG user"

Game(s) From Genre_Fad

currently copies of Mingh are available on BGG within the US for $6 to $20.
So I ended up passing on the offer to send ~$125 MSRP (I paid the pre-order price for Agricola) of games to Wales (even though I would not have had to pay for the shipping.)
I will have to live with my decision...

RATING: 5
Simplified Mah-Jongg with playing cards instead of tiles.  Mhing doesn't have the same level of strategic interest as Mah-Jongg, but it's cheaper, more portable, and allows for various numbers of players.  It is possible to play most versions of Mah-Jongg using these cards, although you need a lot of space to lay out the discards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easy to learn variation of Mah Jongg.  I like to play with normal MJ tiles rather than the supplied cards, I enjoy the clicking of tiles rather than holding 13 or 14 cards in my hand :-)  It's easy to learn by, as suggested in the rules, omitting some of scoring combinations and adding combinations each game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8

I have never played a game where you accumalte credits and then turn the credits into points. So it is kind of hard to explain scoring to family and friends. The cards use the artwork from your typical Mah Jong tiles. Try to explain that the game is like rummy and then tell them that only runs of three are allowed and three of a kinds then finishing your hand off with a pair for a total of 14 cards to lay down. 

Only about 12 or so ways to earn credit lead to interesting choices are what cards to keep and what to discard. When playing with 3 or more people anyone can take the discard and then they become first player. Also to note that if you take a a card from the discard pile then you must play it in front of you. You can not place the card from the discard pile into your hand to keep it for later, it must be played. You also do not have to lay down any cards from your hand unless you have picked up a discarded card. So you can have some secrets from your opponents.
A better verison of rummy without a doubt. 
Once a person can understand that it is similar to rummy and with a few hands played they will be hooked.


---original comment---Uses mah jong tiles on playing cards. The best of the rummy games. Plenty of strategy. Small learning curb. Fun game.

Based on one play; four players.  We only played two rounds.  Similar to Gin Rummy/Rummy 500.  You really need to play a few hands to get to know the cards and the scoring possibilities.  It's supposed to have some similarities to Mah-jong.  It's not worth the effort for me.  If I'm going to play this type of game I would much rather spend the energy playing Gin Rummy/Rummy 500 even just for the nostalgia factor.  I don't care to play this again.  I bumped this up from a two because it doesn't belong in the same category as my other two's.

This is like the hand-held card version of Mahjong. Somehow it has a different feel to Mahjong--more competitive, and a lot more annoying when others win. Like Mahjong, the rounds pass quickly and it's addictive. Great in terms of portability.

Relaxed, offbeat rummy game. Nothing especially great, but nothing especially jarring either. Awesome pick for a social, relaxed get together. 

Update: Lowered rating to 5. There really isn't that much control on the outcome, especially towards then end when you only have 5 cards left in your hand. Deciding which one to keep/discard (unless you can card-count) is a crapshoot. There is absolutely not enough information to make any kind of informed decision at all. Otherwise, still kind of fun in a social, light kind of way.

Mhing is essentially Mah-jonng with cards.  The nice thing is that Mhing can take a variable number of players and includes wild cards.   Always tough decisions such as whether to continue for a really high scoring hand or just end the round by scoring an easy to achieve low scoring hand.

A fantastic game that takes its direction from Mahjong but allows 3 to play. I really like the many combos that can be made. My only warning is that it can take a good dozen plays to get to grips with the possible combos. These initial games can take some time to play if all the players are not fully focused and this can leave a bad initial impression. Perserverance will be rewarded though as the game moves quite quickly when all players understand it.

I enjoyed the game. It plays a little like a rummy game, except to draw the discard, you have to call for it and it has to be played to the table.  I like that it is a challenge not just to go out, but to have sufficient credits to score in a meaningful way.

Prefer it over regular Mah Jongg. I prefer removing the Mhing cards when playing with 2-3 players. The scoring can feel somehat obscure at first, but after a couple of plays it adds some spice to the game. I prefer letting all players score though, not only the one getting Mhing (We let the player getting Mhing recieve a bonus of 3 units). That way it's just not a race to get Mhing.

This is an older game in the family of Rummy card games and is a simplified version of Mah-Jongg (1850) where cards are used instead of tiles. Basically, you have a deck of cards with three suits and you create 3-card sets of identical cards or 3-card runs. However a few types of special cards (Dragons, Winds, Flowers, and Wild) are thrown into the mix, and together with the elaborate scoring system add some strategy to the game and make it interesting. But all in all you mainly have to rely on luck of the draw for the cards you need. I think it is best as a 2-player game.

Essentially just a Mah-Jong set on cards. They're lovely cards though, and I definitely prefer the Mhing scoring to the Zung Jung MJ I learned the other day. It's based on combinations of smaller units rather than patterns of entire hands and there are only a couple of special hands to learn.

Rules are very different from Mah Jong.  But you could play real Mah Jong with these cards, if you have the rules and you do not want to pay out for a real set of Mah Jong.  Recommended book is Teach Yourself Mah Jong by David Pritchard.

Wonderfully produced. 'Games played' is for actually whole plays to a score of 500, which has been taking the missus and I at least three hours spread over 2-3 days per game.

I have a set of Mah jongg cards but never play with them as we don't have instructions on how to play the card version and there is no where on the net that I can find the instructions for the card version. 

I have played Mhing with the Mah Jongg cards once and the game group really wasn't into it. I haven't yet played it with my current game group but I hope to sometime. I enjoyed the game but the game groups that I have been in just don't seem to like trick taking games.

RATING: 5
Have only played 2er.

A rummy variant: 
4 x 1-9 (3 suits) = 108 cards
4 x 4 winds ('honors': N, S, E, W) = 16 cards
4 x 3 dragons ('honors': red, green, white) = 12 cards
Wilds x 6 = 6 cards
Flowers x 8 = 8 cards
------------------------
150 cards

- Start: 13 cards per player; any Flowers are melded and replaced with another card. 
- Goal each hand: go 'out' with 4 sets (triplets or sequences of 3) and one pair = 14 cards
- Turn: draw a card (if Flower: meld it and draw again), then either go out OR discard.
- Anyone can take the card just discarded; if >1 person wants it, priority of player going out > triplet > sequence. If discard is taken, must use it to meld a set (not pair, unless going out). If not going out, that player discards a card and play continues to THEIR left.
- Points
--- Only the person to go out scores
--- Get CREDITS based on what you went out with. More credits --> more points (exponential growth, sort of)
--- Play to 500 points (for example)

The game title is not to be confused with the similar word in Italian.

Mhing is an oriental themed card game that is loosely based on Mah Jong. This one has held me in a vice grip ever since I purchased it way back in the 80's.  While I enjoy it in any format ( sitting,  standing,  or hopping on one foot  ),  this is a true 10 as a two player game.

There are only 3 "suits", with honor cards and flowers, and that's it.  You might think this would make for only a  few scoring choices,  but oh,  you would be so overwhelmingly wrong.  There is a myriad of choices, a veritable potpourri of intertwining combinations that are too numerous to mention here.  Suffice it to say,  this is one deck of cards that packs a healthy wallop. 

Every hand presents so many options on just how to proceed - and often you will have to change tactics mid-stream when you decide to cut bait as the hand gets a little long in the tooth.  The reason behind this is that only the player who goes out first scores.  Even though you may have been chasing a killer hand that would have yielded hundreds of points,  best you go out with a few,  thereby preventing your opponent from possibly scoring big.

If you game with two,  you owe it to yourself to check this one out.  After all,  it comes with my highest recommendation.....

Easy to pick up, once you've played a couple of hands.  Recognizing the credit patterns becomes more natural the more you play, and it seems less unintuitive.  The different ways to score credits allows for a lot of strategy, but I felt like there were too many hands where it was entirely up to the luck of the draw, especially with the flower cards.  I think I was trying too hard to get larger, harder-to-get matches, though, instead of just trying to go out, since whoever goes out is the only person who scores.  Very intriguing.

A great and very addictive game. It has directly contributed to my newly acquired Mah Jongg obsession. The game itself is closer to American MJ rather than Chinese, Japanese, or Hong Kong MJs; yet it still very enjoyable. Should probably not play with more than 5. We had an 8 player that turned 7, and it went on forever because anyone is allowed to 'chow', just not the player to the right of the discarder. This made for an interesting chaotic variation, but it wore thin quickly. (For greater than 5, I would suggest a house rule on limiting 'chow'ing.) I have later played with 4 which was excellent.

2-Player and Group games are really two seperate entities.  Great either way, but strategy is required.
Update:
For larger groups, it's best to institute a house rule, related to the number of 'credits' a hand is required to have, to go out.  The rules state zero, and only the person who goes out gets any points.  With more people, that would make for a LONG, aggravating game.  Try three.  Four would even be fine, as there's  entire categories for 3 and 5-credit hands.  Just something to give you a chance to make a decent hand, without having to be dealt it.

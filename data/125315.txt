An area control game where you drop your cards from head height. Novel, a bit random, a bit of fun.

Lovely game, with a great concept. Swift, and hard to take very seriously, but all the same there's some distinct skill and strategy in this game. That said, luck can cause huge point swings, and the first player is at a very distinct disadvantage, so it's far from a perfect game.

I don't get this game. People are going nuts about it as the new dexterity hotness, but I get nothing special from it. You randomly drop a card, hope it lands in the way you'd like, and usually it doesn't so you end up hurting your potential score. Then the scoring is so frustratingly tedious, it takes 4 people 10 minutes to sift through everything, which is longer than the gameplay took. I just don't get the love, because there are countless other dexterity options that are better. Frankly I'd rather play Jenga, because at least knowing who won and lost is obvious when the game ends. I do appreciate that this is a small box, extremely portable, which is rare for most dexterity games. However I just don't see myself wanting to bring it along. There were 4 of us who played and no one got any thrill from the game. It was simply, drop, drop, drop, drop, etc. No shouts of excitement, no held breath in anticipation, it just happened. It's like drinking water, sure you quench your thirst, but it does nothing for your taste buds.

Yes, it's a stupid game but it's fun!  It's a filler that plays up to 7 and finishes in 20 minutes.  It puts 7 Wonders to shame in how easy it is to teach and it gets people laughing as their cards go slip-streaming as they don't drop it just right.  I very much want to play it with the kids, but I'm honestly enjoying it quite a bit with the adults I'm playing it with.

It's cute for what it is, there is a tiny bit of strategy but if you drop it from a high height it gets a bit tough. It's a pain in the butt to score though and it isn't much of a game for what it is. I never found a good time or reason to play it again, so I auctioned it off.

The best thing about this game is that everyone sucks at dropping cards with precision. There is some strategy by it is mainly a fun activity of area control by dropping cards on the table and capturing green spaces by having the most flowers of your color in the garden.

RATING: 6
A brilliantly simple and fun area majority game!  I went into it not expecting much (although it did look somewhat fun), and ended up being very surprised at just how much fun I ended up having!

Basically, players take turns dropping cards onto the table, hoping they land in such a manner that they connect up areas of flowers in order to score points.  Each player has their own deck of flower cards in their color, with various configurations of green space and white space which can break up the green space.

After all the flower falling is done, each separate contiguous green field is scored.  Whichever player has the most flowers of their color in each field will score points.

It all sounds very stupid, but it's totally not!  There are actually some meaningful decisions to make, and all of the laughing and groaning about awesome flower falls or ones that went awry is really great!  Definitely one to pick up if you have a chance!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It is indeed fun to let your cards fall, try to aim them in the right place and hope they don't spin in the air (they usually don't).

There is, however, a clumping effect. An area that gets contested, starts being worth more and more points due to the flipped cards and whatnot, such that other areas have no impact on the eventual winner.

Also, it's a bit of a silly game. It has me invested enough to say, let's play it again, but not invested enough to say, hey, let's play FlowerFall today.

Quick silly fun. Probably better with beer.

Seems odd that it so heavily advertises that you can play ANYWHERE!! Wouldn't it be incredibly frustrating to play on an uneven surface or anywhere with even a slight breeze?

Vying for control is fun, but can't be taken too seriously. It's too hard to be accurate and everything changes SO MUCH on every turn that it just feels chaotic.

Not bad. Needs beer.

RATING: 6
Hah, this is a very unique game! It’s from the brilliant card game designer Carl Chudyk, who is famous for much heavier card games like Glory to Rome and Innovation. This one is not even close to being such a game – it’s a silly dexterity game with a scoring somewhat reminiscent of the farming scoring in Carcassonne! Basically each player gets a hand of 12 identical cards, each with some green flowers and flowers in their player colors. In turn order, they then drop it from eye-height onto the table! When the game ends, the player with the most visible flowers gets a point for each green flower that is visible (there might be several flower fields due to the rather unstable way players are dropping their cards). 

It truly is an innovative game! Dexterity mixed with an area-majority scoring system which plays in 10 minutes – I have to say that it was actually pretty cool to play twice with 4 players, and I would love to try it again with both 2 and 7 players, and with family and children, just to see how it plays. With 4 it was quite good, although I find there is a relatively significant last player advantage – not impossible to overcome, but unless the first player is extremely good at dropping cards on the table half a meter above the surface, he won’t win, and that’s a shame… That last card of the game can be decisive because you can cover up the cards of the other players (though only with the “frontside” of your card, the one showing your own flowers, which means that you cannot just boost one of your fields with 5 extra flowers); so, as the last player you still need to have a lot of your flowers visible before the last turn. Oh, and that last card can really screw you depending on which one it is; there are some cards with a boarder around your flowers, meaning that it probably won't do anything for you if that's your last card - and that's a design flaw in my opinion.

I have won without being the starting player, but it still rubs me the wrong way. Oh, and concerning the scores, they are never even; one player will score a lot of points on the biggest field! Our first game ended something like 18-6-0-0. Not that it really matters, just something I noticed.

[thing=125315][/thing] is less of a game and more of an activity.  I bought this mainly as I thought the family and non-gamers would like it.  Interestingly they really did not get it.  This, to them, did not fit into the framework of what they perceive as a game.  It was dropping cards on a table.  That, they say, is not a game.  Yet play the game with gamers and I get the reaction that this is an interesting filler with a dexterity element to a card game.    For such a simple game it surprises me that it missed the casual gaming audience so completely yet appealed to the gaming audience.  That, in itself, has given me much food for thought on the concept of a ‘game’ to different people.  For that I must thank Flower Fall.  I have little urge to play it again though.

Flowerfall is a silly game. I mean that in an entirely positive way. Drop cards, create patterns, score points.

I've found that players who are set on strategic play balk at the randomness and the likelihood that other players cards will cover even the simplest of plans. 

I enjoy Flowerfall immensely but I admit that it may be too random for some. Give it a try!

One of the most entertaining dexterity games I've played. Doesn't require much of the players to learn (the rules are exceptionally short), and the game consists of skill in dropping and placing cards.

To master the fall of the flowers is to dominate and subjugate all that oppose you. With their blossoms crushed under your own mighty seed, they will lament their fate--but who else is to blame for their weakness but them?

This is a Chudyk game?!?

Yes, but he has totally left the madcap antics of Innovation and Glory to Rome behind, and gone to a simple yet challengin little dexterity game, with one of the simplest rulesets I own.

There are 4 starting garden cards, each player gets 10 cards with different arrangements of flowers and borders. In turn drop your flower cards from eye-high to merge and claim gardens by linking the starting gardens to more of your flowers- if you can.

That's it; green connects flower beds, white and or table/floor space separates them. When everyone's cards have fallen you have a winner.

This game is a fun, very light-hearted filler, which takes simple components and makes fun with them.

Starting this at a 6.5 after (2) quick 3-player games with the family.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2012)

I kickstarted this game to find it a lot cheaper later :S  But I believe I have an additional terrain card :D so it´s ok.

In my opinion, the box is ugly (although in agreement with the game) so it took me almost a month to bring FlowerFall to the table. Still I played it with 2 and 3 players and it was novel enough but not fun enough. I believe we need more players to really enjoy the game. The art is ok and it serves its purpose.

What I really like is the falling mechanic, it is reminiscent of a MtG card (Chaos Orb I believe) I played a long time ago, also it is very easy to learn and teach. Another plus, the game takes 10 minutes to play.

Its strongest point is that its plays so different than most games and that is refreshing. 

I need to play it again to form a better opinion of the game.

After more plays, I’m still undecided if I should keep it. Flower fall can be fun with the right crows, but my desire to play it again is rather low. I’m only keeping it because it is an unique game in my game collection.

When my home game in California was in it's early stages, we stumbled across this gem.  It's dexterity mixed with a lot of luck as you are dropping cards from eye level onto a table (or possibly floor).  For a few weeks it was the highlight of the game night.  People would talk about it the next day more than any other game.  This game provided an "experience" unlike any other game.  Seeing 5-7 grown men arguing about dropping flowers onto a pile, and hovering over the dropped card to see if it's touching or merely a fraction of a millimeter away from it's closest other card creates a hilarious scene.  I will always have fond feelings about this game and hope I soon find a group of gamers here in Kentucky that can be lighthearted and competitive enough to enjoy this fantastic game.

My group was mixed on this one, but I quite like it. The beginner option (seated at a table) is a good way to learn the game without biffing too many shots -- though even then some easy shots get biffed. It plays quickly, it's easy to teach, and it's unlike any other game I've played. I can see how a group meta would emerge after a few plays, which is neat.

For just being a deck of cards and a tiny rules sheet, there's a surprising amount of fast, fun game here.

The game doesn't stand up to any form of strategy. Once you realize that dropping a card on the 5 flower side is just giving other people points, the game degenerates quickly into vicious fights over small amounts of flowers. Variants with extra starter cards didn't help enough. This is the first game I've owned where no one enjoyed playing it.

You physically drop playing cards with flowers on them onto the table to make flower beds. Highest number of your flowers in the bed scores points.

Probably the most random and pointless game I've played.

RATING: 5
A silly fun dexterity game dropping cards onto the fields of flowers on the playing board.  The game is a bit lucky, but also requires some skill and smart-play.  Either way, the games last 5-8 minutes and are a hoot if you disagree and think they are TOO random.

This dropping of cards sound kind of fun, but its actually pretty bland. Often there are just huge areas (although this seems to have been fixed in the 2nd edition). Overall good for a few laughs, but nothing I would seek out to play. The idea sounds better than it plays imho.

Amusing dexterity game of dropping cards to connect to "farms" like in Carcassonne.  Card dropping was more random vs other dexterity games and more difficult to control, if at all, thus the lower rating.

The glorious, innovative Carl Chudyk does it again! If you haven't seen FlowerFall, it's an area-majority dexterity game in which you drop cards on to a playing surface from head-height. One side of each card has flowers of your personal colour; the other side neutral green flowers. The cards form contiguous areas and you score points for the number of green flowers in each area that you control by having more of your own flowers than anyone else's. Simple and great fun. The strong last-player advantage can be mitigated by playing one game with each player starting and totalling the scores.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A pretty cool Chudyk dexterity card game. It's really unlike anything else out there (minus the inevitable copycats that came out shortly thereafter, of course). You basically drop cards onto a table and try to get majority scoring in your color as the cards overlap and create large connected areas. Chaos ensues as people try to precisely drop their cards to take over a section or reclaim points they badly want/need and fail miserably. It's fun. 

The more the merrier with this one.

--Jul2013-- I suspect I have no poetry in my soul.  But this one left me pretty flat.  I agree that there is strategy; and skill; and there's a game there.  But it's not for me, I think.  While it's entirely conceivable that skilled players could make something cool out of this, I (in contrast) found that it ran randomly and long with beginners - and so getting there from here seems hard.

Interesting idea that is executed quite well.  It's a dexterity game, sure, but it's also just dropping cards onto a table and there's only so much you can do to be "good" at it.  The one gripe I have is that the resulting mess can be a bit difficult to sort through but it's crucial to the game.

It's a 5-10 minute dexterity/area-control game where you drop cards from your personal deck (shuffled; random order) onto the play area (seeded with 2-4 larger cards, depending on player count), trying to create contiguous areas of green grass -- each such area is a "patch". At the end of the game, after everyone has played all their cards, each patch is worth 1 VP per green flower center that is visible in it. The player with the most flowers in that patch scores the full VP. Whoever has the highest total VP wins.

Goofy, silly, with seemingly little control. I would MUCH rather play Beer & Pretzels.

Cute filler that's incorrectly billed as "dexterity" -- the vagaries of where your flower cards drift down to the table (the titular flowerfall) is mostly down to whether you're playing in a drafty room. You can generally hit the target more often than not, weather permitting, so there's some real strategy around what and what not to try and block or cover. The "or not" adds an element of randomness that, like dice rolling, keeps things light and ruins the best laid plans of the master strategists.

For the time it takes, a winning filler. Downsides are the functional but inspiring artwork and what seems like a last-player advantage.

Just a light time filler. Very random. Nothing serious here. I would happily part with it to sweeten a trade or create more shelf space--even though it takes up very little. But I'll also not go out of my way to purge it since it keeps me laughing and smiling when I do play it.

This game was a lot more fun than I thought it would be (I'd gotten it for a friend as a gift, and while I was pretty sure he'd like it, I was pretty sure I wouldn't). There's a lot more strategy involved than I would've guessed (granted, I'd guessed zero, and it's still mostly tactical, but even so...) and it does a good job of being engaging enough to be interesting but not so serious that it's frustrating when you utterly fail at dropping a card. (The most amusing parts were when the cards flipped over in midair.)

I still don't think I'd buy this for myself, but it might be my favorite dexterity game.

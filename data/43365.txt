2010-04-14 (rating 9):

An excellent game. No luck or chance. But lots of interaction.

Some claim that the game is broken because a player may block end of game in some cases. But I do not share that opinion. In my opinion if other players allowed him/her to do that then it is their fault and they do not deserve to win the game.

Also the game is very simple both in rules and in components so it is easy to do it yourself.

RATING: 6
Probably a generous rating.  This is not my cup of tea.  I play solitaire or 2-player and this requires 3.  This is a Euro, which is definitely not my thing.  It also involves a lot of bidding, which is not my thing.

So why did I get it?  Because the town I was born in is on this map as is the town I grew up in, along with the city I currently live and the town I went to college in.  It also has the MKT (Missouri-Kansas-Texas) railroad (Katy, for those of you who know it like I do), so it gets a bonus for all of that.

RATING: 3
Interesting, but the end game doesn't work. There's no real reason to Go West at a cost of $30 plus more $ to fund movement. To get your money back you'd have to make it the western map edge on turn 6 and hope you score the bonus points twice (which is the best you can hope for, and unlikely). 

If the extra trains were free it'd make more sense (since they're part of a "land grant"), but they'd be worth way more in auction dollars to the President of a railroad than his opponents and the Prez would win the bid every time. 

All of this assumes that the extra ten trains may only be placed west of the dividing line; if they can be placed anywhere, the game's entire concept falls apart.

This game gave me a double feeling. It's easy to play and straightforward. On the other hand there is a problem for someone who hasn't start very well. There is no chance for recovery. If you don't earn a lot of money in the beginning, that's not gonna change later in the game.

First Play: Very easy rules but straight off, why isn't there a track to plot the 8 Wall Street actions? Missing this off is a major over sight and not acceptable.

Three new players and it was a game of two halves, the first half was very good. Lots or jostling and trying to out maneuver the opposition. Then it became apparent that most companies wouldn't reach the line and so stagnated just collecting a dividend. The game turned into a churn of pre-determined moves and it became a real chore. 

I'm guessing we played sub optimally and we needed to concentrate on achieving the end game conditions earlier, but we didn't and the game suffered as did our enjoyment.

Needs another play but at this stage I'm very disappointed.

RATING: 5
*very* initial impression:

More static than I would like.  The timing and Wall-Street manipulations have the potential to become interesting, but seem very precarious.

Playtime took a solid two hours after rules; accompanying this is that we neither ended the game, and also it was elongated due to one player hijacking  the two companies with cubes left (only two crossed the Line), and refusing to build them until he could win (by buying all the shares and having a greater income, or by letting all the other players buy shares until he had the most money).

Not sure whether this is problematic, as I am not totally clear that a losing player cannot simply hijack things if they won't win, causing the game to not finish (i.e. stalemate, he can't get enough money to win; he refuses to finish the game).  This is perhaps a simple thing to look out for and be able to avoid, but in simply trying to not break the game, a player may self-atari.


2nd play:

I decided to play the asshole tonight.  No one could fully defend against it, but we decided in the end that such playstyle is that of a teenager's, and one that if you are placed into such a situation, you should suck it up for the sake of the game.  Not convinced that is a great thing, that one must play to *not* break the game in a common situation.  Not sure how much I'm liking this one.  Will play further, certainly, and perhaps things will improve.  The 6.5 is reflective of that hope; if it proves wrong, it will likely become a 4.

3-4-10:

Played a "normal" game of this tonight, lost badly due to miscalculation.  Was still the best experience of KP I've had yet.  Would like to explore this more in a shorter amount of time than the 6 months it took to get to the table again.

I really enjoyed the feel of this one as the companies raced for the west!  Our game ended with none of the companies making it west before 5 of the companies ran out of cubes since all the companies ended up being well funded by various players, but I can see this one playing out in several different ways.  

In the end, I won due to buying early and often on a lot of early shares while the other players were more tight fisted with their money, allowing me to receive dividends on the first 4 companies by very early in the game.  In a game where dividends are your income, I figured getting those early shares would pay off big.  I'm not sure how that would pay off with more players being looser with their cash though.  

I also really enjoyed the Wall Street round, where the company paying the highest dividend in the past round is forced to auction off a share.  That really added an interesting layer of sometimes wanting to control a company's growth to keep it from getting watered down by unnecessary investors.  Good stuff!

11-2011: okay. That was a bit overenthusiastic. But, despite the wicked company imbalances, it is still very interesting.

03-2011: My 10 rating is a plea, a demand, a cry for help. This game stood in the shadows as B&O, its Winsome stable-mate in the 2009 got all the attention. Come back to Kansas. Give it a chance. You must play this game. More than once. More than twice. Embrace it for what it is: an epic battle for the soul of the game itself.

There is no speeding or slowing the clock like in the sleek and spartan Wabash. Here, the clock gallops or freezes altogether with a quorum. There is no extortion or turn-order opportunism like in Preussische Ostbahn. There is just (near) total control over what you can control. And (almost) no control over what you can't.

The levers and buttons in this game are so totally different from any other Winsome - or any other game - that I've played. The tensions are many and unique. The decisions are big and let you know it. They demand attention, commitment, and, above all, courage. They are luckless gambles where everything - everything! - is at stake. From the ultra-fragile opening to the mid-game positional jockeying to the excruciating questions of share issuance and purchasing and cube usage that start to reach a deafening crecendo somewhere around Witchita.

Is the game broken? Who cares. Shatter it. Enjoy the crash. Enjoy the jagged shards.

12-2009: After first play, this gets a very volatile 8. Room to go up if the game-end control and incentive manipulation gets as interesting as it seems it might. Room to go down if the game-end lock-up issues materialize in a way that is insuperable . And, if insuperable, are they unavoidable? (mini-update: Bohrer says play with 8 Wall Streets if you feel the end game locks up.) Perhaps the game is just fragile and requires players to recognize the danger of an income-rich, cash-poor player getting control of enough companies to lock the game. Much more thinking and playing needs to be done... And that is a very good thing.

RATING: 8
Extremely good first impression based on one play with three players. In Kansas Pacific, players fund companies' growth and attempt to secure outside investment on unfair/opportunistic terms and timing.

David V.H. Peters demonstrated with Age of Scheme that he can design an interesting first 50% of a game; with Kansas Pacific he has shown that he can design an amazing second half. Our first impression is that there isn't a lot going on until the rails hit the second mapsheet. I'll be happy to find that we're wrong, though, and we'll certainy be playing this often enough to find out.

In Kansas Pacific's awesome second half, players desperately try to control when the game will end and on what terms. They must make huge gambles in both the forced and optional auctions, threaten to hold the game ransom or crash into the end at speed, and have a very good idea of what each other player wants to happen.

Track building does not have to be nearly as linear as current photos suggest--as with Wabash Cannonball, if this game catches on at all we will see much more sophisticated patterns.

I am clearly very enthused about this new game--with any luck, the subtle early game will reveal itself to be as interesting as the balls-to-the-wall second half.

RATING: 8
This is a weird one. I can't get my head around initial company valuation, let alone execute a good strategy. Short term alliances, president usurpation threats, game ending speedups and even more shenanigans. It's a fragile game, so if players are not well versed, they can easily kingmake. Still, I am happy with both the Winsome and the Queen versions. Lovely.

RATING: 7
Kansas Pacific is another evolution of the Wabash Cannonball lineage of games. Of the existing games (Wabash, Preussiche, Gulf, B&O) it is most similar to Wabash with elements of Prairie Railroads: Kansas thrown in for good measure.

The game features 6 companies with 6 stocks each and identical numbers of cubes. Everyone starts on the east side of the board. There are incentives for going west including buying extra cubes at one spot, and being able to actually "Go West" formally with your company which gives it an income boost and shuts it down, leaving it to just collect income for the rest of the game.

The game flow is different than most of the games, more like B&O. Each company operates in order. The president gets to choose whether another share is issued, and then can build track. The track building is moderately tight as each hex can only have two companies present in it. The board is covered with cities and towns to increase income, with the towns decreasing in value if 2 companies are present. Once the construction of track is done, the current income is divided by the current number of shares issued and dividends are paid and marked on the board. After all 6 companies have operated, then Wall Street issues one share of the highest paying share for bid. Other than WS, the share issues are all president determined choices. The game continues until X number of companies run out of track, cross a line boundary on the western part of the map, or Go West. Another, timed end game condition of 8 Wall Streets has also been added as an option by John Bohrer, and seems like a good idea to prevent end game shenanigans in some cases.

The game is quick playing, and somewhat more linear than the other recent Winsome titles. The companies barely have enough cubes to get across the line that allows them to purchase extra cubes, so they have to plot a fairly straight path to get where they're going, unless the intent is just to use them to gather income, which isn't bad either. Some of them end up being boxed in based on track building, but for the most part this seems to be a game of timing when to build out a lot, when to issue shares, and when to either take on friends or hog a company for yourself. The amount of cash that flows into the game from the beginning seems gaudy when one is used to more spartan early games like Wabash, but it's necessary because of the often high track costs as companies are allowed to blast across the landscape very quickly if they are willing to pay the higher costs that are charged when one wants to buy, say 6 track in a given round instead of 3.

Overall it's a decent little game. Nice for an 1hr20 diversion or so. If it was longer, and I don't see how it could be, I wouldn't like it nearly as much. Currently I'd rank it about on par with Preussiche for my tastes, which means it's good, I wouldn't mind playing it, and I might be specifically in the mood for it once in a while. I think it's probably the weakest of the extant cube rails games (including Age of Scheme as well) for my tastes though. The share issuing decisions are the main twist, and they don't strike me as being as interesting as the hooks that are present in the other games in the series. There's certainly room for depth and I'm sure the game will get some repeat play, but not my favourite of the series.

Another game of investing in railroad companies, trying to make more money than everyone else. Kansas Pacific looks more linear than, say, Chicago Express, after the first plays. For the moment, I am unsure how any company can make Going West work successfully, though. To get there you need to forego a lot of the early income opportunities, and it's hard to envision the Going West bonus making up that difference.

It's early times, though, and there are quite a few questions left to be answered.

This is a Winsome title hidden in a Queen box, which means it has high strategic characteristics in a well-produced package. Winsome should do this more with Queen. Excellent train game. Getting out west seems harder because it's so tempting to crowd around the eastern cities in Kansas.

RATING: N/A
An interesting cube railway game, Kansas Pacific seems like a truncated version of the other Winsome Railway stock games, owing to its limited supply of cubes and the great length of Kansas where the game is played.  On a 1st solo 4-player game, I found that one bidder quickly found an advantage by rapid expansion to Wichita, treating the Frisco as a money generator and then enlarging upon it with ownership of the Rock Island Line to leverage both ends of the game round. I like the flavor and the speed of the game, but don't think I can honestly assign a rating yet- I need more plays for a better feel of the game and it's strategies.

The "broken" endgame isn't anything you can't solve with a little common sense (if the stalling player can't alter the end result anymore you should just call it a game). But KP can overstay it's welcome because of that. The "Wall Street" forced auction mechanism is neat and creates some interesting play, because a share of the biggest dividend payer (not the company with the biggest income) is auctioned at round end. Overall there are better cube rails games for my tastes though.

One has to be careful as in Wabash about spending money for stocks when game end conditions are close.  The end of the game can occur very suddenly although you can have some control over that aspect if you can get the president's role in two of the first five train companies.  Appears to be a fairly quick playing game as our learning game took 1 hour 20 minutes although I suppose I could see where it could go longer if someone or two makes the game go the full 8 Wall Street rounds.

I think there's probably room to play this game once everyone is so many games deep and can value the companies properly.  Until then though it's not particularly interesting, unlike e.g. Chicago Express and German Railways that have more obvious and intriguing hooks.  I'd like to play with each player count at least once but I think devoting time to KP would mainly be a slog.

Based on one play: This game falls in with Chicago Express and American Rails, but is actually quite different in strategy. Sure you accumulate shares of a railroad company and then can control its track placement however in Kansas Pacific only the current president can issue new shares so the strategy is much different. You can also race tot he end of the board to get a bonus payout or just hit different cities to get points. Well worth a try if you like the others in the series.

Clear member of the "cube-rails" series.  I liked many aspects, such as the track cost mechanism & the land grant.  Unfortunately we had weird stalemate type situation at the end of my 1st game.  Only the guy in 4th place had power to end it; the game could have gone on forever & effectively that left him as kingmaker due to different income levels. I can see that working in a variety of ways, but it really makes things tedious at the end. Unfortunately there is no "timer" mechanism to avoid the I will just wait this out for 30 turns while I gain $1 per turn on my opponents.  It probably improves with more plays (e.g. avoid stalemate).  Also one needs to know the value of the different companies for the game to work; it is probably broken without this knowledge.  For example, brown is great at the start, but fades late.  Unless one handicaps the person wanting brown (i.e. make them pay lots for the share), they will pull away since the initial  dividend payout is so high & the late fade will be less important.

Kansas Pacific is an interesting entry into the Cube Rails series.  It bears some similarities to previous games while still having its own unique feel.  It's probably about as heavy as Wabash Cannonball.

In KP rather than players taking turns, the train companies take turns.  The player that owns the most stock in a company immediately becomes its president and takes the turn.  The president determines where the company will expand and then the company pays out dividends based on its current stock price.  Being president of well funded and well "cubed" companies (i.e. they have many tracks available) is vital for controlling the game tempo as is getting the company moving west.  When making opening moves players have to keep these things in mind.

Since it's companies, not players, that take turns there's no penalty for over investing in too many companies.  This makes vying for company control an interesting part of the game.

Over all, KP is a pretty fun game with players racing their companies West while while fighting for the best routes, maintaining and gaining control of key companies, properly diversifying and increasing stock value in carefully measured increments.

An interesting continuation down the Wabash branch of games. The majority shareholder drives each RR west for more income. See my preview here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/426082

A surprisingly fun game. I had read many comments about the endgame being broken and ruining the game. However, I don't feel that is really much of an issue. I view it more as a player issue. One needs to pay attention to the gamestate at all times and be looking out for any players that could be gearing up to the hold the game hostage for the win. This "feature" adds a little more to think about with this one, but it can cause the game to run a little long. 

Ultimately, I am happy to own it after one play with three players.

All of us enjoyed it and are looking forward to playing it again, hopefully with more players next time!

Crazy tactical investment game.  I wanted to like it much more than I actually did.  There are some great ideas here, but the game has no discernible end game.  A player can shore themselves up as President of middling companies and keep the game going until they surpass the leader or until it behooves them to pull the plug, all others are at the mercy of this player.  

That means if you buy in big to the West Coast connection your investment is more determined by the withholding player than the work that you did.  

If you outbid them on anything they want then you have used your money and they can end the game.  Hmmm, extortion is cool in games, but this is just awkward.

I'd try this with more to see if it works, but I don't think that I will play it again with three.

Lots of nice ideas, but it outlasted its welcome.  It feels like it is still in development.  

I should also point out that while this is one of the nicest looking cover pieces that Winsome has put out, that contrary to that, this is perhaps the noisiest, visually irritating board.

1 play, 3er.

A very interesting expansion of the Wabash line of games. Here, though, companies take turns (with players owning shares in various companies). There's great incentive to build westwards, but also to just muck around in the east and snag the high-income locations to earn cash (most cash wins the game). Interesting decisions during the game about where to build, whether to race out west or not, etc. As usual, also need to decide which companies to invest in, of course. Our game had some weirdness at the end -- seemed like the game could drag on almost forever -- but I suspect that was simply because we were all new to the game; expect the end to be a question of timing, with players jockeying to control when the game actually ends. 

Looking forward to more plays!

--- Summary ---
There are 6 companies with 6 stocks each, the same number of cubes (barely enough to reach the Land Grant line), and specific starting locations. They always take turns in order. Start the game by auctioning 1 share (and company control) in each company. On their turn, the company can first issue a share to raise money (auction a share, if available). Then it may build up to 8 (?) track by placing cubes in hexes, with costs increasing with number built -- but max 2 companies/hex. Building into towns, cities, etc. improves company income. If you cross the Land Grant line, may spend $30 to buy 10 more cubes; just barely enough to reach the western side of the board = Go West: all unsold shares and unused cubes of the company are removed from the game, and it adds $20 or $30? to its income for the rest of the game. Then pay dividends per share, Wabash style: income / outstanding shares, rounding up. After all the companies have moved, Wall Street auctions a share in the company that paid the highest dividend. The game ends if all 5 cubes have no cubes left, or 4 have crossed the Land Grant line, or 3 have Gone West. Most money wins.

The game itself is not bad, but i don`t see a difference between other train games. If your not a hardcore train gamer and you know for example Chicago Express you don`t need to play Kansas Pacific.

It is growing on me.  I'm not sure if it is brilliant or just opaque.

This one could go higher, but I would need to play it more first.

Very mathy game. It lacks a way for a company to lose value. I don't see a way where you do not want to buy every stock that comes up for auction. The graphic design of the different cities should had been more clear (some of the different type of cities look alike).

This is the base game, from Winsome Games Essen 2009 set.

Definitely has an endgame problem, and even without that, there's nothing here that hasn't been done better elsewhere.

The Players do not take turns - the *Railroads* do.

Nice "light"(compared to 18xx) railroad game with stocks. Simple yet cutthroat.

A fun game.  After playing B&O several times this was a welcome return to the smaller scale (ha!) train games, I associate with Winsome Games.   The game play was fairly speedy and not too hard to understand what was going on.  As usual for me, what IS difficult is figuring out how to make much money.  Overall - a fun  game.

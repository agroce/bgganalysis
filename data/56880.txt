Decent game, but nothing that new here.  This is a slightly more complicated, dicey version of [b]Diamant[/b] that doesn't add much more fun in double [b]Diamant[/b]'s play time.

Kind of push your luck game, but certainly not the best in this category

RATING: 3
Very repetitive (7 towns with exactly the same handling), very fiddly (drawing 20 markers from the bag and sorting them into piles of ascending values).

Leaving a town early could have been handled much better with an additional blank (or "leave") card, so that this decision is also made simultaneously. By not playing a card at all, a player gives additional information to the others.

We played with 5 and even then, there was not too much excitement. I could not imagine to lay with only 3 or even 2.

El Paso definetely does not want to be a deep strategic game, however it is not much fun either.

If push-your-luck is your thing, this deserves to be in your collection and has some long-term planning compared to most games of this kind.  Felt a round or two too long but fun nonetheless.

Ok, yes it's a Zoch game so silliness is expected and accepted. But I'm always partial to push-your-luck games and this one has it in a big dose. The tension between running first with the least loot or staying behind with the risk of being caught, and the risk of choosing steers or gambling which is dependent on the dice makes for an exciting game. Nevertheless, there's also strategy involved due to different payouts in different stages in the game.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting little push-your-luck game. It's a bit like Incan Gold, but meatier. Speaking of Incan Gold, they could have included a 'leaving town' card here as well, to add even some more bluffing. And perhaps the amount of loot chits to draw for each town better goes down with less players ? f.i. 15 with 3 players and only 12 when playing with 2. As it is now, with 2 players you often don't even reach the lowest high points chits at most locations in town. I also don't understand why it comes with just one pawn instead of one for each player (which can then already be moved to the next location for players already moved further). But apart from these minor gripes, I really like this one, as its mechanic is simple & great.

Played at Essen09, aborted. Strange blind bidding mechanics (try to bid lower than most players, but not too low)

RATING: 5
Kind of bland and forgettable. Fiddly chips have to be sorted and stacked each round. Card play determines what you might get, depending on a dice roll. Some forward planning is possible, but meh. Who cares.

Similar push-your-luck game than Diamant is. El Paso is a bit more lenghty, but offers a bit more decisions too. The game isn't that bad actually, but it's missing something which why it (I guess) it won´t "survive" (=table time goes to other games).

RATING: 7
Western theme. You're trying to get so many goods with you from town to town, but look out for the sherif. You play cards to get goods (same color). The cards are numbered to determine the order to pick goods. The higher the number, the better the good is, but mayby it is all gone, since the lower number picks first. A good filler or short game.

Ein Can't Stop Mechanismus. Wenn man es richtig spielt, auch sinnvoll ;).
Alle Spieler sind in der gleichen Stadt und rauben diese aus. Alle legen gleichzeitig eine Handkarte verdeckt ab um anzuzeigen was sie überfallen möchten (Saloon, Hotel, Bank, ...) Danach wird gewürfelt. Solange nicht der 5te Sherriffstern gewürfelt wurde geht der Überfall weiter. Spätestens beim 5ten Stern ist Ende und alle noch in der Stadt befindlichen Räuber müssen alles Diebesgut abgeben. Wer vorher die Stadt verlässt kann das Gut zu Siegpunkten machen, je nach Stadt in einem anderen Tauschverhältnis.
Hat mir tatsächlich sehr viel Spaß gemacht, allerdings war die letzte Stadt sehr langweilig. Ich führte mit einem Punkt vor dem Zweitplatzierten. Der machte weiter, also ich auch. Wenn beide alles verlieren gewinne ich mit 1 Punkt Vorsprung, wenn beide was bekommen, gehts eben weiter. Da wurde mir die Entscheidung vom Spiel abgenommen sozusagen. Wenn ich Aussteige könnte ich verlieren, wenn ich drin bleibe habe ich höhere Chancen an der Spitze zu bleiben...
Aber insgesammt sehr schönes Spiel, auch stimmig zum Thema. Spiele ich jederzeit gerne wieder mit.

Excellent closer where players play cards (in 7 suits) to try to loot towns.  What makes this great is that there's a push-your-luck element controlled by dice: you can bow out after any round and wait for the next round while the other players continue to loot BUT once all 6 dice show the sheriff than all players left-in lose all their loot.  Additionally there are different payouts at each town, you can only bring one piece of loot to the next town but you can look ahead to see what will be most valuable.  Fast and fun.

Some of the comments I've read on thos game are baffling. Too long? I've played 2 games, one with 3- amd one with 5-players. Both clocked in at about the 1/2 hour mark with rules explanation. Fiddly? Sure you have to pull 18 chits from the bag and then stack them with the highest on the bottom and the lowest on top. This usually takes about 30 seconds. The cards are about as un-fiddly as you can get... the piles don't get reshuffled and cards are drawn on a first-come-first-serve basis. The one other thing I've seen is that the beginning- through mid-game plays no role on the winner. Well, in the first game I played, I was able to build up a nice lead early on and was able to leave El Paso, the final city, after securing only 1 chit confident that the win was in my hands.

I like El Paso MUCH more than a game like Dice Town since the only one that can hose you is you. I'll be glad to add this to our collection for when we need a nice closer for 5.

I'm always on the lookout for the perfect Western themed game. This one is pretty fun! A certain number of tiles are pulled from the bag randomly based on the dice roll. These will be the available tiles players will be trying to rob from the town. The tiles are placed in descending order of value. Players will also have a hand of cards that they may play to claim a tile. The player that plays the largest valued card takes the top tile...maybe that's good or maybe you would rather take a tile with a higher value. So the strategy is fun, a little luck driven due to luck of the draw, but fun. 

The best part of the game...I think...is the sheriff badges that show up on the dice. This is the timer for the game and provides that push your luck element that keeps things interesting. When all the dice are badges the tiles in that town are no longer available. At this time players may trade their tiles in for gold...the currency of the game...in the form of wooden cubes. A player can also carry over a good to the next town hoping to make a higher profit and also take a risk in losing it too.

Very clean push your luck type of game set in the wild west. Players steal different types of things from cities in turn and trad them for money. The deal gets increasingly better but if you hold on to the loot there is a danger of losing it to the sheriff which will steal all loot. A good game but a bit repetitive.

Super fun "push your luck" game. It hits some of the same notes as Diamant but I think works better with a small group of people.  Unlike Diamant there is actually strategy.  Lots of real tactical decisions, good "look ahead" planning both in what you will sell and how to manage your hand.  

And when things don't go well, it's even more fun.

Yay!

RATING: N/A
Simple family game. Fun but too long. It has luck involved but the major flaw is that the sheriff doesn't seem to happen too often thus making the game strangely boring. If the dice roll is more interesting, with more sheriff stars, the game turns out to be more interesting also because it really matters the timing to abandon cities. When I played the game, only once players had to run away before they get caught. Most of the time players robbed everything from the cities and only after that they ran away. That turned the game poor and dull.

Maybe reducing the number of dice can work better but even with that the "SD" and "die" symbols would result in an increase of luck.

Too long for what it is - Diamante 'Plus'. Fiddly set up and the fact you leave town when no chits left makes it lack tension (it seems to happen too often)

OK push your luck game in the same vein as Diamant. Quite fiddly though. It's less one-dimensional than Diamant, but it's precisely its simplicity that gives Diamant its edge. So for now, I'd rather play that.

RATING: 2
This game was very disappointing, especially since I like a great many of Stefan Dorra's designs. This one takes the simple, push-your-luck concept used in Alan Moon's brilliant Diamant/Incan Gold, adds a bunch of chrome and cards and spoils a simple concept. Not only is the game too long and fiddly for what it is, it also sports some absolutely terrible graphics. Certain goods can be traded for points at different ratios at the various towns, but the graphics team at Zoch has somehow found a way so that you can't tell which good can be traded where by looking at the game board, All in all, a pretty terrible offering ...

Fairly typical push your luck dice game. Play a card, highest gets to grab the topmost tile. Later tiles are worth more. Dice rolls allow access to certain loot if the right side comes up. Stay too long and the dice all come up Sheriff, and you get caught and lose all your loot. Got taught this one wrong, so my impression could go up if I ever played it again.

Advanced Diamant, really. As a variant I suggest keeping one's points hidden to make the endgame less of an 'all or nothing'.

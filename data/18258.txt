Several things going on (character selection, area control, multiple ways to score), a little chaos, a cute theme, and a controlled game length. It takes a couple plays to grok the character cards, but then gameplay is much faster. The "take that!" factor isn't too annoying because the negative character effects are minor (kill or convert one astronaut, blow up one ship).

Played this at the Meetup on 7/15/08 and it was probably the biggest hit of the night. So big that Donna rushed into the game store and purchased it on the spot!

I'll need more plays to get a better feel of the ten-turn timing, but after one play - I really enjoyed this game.

This is an easier area majority game. Like all area control games, it's mean. But due to the fun loving illustrations and theme, I think it's very approachable. There's some smart hidden information to switch up strategies and allows for some subtle bluffing. The card fix role selection works well here (much like Castle for all Seasons or Citadel). I really like this one.

Didn't really grab me, although I did play really badly.

Seems like elements of a take that game, welded to El Grande and Kreta...I prefer the other games. Some of the crads are downright confusing with the colours and the way they are typed.

Still it plays quickly enough.

A tale of two Brunos (Cathala and Faidutti). Both designers of some of my favorite games (Five Tribes, Dwarf King) Mission Red Planet is a nice mix of area control and role selection wrapped in a steam punk theme. You spend the game loading rockets with cubes and landing them on regions of mars that have valued resources. There are three scoring rounds and a lot of shenanigans due to the types of roles players execute each round. I like the game very much except for the card component. I think that the cards are too swingy and need a revision or to be taken out of the game.

+ A bit more structured than Citadels; Very interesting theme.
- Can still push the upper limits of chaotic enjoyment.



Why it's previously-owned:
There are just too many other good gateway/lightish games that are so much more enjoyable to me than this one.  I prefer games to have a little more structure than this one I think.  
I traded this away for a bunch of Stargate TCG stuff.

RATING: 8
I liked the gameplay during the game, but that final discovery phase had a huge impact on the final score.  The winner still won, but a discovery card that doubled production for some (but not all) zones added 20+ points to the scores and could have easily catapulted someone to victory from a lower place.

Would play again, since I enjoyed the game, and wouldn't focus as much on the final scores (just the journey of getting there and trying to maximize score).

I like the second version better (it adds Phobos for another wrinkle in strategy) but I got this in a math trade so I'm not interested enough to get the second version as well.

Didn't do much for me. It's largely an area control game, but with end conditions that allow you to focus on particular regions, rather than (necessarily) wanting to own the whole map. That would be fine, but you have very little control over where you end up, and not enough time in the game to really try and work against the randomization/chaos of the game. (Though, if the game was any longer, it would certainly wear out its welcome.) You are given a hand of 9 cards, which you slowly deplete until you want to pick them all up again, each with slightly different abilities. But, for my taste, the slightness of the difference was pretty damn slight. 

With multiple plays, you'd probably start to figure out how to best stay ahead of the pack and optimize your ability to control what happens in the game. But I would still put this game closer to Citadels, Shadow Hunters, and Bang, in terms of control and strategy, than I would to Vye, Tammany Hall, or Neuroshima Hex. So it's more a party game in strategy game clothes than it is a real board game. Personally, I'd rather go lighter and do Shadow Hunters (if I had enough people) or play Vye, which is probably easier to teach, prettier, more appealing to all types, and makes people feel like they're doing something.

RATING: 7
[update: Score lowered from 9 to 7 due to lack of desire to play]

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this game. Especially in light of Citadels leaving me a bit flat. The limited turns and actions available before game's end really added to the tension and intrigue. Only time will tell if repeated plays will dampen my enthusiasm. I came in second to last place in a 5 player game but still came out with a smile on my face. 

Citadels is a fun game too, but MRP doesn't take itself as seriously and therefor benefits from that sense of realism. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An area control game in which getting your dudes into areas is a more convoluted and chaotic process than in most games of this type.  That certainly fits the theme of travelling to Mars.  Character selection reminds of Faidutti's Citadels because of the nine characters who take effect in sequence. There are also similarities to Dorra's Kreta in the way that everyone has an identical set and a character that is played is discarded until the one who allows the discard pile to be picked up is played. Mission is quick and fun and with sabotaged and re-titled space ships, lucky bonus cards and a touch of take-thatery your fate won't be entirely in your own hands.

The artwork has a nice steam punk style.  Production quality is decent, except for the fiddly little astronaut discs.  The rules are an easy read.

Feels like a bit of more "game" added to Citadels; One reviewer described this as similar to the dynamic between Coloretto and Zooloretto and I think I agree.

The scientist role (and the presence of both extremely useless and extremely valuable event cards) was a sticking point with my game group; Surprisingly I wasn't offended by it, but I think when we play this again we'll try the official science-less variant proposed on Faidutti's site.

Some fun mechanics, including one or two mechanics borrowed from one of my obscure favorites - Station Master.

After one play...this game has some potential for fun in future plays. On the other hand, our game last night very quickly produced a runaway leader problem.

The balance between positive (build your position) and negative (destroy other player's positions) effects on the cards is noteworthy. After one play, I am not quite sure if the balance in this game works for me.

Playing positively in our game produced a runaway leader in round 2 of a 10 round game. As such, should the other four players have focused on using their nasty power cards against the runaway leader?  Probably.

RATING: 5
the production is generally great.  i like the art, i like the mini discs/chits, i love the rockets, and everything is fairly evocative of the theme.  there is a card with some missing letters and the boards aren't the best quality, but whatever.  the game itself, as they say, is a bit of a cross between citadels style role selection and el grande style area majority and scoring.  there is quite a bit of chaos, and i think the discovery cards are what put it over the top.  at least the negative ones, which are real doozies.  some bonus cards are very difficult to fulfill too.  needing the most people on mars and having the only dudes in a region come to mind, especially in a 5p game.  anyway i think the game can be improved with a couple anti-chaos tweaks, but out of the box it's still entertaining.  the length is really what makes things manageable, 45-60 minutes is pretty easy with this one.  i'd much rather play citadels, though.

The components are crap -- flimsy misprinted cards, boards that are bad in almost every way they could be -- but the game is undeniably fun. 

About three months after buying the game, I saw on the Geek that Asmodee was sending out board replacements and wrote to them to get some. Three days later I had them. Same thin boards, same bizarre application of the printed sheet over the side of the board with folds, but at least the cuts were clean and straight. I put them under a heavy stack of games for a real flattening...

...and now they stay properly flat. Score upgraded by one point just because I'm no longer going to be upset about the stupid boards whenever we play. I've also ordered Ave Caesar and Cash'n'Guns. Go Asmodee!

RATING: 7
The artwork is very nice and it is refreshing to see such a stylized theme throughout the presentation.  After the art though, the theme drifts off and away from actual gameplay.  There does not appear to be much mechanical link between the game and the art choice.  If that is not a problem, you'll find a somewhat chaotic (unpredictable might be a better word) game experience that does a nice job balancing game length with the randomness.  Games play quickly and consist of a blend of blind role selection and area majorities.  This leads to lots of second guessing and some spectacularly good (or bad) turns.  This will appeal to specific gamers, so be sure you know what you are getting into with this one.  The game has a bad rap for being cutthroat, but it really isn't actually that bad. There is definitely a potential though.

Played twice.  Fun game with a cool steampunk theme.  The artwork and production of the game are great... maybe one of the best I've seen in a game.  Much of the game I had to keep refering to the translation, from French, for each of the different roles that could be played so that may have kept me from being being able to focus what strategies would be most usefull or maybe how to outguess what roles the other players would choose.  I initially thought it was most important just to get get my astonauts on Mars and then move them around to where I wanted but I suspect the better strategy is getting aboard the right rocket in the first place and have it deposit you in the location you want.

I've decided, that though being a cool game, the mechanics area a bit too chaotic for my tastes.

Love the role selection for driving the game. There's luck involved here, but also a lot of deduction and tension.

Fantastic area majority game. Definitely a hidden gem. Got it for $10 at toysforthought.com and it's possibly the best bang for my board game buck I've ever got. Seeing opponents choose an unexpected but effective role and thinking "ooh, I didn't see that coming" = sign of a good game. Little downtime, lots of head games, simple but effective design.

Two flaws -
1. The rules for picking bonus scoring cards are silly. House ruled to draw two, pick one from a bonus-only deck. 

2. Too much luck on the scientist role. When one player draws a useful bonus card and the others draw useless discovery cards like "A Pretty Rock", it sucks. Not sure what house rule would fix this, but it seems itching for one- and I don't normally do house rules.

Played over the weekend with 3 friends and really enjoyed it, enough tactics to keep you going as long as you try not to think too hard. Saw a couple of comments regarding whether we need discovery cards, that'd be a yes for as it gives a hindering mechanic and keeps you in the frame and something about the box being difficult to open, I can only assume that was made by Joey Deacon.

You would think that I would love this game, since it's basically Alien Frontiers smashed together with Citadels.  But I don't.  There's way too much chaos invalidating everything you do and everything you plan, and the "steampunks in space" theme just didn't do it for me.
I would play this again only because I believe I could better control the chaos by knowing the game better.

Wow, there is so much bad about this game. It has the Citadels problem: you can do an action and do nothing on your turn. Fun. Worse, it's very dry and not fun. Worst, it's not balanced at all. The scoring cards you randomly draw are worth wildly variable amounts of points. One card I started with scored me 12 points through no action of my own, while the one I discarded maxed out at 7 and took effort. The other one I drew during the game gave me 8 points because I happened to be doing unintentionally.

RATING: 7
An interesting hybrid role selection/area control game. The defining feature is the need to transport your pieces to the Mars board, where they will score points, by placing them on spaceships via role selection. Scoring cascades, with each of the three scoring rounds yielding more points than the last. There are hidden objectives that also score points. I find the game to be quite engaging.

Faidutti re-shapes the base role-selection mechanic from Citadels, and adapts it to an area control game. Mission Red Planet has nice graphics and gameplay, but it is quite chaotic (a bit too much for my tastes) and one can be easily screwed: hidden action selection + hidden objectives + hidden event cards add up to form a game that's very difficult to control...
Anyway, if played with fast pace and light heart, it can be an enjoyable ride.

extremely annoying game but at least quick enough the nightmare is over quickly. the game's too short to have much if any control over your fate, and the bonus cards and discovery ones change the game from quick and mindless to quick but painfully annoying. get 1 bonus when all others get 2 or 3, and in the end find out your bonus was impossible to finish becacuse of a discovery someone played last turn... how  fun :-(

After two plays, this gets an 8.  I apparently suck at his game, as I've been completely blown out in both games.  Winner had at least double my score.  

There's a lot to like here: short playing time, quick gameplay, interesting choices, and a good dose of paranoia.  Holding the first player marker isn't always the best, especially if two players choose Explorer in the same round.

It seems that some long term planning is required, at least in regards to character selection, although your plans are not guaranteed to go through in full due to the scheming of the other players.

Theme in this one is top notch, and the primary reason I wanted the game.  Components are very nice also, despite that they don't really fit in the box insert too well.

I intend to play this much in the short term future.  Rating may go up or down based on the results of those games.

Citadels: The Board Game.  Well, ok, not exactly, but borrows the excellent character selection mechanics of Citadels, and expands on it with a fantastic area control mechanism.  This just bleeds flavour.  The packaging isn't kidding when it says that it plays in an hour; in fact, it's never taken that long to play thanks to the "ends in ten rounds" rule (and that includes agonizing when it gets to your turn).  Very high quality play pieces as well.

Needless to say, "If you liked Citadels, you'll love Mission: Red Planet."

A fairly simple and fast game with plenty of choices and a healthy dose of chaos.  After reading through the rules, I felt like the chaos and "take-that" would be too much for me.  However, I really enjoyed my first play.  I think that as long as players are genuinely making an effort to do what is best for them, the "take-that" is easy to take.  The game really moves along quickly and the area majority scoring is well done.

Rating after 2 plays. A lot of depth here, and a lot of fun, but something about the system seems awkward. Hopefully this will change as familiarity with the character cards increases.

 *** After two more plays***
The game definitely improves all around after several plays. The character card system is a bit unwieldy for the novice player, but once you have the various abilities memorized, the game becomes a more streamlined and enjoyable experience. I look forward to trying this with four or five.

Is this the best Faidutti game?  I think so.  With the help of Mr. Cathala they've managed to create something special.  It's got role selection, and area control and hidden cards...It's so mean, yet so fast.  It has chaos as well as predictability and control.  It's damn near perfect.  This game was shit on when it first came out.  Too bad it didn't gain popularity until it was long OOP.  A game that takes a bonafide classic (El Grande) and makes it into it's own classic.  Well done.

RATING: 7.5
Based on two successive 3 player games.  While the action is pretty unpredictable, the decisions you make about which character to pick and which ships to sail on do feel like they make a difference.  The .5 is for the theme, it's refreshing that they chose a steampunk Mars instead of what could have easily been another history based game.

In a nutshell, while clever moves may give a you a few bonus points here and there, it's not a game where a brilliant strategy will prevail over all.  Grab opportunities when they present themselves and take advantage when you ended up picking just the right character.

Note: A couple of the ships have split on me.  I'm going to try and glue them together and if that doesn't work I'm going to ask Asmodee for a replacement.

Takes the role mechanism from Citadels and a bit of the boat loading mechanism from Puerto Rico and combines them into a fun medium light area control game. Generally takes around 45 minutes for a complete game, but first timers might be prone to AP. After playing a couple of times, you'll realize that the game is chaotic enough that over-analyzing the game will only frustrate you, as things never go exactly the way you planned. 
Light enough to be a family/gateway game, heavy enough for gamers. Not something I'd want to play every day, but it hits a sweet spot.

I might play it again if all the resource chits are revealed in the setup, it doesn't become a  "surprise" when you score big on a region all of a sudden.

The cardplay is interesting, but the events add too much chaos to the endgame scoring and, like I mentioned above, the luck of the draw in getting a 3-point chit is too big for me.

The game has nice art, but those minuscule bland-colored discs for astronauts is really unforgivable. Why not astronaut meeples?

A below average area control game with too much chaos for my liking.  The game has 2 types of secret mission cards (secret scoring missions and hidden planet cards that affect the region to which they are played) which I like, but the overall lack of control really tanks the game for me because there are so few turns and actions between scoring rounds.  It often takes 2-3 turns in order to accomplish much, but you can get royally screwed by opponents playing the saboteur (which nukes a ship of astronauts) or the pilot (which change the destination of your space ship).  Having 3-5 of your men instantly vaporized or sent to Timbuktu can be a game killer because you simply don't have enough time to build up your tokens for controlling regions or to move them into useful territories. 

The comparison of this game to Citadels is weak since roles are not selected from a single pool... instead everyone has their own hand with the same 9 role cards, and it's your choice which order to play them in (plus one card will let you bring used role cards back into your hand).

Steampunk themed Mars conquest game (Great theme!). 4 rockets exist to transport colonists to Mars. Once on Mars, colonists need to dominate regions to score points, based on tiles which are flipped when a region is first visited. There's 10 rounds and each player has 9 special role cards, one of which must be played each round. The trick here is to judge when to play the role that lets you pick up all your cards to be available for use again. Other roles include pilots to fly rockets where you want them to go, explorers to get around Mars, saboteurs to blow up rockets en route and so on.The game picks up pasce as you go along as there are 3 scoring rounds - 2nd one is double points and the third one triple. With more colonists on Mars each time as well, the game gets more frenetic. The final twist is that you can gain objective cards which reward you for being in a number of regions, which is another aspect to manage.A good game, not too complex, good for both casual and more serious gamers.

Seemed like a promising transportation and territory claiming game...  But the bad mechanics turn it into a cluster bomb of "luck of the draw" and "First to Fortune" game play filled with plenty of opportunities to be rendered walking dead.

Luck of the Draw:  The ships and destinations are at random.  Not so bad at first, but given the timing of the role cards this can quickly make any kind of effort into a poor game chance and getting screwed irrevocably.
Role card effects often do more to prevent players from catching up rather than taking down a strong player.  The effects are powerful enough to screw over another weaker player, but often won't do enough to chance anything about a stronger player.

First to Fortune:  All it really takes is one player having a huge lead on one valuable resource to win the game.  They luck out, get a few astronauts in the right territory, and chances are the game mechanics will allow them to easily keep that territory throughout all the scoring rounds.  Cards aren't powerful enough to do enough to change such a situation most of the time and any event cards only affect such players at the end of game... Well after their victory has been secured.

Walking Dead:  Very easy to get hit with a combo that will leave you unable to compete for the rest of the game.  You can still do everything right and end up dead in the water.  Lose too many astronauts in the beginning, you won't be able to capitalize on early territory claiming and the first scoring rounds.  You'll be left trying to play catch up and scrape what bits you can manage to a ultimately futile effort.

The only thankful aspect of the game is that there is a limited number of rounds and losing players can easily perform idle actions to get the game over quicker so they can move on to other things.

If you are going to make a game so luck based, it shouldn't be this long.  Poker is a "luck of the draw" game, but I don't need to waiting an hour or so for a hand to be over.  That is what this game felt like a: Bad poker hand that lasted for over an hour.

Fairly fun game, just played for the first time. Not as much luck as many of the threads here on BGG led me to believe. 

Although not a long game, by the end I was just about ready for it to be over as there doesn't seem to be much evolution to strategy throughout. However, since this was our group's first play (for everyone), this may change with subsequent plays. 

At the same time, the amount of luck in the game may also start to bug me more as strategies become more defined, but right now it seemed to add just the right amount of randomness. Without any of the random factor, I think the game would be too dry.

Update: Played once more, still fun. Need more plays to get better strategies

I love the character/action games.  Lowered from 8 to 7 on replay.  Lots of stuff happening on that board.  It seems like the best move is to do what helps you (rather than hosing the leader).  I had a game where I was far behind but still getting picked off because I was in the same territories as one of the leaders.  Maintains a good pace throughout (doesn't slow at end) and plays in close to the listed time.

I can't see the point of playing rounds 1-8. The last scoring round is worth more than the scoring from the first 8 turns put together. It adds up to a completly random experience that I don't have any control over. I give it a 3 instead of a 1 because the art is a very evocative industrial age/steampunk style that I really like. Wish there was a good game under it.

I got this game from an auction for not alot of money. When I bought the game I knew nothing about it other then the art was pretty cool and it had steampunk rocket ships.

What I actually got was a neat little game with fantastic components, a useless insert and a too big box. The game itself has alot of neat little mechanics but ultimatly orbits around getting your spacemen to mars as quickly and spreadouty as possible.

RATING: 7
Probably better as a game than Citadels, but because this is more strategic, the chaos inherent in the role selection phase is actually more frustrating than in Citadels. The fact that everyone has the same cards makes for some interesting bluffing and guessing, but in the end it's still pretty random, so any plans you make are basically worthless. The scoring for area majority is also weird, and final scores can be very swingy depending on which card you happen to draw at the beginning of the game. It's still fun to play, but not the most satisfying game I've ever played. For a really excellent game with similar mechanics, check out Libertalia.

An interesting area-influence game that plays relatively quickly and has just enough chaos to keep things interesting.  Unfortunately the production quality is poor: the board warps and tears easily despite its small size, there aren't enough scoring counters included in the game, cards have tiny font size and missing letters, etc.  The bonus point cards are worth too much.  It is rediculous that in a game where the scores are so close one player can get 15 points at the end just because they happened to draw an extra bonus card while another player gets screwed with drawing useless discovery cards.  I think the game needs more development work.

I finally got around to playing this game with four people, all gamers. It felt relatively flat. I thought I would love this game. I was entranced by the artwork (prior to purchasing). When it arrived, the quality was a tad weak, and the artwork somehow didn't hold up to the images. Too bright? not sure. The game play seemed a bit quick for what you were attempting to accomplish and the end game came very quickly. I'm sure it was the manner in which we played, but the doubling, then tripling of points at the end gave way too much weight to the last 2 or 3 moves.
Edit: After a few more plays, the game is just meh. It's since been traded away, hopefully to a more loving group.

Sumptious steampunk production helps a rather decent game to shine.  While you'll have seen all the parts before they're well integrated and there's a lot here to like.  My only real quibble is with the end-game scoring which has a few too many big rabbits coming out of the hat.  I'm not sure if more experience with the game would ameliorate that or exacerbate it.

RATING: 2
Huge level of chaos plus  high capacity for analysis paralysis plus highly sequential play plus little to no tension = one game I will never play again.

Seriously, how do people get away with publishing stuff like this? The thing is so obviously out-of-kilter, so out of touch with itself as a design, I'm surprised it would see publication. If I want to play a chaotic, fun, low-skill thematic game, I want it play quickly and not get bogged down in boring analysis.

And where is the theme here anyway? It's only a little bit more than a paste-up job. People say Faidutti does games with good themes while Knizia's games are brilliant but dry, but virtually every Knizia game I've played in the last 5 years is far better thematically than Mission: Red Planet. The only theme in this game is the art.

Sort of fun, but I'm never a huge fan of the citadels-type role selection mechanic.  It also felt as if the game gave an illusion of control although the proceedings were fairly chaotic.  The special scoring cards also seemed rather imbalanced.  Overall, I felt as if there were some good ideas that just didn't execute very well.  Now, all that having been said, it was still fun enough that I'd play again if asked!

A little Analaysis Paralysis in the end, but overall its a fun game.  One thing I don't care for, the scoring between rounds seems too close at the end.  I think this game would be better if it ended on turn 12 and scoring occurred on rounds 5, 9, and 12.

Boy, did somebody say RANDOM?!
I didn’t like that only the player with the most population gets the VP; I much prefer other area majority games in which you also get something for being second and maybe third. In this game, it’s just too big of a point swing if you lose the area by 1 population (which, again due to the randomness, might not even be your own fault). The last scoring round is quite decisive too, which I also don’t like.

This is a game which I have rated 6 but could definitely see dropping to 4 after a few more plays – the randomness is quite extreme for a game which requires you to think ahead, but which has a massive amount of luck which can ruin your carefully laid plans! Despite this, I did enjoy the game perhaps because it was so random that it was actually quite funny! Also, it only took an hour to play which is reasonable.

This is just a fun game.  The role selection is a good variant to the standard area majority game.  The two aspects combined are great.  There is a good bit of random chaotic nature to the game, but I don't mind that sort of thing in a shorter game.  If you want complete control of a game you can't play this by the standard rules, because you won't like it.  My rating for this game is dropped a half point not because of game play, but because I am truly afraid that one day my board is going to rip in half.  Despite others' comments, the rest of the production values are excellent.

Really "fun" game. It's not super deep. but luckily, decisions matter, you have to consider the other players, there's a risk/reward element and some good old screwage. Solid game, very accesible, and a lot of fun, if not the deepest experience you will ever have. 

Rating reduced to 6.5. Upon repeated plays, its becoming rote. There aren't enough interesting things to do. Each role serves a purpose, but outside of looking for a good opportunity to use one of the aggressive cards, the game kind of plays itself a bit too much.

There was a 50-50 chance that I would either love or hate this game- I love Citadels, but I'd rather balance the ol' checkbook than play El Grande ever again.  Fortunately, a cool and engaging theme (Victorian sci-fi), great production values (including a box that opens just as easily as any other, you f*cking crybabies), and a perfect 45-60 minute playtime tipped the scales to 70-30.  Now, this game is clearly a Euro and typically that means "DOA" for me these days but giving it a fair chance I found that the game is quite a lot of fun and actually has a good amount of theme despite the idiotic inclusion of tiny, atmosphere-destroying wooden discs to represent astronauts.  The chief differences between M:RP and Citadels are the area control board play (rather than card-based district building) and that each player has a full selection of nine roles.  The chief differences between M:RP and El Grande are that it never feels like shuffling around wooden cubes and trying to maximize each play in anticipation of scoring rounds.  M:RP can be fairly nasty, and for the fallen there's even a memorial space on the board (at least in the US edition).  Sure, there really isn't anything new and frankly it's pretty derivative but it's all put together so well and unlike Thurn and Taxis, which was a _completely_ derivative, soulless, and heartless game this one actually has a little passion and some guts to it.  This is definitely the Faidutti/Cathala team's best game in a very long time, and it's also the best light Euro I've played in ages.  I do wonder if it will survive more than 5-6 plays or if it'll hit a hard ceiling and be shuffled off to the trade/ebay/burn in fire pile like so many Euros that looked promising at first have.   For now, it's an 8 and I feel comfortable with that.

Combination of simultaneous action and area control which worked very well together. What I really like about this game is the length is just right. It didn't drag at all, and that was on the first learning game for all of us. 

You really have to plan how to use your actions (9 actions in total played over 10 rounds). You will realistically only get a chance to play your recruiter once (to get all the cards back) so it is essential to plan when you want that to happen. 

Keen to play again and try out different strategies.

1 play vs. Daren, William, Dan, and Matt.  Very fun, light control game.  The cards, although they didn't see much play, seem that they MIGHT be a tad to chaotic, but they didn't really hinder the game I was in.  I enjoyed the game a lot.

Same "choose whom to screw" mechanic as Augsburg is found here. This one I'm quite sure I don't like. But maybe I'm just extra sensitive to this, because, again, most other players at my table seemed to enjoy this. This is essentially an area majority game, with the addition of an extra staging area for the units before they get where they're going. But things like arbitrarily choosing which space ships (the staging areas) blow up, and changing their destination, really suck the fun of it for me. Did I mention other people seemed to like it?

I had bought this game at a time I still thought Bruno Faidutti a good designer. And, to be honest, he is. It's just that his love for total chaos is something I've come to dislike intensely. M:RP is no exception to this rule: as the number of players goes up, the events in the game become unbearably messy and unpredictable to the point where a winner can have three to four times as many points as the loser. Which is, when you get right down to it, patently ridiculous. The game, such as it is, is only 'playable' (= 'annoys me the least') at the very low end of the player scale.

I gathered that there was talk of a re-edition beyond the two editions already in existence (one with the round board, the the one with the square board to replace it), but to date it hasn't surfaced, and with Asmodée acquiring FFG—the second publisher acquiring what was to be the third—matters are undoubtedly up in the air for the time being. Seriously though: this game should only be played by fans of utter chaos; the rest of the gaming population can politely ignore this design.

This game should be more fun.  I am not sure why I don't enjoy it more.  I probably do.  I don't know... so confusing.

With the latest play, I felt a little more control.  I don't mind chaos, but it seemed like I couldn't really plan before, and this time I could.  There are so many things to try to plan for, and when I have to try to do to many you end up not getting anything accomplished.  This game can be fun if you play it with fun people who can play fast.

Acquired via Math trade August 2008.

Quick role selection and area control game.  Have one game under my belt now.  Need to play this some more to flush out the interaction and see if the game is worth holding onto.

Traded away September 2009 for Tribune.  Only played once, but I found it fairly chaotic.  Liked the area control elements.  However, the roles were a bit complex for my kids, and my game group had an opinion on this one already.  Would play it again, but don't need to own it anymore.

Priceless take that highlight: 14 astronauts of 2 different opponents getting fried by radioactive rock,
while my lone astronaut scores 3x3 points at games end.
I was laughing so hard inside of me that I thought my

when you see the anguish in other players eyes. 

This is Chaos in a Box. Just know what you`re getting into before the game starts.

RATING: 8
An OOP game worth getting but the poster child for how not to publish a game. The box is badly designed putting the pieces back in the insert is impossible, the board may tear into sections and needs to be handled with care. The character cards are an odd size and finding sleeves for them is hard. I had to cut some down to fit. The information on how to play the character cards is in a very small font on the card making it very hard to read there is no reason for this as the cards are very large. A more modern game of MRP would have ICONS listed down the side. Given its age you can not fault it for that.

Still a good playing game and needs to be reprinted to a more modern and thought out standard.

Well wanted a reprint, but no thanks, Fantasy Flight Games doing it, never a good thing. They always screw it up and they love to publish games needing expansions out of the box, Eldritch Horror, or you wind up with 2-3 expansions that cost each what the base game cost, other then MayFair Games, my least liked publishers, FFG is right above them. Seem both in business just to milk your wallet. That reprint of Pandemic comes to mind, and two expansion where one depends on the other, nice move FFG.

RATING: 7.5
Wow, did I want to love this game. I liked Citadels but always wanted the non-role-selection parts to be fleshed out. This game does that, but unfortunately I don't think the area majority elements really work with the level of chaos in the game. Especially the random cards that get revealed at the end. 

Still an enjoyable light game, and solid theme and art.

Components: The board is a bit boring, which could have been improved simply by having the zone boundaries drawn along geographic features, instead of the straight partitioning we see. The text on the cards, one of the most important piece of information in the game, is way too small. Everything else is top notch.

Experience: Hmm. There is a fair amount of complexity here, given that on each turn I only play one card. A fairly contentious, unforgiving area control game, and with lots of opportunity to get screwed right before the scoring. This game is all about knowing which cards to play right before the scoring, and deciding which cards are worth re-using.

Nice game. The character selection slows it down at first, but by the midpoint of the game, it gets a lot faster. There's also a lot of timing in this. Getting to go last on a scoring round is a big advantage, but you don't have a lot of control over it. Good game though. It plays fast and fun.

RATING: 8
A Citadels-like role selection put together with some nice area control.  The individual powers make the area control very interesting.  It plays quick, which is one of its best features.  Asmodee gave it great production value, as good looking as any Days of Wonder game, and with as easy as the core mechanics are to learn, this is a great medium-light game even for non-gamers.

Jack of all mechanics, master of none-the mish-mash of role selection and area majority works better than expected. Theme blasts forth from the rocket exhaust and this is a 60-90 minute thrill ride.

Dropping from 7 to 6 after three games. Initial game took a long time to finish, but now we are coming in around the rated hour. Initially we were over thinking this one, and thought we had more control over the situation than is really the case. This is an amusing game, but with only three players the winner seems to be decided almost by chance. Also don't like the fact that you have to discard the insert to repack the game since the spaceships don't have storage wells.

I really liked Mission: Red Planet although it didn't go over very well with two different groups of people.  They disliked the randomness of the event cards played on the territories but I felt it worked fine and was manageable.  Really liked how the roles worked; it felt like Citadels but was even more vicious and played in a set number of turns.  If that sounds appealing then give it a go!

A Victorian Citadels, with strategic decisions, precision timing decisions, and the perfect amount of "fate" beyond your control, although a refined player will beign to understand his opponents choices.even good with 2, and fast like 30 minutes or so. Excellent game.

After one play, with 5 players, it just seemed chaotic.

It was fun, but it's hard to imagine having much control over the outcome. Not only that, but most regions also get affected by random cards which change how the final scoring of each of those regions is handled. (So you could take great pains to control a region, just to have it end up being worth nothing at the end.)

So, this one's a mixed bag. Definitely some fun and interesting mechanics, but too random and chaotic. (Fewer players might make the chaos manageable enough.)

Pro:
- unusual theme;

RATING: 6
Really cool and nasty game. Each player plays cards to perform a particular action. Each person has the exact same cards in their hand. These cards have a particular action that will affect other players and also affect the board. The point is to get majorities on the board. The board represents colonizing Mars with astronauts. It is nasty but fun game that can be quite some fun to play. One complaint would be that waiting for everybody's turn to come around for you just to do one action can make the Game drag a little.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Players send astronauts to Mars in the late 19th century.  Players select role cards (a Verraeter styled character selection) that determines the play order for the turn, and allows a special action.  These typically result in astronauts (wooden disks) being loaded onto rocket ships, which are launched to Mars when full.  Mars is divided up into different areas.  During the three scoring rounds, scoring chips are awarded for each area on Mars based on most pawns in that area.  So hard to rate - an area control game that you essentially can't plan for, and have to rely on good luck and not being picked on to have a hope of winning - so what's the point?  Then the ultimate, face down discovery cards that can tell you the past 10 turns you've spent fighting for an area majority has all been worthless as you won't score it.  Good points - it looks good (apart from undersized card text), and it's fairly fast.

Yet another minnd-bogglingly chaotic game from Gaul. Just like Himilaya, Citadels, etc, this one alos uses the time-teested formula of using a calcuation-heavy subtle systems and bolting them onto a ridiculous out-of-control luckfest part. In this case we have simultaneous blind-bidding and "take-that" event cards. It's actually one of hte best of the bunch, but what a low bar!

There are so many cards that can kill your score.  if someone recognizes what you are doing they can kill one token and stop you from scoring a MINIMUM of 8, and there is nothing you can do to stop it.  Had one play where a discover card, removed all my guys from one region.  -8 -9 (would have lead in ice) -3 for that region.  -20 on one card.  Finished with 14 points total (was after the ice bonus)

Pretty chaotic, a fair amount of luck, and plenty of opportunities to screw people over.  But it plays in 30-45 minutes.  Box says 60 minutes, maybe for your first game, but once you know it, it can really zip by.  It's like Citadels with area majority scoring, although not as harsh as Citadels can be.  This game doesn't seem to have gotten a fair shake.  Very cool artwork and stylizing but the bonus cards could be more clear.   I generally prefer this over Citadels these days.

Now the game takes off even more!

Unexpectedly exceptional game. I found it standing on a shelf of a local board game store when it was already long time OOP, and I was happy to have bought it cheaply.
I put it on the table during one game night with 5 players that are completely new to this game and oh what fun we had.
I played it later with less players and fun was totally preserved. It's fast, mildly complex, not too random, not too predictable, with great steampunk theme and with many different segments of the game each of which is fun above average.

One of Asmodée Editions's newest games. Mission : Planète Rouge is quite simple and enjoyable even for non-gamers. It was a pleasent surprise.

I played a few times since buying the game.

I don't mind the french version personnally. Matter of fact I prefer the french version than the english. The french version the map is round. The english is a rectangler. Who heard of a regtangler shape planet? Not me!

I just wonder if there would be a major difference between the  french and english versions when it comes available.

I've read that there are some chaos issues in the game due to character abilities which is similiar to Citadels.

For some gamers, I understand that it is a reason enough to not play this game. Though I don't have a problem with it, I guess I don't see how it would be a turn off for some gamers. The one`s who would  be turned-off by Mission : Planète Rouge  am guessing are the Citadels haters.

I do enjoying have special abilities for each character and once you pick it, it is discarded for the game unless you pick character no. 1 which lets take all the characters back in your hand.

I'm enthusiastic because I have tired of Citadels but still like the Role mechanics. This game gives that to me plus adds a rule from Dungeon Twister (a game I don't care for) that I do like - a way to pick your cards back up, which allows for more precise planning. The similarities to El grande are true but the game doesn't have the depth of El grande, which makes it an easy and quick game for 5 players.

Good quality contents, attractive art, compelling theme, easy to understand rules and real replay value. An excellent job.

Excellent game.  Only played twice and rating will undoubtedly come down a little.  But right now it's a much better version of Citadels that plays just as fast if not faster.  Highly recommend picking it up.

Update: And down goes the rating.  It'll probably stay at 7 for a while too.  A lot of luck and randomness combined with the now lack of novelty to bring this one down pretty fast.  Still better than Citadels, though.

If El Grande and Citadels were to ever have children, I think Mission: Red Planet would be the outcome.  Some say Fist of Dragonstones and Mission: Red Planet would be unofficial sequels to Citadels. Not only do I find M:RP to be the better of the two sequels but I also like it more than Citadels. It feels like a more natural progression of Citadel's game mechanisms.  The only nitpick I feel is that the victory points for territories should be known from the beginning, instead of discovering when landing on it for the first time.

Edit: There is a new edition of this game.

I enjoy variation in my games. This was just random and chaotic. There seemed to be no point in planning anything.  I could not figure out why I was at the table when a monkey would have the same results as a human playing that game. I guess if you want to be absolved of any responsibility for winning or losing, these types of games may appeal to you.

I love the theme for this--it is a steam punk Victorian space race game. To Mars! The game mechancs make it a fairly standard worker-placement/area control game, and some of the components are a little flimsy, but it looks great and is a lot of fun! I have debated whether it is worth getting the second edition. First edition seems just fine.

Played twice; once with wife and son, and again with four coworkers.  Enjoyed in both times, and forgot the damned water end-game-score bonus both times as well.

I'm not sure how I feel about the discovery cards -- you can really mess up somebody's game by dumping a bad card on their zone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Only one play, but perhaps the randomness of getting a victory point mission card or a discovery card that offers no victory points is too much of a deciding factor. Requires more plays to determine if this is true.

I really enjoyed this game right up to the point where the Event/Discovery cards are revealed. Then the whole thing went wrong. The game itself, loading ships, sending them, deploying majorities, moving people and so on, and the increasing scoring system, and the characters all worked very well. I could see a few tweaks would help but everything worked nicely. Then the final cards are revealed and BLAM! somebody racks up loads of points totally unconnected to the game play. Well, not unconnected, but there's a huge gap and imbalance between the points scored in the game and those scored at the game end. It seemed wildly disjointed and completed skewed my feelings. I felt like I had worked for my score then somebody else magicks up points from nowhere. It felt like a tacked on mechanism and a badly weighted one too. I was also disappointed with the production quality, especially at its high retail price. The boards were warped, the rockets had creases on the fronts, the cards had an unreadable and tiny font and amazingly some cards had random letters missing! What, nobody bothered proof-reading or quality testing? Asmodee have a good deal to learn. No german publisher or DoW would let a game out in this condition. I liked Red Planet a lot, I can see it being developed, I would like to less either 2 more rounds or one less character (didn't like the Soldier, killing is nasty). Good game, could be great with more work.

To play your cards effectively, memorizing the cards others have played would be most advantageous.  That is a little more memorizing than I like to do, so that means I don't play the game as well as I could.  This game shares some similar mechanics (choosing actions) with Citadels.

OK, I'll admit it. Faidutti isn't my favorite game designer. There have been games of his that I've liked and some that I haven't liked, but none that I've really loved. Well, the times they are a'changin' because I think I might love Mission: Red Planet. 

It's just a great middle weight game that rewards forward thinking while tossing in just enough randomness to allow you to play it in a non-brain-burning way. Faidutti has finally hit a home run with me. 

By the way, the artwork is absolutely stunning. While there are some minor problems with the components themselves, they really are small and are nothing that take away from the quality of the game.

It has a little of all the things I like: attractive game, simple rules, not too long (just 10 turns!), some screwage.  A lot of the game mechanics feel a little familiar, but oddly don't feel old or used.

Citadellás szerepválasztásra épülő Marskolonizálás.
Nagyon hangulatos, tematikus, szép darab, ami játékélményben eléggé hasonlít a Libertaliára. Talán kicsit kevesebb döntési lehetőséged van itt, de amúgy a szokásos könnyed, szórakoztató, party-jellegű játék, az ezeknél elengedhetetlen igen nagy káoszfaktorral. Egyetlen hiányérzetem volt csak vele kapcsolatban: ehhez a stílushoz szerintem kevés a max. 5 fős lehetőség, megkívánná a minimum 6-ot.

Mission: Red Planet is a pretty straight-forward area control game. Players send astronauts to different areas on Mars in differently sized rockets (think Puerto Rico: they launch when they are full). Points are scored for each majority in an area.

Faidutti wouldn't be Faidutti if he didn't add some random mayhem to spice things up, though. In this case the role is taken by character selection á la Citadels (with some mean abilities, although generally quite well-balanced) and event cards which can have positive or negative impact on players' scores. Most of the event cards actually remain unknown to the players until they are revealed in the final scoring round.

Mission: Red Planet plays fairly quickly. My biggest beef is with the event cards which can cause huge swings and hit players out of the blue or wash them ahead of the pack in a very arbitrary way. Still, might be Faidutti's best game indeed.

An beautifully illustrated and excellent game. My initial impression was that this would be around a 6. I really liked the use of cards to place the colonists on the ships - in particular the fact that each player had the exact same cards available. This raised it to a 7. The resource collection mechanic and its interaction with the bonus cards worked better than I had foreseen which raised the game to an 8. I see two potential improvements. First the game currently distinguishes between outside and interior zones with regard to the effect of soldier cards and discoveries. This is a very odd mechanic to apply to a spherical planet. Elimination of this distinction would improve the game. Second the game needs map the entirety of Mars, not just one hemisphere. This would increase the number of territories 80% and would require a similar increase in game length. The game play is so good and plays so fast that the added length would be no problem.

A great mix of several elements: role picking from Citadels, industrial world of XIX-th century from Wolsung, majority control from El Grande etc. The graphics is simply brilliant and beautiful.

The game takes about an hour and for that time there is really a lot to make and decide. My only gripe is the box insert - to someone who designed it: have you ever tried to make all the components fit in the box after punching out? If yes - could you please share with me this unique knowledge? It's a disaster.

But apart of that - a very good game for gamers and casuals alike.

By the same guy who did one of my fav games, Citadels. The theme is worse but it includes many of the same elements that make Citadels great. With one caveat, the scientist role makes the game too luck based. Take him out and the game's great.

RATING: 6.5
The biggest drawback is that a few of the turns solve to a single best play (or pair of options), which reduces replay value. The game would have been better with either more or fewer roles (or perhaps different roles), so that there wasn't such a clean solution for when to play the recruiter, playing certain cards early or on scoring rounds, etc.

Chaotic, luck-heavy, imbalanced game with screwage, kingmaking, and runaway losers.  But so what?  It's meant to be all of those things!  Revel in them, because this is a freewheeling family/social/beer game, not something to take seriously.  But along with that atmosphere, I really like the way that the game gives you something interesting to ponder each turn - it's not a brainless game, even though the impact of your decisions is damped by the general chaos.  The steampunk theme is communicated well in the whimsical character illustrations, although the quality of the game materials is very low for the price.  I would have loved to see little plastic Victorian astronaut figures instead of the wooden markers.

For those who think that the discovery cards bring too much randomness to the final scoring, Bruno Faidutti suggests a variant in which each player can peek at one hidden discovery card of his choice at the end of the 8th turn.  I like this idea.

I absolutely love the Citadel-like cardplay on the first half of the game. I love sabotaging someones rocket so that it blows up with all their troops on it after they just thought they were very clever to get their guys on it and attempt a launch.

But if you embrace that element, it looks to be a lot of fun.

Despite the randomness that some gamers might deplore, I find that this game has enough strategy and planning in it to make it really interesting. And it's a game that one will enjoy more after repeated plays because the random elements can, to a large extent, be countered and mitigated through actions. And there are also alternative rules published by the designers that will reduce the "chaos" further. The game is fast played and has great components & a compelling theme.

This could potentially be the first area control game ever to truly please "light gamers" or "advanced family gamers" who might deem other games in this category as too complicated, dry (Web of Power), confrontational (El Grande) or unforgiving (Kreta).

Really nice game with excellent production. The game itself is more of an area control game than most people realize. The different roles are not as important as other reviews have made it sound.

It is more about making sure you choose the role that is right for your particular situation. Very nice game.

It takes the role selection from "Citadels" and applies it to an area control game. The steampunk graphic approach is very nice. Event cards add some spice, but also a lot of randomness.

I still enjoy it, but I have a feeling that pure luck may decide too many games.

RATING: 7
Fun game with very nice components.  Strong theme and has a variable player powers type of feel with the role selection.  The area majority is simple and fairly well balanced.  I didn't really feel in control of what was going on at any point.  Many actions taken by other players will adversely effect you, and its basically random chance whether they decide to do X this turn, and screw you, or do Y this turn and not screw you, when they have no way of knowing your plans and X and Y achieve the same result.  This gives you a lot of chaos and a human element luck factor that takes away from the otherwise super analytical area majority game being played beyond the roles.  This chaos takes away from what should be lots of tension.  Still, this is a great game for the 1 hour timeframe.  I'd play again and this one has a lot of cross-audience appeal.  Folks who call it a "ride" game where you are at the whim of fate and not really controlling your destiny are correct.  Its a fun ride, though and it looks good!  Don't play with AP-prone players!

The boards are warped while the creases are flaking print off. There aren't enough scoring tiles and some of the cards are missing several letters in their text.

RATING: 8
A nice fat wad of steam-powered chaos.  It's a lot like trying to fly a coal-fired spaceship—kinda rickety, kinda scary, and with really dodgy yaw control.  I'm a fan of these sorts of contraptions where your goal is to build a house of cards while everyone is taking turns punching you in the head.  Overheard at the first playing:  "It's like [i]Citadels[/i] but it doesn't suck!"  (For the record, I like [i]Citadels[/i], but I think I'm the only one in my group who does.)  So if you're in the mood for a lighter, chaotic, highly-thematic romp, this one gets it done full steam ahead.  

Throw up some wheat-paste signage, hire a barker or two and pack those suck—er, [i]intrepid adventurers[/i]—into the Jules Verne Express and blast their asses to Mars!

An interesting mishmash of role section, area control, and worker placement. This is one of those Euros that doesn't do anything WRONG but neither does it especially stand out, either.

One day designers might wake up to the realisation that crossing one game with another is a good way to create a design that's weaker than either. This Citadels/El Grande cross breed is so chaotic that there's no real player control at all. Oh, and the text on the role cards is MUCH too small.

First played this on March 1st, 2007.  The rules may take a bit to get through and it takes a while to learn what to do.  it's worth it however.  There are many options you have and good strategy in the game.  It's unique enough to want to play.  There is a fair amount of luck as suppose as well.  And there is defintely some of the "get the other player" element.  A fun game that is worth a game play and possibly consideration in encorporating into your gameplay rotation.

I really liked Citadels until it fell out of favor with me rather aprubtly, so I was pretty pumped about Red Planet.  Unfortunatley, I wasn't too impressed with the game.  The whole design felt rather rushed.  The ships left the platforms before you could do much of anything to them, the areas on Mars were taken over too quickly, only a handful of character actions were used with a few not being chosen at all, and the end came entirely too early.  It seemed like the game just started to get good when then it was suddenly over.  The scoring also seemed a bit wacky/chaotic...  I don't know, I just felt pretty underwhelmed.  Not that it is a bad game, it just didn't come close to my expectations or the greatness of Citadels.

Too much luck, too many cards to select from. Did not like the steampunk artwork / theme, nor did it transport well enough.

One of my favorite Euro's, it even breaks in to my top ten of all games.  I like variable player powers and area control.  The game seems to take many mechanics that have been done before and put them together in a way that I really like.  Scoring could've been done a little cleaner with a score board.

Area Majority with Character Selection.  I'm really rather stuck on this one.  It wasn't a bad game by any means, but I'm trying to decide if I really want to play it again.  I wasn't hugely sold on El Grande, and area majority is definitely a basis of Red Planet.  It's a good source of player interaction, but it gives me a touch too much anxiety and the feeling of losing control.

The 60 minutes play time was quite doable.  The game did not outstay it's welcome.

I think the chaos level was a little high too.  I don't mind chaos if you don't give the illusion of long term planning.  In Red Planet though, you are given long term goals, and have to make blind bids, all the while the game board can shift drastically before your actions take place.

RATING: 8
Mission:Planète Rouge has a great theme, excellent artwork and some cool - though poorly produced - components (particularly the rockets). The scoring is perhaps too luck-based given the relative importance of the bonus and discovery cards, which is one of many ways in which M:PR is NOT AT ALL like El Grande. Even the majority scoring is different; in El Grande there is scoring for second and, often, third place in a region whereas in M:RP only the leader (or joint leaders) score. El Grande is a much more subtle game.

I was instantly drawn to the theme of this game.  The artwork is amazingly evocative, and the basic mechanisms sounded solid.  So, I was very relieved when the game play turned out to be equally solid.  This game will not set the world on fire, but it does breath life into the Citadels system, and I find this game to be superior.  Recommended.

PAINFULLY random thx to discovery and mission cards.
If not this 'little' problem I would've thought of this game as clever, irresistibly charming and fun to play.

There are important decisions to take, a focus on your plan is required as well as a bit of predicting co-players' moves.  But all this is marred by the randomness...

As can be expected from the "Bruno's", a chaotic mess of a game here. 

Maybe I'm a little harsh as at least the gametime here is something tolerable like an hour and it does keep you interested but the randomness and chaos really spoils what could have been a decent game.

The fast gameplay and one hour or less game time means you could still play it for fun and not feel as burned as Shogun which is 3 hours or more HOWEVER  you can be heavily burned in this game. I watched a fellow player get ruined in the last turn by a final card in his territory getting turned up which kicked him out of that territory completely, this also spoiled his endgame bonus card he had been planning for all game and made the difference between winning and losing....BLEECH!

Area majority meets role selection and chaos wave riding, all bound together by a Victorian sci-fi theme.

I love the theme and really like the style of the artwork. The game itself is more abstract and euro'ish than I had anticipated. Now, while the basic area majority game works fairly OK (without feeling particularly great), I really don't like the guesswork involved in the simultaneous selection of roles. And I really, REALLY don't like the general level of chaos in the game: Having your astronauts sent to another location than you planned for, having your spaceship blown up because of an arbitrary decision made by an opponent, not knowing what type of resource an area holds beforehand, and of course the completely wild discovery cards, which secretly alter the values of areas. Yikes.

All in all, this is definitely not my kind of game and I hope I won't have to play it again.

Meh, doing something exciting in this game requires sticking your neck out so far that you're pretty well done if it gets chopped. The bonus cards are really swingy as well, as most discoveries just suck to draw. I don't feel compelled to play this again soon.

I'll start by saying that I'm not a real Citadels fan, and this game has much of the same 'feel.'  Players each choose a role at the start of the turn and, when their role is activated, take the actions provided.  Unlike Citadels, where everyone is playing to their own card set, in this game everyone plays to a common board.  During a scoring round the sole leader in a board area scores points.

That is where the game fell flat for me.  Some of the roles are too powerful and others appear to be too weak.  In order to get back a card that was used previously, you have to play the weakest role to get them back... in effect passing your turn.  Because there are only 10 turns in the game, this can be disasterous.

After playing games like El Grande, which award more than one player in an area with a reduced number of points, Red Planet ONLY awards the leader in an area which tends to imbalance the game.  Even though there is some compensation due to "Bonus Cards" and 'dead' units, it is NOT enough to make up for any shortfall.

At least three times during the last game played, a player was denied points that he had been working toward because another player decided, "on a whim," to reset the destination of a ship.

Some of the card roles randomise the play area too much meaning that there can almost be no long term planning... you might as well play your cards at random.  By the end of the game it was basically just screw the opponent on your left because you're not going to get what you want anyway...  much too chaotic even for my tastes.

I think that I'm being generous by giving this game a '5'... but it does have some pretty bits.

Update:  I played one more time... and I won.  The game does have its moments, but I still think that it is entirely too chaotic.

RATING: 7
I am so not a fan of area control but role-selection on the other hand......I think this game does a great job of mixing the two.  The roles have a delicate balance that makes choosing one each round a welcome element to the game.  Besides, this is very light and NOT a nasty area control game.

Best with more players.  I think its likely to be more durable than citadels.  The role cards are better.  It's easier to guess what the other players are likely to do.  It's still got a bluff factor, and the 'screw a player over' but it's more manageable.

I really like the rocket loading and launch mechanic in the game. I think my main criticism of the game is not the chaos per se, but that there is no reward for 2nd place when an area is scored. It is "all or nothing" for all of the points unless there is a tie - so the effect of the chaotic elements is amplified in the scoring.   It is another one of those games for me that my enjoyment is somewhat contingent on the game clocking in at around an hour or less.

I finally got to try M:RP and loved it. I'm a sucker for steampunk art/themes, so I was biased going in. But the game play was great, I like the combination of role selection and area control. We had already gamed for three hours so were playing with probably less strategy than we could've - but it was one of those games that have me chomping at the bit to try again. 

Some that I have played this with are unhappy with the level of chaos, considering the short game.  But the chaos to me is entirely consistent with the theme of rockets going to Mars - what could be more unpredictable than space travel!  Plus, if you know the game, you can mitigate the risk and adjust strategy accordingly - for example focusing on the inner regions that are safer and not vulnerable to soldiers and discovery cards.

Upgraded to 10, I'd play this anytime.  Just the right amount of chaos and strategy, perfect theme/mechanism mix, fast enough to play with newbies but meaty enough to play with (most) gamers.

OOP.

RATING: 6.8
Entertaining game with a great theme. I love the role selection; not surprisingly as I also love Citadels.  

On our first game, we used the resource tokens to score Discovery bonuses before realizing that some of the Bonus cards depend on how many resources of a type a player has. You'll need to keep a score pad and pencil. And remember, after the 10th round, evaluate Discovery card events first!

While the game is always fun, it can be chaotic with 5 players. I think the sweet spot might be 4. Some players suggest that with 5, more backstabbing and alliances form.

A tactical game with very little long term strategy. Not much better with 4.

Astonishingly simple combination of simultaneous role selection combined with majority scoring. Nine different roles, ten rounds, three increasingly important scorings. My single problem is the luck element introduced by the event cards. I drew two good bonus cards which made me the winner, the other guys only drew discovery cards. Still fine so far for such a quick game. 

Two reservations: Probably, with the full complement of five players the chaos factor would be too high for my liking. Also, we made the rules mistake that we all revealed our role cards simultaneously which reduces the chaos a bit and increased my enjoyment.

A very nice surprise of a game.  I'm not a fan of the theme (who knew there were so many people already familiar with the term "steampunk" - I had never heard of it before!), but the way the game works is very interesting.  Even though that's what everyone says, in this case I think "everyone" is right - it is just like a combination of El Grande and Citadels.  The game moves very quickly and the rules are quite simple.  However the choice of the 9 different character cards can be very difficult to make as you start to second guess your opponents.  You can play as gently or as cutthroat as you like, it seems like there is a lot of room for player personality to shine through.  It does seem that the later rounds are of significant importance due to the increased rewards.  Skillful choice of the character cards should really make up for the fairly chaotic nature of the game.  It's a lot of fun!

An intriguing area-control game mixed with some Citadels character selection. The theme is interesting, the game plays very quickly and there's quite a bit going on with the secret missions everyone is trying to complete.

Components are varied. Not enough score tokens (we ran out in the final round, which was extremely troublesome). Ships and board are nice, but the astronauts were these small, round things which rolled everywhere. And the character cards definitely needed some graphic-aids, because with 9 characters, it would be easier to look at a graphic and see immediately how many astronauts you can deploy rather than read each card one by one.

Interesting game that combines Faidutti's "Citadels-like" role-selection mechanic with area control scoring. The board and bits are really pretty and the art on the cards is both quirky and beautiful. I tend to have trouble getting my head around area majority games, but this one works better for me than most.  Very enjoyable and reasonably quick.

Asmodee had me at the theme.  The graphics are gorgeous and evocative of the "steampunk" theme.  MRP is a fun game that plays quickly and adds an interesting twist to the area control mechanic with the addition of role selection (ala Citadels).  The result is an intense game where players must outguess, outwit and outplay their opponents in order to claim final victory.

There's nothing new here, it's just Citadels-style role selection with some area control and a cute steampunk Mars theme, but it's an incredibly satisfying amount of game.  Unlike, say, Citadels, the duration, weight, and decision load are just perfect.

Good theme, but not great carry-through. Combination of Citadels and El Grande works most of the time but randomness and screw-your-neighbour tactics by opponents can easily squash strategy. Fun, but problematic at times, as random card draw can easily determine bonus point victory, and random rocket flights can potentially shut out certain players.

In Mission: Red Planet, players work as mining companies compete to send astronauts to Mars in order to colonize and mine for recently discovered materials. Over the course of 10 rounds, players play one of their special agents every round to help fill the rockets heading to Mars with their own astronauts while simultaneously working to prevent their opponents from doing the same. Once landed, these astronauts must gather to control specific regions of the planet, each yielding one of the three resources: Celerium, Sylvanite, or Ice. After rounds 5 and 8, players gain score tokens for every region where they control the majority of the astronauts. At the end of the game, players score one final time, adding any bonuses received from Discovery Cards and Bonus Cards. The player with the most score tokens at the end controls Mars, and all the riches it can bring!

RATING: 6.5
An OK game that plays very fast and scales decently.  However, there's a lot of randomness and unpredictable interactions.  It's not a bad game, but it's somewhat too simple and I derive limited fun from it, mainly from the feeling that nobody is really in control.

RATING: 5
There are interesting ideas and the game is not so bad. It just did not catch me. In our game,  it did not even happen that we put a discovory( can't remember how they called it) under the board. One of the reason is that you have absolutely no Idea if you are going to have the majority in a certain area at the end of the game to get the discovery. So I am wondering if this mechanic is really usefull.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's very much like a "Citadels area influence/majorites" lightweight game that should play in an hour once you get acquainted with the character/role cards.  There are three scoring rounds and they climb progressively so the third score (last) round of the game is huge.  Text on the cards was too small and the font size should've been bigger.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Chaotic fun if you enjoy that type of thing!  Each person has a deck of 9 different types of characters (much like Citadels by the same designer) which you select one to use each round.  One character, the recruiter, allows you to pull back all your previously used characters to use again.  In the game, you seek to gain majority control in 11 different regions in Mars and scoring rounds occur after the 5th, 8th, and 10th (final) round.  First scoring round one chip of the appropriate resource is available for scoring, second scoring round two chips are available, and in the final round, three chips and the resource itself is available for scoring.  Different event cards can effect the seven outside territories for final scoring or provide you with bonus scoring opportunities.  The game appears to be poorly made as a couple chits are coming apart; others have had issues with board warpage.  I'd prefer to stick with Citadels if going for a chaotic role selecting game and the artwork does nothing for me.

Wow! Production value is exceptionnal, theme is REALLY well integrated, it blends some "classical" mechanism : majority + role selection... what can you ask for more? Fun? Yes indeed! This game is a pleasure to play. Since role selection is simulatenous game duration is almost the same with 3 or 5, all decision are really important (especially when using the Recruter). The Bonus and Discover cards are a nice addition. For some people this game might have too much chaos (or too few control) but Bruno has already published a "more strategic" variant on his web site. For my part I found that it is a perfect blend of strategy (when you are 2 turns away from a scoring round it's important to know which cards you'll play in advance), tactic (how do I use the Explorer to move my astronaut to get a majority before a scoring round) and luck (damn terrotist)! A real gem! And the graphics are so enjoyful. Long live Steampunk rocket!

RATING: 6
Mission Red Planet takes the role system from a game like Citadels, crosses that idea with the action selection mechanism from a game like Race for the Galaxy, and then has you taking control of regions and scoring points at set intervals just like in El Grande. Throw in a deck of bonuses (which has a smattering of "chaos" cards") and you have a game that's 70% strategy and 30% luck. It plays very well if you don't over think it. Our group played it in an hour including a brief explanation.

Worth playing again, and certainly as the filler-like game that most people describe it as. This was a 4 player game and certainly I think that 5 players would up the chaos level, but again its' such a short game you probably won't care.

I enjoyed the game but I have to say that the printing on the cards in the release I played was dreadful.  Not only was the text very small but there were extra letters and letters missing.  I was told that they offered reprinted cards for free but the set we played with was real bad.  Still not a bad area control game.  The theme fits with the spaceship launchings and such.  (it helps when you make noises when the launch)  I will probable play this again as it makes a great under and hour game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Fun game. It's like Faidutti built a new layer on top of Citadels. The theme is very cool, as are the illustrations. If I have any gripes about it, it's that, at least during the first game, you have no idea what you're doing and since there are no obvious strategies, there's a feeling of "Alright, I'll just play this card and see what I can do with it.". If this doesn't carry over to further games (which I may or may not find out), then that's fine.

Rated as an excellent 3 player game. It's hard to find anyone's comments or reviews that are not positive.

Plays quickly. Some say even more quickly than Citadels.

Apparently it is like Citadels with an area control element, thereby being referred to as a combination of Citadels and El Grande.

RATING: 6
Chaotic fun game. I like the simultaneous role selection, game length, area control mechanisms, but the sense of control is a bit too slim. Monster point swings can occur due to hidden bonus cards. In first game I accidentally knocked a player from first to last place while trying to slow down someone else. If you don't mind chaos, give it a try.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It looks great, and has good laughs, if you don't overthink it. 

Underways there are some interesting tactical considerations, but even if you get those right, you might still loose to bad luck (the cards that are stuck under the board can swing everything) ... all in all, Red Planet really is quite random.

I don't know why, but generally I dislike area control, which this game is.

I bought a copy of this in a sale once, read the rules, thought it sounded okay, but then never actually played it. This probably stems from my disappointment with the component quality. Neither of the two game boards would lie flat on the table, there were colour alignment issues that made the face of many cards look funky, and the look and feel of the wood and cardboard (despite the absence of a country of origin label) was remarkably similar to that which came from many of the early cheap Chinese productions (prior to their manufacturing improvements in the last few years). I ended up giving the game away in the Chain of Generosity.

I've heard rumours this might get reissued with different artwork from a new publisher. If that happens, I'll give the game a look-in.

Normally, area-majority and chaos aren't my favorite things in games, but here they're combined just right, giving a game that feels remarkably like El Grande-lite. That's a good thing.

This one was hard to wrap my head around after just one play, and I'm 99% sure we did the points wrong. That said, it combines Citadels, El Grande, and a little of Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy -- three games I love and one I can't stand (RftG), which is a pretty good formula.

I love the role selection and role cycling mechanics, but the area control aspect is a little too much of a black box for me. It's swing-y because of the discovery cards, and with only 10 rounds it seems unlikely that peeking at them will ever be a great option. Since it's impossible not to compare to El Grande, I also prefer the tiered scoring for areas in EG.

Again, tough to call on one play. The premise, components, and vibe are great; the rulebook has some clarity issues.

After about three years of considering it for game nights but never actually bringing it, I took that as a sign that I wanted to like this more than I actually liked it, so I sold it.

Must play - The first time we played this, the game went smoothly, and quickly.  It was fun and everyone enjoyed it, as it was a close race to control the ressources and realize our secret objectives.  I know many people don't like the unpredictability of the event cards, but there is some variants to lower the impact of these events and keep the chaotic nature of the game intact, yet controllable.  A good game with the right people.

Role selection/area control game with a great theme. Never plays too long and is always welcome on the table, shame the cards are weird, unsleevable sizes. Can be quite nasty and the Discovery cards try to shoehorn bluffing into a game too short to support it.

Edit: New 2015 edition is not as nice to look at, but still fine and mechanically tightens up the flabbier bits of the original.

RATING: 6.5
Can't take this game too seriously. A great opener or closer. Not that it's overly short or light; there are plenty of backstabbing opportunities as well as a fine bunch of 'take that' moves, but who wins may be more of a function of randomness rather than smart play. You certainly can play poorly but playing well by no means means you'll do well.
Still...a great fun game with the right group.

I like this game, but not as much as I thought I would.  I love Citadels and area control games - this is a nice combination of the two so I should like it more, but I don't.  I find that the Event cards don't lead to randomness in the end, but rather they add some long-term strategy to what is otherwise a very tactical game.  It plays quickly and just looks so cool.  It's a keeper for me because it's just so cool.  However that being said, there are other area control games I prefer to play (El Grande and Trias) that are more satisfying.  It's a fun experience, but doesn't have the overall satisfaction level of those ones, hence a lower rating.  It is growing on me over time, though, now that I know what to expect from it and see it as more role-selection and second-guessing than area control.

Really nice design. I like the selection of the roles and how it interacts with the area control -- some interesting decisions to be made, but nothing overwhelming. Really great playtime (45-60 mins). Minor quibbles; the role of the scientist (and the objectives/discovery cards) felt very tacked on and unecessary; also I would have probably prefered a 11 or 12 round game to have a better chance of planning and executing my stragety (and make the playing of the '1' character more important)
Update: definitely better with 3 or 4 players

A cross between El Grande King and Intrigue, Citadels and a touch of Monkeys on the Moon but somehow it manages to play much more chaotically than all three.  I've only played once and cannot quite figure out why it's "so" bad.  I expected a bit of chaos but suprised to see that the majority of my decisions seemed pointless.  Perhaps with some experience it plays better, it seems like a system that should work but sadly it's something I don't want to try again anytime soon.

Citadels meets El Grande in a SteamPunk setting.

End game scoring with the discovery cards a bit too chaotic and can easily be the margin between winning and losing in a close game.

Very similar to Citadels. You choose from 9 different character cards with special abilities each round. Instead of creating buildings, you're sending men to mars where there is an area majority mechanic. I think I may like this better than Citadels. I definitely like that there is a set number of rounds, so the game won't go on forever which sometimes happens with Citadels.

Intense fun - the game I wish Citadels was - adding the area control to the card selection/special ability mechanic adds a layer of strategy that makes this a pleasure to play. Exquisite components - visually appealing; uber-thick cardboard, and a kajillion colors. Charming steam-punk theme (and I have a soft spot for steam-punk.) Still not as engaging or meaningful as other area control games (Dominant Species, Chaos In the Old World, etc)

RATING: 7.75
Excellent "Euro" game with just enough screwage to really make it fun. Each player has a group of characters that they are launching to Mars in ships.  You are trying to satisfy secret missions while trying to prevent others from doing the same.  Great game!  Easy rules, great steampunk artwork, and not overly long to play.

"Try before you buy.  Try before you buy.  Try before--"  SMACK!  Wake up!  How depressing:  a steam-punk themed game from an established designer who has made two other games I adore, and it's just a pile of chaos to me.  It just seems so close to working, but I just don't have the time to fiddle with it.  Both games, no matter what I do, I'm buried tin the rubble, and there's absolutely no way to plan.  The rules are also not what I'd call air-tight at all.

I think I have a third game in me, in case I'm wrong.  After that, a NY apartment only has so much space...

RATING: 9
This little gem from Asmodee combines elements of an area control game with similar mechanics to Citadels in that each player must choose a character from their hand each turn and use the benefits of that character.

The game has 2 key phases. First the players must aim to get their astronoughts onto the spaceships that are waiting to launch. Once launched the astronoughts will reach a territory on Mars. Each scoring phase (3) will allow the player which controls each territory to gain the points offered by the mine present.

The inclusion of charcater abilities, secret mission cards and event cards help Misison: Red Planet climb to the level of quality game.

By the by the game is very attractive, right down to the box art.

[b]Mission: Red Planet[/b]
3-5 players

A light area-control game by [person=125][/person] creator of Citadels. 

Theme: Steam punk - Colonization of Mars.

Simple rules. Little down time. A 60 minute game.

For those who know Citadels (Spletke) by the same game designer:

In Citadels, players choose each and every round from a shared set of up to 9 character roles to play, whereas in Red Planet, each player has his very own set of 9 character cards to choose from. Each character having a unique ability.

The character roles are: Recruiter, Explorer, Scientist, Secret Agent, Saboteur, Femme Fatale, Turist Agent, Soldier, Pilot. 

In Red Planet, once a character is used it is discarded from the game. However, the Recruiter character has the ability to return all discarded characters.

In Citadels, it is a race to be the first to build a certain number of buildings(and have the highest aggregate property value), whereas in Red Planet, the winner is the player who has scored the most points from controlling regions on Mars. There are 10 rounds of play, three of which are scoring rounds.

The two games feel very different.

Check out the game designer´s interesting blog, it is both in French and English:

A very simple and straightforward game with a wealth of possibilities.  A weird mix of El Grande (area control) and Citadels (secret jobs). Rating of 7 after one play.  Somewhat difficult to get the hang of with the French edition as we were constantly having to check out 'cheat sheet' to see what the characters could do.  We caught on quickly though, so I don't think that an English copy would be necessary to enjoy.  One would still need the sheet for the Event cards, but they are few and far between and so do not slow the game down much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Mission: Red Planet is a strange game. Mechanically it takes the single-turn duration, simultaneous role selection from Citadels and attaches an area control game to it. (Gratefully, it does so with only a slight increase in complexity.) By adding a prospecting element to the area control, the greedy, every-man-for-himself, chaos that ensues during gameplay gives the feel of a Wild-West gold rush, but it is amazing how M:RP's designers' choice to make the contested location Mars pulls the theme from a Western to Science-Fiction. Yet, by making the art-style steampunk they turned the theme back around towards the Wild-West when it was headed into the territory of Joss Whedon's Firefly. Its just... weird.

Good though. All 9 selectable role cards are powerful and give players the feel of being able to strongly affect the outcome of each turn. The chaos that then occurs makes it difficult to formulate concrete multi-turn strategies, but is player-driven so it doesn't feel like the game itself is slapping you around. There are a lot of "Take that!" actions, but the steadily increasing value of holdings as the game progresses dulls the urge for revenge-based gameplay as wrongs inflicted during early rounds do not matter much in the grand scheme. Still, M:RP incites cross-table trash talking and threats of in-game violence making for lively games.

A bit of Alien Frontiers mixed with Citadels.  

I enjoy this game.  The scoring I do not like though.  You gain control of an area you score those points in addition to knocking someone down a peg by taking away their points.  The swings are too much for me, but the game still is a great experience.

According to the blurb, this game started with the theme; strange, then, that the theme should feel so loosely pasted on. That aside, this is a decent blend of majority control and rôle selection ([i]a là[/i] Puerto Rico).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice area majority game with screwage elements from Citadels. It's not as evil though; in theory it is, but the screwage tends to be smaller than you think (Pilot is a notable exception). It makes up for this by being chaotic on the Mars end though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun game developed around the Citadels idea by adding an area control mechanic that plays very fast. You don't have time to get bored.

The Citadels mechanic is very enjoyable, and the rocket's idea and the characters' powers are really fun. There's room also for strategy (even if there are not many different ideal paths; see below).

The rules are very simple to teach and to learn. This is the type of game you can play with just about anyone. 

My biggest complain is the balance. There are characters more powerful than others. For example, the Scientific is great, because it places 2 astronauts and you get a card (likely a bonus card that will earn you at least 6 points). Since you have to at least use the Recruiter once, it's likely that you will play the Scientific and Travel Agent twice. That also makes players tend to use the same characters on the same round (in my second game I matched Luis' character in at least 6 rounds, and Bruno's in at least 4), especially the Explorer on rounds 5 and 10, to move cubes and maximize your points.

That makes me question the longevity of the game. I have only played 3 players game up to now. Maybe it changes with more players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impression: I like how the role selection gives everyone a chance to do a bit different things and also to choose whether you go early in a turn or later. Some characters can do quite nasty things to other players but everyone has the same cards and there aren't many things you can do to astronauts on Mars. So there is (sometimes very nasty) player interaction but it's limited in a way that not too much can be done to already established good positions on Mars. Game feels a quite thematic and steampunk theme is something you don't see too often in euros.

A chaotic area majority game with a Faiduttian turn order / role selection system. Lots of outguessing. 

The neat graphics on the box cover do not extend to all components: The event cards and the planet board are far less fancy than the box and the character cards. The board of the French edition does not seem to want to lay flat on the table.

Quite nice, and very French, but I'll have to test this again to find out whether the game is even too chaotic.

Some cards create some balance issues.  Production quality is also somewhat quite low. Though the shuttle-to-planet mechanism is very nice, the presence of "I Win" cards makes it just too lucky of a game for me to enjoy.  A game is quite bad when a viable strategy by one player is completely undone by the lucky draw of a card by another player, and sadly, Mission Red Planet falls flat in this area.

This is a game where you feel like you have more control of what you are going to accomplish each turn than you actually do. The launch pad acts as a "blender" everyone submits their desired actions to and then waits to see what pops out. I'm not saying it's not strategic because it most certainly is, it's just not as direct an interaction with the area control board as I would personally like it to be. I can see the appeal, and a couple of my game group regulars like it, but it is just not for me.

One of the better role selection games.  Very underrated game. Such a short rulebook! That is a big plus as far as teaching it.

It has take that, which I usually don't like, but I think it works very well here. I really like the element of trying to guess what roles others are going to play, and seeing the payoff when they are guessed correctly.

RATING: 9
It's a fun game for up to 5 people, and there's a feeling of theme throughout. The chaos factor doesn't bother me at all, nor the screwage potential. 

My wife--not a gamer--liked it a lot, right off the bat. I think it's just about a perfect contemporary board game, as it's easy to learn, plays quickly, gives players a lot to think about for choices, changes its factors for each game, and is neither too long nor too short. There's also even an aspect of screwage, but not overly so. 

The components are mixed, as the playing board has warped somewhat, and even the designer wrote that it was stupid of the game company to provide little round, colored, wooden pieces to represent 'astronauts.' But the other pieces have nice art and are sturdy, thick, coated cardboard.

In all, one of my picks for what should be a new generation of standard family strategy games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
At 45 minutes a play, it's actually pretty fun.  Don't expect a super-deep thinkfest and you won't be disappointed.

Except in the component quality of the English edition, that is.  Asmodee should be ashamed of themselves.  Quite possibly one of the five worst-equipped games I own.  Misprinted cards, chunky boards that won't lie flat, a box that's a challenge to fit the bits back into, well, you get the idea.

A great intro to the majority genre. Plays in about 45 minutes, simple strategy, but still fun. The benefit of seeing where the points will be allocated gives the game that "screw your opponent" factor, which we all love! Good to introduce a beginner to the genre.

This is an area control game in which you needed to fill up spaceships going to different regions of Mars, and then have the most astronauts in that region during three scoring rounds.  This game was pretty fun, but I was a little frustrated at how only the player with the most guys scored, leaving everyone else out in the cold.  The role selection mechanic with the special abilities on the role cards worked very well, though.

Acquired in a large trade in May, 2013. This game really looked great, and I am sure I would have liked it. Just could not get to the table with the current group I have, theme would have turned them off. I can't get China out though. Or Hansa. So, I had to get rid of this.

Gets better with additional plays as you learn what the event cards do. More players, more fun, especially great with 6 as the board fills up with astronauts. Not for deep-in-thought gamers, but terrific for those that want to laugh, trash-talk, and don't mind some fun chaos.

I really like this game, a friend gave it to me cause he got the new version.

I like the area majority with the twist of the card choosing and ship area majority, the points are a bit weird.

It is like a "mini" El Grande? I dunno

Anyway, great little game.

Not bad. Game play is quite similar to "Citadels" -- at least by way of role selection. But this one has a spatial area control element. If you like that kind of them and you like lighter or easy to learn games, this might be for you. Pretty abstract, theme wise however.

I love to play citadels, but if given the chance between playing that or this, I would play Mission: Red Planet for sure. It does mix so many features I like and they blend so well together. I also feel strongly that the theme was pretty well put in the game, and the steampunk art really works for me. It feels like mixing Citadels and El Grande in a big package. Can't wait to play this one again.

On order from Thoughthammer.com.. what can I say?  I'm a big fan of this genre - victoria steam rockets, poking planets in the eye.  Wicked!

Update: Arrived, and I'm exploring the components as I type.  Initial thoughts?  Very impressive components, from the art to the cutouts, the board and the plastic insert itself.  Big marks here.  The GAME, however, remains to be qualified.

Update:  I played a game, got absolutely thrashed by my 2 opponents.  I'll chalk it up to inexperience, and hopefully will play better next game.  Components are obviously fantastic, although it'd go a long way if the 'astronauts' actually looked like 'astronauts' and not 'Painted Puerto Rico Settlers'

Update: Played two games, but just can't give it a number yet.. My initial 'wow' factor has worn off.. the overly-laquered box makes it akward to use, there is a very poor insert and the pieces do not fit well at all. Fast, but .. bleh .. more plays required.

Update:  I had this on my trade pile for a long time.  There were offers, but nothing that really seemed to fit.  I'm glad I didn't trade it because I recently played it again and really enjoyed myself!  I think I'll hold on to this now.

This game is a basic area control game, where the actions are fueled by player's simultaneous role selection from their symmetrical series of cards. At this point I've seen the role selection element a few times already in games I love such as Glass Road and Rococo, but here it's still enjoyable even if it feels a little basic now. I will say that not all the bonus cards are of equal usefulness, and the game plays fast once people are familiar with the roles so it can be hard to get a significant board presence if you don't get a strong start.

Send your astronauts to Mars in Steampunk style. Has a mix of Role selection, which also determines turn order and area control for scoring. Each player has the same set of roles and choose one each round. One role allows you to reset the roles you have. Mars has different areas, where you score based on majority. In the final scoring there are bonus scores for areas and objectives and some areas become worthless. I try not to over-think the roles there is too much randomness for that. A quick game but not one I care about.

RATING: 7.5
First impression of the material; Asmodée should be a shamed of the material quality on that game. This is unacceptable to supply material of that sheepness for the price asked for the game. When I opened up the box, the two boards (main board and shuttle board) were warped because the carton of the bords is to thin. What were they thinking.
The game is a mix of Citadel and El Grande that is very effective. There is always a lot of interactions between players and chances of back stabing you adversaries. The rules are light and easy to learn. The text on the caracter cards is well written and easy to understand with result that the game plays rapidly.

Première impression du matériel, Asmodée devrait avoir honte d'un matériel de si basse qualité. Il est inacceptable de demander un tel prix pour un jeu dont le matériel est de si piètre qualité. Lorsque j'ai reçu le jeu les deux plateaux de jeu montraient des signes de gauchissement causé par le qualité du carton qui est trop mince.
Ceci dit Mission Planète Rouge est un mélange de Citadel et de El Grande qui est vraiement efficace. Il y a beaucoup d'interactions entre les joueurs et la chance de poignarder ses adversaire dans le dos. Les règles sont légères et faciles à comprendre. Le texte sur les cartes est bien écrit et facile à comprendre ce qui accélère le rythme du jeu.

I've played Mission: Red Planet once with 5 players and down time was awful and I kept getting slammed by all the other players because they couldn't slam the person they wanted to.  And I still randomly came in 2nd.  Go figure.  Anyway, I have no interest in playing again.

OK, if it wasn't a Bruno Fiadutti game I would have rated it a 7.5 - so I'm partially biased.  ;)
Good combination of role-selection and area-control, combined with event cards to mix up the action. After another play, I'm interested in how this would play with 3. 

The best part of M:RP is the seamless combination of area-control with role-selection. 2nd best is the fast play time (it is more than just a filler).

The worst part about M:RP is that the winner is likely the one that dodged the most conflict. In the 1st 3 turns, people are pitted against each other, and the mechanics don't allow for re-adjusting your positions easily. Once you're in conflict with someone in a zone, it's hard to dislodge someone from another. By Turn 4 it's pretty accurate to guess who the winner will be.

Area control game with several interesting twists, chief among them being the role selections much like Citadels except the same role can be selected by several players on the same turn, and a player can't selecte the same role twice (with a way around that).

Flavors of Citadel and El Grande blend into this sci-fi adventure.  This game has quite a bit of potential, but the initial bonus cards seem a bit unbalanced and may give some players too much of an edge.  Spaceship-shaped cards are nice to look at, but not so easy to shuffle/mix.  Playing a second time only increased my respect for this game.  Playing a third time makes me question whether or not this game is different enough between plays to make it compelling enough to keep playing.

Area control, role selection, and missions, along with a steampunk/1800s space exploration theme. Nothing innovative, but a great blend of awesome mechanics in a fun and quick game. Players use different roles to equip, launch, and guide thir astronauts to different regions in Mars, attempting to win points there via majority presence during scoring rounds. Some roles (e.g. the saboteur) can derail plans by swapping astronauts, changing a ship's course, or blowing up a rocket. At game end, players score bonuses as well, such as for completed missions on their event cards.

Simultaneous role selection coupled with area control.

I found this to be quite fun.  Similar to the play in Citadels, I liked the aspect of the different characters and thier abilities.  During our first play, we had little idea of what to expect as far as scoring goes, so we didn't really compete correctly.  I think this one's learning curve is such that one play will provide you with the information of what is possible.  I look very forward to my second and later plays of this title.

It is very chaotic, but I don't have a problem with that because of the fast pace of the game, and the directness. There are 10 rounds, which go very fast, and there is a VP count at rounds 5, 8 and 10. Because of these frequent counts you have to be very economic with the few actions you perform between each count. A nuisance is that the gameboard breaks easily. I know of two copies of this game, and both of these have a gameboard that broke after a couple of plays.

**Update: Lots of chaos, bumped down 1/2 a point.

An Area Influence game at it's core. Most Area Influence games coming out have to have some neat way for you to get your pieces on the board and move them. Which makes sense because if you could just put your pieces anywhere you wanted then the game would be [i]very[/i] boring indeed. In Louis you place pieces where the cards says, and can then move them while leaving one behind with each move. In Tikal you have 10 Action Points to spend, which includes everything you do in the game from moving to adding more people to digging up Temples. In Mission: Red Planet you play cards that allows your pieces to be put on Rocketships that have specific destinations on the board, and when the ship is full, it drops your pieces off on the board at that location. Each Card is a "Role" and you can only play each card once in the game, until you play a specific retrieve card that gets you all you cards back. Each card will always let you add one or two (or three) pieces to a Rocket, and then let you do one other thing. Examples are to move three pieces on mars, launch a Rocket immediately, destroy one ship still docked, draw an event card, etc, etc. So it does have a little of the "screw with your neighbors" aspect, but its pretty minimal and evenly spread since everyone has the same cards available. I think its a good game, and intend to play it often.

We just got this game 2 weeks ago and have played it nearly a dozen times (between marathon rounds of Mare Nostrum).  Fantastic fun!  Even when getting used to an established strategy, the influence of the other characters and bonus/discovery cards always keeps you scrambling to readjust your goals.  The beauty here is a simple yet sensible strategy game that even my 8 year old daughter becomes the instigator to a play through.  Bravo for Mission: Red Planet - it has quickly become a game we're hungry to share with our non-gamer friends to get them into thinking beyond LIFE and Monopoly.

Players are in a race to colonize Mars in order to get valuable resources.  This is a game of achieving majorities in different areas, in the same vein as [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/93]El Grande[/url][/i]. As its predecessors, players don't have to much control of the game and limit themselves just to take the best of the situation shown.  There is more chaos than in other games of the type, cause normally the players know the options available, but here there is a secret simultaneos action selection and it's hard to tell who is going to play what.  Its Steampunk theme and graphics, set in the later 1800's, is a plus.

This game is like a fist fight in the back of a flatbed truck.  You can throw your punch but you might miss just as likely as you'll knock someone off the truck.  So much fun.

The area majority elements are limited, the incremental scoring is kind of wacky, and trying to read which of the NINE roles four opponents might choose is basically impossible at the beginning, but as the game wears on anticipation becomes much easier.  Plenty of decisions for such a light and quick game, tough to make them count at times though.

Really poor components, quality is good but the board don't unfold flat, the astronauts are discs that roll all over the place, and the insert is useless as it offers no where to store the dozens of space ships which are the most space consuming component of the game.

RATING: 4

It's actually got some neat mechanics and ideas. However...I think there are a few too many roles in the game. There's no angst about when to get them back in to your hand--it's likely to only happen once in the game. That's not very "interesting." 

Second--and far worse--is the disparity in Discovery cards. To have an entire region score NOTHING at the end of the game--and to have no idea and be able to do nothing about it--is unforgivable. 

The only way I'd likely play again is if we kept the Bonus cards and tossed out the Discovery ones.

Even if you have Citadels, I think this game can work in your collection. It's a mismash of different mechanics (role selection, area control, bluffing), kinda like Manilla is, but it works well. Also, it lasts the perfect amount of time for what it is. 45 minutes for a light game of 1800's Mars exploration?

The only downside is that the theme might not work for everyone.  But, there are those who will LOVE the game because of the theme. I know I do. And the artwork works really well with it too.

Great fun.  Citadels in space with area majority.

I really like it.  The scoring/vp side of things is typical area majority - quite dry and 'euro', calculatory conflicty sorta thing, but....

.... what makes this great is the other part of the game - role selection performed simultaneously injects masses of chaos into things.

This is fairly incongruous with the area majority bit and I wouldn't have thought this it would work - but it's like Bernaise sauce on chips - you may enjoy the two of them on their own or with other condiments and wouldn't think of putting them together.  But then you give it a go and BOOM!  A taste sensation.

These two opposite bits really attract and work really smoothly together and make for a game with a lot of fun.

Played at BGG.con '06. Broke the demo copy - I turned the board upside down and it fell apart into three pieces. Evidently I'm not the only one who's had issues with the poor quality of the board, I've heard other people complain of bubbling, and I saw another demo copy at BGG.con which looked as bad as mine (but without the broken board). The box is also problematic, sticks to itself, is annoyingly shiney, is way too big for the game once the insert is removed (and the insert needs to be removed because it's entirely useless).

It's a shame, because the rest of the components are exceptionally good - painted wooden discs for Astronauts, thick tiles for ships and scoring, fine cards... so why the shoddy board and box?

Oh, and one final complant about the rulebook: I looked in there for a tiebreaker and not only is one not listed, I didn't see mention of an actual win condition. I presume it's "most points wins," but I've never seen a game not say that before.

11/16/06: I'm starting to think I might like it better if the scoring thingies were distributed before the first round, so you know where you might like to go.

RATING: 5
This game has two main components: simultaneous role-selection and area-majority. I hate simultaneous role-selection. As for area-majority, I feel that the lack of rewards for 2nd place makes this game miss an important strategic element found in more conventional area-majority games. Specifically, I feel that Age of Empires III implements similar ideas in a better, more satisfying way, and the game time is almost comparable, since Mission: Red Planet has a lot of annoying AP and downtime where you can't help worrying about things that are random and out of your control. The decisions could have been streamlined a little bit, as I feel there are too many, with no interesting way to distinguish between them, besides just taking risks and leaving it up to luck (e.g. is that guy going to screw me or somebody else?).

Another secret role selection game in the vein of Grimoire and Witch's Brew. Like all games in the similar genre, it is a blend of double-guessing, bluffing, chaos and tactics. The roles and their effects are interesting and there are plenty of chances to sabotage others. The Event cards seem to be a hit-or-miss affair though. Despite its novel steampunk theme, I don't see myself wanting to own it anytime soon.

RATING: 5.5
What a mish-mash of gaming mechanics! Each player has a set of role cards (ala Citadels) that allow placement of astronauts as well as a special ability. The object is to launch ships to different zones in Mars in an effort to colonise it.

There are 3 scoring rounds with each terrain seeded with a different type of resource at the start of the game. To add even more chaos to the fray, there are event cards that either give secret objectives or affect payout at the different zones in Mars.

The game works overall but the Faidutti chaos is even more pronounced in this game. There's nothing original or terribly exciting. It's quite 'Meh'. The artwork on the cards are great but the component quality is shockingly poor (missing words on cards, a board that doesn't sit flat, etc).

I LOVE the theme and art, although I wish there was a little more meat to it.  Still, the game is brisk and fun.  The end bit does have its problems, maybe the points on the bonuses just need to be reduced.  The components definitely have quality problems (the board snapped in half in my hands...and it wasn't my game), but I understand the company has been very good about replacing components.

RATING: 8
Area Control, Simultaneous Action Selection. Solid area-control game. Nicely combines role-selection and turn order as the means to place control tokens (astronauts) in the contested areas of Mars. Nice steampunk theme and artwork. Scoring is a little more abstract than the rest of the theme, but a solid, enjoyable game. A friend bought a copy after we played it at BGG.Con 2006.

I later acquired a copy for really cheap and then ended up selling it. Couldn't quite justify having a second copy in the group, on my shelf.

Citadella plusz egy kis területi többséges mechanizmus. Semmi újat nem hoz a játék, igaz 2005-ös és csak így 2011-ben sikerült vele játszanom, de ettől függetlenül egyedül a nyelvfüggőségébe tudok belekötni. Persze könnyen magyarázhatók a kártyák és szerepek szövegei, de azért ez mégsem túl jó dolog. A Mars részekre osztott területein próbálunk többségbe kerülni űrhajósainkkal a háromféle nyersanyagért. A Marsra a játékosszámmal megegyező űrhajómennyiség indul különböző nagyságú kabinokkal. A 9 szerep közül sok elég konfrontatív. Még pár bónuszkártya és felfedezési kártya ad egy kis körítést a játéknak. Úgy érzem talán maximális játékosszámmal lehet a legjobb a játékmenet.

Let's take all of the simple fun of Citadels and cram it into an area control game, let's see what happens.  Highly chaotic, random effects for pay out.  Tough to control, easy to get screwed, and really not a whole lot of fun.  

That said the art is nice, a shame they used 6 point type so that you can't read the bloody cards.

I thought this game would drag a bit like Citadels does with my group. But once the roles are read once, they're really simple to understand. A good mixture of role selection, area majority, screwage, future planning, and special events through the cards. Oh, and the bonus cards give each player a mission throughout the game. My group is usually pretty slow (two hour T2R:E!) but with constant kid interruptions, we finished this in just a little over an hour.

Citadels with a board/area control.  Having more than just the role selection in the game makes this one a winner for me.  Also adore the theme. *Update* - not sure what I was thinking.

There's a lot going on in this area control game - plenty of decisions to make, plus the bonus cards for hidden objectives make you work toward something and help shape your strategy.

It reminds me a lot of El Grande with area control of certain territories and three scoring rounds.  However, there is a take that element here that can be annoying, where your best laid plans are altered almost randomly.  It's still fun, but there isn't enough control here compared to El Grande, so it's merely a good game instead of a great one.

This game was exactly what I was looking for.  (Did you just do a double-take of my rating?)  I had asked for recommendations from my fellow BGGers for a gift for my brother based on certain criteria, and this one fit the bill perfectly.  But unfortunately, while it was certainly a fun game, it fell a little short for me (and it's not just because I only scored 17 points while the other 3 scored 36, 53, and 56!).  The main problem for me was the level of chaos, although surprisingly it wasn't the event cards that were the problem for me (which is what most people seem to complain about regarding this game), but the character cards.  With this being my first game, I decided to center my strategy around accomplishing my initial bonus card, which was to get one astronaut into each region on Mars.  But with spaceships being destroyed, astronauts being killed, and destinations being constantly changed, I found it next to impossible to control the final destinations of my own astronauts.  The other problem for me is that there are simply too many character cards.  With a 10 round game and 9 different characters to choose from, there doesn't seem to be a great deal of tension over which character ought to be chosen for most rounds, and several of the characters are only used once per game (with the others being used twice or not at all).  I'd like to see the roles tightened up, reducing the number of them to 6, and leaving a little more control for the players.  Having said all that, I did enjoy the game and it was simple and quick-playing enough that we managed to complete the game (with all 4 of us being first-timers) in about an hour.  So in summary, I feel that this is a good game that could be made great with some serious tweaks of the character cards (and with the addition of some plastic dudes to replace the tiny little astronaut tokens!).  Game design: 2.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 6/10

Fun, short blend of role selection with area majority. The idea that some people could attack it as a hodgepodge of mechanics is absurd; they're integrated very well, and there's a refreshing level of vicious direct interaction.

RATING: 6
It's hard to say what I think of this game.  I really like games featuring simultaneous action selection and role selection (e.g., citadels).  Despite this, the game seems like it's missing something but I'm not sure what.  Maybe it's the limited turns.  I kind of felt as though I didn't have enough time to do very much, but maybe that was the designer's plan.  Getting points on Mars can be rather chaotic as well since it's hard to figure out what the hidden cards do for each section of the planet.  I have only played the game once with 3 players, so maybe I will like it more with 4 players.

Rating will follow.

This has the WORST insert ever. Without a lot of thinking and using small plastic bags the game doesn't fit into the box. It would probably make sense to throw the insert away but then the box is too big. The shiny box looks good but it's very hard to open. Also quality is very bad. (Some parts got damaged when removing them). The Mars and spaceship station boards don't stay flat. I don't want to force it, they might rip. Colors of the cards could be nicer and also I'd appreciate plastic astronauts instead of the wooden discs.
I'll give it -1 rating because of this.

The theme on the other hand seems really good. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent game, but there is just too much chaos for me, I think.  The cards that come up at the end can completely change the game, and only one person knows what each one is.  I like the art, and I like the roles, but the role selection is similar to Kreta, another area control game that is far superior.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Hmmmm... I love the Victorian steampunk setting and great artwork. The theme and early descriptions of "Citadels meets El Grande" made this a must buy for me. But...

The thematic artwork is destroyed by the shoddy components. The cardboard started to peel apart when punched. The boards don't lie flat and attempting to straighten them threatens to rip them at the seams. Quite a few font problems on the cards too (missing random letters). Cheap, cheap, cheap.

So, how does it play? Okay at best. Too many random elements throw out any balance that there may have been. I've heard that there is a "no luck" version of the rules out there. I'll have to try them out before my game completely falls apart.

Very good mesh of Citadels (pure role selection) and El Grande (pure area control), packed in a medium-weight package. Very good game, this sentiment is shared across my entire gaming group. 

Requires a set of like-minded individuals though, who all pay more or less the same attention to the opportunities. Persons that want to control everything will rate this game low as so much is simply beyond your control. 

Going into this game with a right mindset is key: lay low and push everyone in the right direction (which is, against each other). Destination draws make this game have its chaotic and luck-driven component, but a good tactical player can usually negate this by carefully influencing his opponents and simply making sure he has the robustness in his setup for some bad luck coming his way. 

Not for optimizers. Not for control freaks. Great for a pleasant evening of fun, tickles the same itch as  Small World.

Almost like Citadels in space. Great steampunk artwork. The gameplay, however, is fairly chaotic. You'd almost want to forget about planning too much in the long term because things will change drastically by the time it comes to your turn. Meant to be played as a light game, but some people will scrutinise their choices, making the game longer. Didn't see any mechanics that I thought was novel. Prefer Citadels instead.

One of the more enjoyable games early on in the 2006 season. Comparisons with Faidutti's Citadels is almost unavoidable. The pace at which this moves is an improvement and, as much as I like the Citadels theme, Mission: Red Planet is even better. The components, boards and artwork are outstanding. There's definitely a bit of screwage ... but players also have the ability to anticipate and do something about it, a feature missing in a lot of "take that" games. What keeps this from being an elite game is the imbalance in the event and bonus cards. Some are powerful, some do nothing. Some can pretty much randomly put a player out of contention in the end-game scoring. I know Faidutti likes a healthy dollop of chaos in his games, but this one really could have been improved with just a little more thought and balance put into these cards.

Probably plays best with 5 players, but 4 is very good too. Definitely a chaotic game with some strategy too, but it is mostly reacting to the situation on the board. Plenty of screwage opportunity, but it is not too bad since nearly every card can mess over the other players. The artwork is very nice, but both boards are difficult to lie flat and the launch board tore when I tried to get it close to flat. Still this is a nice game that is suitable for light gaming.

Mission: Red Planet is Citadels meets El Grande.  Or rather, Citadels PLUS El Grande.  There's almost too much going on here.  The production values are gorgeous and the proceedings are a bit leaden.  It's solid, but it doesn't crackle.

This game takes the role selection mechanic of Citadels and makes it more fun.  You can still attack other players, but it doesn't feel like other players' attacks are setting you back so much as it does in Citadels.  The theme is quite interesting as well.

Bruno! Bruno! Bruno! This game Is FAST. In my mind that might be the downfall of it as it ends pretty quickly.  I'm half expecting Asmodee to release an expansion "The other side of Mars" with a 2nd board and new characters/rocket destinations that will lengthen the game. At any rate that's just my musings (or wishes I dunno).  The game as is is great! I love the treachery involved in some of the characters. I love that each players has the same characters.  I love the Discovery card aspect. WOW Great GAME....thanks again Bruno!

Worst box insert ever though. Throw the insert out as soon as you open the box and things are fine. 

UPDATE: This game is why I hate BGG sometimes. When this game released it didn't do well despite being a brilliant game. It's still to this day my favorite role selection game and I've owned it since it frist came out in 2005! I eagerly awaited getting this and loved it. Still perhaps due to being from Asmodee who was not as prominent then as they are now it got looked over. I talked to Bruno about the game several times over the years and he said resolutely that due to low/slow sales upon release there would never be an expansion for this game that I loved. SIGH

Then retailers have a hard time getting rid of it. I've seen it sell brand new from retailers for as low as $9.00 which is just stupid cheap. Now we fast forward to 2013 and it's finally unable to be had. Out of print and due to it taking years to sell off will not get a reprint and guess what? Everyone and their brother feel they need a copy of it and it's price is sky rocketing. $50-$70 for used copies plus shipping. Geesh. It's stupid.

It is a very good game. But it feels like a combination of several games like Citadels and El Grande. The components on the other hand are excellent. There is quite a bit of fun and tension in this game and it goes fast. The players need to know the character cards well. The number of character cards, in my opinion, should have been less and more powerfull. At certain times you feel that certain cards do similar things. A player that knows well the cards and keep track of the cards of the other players will probably always win.

RATING: 7
Components are disappointing. Cards and ship counters have defects that could mark them. Boards don't lay flat. Box has no place to store the ships once you've punched them. [But: I do like the little astronaut discs, color choices in general, and the small size of the boards.]

I think this is the best Faidutti I've played (second being Dragon's Gold). There is a lot of chaos, but when evaluating my decisions I feel like they are real, and strategy can be used. I guess it is an interesting question, though, whether it is sufficient to have an illusion of control when making a decision, even if generally other players' actions make a mess of your planning.

I thought this would be a difficult game to play solo, but I find it hard enough to predict what will happen ultimately, that knowledge of which role another player chose doesn't seem to corrupt my choices for a different player.

The obvious comparison to another game I've played is Perikles [wrote this comment long ago]. Both games limit your (area majority) placement options at any given moment. I rated Perikles higher, probably due to less chaos and the feeling that I can think ahead a little.

...Tried Faidutti's "Total Control" variant which gets rid of the Scientist role and the discovery/bonus deck. It also makes certain of the possible scoring bonuses universal. Makes the game faster and a little easier to comprehend.

I observe that apart from the area majority game you play on Mars, the rockets themselves are like areas too. They add a random constraint to where you can drop astronauts on Mars, which in combination with the inherently chaotic simultaneous action selection makes it hard to see the player direction in what happens.

The simultaneous action selection is a bit like a blind bid, or at least blind selection of "bundled effects," in that you're picking what action you want to take at the same time as when you'll get to do it (which translates to: how similar the board will look to its current state by the time you get to go). It's probably worth trying to do without the blind selection component entirely.

While I said originally (over 2 years ago) that there was some illusion of control, I think I'm really just saying that I can make decisions based on the flawed assumption that the board will look just as it is by the time an action can be taken. And somehow I'm amused rather than frustrated at what results.

While I like that the game is pretty short, it seems like the chaos plus [i]too few moves[/i] makes it impossible to meaningfully aim for the various scoring possibilities that exist (i.e. various types of majorites). The randomness of the rocket destinations ties your hands enormously, and shifting your weight around once on Mars isn't that easy.

RATING: 5.5
Plays quickly and apparently quite sensitive to "gang up on the leader" syndrome. After my first game (in which I squeaked out a victory) I felt the game was too short, that I didn't have a chance to fully implement my strategy. I was grateful the second game was mercifully short--my fellow players, not unreasonably, perceived me as a threat and each, early in the game, made one play that affected my position negatively, which, in toto, very effectively took me out of the game (I scored 3 points, all in the last round).

In the one game played so far with five players, everyone had a lot of fun whether they won or lost.  We all want to play again, so this will definitely be hitting the table again in the near future.  I like the choose-a-role mechanism combined with area control of Mars.  Because players choose roles simultaneously, this game plays faster than Citadels.

I've read that some folk consider Mission: Red Planet to be a hodge podge of game mechanics resulting in a mess, and I can't emphasize enough how much I disagree with that.  Instead of a mess, several mechanics that have been around for a while have been combined to make a delicious playing experience, in which players can have an easy, fun time, while making real strategic decisions.  Mission: Red Planet is probably a high end medium weight game in complexity, but is simple enough that non-gamers can be coaxed into playing, and fun enough to keep them playing many times after that.  See my review for more details...

Great theme, great artwork, good components - this game is definitely great to look at. And although it is an unmistakable cross-over between Machiavelli (which I do not like) and El Grande (which I do like), it plays different enough from both of these titles to warrant a purchase. In order to like this game, however, you should have no objections against a little chaos: It is certainly true that you can win the first two scoring rounds and end up last after the final one. As long as you keep that in mind, and you do not mind quite a bit of luck, the game is very entertaining and perfectly suited to play with non-gamers. It also probably plays best with four players (although you should be allright with five).

RATING: 6
Another game with Bruno Faidutti's trade mark simultaneous action selection ala Citadels. Players choose role cards that are simultaneously revealed but executed based on descending numerical order to assign astronauts to spaceships destined for the different regions of Mars. Players engage in an area majority fight over specific Martian landscapes that produce one of three resources, Slyvanite, Celerium or ice. All three resources have different point values with ice being the lowest (1 point) but worth 9 points in the end for the player who controls the most ice tokens. Overall, the game plays 10 rounds, but goes by decently quick once players are familiar with the different character cards. While the game has a certain amount of chaos due to simultaneous action selection, event cards will drive how players focus their astronaut assignments on Mars. The one major concern I have that really detracts from the game is the availability of bonus cards. Players get a choice in the beginning based on the draw and if the bonus cards are not great, they will already be at a disadvantage. In addition, discovery cards are weaker than bonus cards and if additional draws of the event deck due only yield more discovery cards, they are at a huge disadvantage compared to players who have two or three good bonus cards. The end game scoring can result in almost doubling of the scores due to bonus points. One word about the theme, this is one instance where I feel the theme is wonderfully integrated into the game. The steampunk genre does not always work well, but it really shines in this game.

The scientist discovery cards mar an otherwise good game.  Their swinginess is WAY, WAY too high when compared to the rest of the point gains in the game.

My rating would be at least a point higher if their implementation was even remotely balanced.  The 6.5 is for the game if you just don't play with the cards at all.  If you chose to play with the cards, my rating drops a point and a half... maybe 2.

No idea who let them through playtesting, because I've played with NO group of players who did not unanimously agree that they were strongly flawed.

It would probably be too chaotic for some people. It also has a subtle humor to it. The art is wonderful.

Role choosing / area majority game, with a standard dose of Faidutti randomness included.

I like how the ships come out randomly, so the challenge is to figure out how to get your astronauts to the areas you want, either by redirecting ships, moving them around once they're on the planet surface, etc.

Still working on our 2 player rules, but we're close with using a neutral 3rd player, randomly choosing a role (making sure it can be performed), rolling a die to determine which ship to load, but always choosing actions that will lead to the greatest majorities for him.

Bruno Faidutti & Bruno Cathala; We wanted to make a game about colonizing Mars, with shuttles leaving the blue planet towards the red one. The theme is strong, and well caught in the steampunk graphic style decided by Asmodée. In Mission: Red Planet, each player plays a colonial power which sends astronauts, in space shuttles, to occupy the most promising zones on the planet. For scholars, the systems merge a majority game, à la El Grande or San Marco, with a character/action card system, somewhere between Citadels and Adel Verpflichtet. Category: Science Fiction, Space Exploration;  Mechanics: Simultaneous Action Selection, Area Control; also known as Mission : Planète Rouge

RATING: 6
The description above is correct: It's like a meld of El Grande-style area majority games and Citadels-type role-selection games.  It takes a game that requires a lot of planning and throws some chaos into the mix, and layers it with a wonderful theme.  If it lasted any longer, it would probably be a bad thing, but as it is, it's a nice balance of the two game styles.  My only issue is that the bonus cards can throw a lot of chaos into an otherwise balanced game, but I suppose you could leave them out of the game and have it be just as enjoyable.

Mission : RED PLANET1889. The Paris World Fair is the latest place to be, and the masses marvel at the latest technical achievements which are on exhibit there. Meanwhile, the big industrial trusts, supported by their governments, are planning their next step - the conquest of Mars and the mining of the fantastic ores found in its subsoil... Mission: RED PLANET is a majority control game, a character selection game, and an exploration game, with a balanced mix of bluffing and strategy. In order to charter shuttles to Mars, and take control of the regions where the most interesting minerals will be found, you'll have to make the best use of your nine characters' powers. The scientist can make mysterious discoveries, the saboteur can blow a rocket up before it leaves the launch pad, the pilot can change a shuttle's destination, and so on..

This plays almost exactly like Citadels but adds an area control component. I think it's superior to it's older brother in almost every way, except perhaps in portability. It's also fairly quick as board games go (even quicker than some longer games of Citadels I've experienced)so to me there is little downside to picking this up, if you can still find it. It's definitely under-rated.

A fun area-control game, assuming you can take a bit of randomness in how other player's actions and a few endgame cards affect you. You can adopt a strategy for the game based on your initial bonus card, but as each round passes and players' strategies begin to clash, you often start leaning on the aggressive cards to wipe aside the opposition and clear a path towards planet domination. (P.S. Don't play the Travel Agent on the first turn. You almost always get burned.)

Component problems: dumb insert, off-center and inadequate die-cutting, peeling money counters.  Game is decent but forgettable.  As with many euros, it is entirely derivative, but the synthesis here is at best equal to the sum of the parts.  The board is simply too static (or the game too short; pick your poison), and too much hinges on a core roshambo element that just isn't that interesting.

Played this with five and it was very chaotic.  Played it with four and loved it.  Simultaneous action selection + area control.

The simultaneous role selection mechanic is similar to Citadels in that it combines priorities with special abilities, leading to some really interesting trade-offs.  Many of the most powerful abilities have low priorities, making them risky to play since you might miss out.  Others rely on their low priorities to give you a powerful move that others can't respond to.  All of this is very interesting and full of double-think.  It works beautifully.

Unlike Citadels, roles are not drafted.  Instead, you select roles from a private set.  Once selected, a role cannot be selected again until you use a weak role that brings the whole set back into your hand.  Since a game lasts ten rounds and there are nine roles, you must do this at least once during the game.

The one flaw in the game, I think, is the huge value disparity in event cards.  Most bonus cards are worth 6-8 or more points, and therefore very valuable (if you can achieve the goal).  On the other hand, many discovery cards are of dubious value, and one (pretty rock!) is worth exactly zero.  In a game where scores seem to be in the 50s, the disparity between an 8 point card and a 0 point card, in a deck you draw from just once or twice a game, is just too much.  We plan to play around with some variants in the future where you draw, say, 2-3 cards and pick one.  Or perhaps separate the bonus cards and discovery cards, and draw from them separately (with an incentive for drawing discovery cards, if necessary).

RATING: 8
Awesome area control/hidden roll game.  I love just the fact of fighting for control on the planet mar, plus the fact of trying to figure out which card someone is going to play.  Such a great game and plays really fast, and is never a dull moment when playing this game.

RATING: 7.8
There's the chaos you'd expect from a Faidutti game but less than many of his games (maybe it's Cathala's influence). The components are nice but I had many tokens that were poorly glued together or not glued at all to my disappointment. All was fixable and doesn't detract from a fun game of area majority where there's plenty of options to alter your position on the board for point gains.

Played this with three newbies and the person who owned the game (obviously I was one of the newbies).  Really liked this game.  Gameflow was easy and fast.  I ended up tying with another newbie....we consulted the rules and found out there are no rules for breaking a tie!

In the end a majority game but underway several nice mechanisms and reminds me a bit of citadels ;-) (due to role selection)

RATING: 7
Pretty fun.  I like the role selection, especially.  Fairly chaotic with hidden bonus points, random values on Mars and other player's actions.  Does play in 1 hour, which is a welcome improvement over Citadels, which this game will inevitably be compared to.  Strategies will be varied depending on the number of players and whatever groupthink is going on.  Look forward to playing again.

This was a surprisingly fun game. Its hard to understand the value of the Victory cards until the end of your first play session....so its a game you have to play twice before you can really have an opinion.

Falls into the category of "fun" games.  Lots of strategy and decisions, but a heaping spoonful of chaos.  Kind of like El Grande meets Citadels.  After a second playing, the rating sticks.  I've played it with 5 different people (once 3 players, once 4) - all enjoyed it a lot.  I think this is one of my favorite new games of the year.

RATING: 6.8
well.. it works, the theme is nice, components are ok, art is good, there's some tension during the game, many games comes to mind ("this is like in citadels, this seems el grande, this is taken from there....").
In the end, there are some too strong effects that makes it too chaotic. you can use scientist to know some of these effect, but you'll know 2 out of 7 at most, the others are random and quite too strong to allow good planning.
this is a pity because it's a kind of game i usually like a lot, rules are simples and immediately grasped... i would eliminate some randomnes to give it 7 or more

Tom Vasel says this is the game that Citadels was supposed to be. It's not a bad game, but I'd prefer Citadels over this any day. It has role selection, which I'm a big fan of (thanks to Citadels, it must be said). However, I find the area majority aspect a bit 'take it or leave it'. Lukewarm at best.

Scifi, variable powers, area control. How could this be a miss?

I wasn't a huge fan of the Discovery events, some of those can really hose you up and you're probably only going to see 1-2 in a game.

There was also a lot of ways to screw people, it's not uncommon for our games to have people totally miss a turn or three as other people have destroyed or blocked them from placing. The sequential reveal of roles also seems to add more time then it's worth.

Finally, there is no mechanic to keep someone in the game if they are being picked on. The Lost in Time and Space thing is pretty useless and it's very possible for someone to just get pummeled by a couple other people who Soldier, Femme Fatale, etc his troops. Traded it away and have not looked back.

This one looks fairly light with the cartoony artwork and steampunk sci-fi theme, but once you start playing, there are actually many tough decisions to make.  There are no dice, and yet there still is a lot of randomness with the Event cards and undiscovered Resource Tokens.  The secretly held bonus cards can make all the difference, so there is no way to tell who will win until they are revealed, even when someone seemingly has a huge lead in points already scored.  Nothing is really new here - the mechanics are similar to other games:  role selection as in Citadels; and exploration and secret mission bonuses as in Nexus Ops.  That's probably a good way to describe it actually - a cross between Nexus Ops and Citadels, with the interaction of both, but without the wargaming and dice.  It should play in an hour, and bridges the gap nicely between a filler game and a heavy Euro.

All these years I thought Mars needed [url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060672/]women[/url].  Turns out the non-terrestrials just need round markers to control their areas.  Like big wooden scarecrows, I guess.

I changed my mind. I enjoy this one after all. All of the different mechanisms work if you accept the slight randomness. Some people will enjoy it and other will not.

RATING: 6
Played once (with 4 players). A pleasant, not too long game with some good ideas. However, you must not expect much control, considering the number of ways the other players can derail your plans, willingly or not. As it is, there is little you can do but hope it will turn out not too bad - it might, or not. Also, the components are rather poor and the rules could use some more precisions.

Won the first play, didn't like it.
Chaotic, theme is low, characters don't make me feel much more in control. Good that it's playing time is short...

RATING: 7
Rating based on one play. As much as I love the graphics and theme, I can't say I'm overly enthused about the gameplay. This rating could rise with additional plays, but frankly, as I own Kreta (which is similar), I'd rather play that. I suspect there is a low chance of determined outcome and strategic play in this due to sheer number of cards.

Will be playing this again tomorrow; will revisit the rating after my third play.

Steam powered space ships going to Mars!  Hidden Role selection and area control combined into a very fun, fast playing game. Kind of like a more thinky Citadels that plays quicker.  Bonus/Discovery cards are swingy so either play with a variant or stay away if that sort of thing bothers you.

Received in trade for part of a painted Warhammer Orc Army.

A good area majority game should not be as chaotic as Mission: Red Planet is.  With the combined effects of role selection, discovery and bonus cards, it is possible for someone to play well for the majority of the session yet still lose due to an unlucky series of events in the last round.  But you know what, I don't care!  This is such a breath of fresh air to the mechanic that I just had a blast with it.  There are so many things you wish you could do and ways to screw with other people.  I really enjoyed every minutes.  What a pleasant surprise.

I was really let down by this game after playing my first session- it was exceedingly confusing due to poorly laid-out rules. Although I found many of the mechanics interesting, I don't think that certain cards are really useful at all and that the game could use some streamlining- You know a game is bad when you read the rulebook and all you hear around the table is "Wha?"

I like the rolesystem similar to Citadels. With this game too, you have some nasty roles to select and harass others. Only some of the tension is gone, because everyone gets their own deck. This comes down to decision which roles you choose and when. Area control aspect is quite nice, although I've played probably too much of them. But what brings tension is the limited game time and scoring rounds. Good game, but could be better. Art is fantastic.

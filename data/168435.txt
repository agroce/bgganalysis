It's a great city-building-tile-placement-negotiation game. Scratching the itch for faster city-building type of game compared to Suburbia or Quadropolis or City Tycoon. I like the semi-coop aspect of it. The scoring of tile placement makes sense too, shops in straight line make the customers easier to go from shop to shop, the bigger the park the better your city is, offices should be built near restaurants, houses shouldnt be built next to factories. The final scoring mechanism is a bit disorienting and a bit anti-climax, but I enjoy the game for what it is, a fast, negotiating, city-building game.

6 plays / 5,6,7 players

LIKE: The semi co-op, the interaction is good. Scoring the lower of two scores is fun. 
DISLIKE: Too easy, I got bored of this one quickly. Seemingly hard decisions turn out to be of minor consequence, because the game feels too balanced. Tiles are pretty random.

OVERALL: Could have been a great game, but for me it feels too balanced and decisions are obvious. I feel the game needs more constraints to get players to make interesting decisions. As it stands, I feel there's limited replayability.

RATING: 7
One of the best competitive co-operative boardgames I can think of. It is a very clever mechanic to have players building separate cities with their neighbours while competing with every other city. 

However, should you seek conflict, Between Two Cities is definitely not for you. It is a game of positive construction mechanisms. Whatever you do you always go forward and never disturb others. Hence, it suits most players and families. It also plays quick, which always great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like this because it's typically Euro and typically co-operative and YET, it somehow feels fresh due to the nechanism of building either side of you and the way the winner is decided.  Not only that, but it's quick, relatively simple (well, after the first play anyway) and good to look at.  Must play with the expansion soon as it looks good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent, quick filler game that plays 3-7 in under half an hour.  This is a great gateway game to more complex drafting games like 7 Wonders.

The teamwork aspect of this game is its strongest feature, and sets it apart from anything else in my collection.  It gives a little bit of the feel of a cooperative game, without the alpha player problem that some people dislike about coop games.  Players work with their neighbors, but are still looking out for themselves.  It's a very elegant balancing factor, and something I look forward to seeing in other games.

I like that it plays quickly, is easy to teach, and accommodates up to 7 people. I'll happily play it whenever.

By default, scores seem to always be within a few points, no matter what decisions you make. I get the impression that the game is largely luck driven? I could be wrong, but this admittedly bothers me. This could use an expansion to spice things up.

Played 3p once, rated it at 7 due to too short.

Game only played 3 round, each round might take ended up lesser than 5 minutes unless there is a lot of negotiation goes on. 

Interesting mechanic that has us build two cities in the same time, semi-coop with other player and to balance both cities off because we are scoring for the lower cities between two. 

Definitely wanted to try again, recommended must play with expansion as base game is way too easy.

RATING: N/A
A very interesting mechanic where each player wants to balance two cities, as they are evaluated on the weaker of the two.  There could be significant AP as you could try to evaluate each of your partners and attempt to sabotage the city shared with the one doing better (to ensure that it is weaker than your other city), leading to silliness.

Fortunately, the group I played with simply wanted each of their two cities to do well and didn't slow the game down trying to keep track of everyone else.  This led to it feeling like a 3-player game even though we played with a full 5 players.

There is good strategy and planning and lots of luck involved, but it felt a bit too multiplayer solitaire-ish for me to want to own it.  I'd probably play it again, though.

1st play: Drafting tiles game, with city building and quick playtime.  A decent game but I don't think there's much replayability.  In one game, we saw all the tiles and hit most of the scoring opportunities.  There are only 6 tile types repeated throughout the game, so we got to see all of them in our one play.  Pleasant game though.

No 2nd play.

RATING: 8.5
A realy good and clever tile drafting game, kinda-sorta pseudo coop as you are building two cities along with 2 different players, but what is really brilliant is the fact that you gain the points of your worse city, Awesome. If you play in a, somewhat, fast manner (like we do:)it makes very difficult to manage the balance between you 2 cities.
The length of the game is ideal as it allows for multiple plays in a row. 
It seens like a good game to introduce prior to 7Wonders, or even as an introduction to drafting itself.

Interesting semi-coop tile-drafting game where you have to build a city in collaboration with each of your neighbors, but your score is the lowest of the two city scores, which means if one city score is very high, it's helping a competitor, but you don't want it too low or it lowers your possible score.

This is a fun, lightweight alternative to 7 wonders. I would almost certainly rather play this than 7W just because of the extreme ease of setup and speed of play. We played 4 player in about 20 minutes with final scoring, and because you are limited to playing just in your two neighboring cities, I don't see this going up by much with more players, even up to the 7 cap. 

It is definitely light, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. As an appetizer/filler it has quite a lot going for it. Recommend you try this before buying 7 wonders.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game's held up surprisingly well for a quick partnership filler, and I expect it to continue to do so.  Scores are fairly constant because tile values are so similar, which means playing well will often eke out a win by two or three points - it's interesting to see how that plays with certain player styles.

I don't like how you sometimes get hands with 2-3 of the same tile on the final draw, which feels like you're getting pretty terrible decisions to be made.

I like the idea of developing cities in cooperation with the players to your left and right.  It makes for some nice player interaction. I like the different ways of scoring different building types.  The tile drafting system works quite nicely.  My reservation is that Two Cities seems too balanced.  A strange thing to complain of perhaps, but in the games I have seen and played the scores have all been close.  Here I think it speaks to a certain obviousness; hence too little decision space for great or awful plays.

Production quality is good.  I particularly like the player pieces.  The artwork is pleasing.

Interesting concept of having two cities and scoring it in Tigris/Euphrates style.

However, the game is too short and does not have enough substance to even justify the playtime.  It almost took as much time to do the book keeping at the end of the game to calculate everyone's points, than it did to play the actual game.

Was nice to play once, but don't have any intention to bring it to the table again.

A lovely tile drafting and placement game that plays well with three players as it does with seven.

As you build two cities, one with each neighbour, there's a lovely balance of trying to score well on both. Do too well on one city whilst neglecting the other and you lose. I would choose to play this over something like Capital every time. 

The only downside is the theme and artwork. Normally this is something Stonemaier Games excels at but it falls a bit flat here. This could easily be a 10 for me if it had a historical theme with better art.

Unique game! You build up two cities simultaneously, cooperating and at the same time competing with the players to your left and right. Unlike other games, BTC forces players to balance two goals equally, rather than getting as many points as possible. So at times, you'll find yourself going for the lower-point option! 

This was intriguing, in a simple-yet-intricate puzzle kind of way. I would like to play it again before I decide how to rate it.

For fans of SM games, this title will feel a tad odd.  It's not a heavy or long game in any way.  It is a solid filler and plays fast.  Fast enough, that you'll likely play it back-to-back at a session.  And that's not a bad thing, since it holds your interest enough to give it a spin a couple of times in a row.  The mechanics and scoring are interesting and the push-pull relationship with your partners is an also interesting exercise in communications (i.e. trying to get on the same page in terms of approach/strategy as your neighbors.)  Overall, it's a well produced, enjoyable filler, but its not likely to replace any other SM games.  As a bridge between them, its good.  Will be interesting to see if any expansions come down for this (there could be and they could be quite good additions).  Will also be interesting to see if SM produces any other games at this level or if they;ll stay with meatier fare.

Really intriguing game, you're participating in building two cities of tiles with various score combos on how or how many buildings you place. But you're building each with another player, and eventually scoring the lower of the two as your final tally! So it creates an interesting level of tension and negotiation that you simply don't find in other games of this sort. Along with Isle of Skye, this is one of the more fascinating and unique titles of its style to come out in 2015. There is life in the tile yet...

It's a nice filler game. I didn't really see the negotiation aspect, as it's very well in your interest to make both cities prosper, but there's a very good semi-coop feel that actually works.

A filler game that is pretty quick. Best for those who are less competitive and more into cooperative games. This is probably the most cooperative game I can get myself into and yet there is still the competitive portion because you need to strategize the move in such a way that both cities are build well.

A favourite of my wife to introduce to new gamers especially. Another aspect is that due to the relatively short span of time to complete a game, it is something that we can play more than once in each gaming session.

For what it is... this is an incredible game.

This is a quick-to-setup, quick-to-teach, semi-strategic drafting game.  It encourages communication and keeps downtime down, because everyone's taking their turn at the same time (a la 7 Wonders).

Quite frankly, the low-average review score baffles me, because I don't see what this game does wrong for it's genre.  It's an opener/closer, not the main event.  For that, it's among the best.

lijkt op 7 Wonders, maar is iets eenvouder, want minder opties.
Alle opties staan trouwens overzichtelijk op één kaartje.
Je kiest 2 tegels uit voor een stand links en stad rechts van je.  Je overlegt met je buren over welke tegel je gaat leggen...

Je eindscore is de score van je laagste stad.

Na 2e speling (met 3) ben ik minder enthousiast.
Je moet al heel goed kunnen tellen om tussentijds te weten welke stad aan het winnen is.  En toch moet je dat doen om goed te kunnen spelen.

Not bad! It's usually going to be obvious in which of the two cities you want to place a tile, but the specific placement is where some discussion comes in. In a game like Alien Frontiers, the fun of the game is maximizing your dice placement, and everyone wants to help other players... not because the other players need or want help, but because it's just fun to look at the dice after they roll and tell everyone what you would do with them.  This game is perfect for that kind of gamer. Acquired via Kickstarter.

Nicely condenses 7 Wonders into its true problem - how to competitively/collaboratively draft - by removing the resource optimization problem and getting straight to the point scoring.

Interesting mechanic for date night. The key is balance, so you can't win by favoring your date over your other side.

A feast for the tile-laying enthusiasts, Between Two Cities lets you build (surprise!) two cities at the same time, over whose construction you only have half control, as your neighbors on each side control the remaining halves.

Anyhow, it’s still aimed at the control freaks as it’s in the best interest of either player sharing a settlement to try and gain the most out of your communal city: after all, it’s all about just grinding points and making the best out of your planning engine.

2015, 2-7p, 20 min. Boring, soulless, mindless, semi-cooperative, abstract game of drafting, set collection, negotiation and tile placement.

Pros: fast, holds 7p, easy to teach & remember.
Cons: too simplistic, negotiation over tile placement can be annoying/slow, few meaty/meaningful decisions, draft choices for tiles dwindle exponentially between turns (i.e., there's often almost no choice or question of which tiles to keep).

This is a dime a dozen tile laying set collection game with the twist being that you share a city with your neighbours. In theory it sounds like a solid idea, drafting tiles, negotiating what to do and optimizing the tile placement. But somehow it feels like you're not in control enough. That, combined with the not-so-interesting choices makes this probably the most boring city builder I played.

It's a pity, since the shared city aspect seems like such a novel concept .

RATING: 8
This is one of the best filler games I've encountered, due to the design of the game allowing the addition of more players, without their being much of an increase in the time it takes to play the game. All players make their turn selections at the same time, thus the end of game scoring ends up being the only variable in game length due to the number of players.

The game revolves around the selection of tiles, during three rounds. Players select two tiles from an available pool (single sector squares are drafted, as in 7 wonders and Sushi-Go in the first and third rounds; straight selection of rectangular two sector tiles in the second round) and then choose to place them in a four by four grid "city" to either their left or right. Since scores are based on the lowest score between your two cites, balancing properly between the two cities is the key to winning the game.

The different square sectors each score in different ways, based on function (indicated by color) and thus adding a strategic element to how the various tiles interact in each city. Since both you and your neighbors are adding to the cities at the same time, figuring out what tiles your neighbors might choose also plays a role. 

A quick and fun game that can favor those who can quickly juggle numbers, but is still a fun game for most players regardless of skill level.

Only played the 2-player variant on the first two plays. Fun game- a little more to it than Sushi Go but in the same vein of set collection. Looking forward to trying with more players and seeing how the co-operative aspect plays out.

Update 10/14: Played a few 3-player games. Overall the game is a little lighter than I had hoped, with not a ton of strategy (although it is there), and little to do to affect other players not involved in your own cities. Will be a good filler game especially with larger groups, and I will try with 4 players soon. For now, knocking from a 7 to a 6.5.

Update 10/16: Played 3 games with 4-players. Better than 3 players, back up to a 7.

Update 04/01/16: Yeah, this is not a 7. Knocking to a 6.5 but may slip to a 6. Too light.

At first glance you might think that this is a fairly straight forward tile laying/city building game. A hand full of different buildings are combined to build a city on a 4x4 grid. 

The scoring though is what sets this game apart. You work with the player to the left and right to build two cities. The trick is that you only score the lowest of city to your left and right. 

Basically you want to build the cities as best you can, but not too good.

Really interesting design!

RATING: 7
I'm liking this game more and more, despite beginning to tire of the lazy drafting mechanic that seems to be in every game that comes out these days. The most fun part is in the discussion phase, where it really feels like you're playing two cooperative games at once, even though everyone is really out for themselves. You have to pay attention to other players' boards, because if you cooperate too well, you might lose: sometimes tanking one of your own cities is necessary. 

Another thing I love about the game is that it plays about as quickly with 6 players as it does with 3. The original 2-player variant that came with the game is not great, though, so I'm hoping the later 2-p. version will bump this up even more for me.

A neat game in that it meshes together a drafting game, along with partnerships with your neighbors. Each turn, you'll receive a hand of tiles, and you'll pick two of them: one which will be added to the city on your left, and one to the city on your right. You'll then pass the remaining tiles, and receive tiles that are passed to you to choose from again.

The rest of the game is pretty standard fare. Different buildings will score in different ways, and you work to most efficiently squeeze points out of each city.

Whichever of the two cities you worked on scores the least points is your score for the game, so you need to make sure both of your cities do well, rather than focusing on making one awesome city and one not-so-great one.

Overall, neat for the whole partnership in a drafting game thing, but I'm not sure how fun it would be to play several times given there aren't many building types or interesting interactions between them.

Great city-building game that is perfect for introducing non-gamers to the hobby. The game lets you build a city with the player on each side and the winner is based on your lowest score so you must try to build both of your cities as best as you can. Production quality is top-notch as with other Stonemaier games and it plays very quickly which is perfect for its weight. It also plays great up to 7 players, which is rare for Euro games. Highly recommended!

I'm not a huge Euro gamer but this light German-style game takes only 20 minutes and is quite novel.  The cooperative competitive aspect of building cities jointly with neighbors is slick.

Based on 1 play with 6 players:

Not sure on this one yet. The scoring system is surprisingly complex and mathy and it kind of brought down the game for me on the first play. It's the sort of thing that probably becomes second nature after you play a few times, but it does present a pretty big learning curve (especially since the cheat sheet is just iconography).

So yeah, it just feels weird to me that such a light and otherwise social game has such a mathy scoring system. I like the core mechanic, but needing to math things out every turn just feels incongruous with the weight of the game. But our group generally liked it so we'll see how this goes with future plays.

This game was a lot better than I thought it would be after reading the rules.  The semi-coop twist on simple city-building really works.

Efficient placement and combo making game, where you have to cooperatively play two separate cities at once. This kind of game just never generates any excitement for me.

Refreshing drafting game that partners oneself with neighboring cities, but there's only one winner. It suits really well as a filler game that can fit it in with any group. The game may suffer replay value, because there's not much variety with tiles and scoring, but it's still fun and interactive.

RATING: 7.5
One of those weirdly "competitive co-ops" where you have to work with your neighbor in order to score better than them.  This is a great game for 6 or 7 players as there is very little downtime (except for when you are waiting for two others to "collude" in their decisions).  The determination of the winner based on the highest "low score" is really neat as well, as it forces you to balance out BOTH SIDES of your play area (which then potentially gives lots of points to your opponent as well).

RATING: 5
The drafting mechanism seems well placed, but I doubt that the other main mechanic of discussing with two other players /at the same time/ will ease gameplay - I was constantly stressed out by having to deal with two discussions at the same time - blame it on my disability to multitask.
Furthermore it is a semi-coop strategy game with only two of the other players; but you really don't want them to win. Takes a lot of the fun out of the game for me indeed.
Maybe I'll have a look into this a little more, but the first impression was really underwhelming.

An excellent drafting game. I had read some positive reviews, and after one play, I feel pretty confident this is an excellent game to play at lunchtime with my coworkers.

It is fast to play, the ruleset is very manageable, the drafting works great, and the collaboration with your two "partners" adds a nice twist. 

I'm not sure about player count... I suspect this is very flexible, but three players might have the problem of cities too closely scoring together and no feasible tiebreaker.

Update: Still enjoying this after 7 plays, but I'd say it is best with 5+ players to avoid a clustering of scores too close together.

Update: played this roughly 10 times, and it started to lose its luster with the lunch group. Traded away... I'd be happy to play it, but I don't love it enough to lobby it to the table during lunch.

RATING: 5
A very quick drafting game that requires a 4x4 grid to be built between you and a partner. That unique twist is about where the excitement for this game ends. The art is drab, all the tiles do is score points in different ways, and scoring takes almost as long as the 3 drafting rounds. It also feels almost too balanced our game of 5 cities ended up with points between 56 and 53, which just felt artificially close. I would be willing to try this again, but there is nothing that really excited me about it to want to do so again. I have heard an expansion will add variety into the building types by adding specific buildings, which is probably what this game needed from the beginning. Maybe that will give this game the little extra it needs to be enjoyable for me.

I found this game very interesting. it is the elements of a puzzle game, like Karuba, but it is semi-cooperative. You are building a city to your right and to your left with your respective neighbor. Although you are cooperatively building cities, the win condition is solo. This leads to interesting drafting decisions. You want to give your neighbor cards that is good for your city and not "better" for your neighbor's other city!

SUPER unique gameplay, unlike almost anything else I've played in that you are not solely responsible for anything, but only one person can win!  There is A LOT to consider in this game, you're looking at what you're building at both your cities, negotiating with both of your neighbors and preparing for what is coming next by remembering what leftover tiles you're passing to your neighbor, thusly effecting THEIR future choices, all while keeping an eye on what other cities are going to score for!  BUT if you can handle all that, the gameplay moves quickly and smoothly and leaves everyone guessing the winner to the very end.  If you're interested in a game that piles on the decision making and, maybe even at times, stress then you'll be hard pressed to find a better game with a unique twist.

This is a really good starter/light game that anyone can pick up on. It has a good mixture of co-op and competitiveness. Working with your partners to get the best city while still trying to beat everyone is an interesting idea and I love that everyone ends up talking to each other. 

So far I've only played 4 games but each one has gone over well. I have rated it a 6.75 right now just because I'm not completely sure of it yet. It is a good game to get newbies into but has enough strategy to hold others that want a more in depth kind of game. Trying to figure out what tiles to leave so you could get your partner to pick them is interesting too. 

Overall, I have enjoyed this game and will be trying to get it to the table more often. Especially with new players.

RATING: 4
Not my cup of tea. It's just a bunch of tiles, where each type has a scoring rubric, and you simultaneously build two 4x4 cities, one between you and each of your two neighbors. From a set of tiles you select two tiles, one for each city. Then you agree with each neighbor how to place them, which is usually fairly obvious. And your motives are aligned with each neighbor, since you share the city. Each player's personal score is the [i]lower[/i] of their two city scores. So you can't neglect either of your cities. Scoring your cities is incredibly tedious, so much so that you can't really score any of the cities mid-game. At least I can't. So it's really hard to know who's winning, or even which of your two cities needs more love.

Very interesting game play.  You're contributing to the building of two cities (along with another person).  The actual score that you get is for the lesser of the two cities.  Therefore you're trying to make the cities equally as good, while making it worse than your partner's.  I think that the several different ways to score are cleverly done.

I give it an 8.5 for it's completely unique mechanism--cooperative with the player to your right and left, while only person wins.  

It is a tile placement of a 4 by 4 city.  You have a city to your left and right in between you and another player.  You build the city up in three rounds by laying tiles.  You and your neighbors have the incentive to build your city up as much as possible to gain points.  At the same time to cannot neglect the other city.  Your score is the lowest point city of your two.

RATING: 7.5
This game is a bit of an odd bird. That's what I like about it. You play the game cooperatively but you win alone, which means you get the social interactions of a co-op game without having to deal with alpha gamers. The choices you make are interesting and have strategic depth but are simple enough that the game zips nicely along. The possibility for hate-drafting is (mostly) eliminated by the fact that you pass your hand of tiles to one of your partners but, unlike other drafting games, the lack of hate-drafting is no great loss here, mostly because what you give them can help you in turn; that is, it replaces hate-drafting with support-drafting. 

And I guess that's what I like best about Between Two Cities: it doesn't sacrifice anything to be a game that feels friendly, positive, and mutually supportive. I'm not sure I can say that about any other game. It lacks the depth to be profoundly satisfying and determining a winner can be a bit of a headache but, as filler or as a game that can accommodate a large group, it's very, very good.

De son p'tit nom, B2C  n'est pas le nom d'un boys band des années 90, ni d'un jeu musical. C'est un jeu de pose de tuiles. Vous prenez le mandat d'un maire non pas d'une ville, mais ... de 2 villes ! Construire des parcs, des maisons, des usines. Un vrai mayor-simulator simplifié. Si ce n'est pas de la responsabilité !  Presque un peu trop. Donc vous ne serez que co-maire de chaque ville avec votre voisin de droite et de gauche (d'un point de vue orientation, hein, pas politique, parce que ça, c'est un coup à se disputer :) ). 
A vous de vous entendre pour avoir les meilleures villes (car seule la moins bien comptera). Si vous ne vous en sortez pas trop mal, vous serez peut-être ré élu aux prochaines élections municipales. Bon, c'est en 2020, vous avez le temps de voir venir

A very light drafting game with an interesting twist of it being a semi-cooperative game rather than a purely competitive game.

Dropped the overall rating 1/2 a point based on my solo play with the automaton deck. Much of the automaton deck just has you play the optimal tile for scoring for Automasso and Automarta with the exception of a few cards that do less than optimal things. Assuming that you as a player are doing the optimal thing after knowing the other move, it's now just a game of luck when picking the tiles.

A friend of me got it from Kickstarter. It is one of the simplest, yet best games we like to play with our friends. Because everybody plays at the same time, there is no long wait during other people's turns. Also, the game is rather fast, making it ideal asa filler while waiting for other people to arrive, or at the end of the game night, just if we still have energy for a quick game. Also love that it's equally fun and fast with 7 people (a game for 7 players!) as with 4.
The rules are simple, so it is very easy for new players to quickly jump in and learn the game.

The central mechanism of co-operating with each of your neighbors and yet competing with them is very intriguing. But, is it possible that this game is somehow too balanced? The scores in the two games I played were unbelievably close, with four points separating first and last players in one game and only one point in the other game. Also, despite all the numeric scoring, players really just intuit their choices for each city, which could be considered a good thing. Unfortunately, the artwork for the tiles is much too bland.

Great little filler. Not sure about it's staying power (needs a bit more cards for that I'd guess) but for now it's good fun the whole 15-20 minutes or so it takes to play.

Quick and simple tile-drafting to build two 4x4 grids of buildings of various types.  The scoring feels very familiar, and if there is any issue with the game, it is that most everything gets you the same number of points.   Both of my cities scored exactly the same, and I wasn't even trying.   That feels a bit lazy to me.  Wish there was a little more bite or oooomph in some of the tiles.   The partnership ideas work well and the game flows well also.

This is too close to being a co-op, and I really dislike co-ops.  Every time we played this, we ended up with super close games simply because the four people playing cooperated very well.  There just isn't much game there.  Traded it in June 2017 for Martin Wallace's Rise of Empires.

Played it with 3 and with this number it's barely a game. Could be that it's better with more players, and I'm willing to play it once more with 4-5 players, but frankly the only saving grace for now is that it plays very fast. For now it's a game with zero meaningful decisions, that's entirely decided by luck.
2016-03-07 : Played it again using the gamer variant that only the left hand city is your score, so you can sabotage the right hand one. Makes it 100% better as a game, still very random but at least now it's a game. Upgraded from a 4 to a 6.

This is a drafting tile-laying game. The really good aspects of the game is that it can accommodate up to 7 people, it plays relatively quickly and isn't too difficult to play. That's where the praise ends. I find the scoring to be too tight, the randomness of the double tiles is kind of annoying, and the visuals of this game are kind of bland. While this isn't a bad game (i'd rather play it over Sushi Go), there are many other drafting games (ie Greed/Fairy Tale)and games that accommodate up to 7 (Diamant/Deception) that I would rather play than this one.

I was surprised by how much I disliked being Between two Cities. I generally despise co-op games, I prefer to succeed or fail on my own laurels and not play a game where inevitably someone is telling someone else what to do. Often these co-ops are games that pit the players against the game, but here we have a game that is at its core a point building solitaire engine (something I like in a game) being twisted by this co-op venom.

I hated having to "discuss" where to place the tile I drafted. It made me crabby and in the end just let both of neighbors do as they pleased.

There was no satisfaction of outplaying a rival. You just threw darts blindly at a board and afterwards see who scored more.

Most of the money spent on the game was wasted on meaningless city meeples and a huge scoreboard used once at the end. Should just be a card game really.

This is a fairly vanilla tile laying game that's improved with interaction with the player on either side of you.  The rating gets a bump because of the player count and speed of play.

RATING: 7
Between Two Cities is a simple but interesting game hinged on one simple concept; build two cities, one with the player to the left of you, one with the player to the right of you, the lowest scoring city is your end score.

Once you wrap your head around the counter-intuitive concept that you are working together, but not really the game is simple to learn, easy to play and encourages a high amount of social interaction (reasoning, debating, favouritism... arguing).  As games only last around 20-30 minutes, competition doesn't get vicious.

The game can drag if played with very pedantic players who play with mathematical precision, keeping a running calculation on both of their cities to strike the perfect balance.

Between Two Cities is a nice warm-up/cool-down game that sits somewhere between a filler and a heavier game.

I really enjoyed this city builder and I was surprised how quickly it actually plays. Three rounds of drafting tiles which you then split between the city to your left and the city to your right. 
You only score the lowest of the two cities so there is an interesting mix of keeping the two cities balanced, if you want to score well. 
All the scores were fairly similar therefore there might be a little too much balance here as tile selection strategy doesn't seem to have a huge effect. More tactical than strategic... but maybe that in itself is the beauty of this one.

I’d heard good things about it, and I had to admit that the idea of cooperatively building two cities with two different players while competing with everyone at the table for points, including my partners - well, that sounded great! But the visuals...ugh. I avoid ugly games, and this one is soooooo drab and listless in its visual design. In my mind, games aimed at casual players should have visuals that lean towards colourful and fun (witness Candy Crush app game on phones). In any case, the partnerships are fun, the game is ultra-simple point salad.

RATING: 7.5
This drafting game felt surprisingly similar to Sushi Go - most picks mostly boiled down to following the strategy to try to get your cities to as close to 4 pts/tile as possible with pretty much all options getting you between 3.5 and 4. The strategies seemed pretty balanced - people around the table tried a variety of things and every city ended up between 58 and 62 points.

The game's two twists were both interesting. The first (namesake) twist of building two cities and scoring the worse of the two was quite clever. I particularly enjoyed how each city essentially picked twice in a row out of each hand (you pick, pass to your teammate who picks from the remainder) which allowed a little more forward planning. What I did not like was that the hands didn't make it very far around the table - with 5 players you only saw 3/5 hands that were dealt, which is a far cry from the traditional drafts of other games where hands rotate back to you.

The other twist is the middle round, where each player is dealt three double-tile cards, of which one must be assigned to each city. This was pretty devastating and both cities that scored lowest could point directly to the tiles that were forced on them by these choices - both times the city was forced to take in a tile it did not want that ended up being worth 2 points rather than 4, which was more than the margin of victory. This problem is slightly ameliorated by the fact that each person is maintaining two cities and thus is pretty likely to draw a bad tile - I am sure that if we played a lot more we would start to get better at this, but in the first two games we played it was very noticeable.

Just for fun, we also played a round where we scored in reverse: same points/tile scoring, but aiming for low scores rather than high. The game was definitely not better this way - in particular the office/house scoring rule was too abusable in the reverse game - but it was surprisingly playable. The most successfully bad city was a whopping 25 points, in case anyone is interested.

Verdict - I would happily play again, but not a game I need to own or would suggest over similar games.

RATING: 6
Easy to play, not very deep or interesting. 
Good scoring. 
Good cooperation between players next to each other. 
Pick a card and pass on the rest is a good mechanic with simultaneus action. The cards you can pick are just not interesting enough and the combos and strategies a bit too shallow for me.

Light/filler game that scales extremely well. Simple point salad game, where you'll team up with the player to your right and to your left. After that, it's a simple draft, followed by plugging one tile into your city on each side. You can collaborate on the best position. Your lowest scoring city is your score. There's a long tie-breaker, as ties are fairly common.

Between Two Cities is the poster child for games that are fine. It's fine. 

PROS
-The explanation of how the game plays and how tiles score is easily groked. 
-The conversations regarding what you're going to put where add an enjoyable element of interaction. 
-It works well as a filler or even gateway game for learning tile-laying mechanics. 

CONS
-The art on the tiles could have been so much better. As it is, it looks like you're putting together a city designed by Office Depot.
-Although only one player ever wins, a win never feels that satisfying as it's partly due to the efforts of your neighbors.

RATING: 8
This is a fast and simple light game which is really easy to play and teach. Since you build your cities with the person sitting next to you, there is a lot of interaction between players (something that 7 Wonders lacks, for instance). It's one of the few games that works perfectly well with 7 players (since everybody places their tiles at the same time, the number of players does not affect the length of the game). The little wooden pieces representing cities are great, there is a solo mode and the two-player version is different from the 3 to 7 players version. Between Two Cities is quite simple and, since it also includes cooperative elements, it's ideal for inexperienced players. Playing Between Two Cities is a relaxing experience and I'm really looking forward to its expansions.

This game combines one of my least favorite mechanisms (tile laying) with a design element that requires me to coordinate with my neighbor, yet I can't openly communicate with him/her, or at least the level of communication between the two players is not entirely clear.

Not really sure how this is a strategy game.  Did I outwit my neighbors?  Did I affect the other side of the table at all?  Sure there is some minor optimization based upon the cards that you draw, but much like Blackjack- you can be dealt cards you cannot mess up no matter how you try and you can get dud hands- or dud neighbors.  If the most difficult part of a game is adding up the score, something is wrong.

Rated an 8 after one play, but this could easily be bumped up. This is kind of like a mixture of 7 Wonders (drafting and point scoring) and Alhambra (arranging tiles to score points). But the twist of needing to work with both of the players to your left and right while also only scoring points for your lowest is intriguing. I got a little giddy during the rules explanation, just considering the implications of these partnerships along with the different ways the tiles score. Immediately wishlisted. Really looking forward to playing again. 
UPDATE: Dropped this to a 7. It's really fun and accessible, but there seems to be a pretty low depth of skill here. Once you know the main tricks and strategies, it's not as competitive. That said, an expansion could really breathe new life into this game, so we will see what happens. Regardless, it won't leave my shelf anytime soon as fun, speedy, 7-player drafting/tile-laying games are in short supply.

Neat little drafting/tile laying game that gains most of it's charm being a semi-co op. Gives me some of the same feelings i get out of 7 Wonders, King Domino and Carcassone. Each turn you are using tiles to build 2 cities, one with each neighbor. At the end of 3 rounds, your lowest scoring city is your total, so you want to be well balanced in building your cities. The drafting of the tiles is fantastic, and the real beauty is the 3-7 player count and 25-30 run time, regardless of the number of players. Loses a half point or two for kinda being ugly, but this was a short fun game with smooth mechanics.

Played and subsequently won via Play-to-Win at Salt Con.  Great iteration on 7 Wonders.  Usually I don't enjoy games which so blatantly rip off another design.  However, the innovation in this game makes it truly worthy on its own.  Playing on both sides and having to negotiate with both of those players makes the quiet solitaire of 7 Wonders turn into a lush garden of interesting player interaction.  I was thrilled to win it.  Fantastic components too.

Major pros: Game is easy to explain and plays in 20 minutes, even with 7 players. The game comes with several cards to provide a variety of means to randomize seating for replays of the game.

Each round you pick two tiles to keep and pass the rest to your left or right [like in 7 Wonders). Then everyone flips over their tiles and plays them: one to the city on their left and one to the city on their right. They can discuss with their neighbor any strategy they want or deciding how to place the tiles, but the player ultimately decides where the tile will go.

After each city is completed (a 4x4 grid), the points for each city is calculated. Your score is the lower scoring city of the two you helped built, so that prevents you from spending too much attention to one city and neglect the other. The result is a strangely nice light and cooperative joint effort to actually help your neighbor.

RATING: 7
A semi-cooperative, tile drafting and tile laying game, with Knizian style scoring. You start with a hand of tiles, pick 2 and hand the rest on. You cooperate with the player on your left to build a city with one of the tiles and cooperate with the player to your right to build another.  By the end of the game you and your neighbours will have built two 4x4 cities which are scored based on the types of tiles and how they are arranged. Your score will be the lower of the 2 city scores.

This is really clever at doing what it sets out to do!  It's quite light and fast, but it plays with seven people and involves some thinking. At the moment I like it much better than 7 Wonders (but it could just be that I'm not bored with it yet). The scoring is clever--both your neighbors are your partners, but only your worst city scores.  It's not incredibly complex, but at 30 minutes it doesn't need to be. Will it hold up? We'll see!

Very good game. Family game that everyone can enjoy, even experienced gamers. Juego único que combina elementos cooperarivos con elementos competitivos. Cada jugador construye DOS ciudades con losetas que se obtienen de un pool común mediante card drafting. Se juega con 3 o mas jugadores, porque la ciudad de la derecha tú la construyes junto con el jugador a tu derecha y la de la izquierda con el de la izquierda. Al final tu ciudad "ganadora" será la que MENOS puntos tenga. Los puntos los determina la combinación de los edificios. Muy bueno, relativamente fácil y rápido.

Interesting tile placement game. Only play so far was solo. I like the idea of having to work with two other individuals in order to bolster your score.

I look forward to playing it as a group.

Between Two Cities is an interesting spin on card drafting games, providing a semi-cooperative game where players have to balance helping their neighbors while trying to not help their neighbors' neighbors. The game itself doesn't have that many turns and most will find that talking strategy will actually make up the bulk of the game. Some are going to love this; personally, it's not my style (I'd rather have tougher decisions made by individual players). Still, this isn't a bad choice for someone looking for a new way to play a drafting game with a big table of players.

You cooperate with your two neighbors to build the best cities from tiles everyone drafts.  Your second-best building gives you your score. Interesting the way that works.

Theme: City Building
Gameplay: Outstanding mechanic where you partner with the player on your right and left to design 2 cities by laying tiles. Each player scores their lowest score city at the end. 
Components: This is not a pretty game.
Replayability: This is another game to scratch that city building itch, so replay depends on how often you get that itch.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (April 2016)

I have heard good things about the game, so I was keen on playing it. In general terms,  I don’t like tile laying games but I do like drafting games.

The game components are ok to good. I don’t dig the art, but the components are of good quality. 

The rules of the game are very easy to grasp and explain, you can do it under 8 minutes. 

Between Two cities plays very fast (perhaps its main virtue).

I found the game decisions to be (mostly) obvious. The most interesting thing is that you have to keep a balance between your cities (because you score the worst one). It also has a healthy dose of uncontrollable luck (I feel luck of the draw is high). I think the game has a low replay value.

Bottom line, Between Two Cities has obvious decisions and it is way too basic and light for my current tastes. I think it can be a good introductory or filler game but it is not for me. I won’t buy it because my desire to play it again is rather low. Dull game.

Current Rating: 5.0

I really like this game, fun simple (don't have to think to hard) yet with enough interesting decisions. I also enjoy the ends scoring as each city leap frogs over one another creating a tense finish; nobody knowing who's won till the last.  It's quick to teach and fits any size group well. Everyone plays at the same time so the game plays about the same time regardless of player count. It also plays quick enough that you can play two or three rounds at a sitting. Set up and take down is super quick. I great filler game that can stand on its own.

2016-10-09 - This is a good drafting game. I really like the tension between the two cities your building, and wanting to make sure you don't neglect one in favor of the other. That said, I'm not sure how much replayability there really is. I'm looking forward to seeing what any expansions may have to offer.

RATING: 7
Players take a pair of tiles, and then choose which of the cities they are making with those tiles -- but the catch is that you are sharing those cities with the person sitting beside you, resulting in a race to get the highest of your LOWER scores. It takes a few games to master a strategy but even without it it's still a lot of fun trying to get your parters to help both win AND lose the game!

PLUS: easy to learn, continuously interactive, win and lose mechanic
MINUS: after a few games your players will likely be ready to move on

Between Two Cities is a very beautiful game with simple and enjoyable gameplay.  I like how the cities unfold bit by bit and how players work together to build the city they're sharing.  There is a lot of knowledge needed for scoring and luckily the tiles do a good job of making that information readily available.  I like it quite a bit and look forward to playing again with a larger group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Don't expect anything terribly exciting here. Draft two tiles each turn. Add one to a 4x4 grid on each side of you. Try to maximize the scoring for both cities in conjunction with your neighbors. Different kinds of tiles score different ways. Your lowest scoring city is your score. It's not a terrible game. It's not a great game. The problem is that there is not enough game here for gamers and it is not social/interactive enough to be a fun time with light gamers (unless you consider simple tile placement discussions an engaging social activity...). Not a keeper for my collection. I have little doubt the expansion would improve it, but I don't have enough interest to find out.

Really unique game that can be taught very easily and played quite quickly. A little worried that the choice of tiles you are drafting can be a too limited/obvious in terms of which tile should go in which city. However, I think this may be somewhat avoided if there is more dialogue between players about what overall strategy you are working towards together or being more cutthroat during negotiations. Might need more plays to really get a feel for it! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
To play this game at the strategic level I enjoy playing games at is problematic because it requires real-time scoring of each city. It isn't overly complicated to do that but it is more complicated than the game deserves. There are not any deep decisions to be made and they come at the cost of tedious calculations. In that respect the game reminds me a lot of Voluspa which suffers from the same undesirably high ratio of calculations to meaningful decisions.

RATING: 7
Build 2 cities in partnership with the player on your left and the player on your right, your final score is the lower of the 2 cities. Cities are built by drafting tiles, which get passed around the table 7 Wonders-style. Plays fast with up to 7!

After 2 plays I feel like this is one of those game designs that is extremely solid on paper but lacks some spark when it comes to actually playing it. Not convinced there's a lot of room for clever play.

RATING: 6
Typical Stonemaier game although this one isn't even by Stegmaier. One idea and a lot of recycled mechanisms from popular games. Mostly, Between Two Cities is a 7 Wonders ripoff. Tiles instead of cards are drafted. The new idea is drafting two tiles at a time and building two cities in a 4x4 matrix simultaneously with the right and the left neighbour. Knizia scoring (the lower scoring city is your final score) and set collection tradeoffs seen many times before (most similar to Quadropolis although this game was released a year later) complete the picture.

While building cities together with a neighbour is an original communicative element, it puts players at the mercy of others with the winner being the one who gets hurt the least from a co-builder's weak decisions. It plays quickly and can be fun with a casual group but fails as a serious game. An ok game but inferior to the alternatives: 7 Wonders is deeper while not taking much longer, Quadropolis does the city building better. The artwork is another drawback, surprising for Stonemaier games.

After first play, can safely say this is a solid game.  Though we weren't wowed, we enjoyed it and were intrigued to play again trying some different strategies.  Each city on the table took a sllightly different approach but the scores were quite similar.

RATING: 7
Because this game basically plays like a cross between an individual strategy game and a family (team) game, it is a really good game to introduce new players who either:
1) Haven't really played any non-cooperative or non-team based games.
2) Haven't really ventured beyond family games into strategy games.

Separate the "new" or inexperienced players if you are playing with 5+ so they can learn from the more seasoned ones.

Between Two Cities is a poster child for a game that is inoffensive. Bland, abstract theme, easy to teach, plays quickly, it's even somewhat cooperative!

In almost all games your chances of victory depend not only on your choices, but on your opponents, as well.  In this game you can directly see and feel those choices, which makes it feel more cooperative, but also adds a little more tension, too.  I would definitely recommend only for 4+ players.

Un mélange entre 7 wonders et carcassonne (ou alhambra). Il n'est pas très beau, on aurait du engager un graphiste. Se joue rapidement (moins de 20 minutes). On a rejoué une deuxième partie, permière partie les scores 57-52-52-52-52 (le gagnant au 2e tiebraker). On rejoue parce que c'est rapide et on veut voir si de tels pointages sont normaux. La deuxième partie aussi est serrée (sur le tiebraker aussi). On dirait qu'on réussi toujours à faire des villes assez payantes et c'est très chaud. Pas clair si c'est parce qu'on est trop bons ou si le jeu est tellement équilibré. Sympathique mais pas convaincu. 7/10 pour la rapidité et le principe de négociation avec le voisin.

Got the game for $16, a good game that plays up to 7 players.  I like the concept of building two cities with the person to your left and right. Your score is the lower of the two cities.  It make you want to score as high as possible in both cities and balance out the scoring.

Everything in this game, the tiles and how they score, the drafting, the round system, all this is just there to support what this game really is: an awesome social experience, where you cooperate with opponents, and negotiate with 2 players who are negotiating with 2 others who are negotiating with each other (for example, in a 5P game), all at the same time. Not only is this social interaction really interesting and cool, and obviously very unique, but every other mechanism supports it perfectly. The drafting is especially interesting in that you give the next player tiles you want them to use in your shared city, but they might not, and make sure you don't give them a tile which works on both of their cities! 

A way different puzzle, tip my hat to the designer!

Somewhat a filler with great components. Playing cooperatively with your neighbor is strange, but interesting.

About the solo variant: it has two modes (simple and full). The simple mode is very random (no drafting) and the full mode is strange (you play for the 'AI' finding the best tactical choice). Probably never going to play solo again. The box size is annoying, there is not enough room to put the tiles sideways nor standup.

Con: 
- the illustrations are not bad but definitely not eye-catching, eye-pleasing. See Quadropolis or (m)any other city-building examples for city-building gímes that are better to look at.
- Scoring of the distinct building types is not strongly thematic nor intuitive. Once again Quadropolis does a better job of this. (It also might be slightly overbalanced, but maybe otherwise it would be just unfair to the unlucky players.)
Pro:
- The game is very good fun! I love the way it makes you cooperate with your two neighbors (almost like a reverse 7 Wonders) and this mechanism is definitely more fun than the one of Quadropolis (or 7 Wonders) I've just compared the game to.

Thinking of buying.

RATING: 7
The different strategies are well-balanced.  The game has a fair amount of strategy for how short it is.  The final scores are usually close so that's good.

It does feel repetitive after a while.  There's nothing else to do besides the one thing: play tiles.  Because there are different ways to combine the five tile-type-strategies, you're never quite bored.  But you aren't as enthused about your choices anymore.  Another thing about your choices: some turns, your choice is too obvious to feel like a real choice.  (And very occasionally you can not have a choice on the last turn of a round.)

With that being said, it's still a great drafting, tile-placement game, because of the totally innovative twist that you have two cities you're building, and you want them both to do well.  I still enjoy this, and it's one of the best light strategy games to teach to people new to boardgaming.  It's just going to be too light to last forever.

I can't wait for this to have expansions that add more to the depth.  If they're good, then that could make my rating for this game significantly higher.

EDIT: this is pretty great as a solo game.  I've only done a little bit of solo boardgaming, but I have been enjoying this quite a bit as something to pull out for a quick half hour break.  I like the suggested "campaign mode" which is simple but gives you an incentive to try for different strategies.  I like the autonoma rules, which are interesting and yet, after a couple plays, become very easy to understand and play through quickly.  I like the aspect of trying to predict what is most likely for the autonomas to do, which has some strategy to it, and yet you can't really know so you don't spend forever on it either.  Very solid.

It's interesting to finally write comments for this now that Kingdomino is out...

I enjoy this, though it's easy for some to have AP while they min/max. The game also seems, somewhat, artificially tight.

So, we have either super short and random in Kingdomino, or longer but with choices in BTC. It's an interesting parallel that I'm not sure I have an answer to.

RATING: 7.5
This is a perfect game for a large group that plays extremely fast and leaves me very satisfied. By the time it is over, you feel like you have accomplished something substantial... more than rolling some dice with brains on them and racking up points, but it can play even faster than a game of Zombie Dice, because the entire game is played simultaneously!

The main draw of this game for me, though, is that it is completely, 100% competitive, but you are working really hard together with both of your neighbors (individually) to make the best city possible and everyone has a vested interest in doing so. The mechanism for encouraging this is sheer genius and I can't say enough how well it works in this game.

On top of that, everything is beautiful - the boxes, the pieces, the cards. The instructions were simple and straightforward to read as well. The rules are fairly simple, so that's also a bonus.

The only con about the game is that it isn't truly deep and epic (I do enjoy heavy strategy a lot). I would play it twice in a row, but I would want to have another game ready if I planned on playing games for a couple of hours or more.

Pas mal du tout. Une bonne interaction avec les joueurs situés à droite et gauche, un peu de discussion pour optimiser les villes communes. Les parties sont très rapides (30 mn grand maximum) et un système de décompte Kniziesque (simple et malin). Seul bémol : j'ai rarement vu un jeu aussi moche.

Interesting tile laying game where you are drafting tiles and laying out a city.  You score based on the different tile combinations.  But you score working on tile placement with the player to your left and right.  Your actual score is the lowest of the two cities.

It was interesting and is liked the semi cooperative nature of the game, but in the end it would not be interesting after repeated plays.

What an interesting game! True "semi-cooperative" games are rare and rarer still are the ones that actually work. I enjoy the fact that it's so conversational and the negotiation can be as cutthroat or easy-going as you want it to be. When I play the game I feel as though I'm only competing against myself and the scoring phase at the end generates some good tension as the city scores climb. Finally, the simple brilliance of scoring the lower of your two cities is the linchpin of the game's function and was a really great idea. Throw in the fact that it plays up to 7 players in 30 minutes and you have a crowd pleaser for all crowds.

RATING: 8.5
I really like this game because it's simple enough for just about everyone yet also deep enough to require some strategy and planning. I think the amount of randomness (in the tiles you draw) is good; this game is not too random.

Pros: Unique mechanic of collaborating with your two neighbors. High player count (up to 7).

Cons: The art is average, it's nice but not vibrant and fun. Poor iconography on reference cards - they're hard to read.

This is my only Kickstarter to date.  I love the products that Stonemaier Games has produced, so I thought I'd get in on the "upgraded" game since so many stretch goals had been met.  Well, buying a game sight unseen was a mistake.  This is not a game that I really care for.  So now I have a really nice copy of a game that I probably will rarely, if ever (it's unpunched), bring out.  

It seemed cool enough that you are building cities between your neighbors and you score the lower of your two cities, but because you share scoring with your neighbor, the game OFTEN results in a tie.  I hate games that are always so close you have to go down to 2nd and 3rd tier tiebreakers.  It's a simple/gateway/filler at best.  Nothing like Viticulture or Euphoria.  

I learned my lesson. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is an interesting filler. It's not deep or immersive and it is highly dependent on luck. It is interesting and very easy to teach and to learn. Our first game was a double set with 10 players and scoring took nearly as long as the game. The advantage to this game is the ability to support high player counts, but for us, a double box is overkill.

RATING: 9
I've loved this one since the first time I played it.  The need to build the best city possible while not making one too much better than the other one is unusual and a fun challenge.  I'd give it a ten, but first time players struggle to grasp how the scoring synergies work and it can frustrate some.

I do hate nor do I like this game. It is like visiting your friends' grandma's house for the first time. You know it is safe but you do not want to be there. Ok, so you have 3 rounds to build a city that is lower in points than your other city with your other partner, but not so low that you lose the game. Then you use this HUGE scoring board at the end to tally points. It is a good filler but the setup and scoring takes longer than actually playing the game. It does feel like a party game and it is safe for the whole family. Scoring looks tough because it is. We spent more time arguing on how it scores than where to place building in out cities.

Between Two Cities strikes a perfect balance of strategy, luck, planning, and cooperative gameplay in a fast-paced, snappy package.

The rules for gameplay are very simple, the city layout/scoring rules are intuitive, and the game moves along at a nice place, since play takes place simultaneously. Setting the game up and breaking it down is also a snap, since the tiles all get tossed into the box.

I'm also a fan of the scoring mechanism, as it prevent collusion between two players, since the lowest score is your final score.

My only gripe with the game is that once the scoring is done, there's always a moment of... "Um, so who actually won?" but that's easily resolved with each player noting their score and comparing them.

This is a really neat game where you are working to build up two cities, working alongside the two people right next to you. Everyone wants to make their cities as evenly good as possible as you only score your lowest scoring city.

It's drafting mixed with tile laying with a semi-cooperative aspect thrown in. Each building type has significantly different scoring.

The game's first and last phase are a drafting session for single tiles, while the middle phase has players place a double tile in each of their cities. The further along you get in the game, the harder the decisions will be, and you just have to hope that you are achieving some kind of balance between your two cities.

I played this in a group of seven players and everyone had such a blast with it that we immediately played another round.

Here's a quick fun tile drafting and placement game that works really well with any amount of the 3-7 players (and has a solo variant and rules for two player games, neither of which I have tried) and does not overstay its welcome. 

The basic idea behind this game is that each player is cooperating with their two nearest neighbours (i.e. the person on their left and on their right) to build a city by laying tiles to complete a 4 by 4 grid. Different combinations of tiles earn a different amount of points. the fun little twist is that the player's final score is that of their lowest scoring city, so they can't just neglect one and concentrate on the other.

I have tried this in a group of gamers and with definite non--gamers and each time it has gone over really well. It plays in around 20 minutes and offers fun an interesting challenges when placing tiles.

No regrets at all about backing this on KickStarter this is a game I can see getting a lot of use and one I have no regrets in backing. Top marks again to the good folk at Stonemaier Games.

A big hit with the family and lack of language dependence makes this a good go-to game.

Lukewarm filler game. On the one hand, it's kind of fun, and engaging enough to keep my attention from drifting. The two cities mechanic is clever. On the other hand, I'm not convinced there's a whole lot of strategy going on here, especially with 6 or 7 players, in which case it's difficult to keep track of who's doing what. The end result is that nobody has any idea who's winning until the final points tally. That being the case, the turns become very samey and lacking in tension.

I wouldn't turn down a play of this, but I likely won't request it either.

RATING: 7.5
Tile drafting game that plays many and plays quickly with some weighty decisions in players' seven game turns. Collusion with neighboring players after tile reveals creates a unique environment where players are helping each other and discussing the best placement. No downtime issues noticed. Only downside is the same-y tiles that give such similar points payouts (usually 3-5 points per tile)that most cities end up scoring similarly unless unfortunate tile draws hamstring a strategy during the double-wide tile phase. It hasn't yet, but I imagine another game or two may find the scoring portion of the game becoming tedious.

I always find new and inventive mechanisms intriguing and the simple semi-cooperative game of Between Two Cities strikes a chord with me. Add to this an EU friendly shipping and the decision is made: this will be my first Kickstarter game!

Update: Sold because after having played 7 Wonders, I realized that those kind of games are to shallow for me.

This game as really worked well for all groups that have played it. Even my wife and daughter like to play this. Final scoring can be a little underwhelming. It does not quite feel like you have won at the end, and there are actually jokes about being the best loser.

However for ease of play, and accessibility this game has it all.

Initially loved this game.  Then one of players decided to play by randomly selecting their tiles and one of their cities won.  In an attempt to see if it was a fluke, we played another game and all of us played our tiles randomly.  In the end, all our scores we within a very small margin, meaning it doesn't really matter what you pick.

I watched the Kickstarter closely and was very tempted, but ultimately I didn't have the funds to backed before the funding period ended. After watching the gang on GAMENIGHT! played this I decided it would be a good gateway game to play with some friends of ours and move it up higher on my wishlist. Glad to have received it from my sister for my birthday.

My first tableau game that builds a city with such simplicity. The rules are well done, and the game play is so smooth even at the higher player counts. It's definitely a good filler game, clocking in at a low time count if everyone knows how to play.

The game is fun and light enough to bring to a small gathering, and has so much diversity and replay-ability.

Fantastic filler at all player counts (1, 2, 3-7, and even 8-14 with an extra copy), because the solo and 2 player variants are fantastic, and the 3-14 mode has a totally new competitive mechanic that requires team work with your neighbors.  You build 2 cities through drafting ala 7 Wonders, 1 city each with both of your neighbors, and in the end your lower scoring city is your score, so you want to build them up equally. Brilliant fresh air in gaming.

We picked this up after hearing about an alternate 2 player variant using one of the bots as a third player. It worked out surprisingly well and puts this into an unusual spot of being a great game at both a low and high player count. I'm frankly surprised that they didn't ship the game with this variant from the get go.

Points scored only with the help of your neighbours - the trick being to encourage both your neighbours to help you at least as much as themselves.

RATING: 2.5
So one issue Ive learned from this is that I dont care for drafting games with those as the main or only mechanic. You have little control over what cards you get from others or whether a certain needed card will appear in the future. You cant know what your opponents are doing and its just overall too tactical for my taste. I enjoy their speed like in 7W but overall would rather play a game with more control and strategy over this kind of game. Admittedly the luck is mitigated a bit since EVERYONE doesnt know if certain cards will appear but Id still prefer a game with a lot more information and predictability. 

Also between this and 7W, Id much rather 7W since I dont need to rely on my neighbors in that one. Its a poor cooperative where you dont know what your partner will draft or what tiles may be passed to him or her.

Lastly and no fault of the game (but it lends itself to this by design imo so partial fault), there is an alpha gamer issue and issue of relying on your neighbor. My neighbor Cat literally chose not to help my city so we would both be held back and aided her other city more. When the game breaks down at that level, I as a gamer can do nothing to salvage the city and will probably lose witnt her at that point. In a euro or strategy game, I could control my destiny more and ignore her actions. Also the player to my other side was very controlling and irking and I just never want to deal with that kind of partner ever again. Though he was better than the girl at least.

Oh and the score summary cards could be better imo. Its also hard to see everyone's boards.

A poor 7W imo.

The two-faced co-op nature of this game is fun... especially since self-interest ultimately rules all. It turns what is a rather simplistic game (is it possible for anyone with half a brain to do terribly?... it seems like most games are won by one or two tiles at most) into a consistently engaging activity. The range of player counts that it supports and its brief runtime are positive attributes as well. I can't help but feel it's an expansion or two away from greatness, however.

It's a memory game. What was I supposed to be building, how can I do that?

In the end for me, it was just grab a random tile that sort of fits and place it.

I couldn't work out how I might make a better city or how I might improve my chances, nor did I care to.

I'd rather play quadropolis.

RATING: 2.5
The game works, and I guess there is something to be said for a game that can be played in a reasonable time with many people at the table... but it's just lacks any soul, and calculating/comparing scores quickly becomes tedious with more people playing.

If you love drafting, don't mind that negotiation/interaction is extremely limited, and want a game that works for large groups, then keep this in mind I guess?

Just be warned that there are clearly better choices for drafting or negotiation games. I'd also argue choosing an utterly mediocre game just to keep a large group at one table (instead of either choosing a different game or splitting the group) isn't a smart move.

I usually find tile laying light and boring unless it is part of a richer system (like Vikings, GT, Noblemen, IoS) but this one, where you're working on 2 teams at the same time, sends a good vibe with a simple twist.

RATING: 5
Between Two Cities is a simple tile placement game with drafting mechanics. It would be exceedingly dull if it weren't for the nature of its central gimmick in which you choose and place your tiles in cooperation with the players on either side of you. Trying to anticipate what your city-building partners will choose and attempting to choose appropriately yourself is mildly engaging. The game's artwork is bland and the color choice is murky. Endgame scoring that requires tally sheets is a deal-breaker for me in far better games than this, and was just another stone on BTC's grave.

RATING: 9
A pure drafting game that manages to introduce a fresh twist to a somewhat tired subgenre (7W, Sushi Go): collaborate with your neighbors! Destined to be the next gateway hotness, if it hasn't become that already. Only danger is it can play itself out quickly (as is true of this subgenre generally).
----
it does play itself out quickly, but somehow that quality doesn't detract that much from the experience. The collaborative nature of the game is a (relatively) unique element, and the fact that it plays well at the odd numbers means it's usually a good tote to a game night. This is after 9 plays, which, given that the modern gaming conundrum (cult of new crossed with games glut) allows for 1-2 plays of a game rather than the canonical 30, speaks well for it. Upping my rating from 8.

The quality is the Stonemaier's standard of excellence. Thick cardboard, great city markers... I just don't like very much the illustrations.

The game is easy to understand, and fast paced.

The core of this game is very similar to Sushi Go!, you just need to add the placement of the tiles and the twist: the fact that you're bulding 2 cities, one with each of your neighbours, is a stroke of genius.

But then, the gameplay is a bit dull. I feel the game is playing me, I feel that my decisions don't matter enough. It's just about getting the tiles you need or not.

First Impression (4 players) : 
Firstly, NEVER I have seen so much of game components being used for so little (cards for choosing starting player... are these some kickstarter xtra or what?)

The game itself is one of a kind (that I know), co-operating with others but ultimately one player wins which is clever idea in itself. Player builds two cities, one with both players seated on his right/left. Sadly I did not like too much because of two things : 1) Natural kingmaking situations / talk-to-win at later stages of game, especially when combined with : 2) Too tedious scoring for this "score is lower of two". It is advantage if you would/could/want to keep mental score of both cities but it is at least for me too much work but still bothers knowing i'd do better doing it.

It's not going to change the way you think of gaming, or even provide anything ground-breaking.  What it does accomplish, however, is allowing what might otherwise be considered a "filler" to take on a few more meaningful decisions.   What this means is that new players will find it doesn't overwhelm them while experienced players will find enough interesting choices to make the effort worthwhile.

Overall, a charming little game that has a place with a new crowd or a mixed crowd.

[b]Between Two Cities[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I enjoyed my one play and would be happy to try this again. The best part of the game is trying to work with both of your neighbors to try and maximize your scoring for each separate city. I'd be more tempted to pick up a copy, but the art and graphic design is ugly and a huge turn off for me. [/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Plays quick, would be a great "heavy" filler.
- Trying to balance two cities with two different partners sets up a fun challenge.
- The round 2 tiles are double building tiles which really limit where you can place them, making the choice of which one to sselect very difficult.
- I question the long term replay value with such a limited number of building types.
- I think the artwork is horrendous, the colors are really dark and the building look like clip art.

I was quite surprised by Between Two Cities, I wasn't expecting it to be as fun as it was. The shared scoring mechanic works quite well since each person will only score their city that is worth less points. All the tension comes from trying to work with two partners who are also trying to build another city, with a different partner, that you want to see fail. They need to balance both of their cities as well which will sometimes lead to a sub-optimal play on the city you share. I may consider picking this up because it would be a fun game to play with my family, but I'm still not sure how many plays you'd get out of it before it started to feel samey. Definitely a game I'd recommend checking out.[/i]

Any game that takes 7 players well, plays at a nice filler length, gives a nice decision each turn, and all with no downtime, is a winner. And so it proves here. The decisions aren't that deep - there are only so many ways to score and some turns are more obvious than others - but for the market it's aiming for, it hits the right tone ... enough to keep you engaged, without being frivolous or overwhelming. I'm a fan of the novelty factor as well, where you're simultaneously building a city with each neighbour. It encourages you to make lead plays that you're hoping your partner will follow, and this generates a satisfying social element. I liked it, centurion.

First plays with 6 and 7 players were very solid... game was well received.  Scores on the first game were a little wide, but by the second, the scores were pretty bunched up.  Best thing about the game is the quick pace, and short time frame.. other plusses are the competitive cooperative tension and the unique strategy for arranging the table by drawing a card to set the player order... We liked the idea, but the two draws, length of hair and shirt color in rainbow order were both kind of weird...

I am curious as to whether the game will be good after 10 plays...I already find myself wanting to mix it up some more...

Fast and easy, but not very fun, and not much of a game. The random factor is huge. In the later part of the game severe downtime might occur if each player wnat to optimise, since scoring takes about as long as it takes to play the entire game, and if you then want to count how much the cities are worth right now to optimise it'll take a long time.

Between Two Cities is a short tile-drafting game that uses a closed, 7 Wonders-style draft.  This game has a very key difference, however--instead of trying to screw over the person you're passing tiles to, you're trying to help them out.  On each turn, player select two tiles from their hand to be placed into two cities, one on either side them, between the player and the next player (you're literally "between two cities").  In this way, each player is working with the players on either side of them to try to create the best possible city.  The tiles are pretty basic, and score in a variety of set-collection ways that may or may not depend on where they're placed in the city.  At the end of the game, a player's score is the score of his worst city, so players can't build up one side at the expense of the other.  Overall, I found this to be a nice little filler with a modicum of strategy--nothing too deep here.  It might get samey after a while.

RATING: 8.2
This is an excellent, light tile laying game that is similar in many respects to classics like Carcassonne & Suburbia, but with a 7 Wonders style draft mechanism. What really sets it apart, however, is that everyone must work with their neighboring opponents to jointly create the best city they can. Each player's final score is based on their lowest scoring city. The winner, then, is the person who managed the highest scoring city of the game selected from the lowest scoring of the two cities that each person contributed to. 

Though it seems like this game would be best suited only for 3+ players (it plays up to 7!), it does also come with rules for a solo play mode, in which you work cooperatively with and compete against a bot named Automa (actually two bots, Automasso and Automarta). The solo system works amazingly well, and really helps to improve one's multiplayer gameplay.

Though Between Two Cities plays up to 7 people, it still moves very quickly. Since the game is based on a draft & tile placement mechanism, everyone performs their actions at the same time. So as more and more players are added, the game duration changes little. The only real difference is in the time it takes to score each city at the end of the game.

Played one game with five players. While there's a lot I really like about it (short and easy) it didn't work so well for our group. The reason for this is because the players in our group are competitive and vary pretty wildly in skill levels. This particular combination doesn't work well because the highly strategic players could be randomly paired up with the lower skilled players and score pretty badly because of it.
I think if you have a group that is less competitive OR a group where everyone is pretty equally skilled, this could be a solid win but for us it just doesn't work.

1-7 players in 20-30 minutes, bingo. Solves the problem I have with a lot of drafting games in that is a completely solo experience. Usually in drafting games you stick with what you do best, detouring from that is usually painful to your game. Since you have to play on both sides and do both sides well, there are decisions that need to be made on what you will take, what your teammate will take and what you might want to pass.

This covers a large player count in a short time and has been played multiple weeks in a row with my game group waiting for a second wave of people to show up.

Kicsit 7 Csoda, kicsit Quadropolis. Mindenki kap 7 lapot, kiválaszt kettőt amiből egy-egy várost épít közösen a szomszédjával. A maradék lapot tovább adja, a legvégén pedig eldobja az utolsót, majd jön a következő kör, amikor ellentétesen adjuk tovább a kártyákat. A játék három fordulóból áll.
Hogy milyen lapok vannak?
Gyárak, lakóépületek, éttermek, üzletek, parkok és irodaházak.

Partner collaboration, lightweight city building via tile drafting, laying and set collection (Zoning optimization). Simple to teach, components have self-explanatory icons. Very little down time as everyone is taking simultaneous actions, plays quick. Novel first play determining cards and final scoring.
-Variant rules for 1 and 2 player games; 1/2 player games do lose the social interaction and collaboration aspects. Could be a little too simple for some after multiple plays

Compared to Suburbia: a lighter, gateway friendly, party/group ready game.

This is a very quick drafting game, where each turn you pull two tiles from your current hand, and then apply one tile to a city you share with the player to your left and one tile to the city you share with the player to your right. At the end of the game, you score for your worst of the two cities, with ties broken by player's best cities. Really interesting, and one of those games where by the time you have the hang of things, the game is already over. I enjoyed this but it never seemed to present me with any difficult choices. You also don't really have a proper sense of what each city is worth until the very end. If you were to update the city scores after every play, the downtime would start to really drag. This felt so close to what could have been an amazing game.

A fun game to play, with an interesting approach to winning.  I found the scoring and determining who won to be a little fiddly and difficult to follow, but overall I enjoyed myself while I was actually in the game.  A nice alternative to 7 Wonders, anyway.  It's rare to find a game that scales 1-7.   That said, I don't think I'm interested in a one player game...there are plenty of good solitaires out there.  
One thing I particularly liked was the "seat order" cards, although it was sort of hard to work out why it mattered so much that they were needed.  If you're playing with people you hate, I guess...

Between Two Cities was DULL. The basic idea that you collaborate with each of your two neighbours to build a city, with your final score being the lower-scoring of the two, is quite neat. But it's a drafting game where everything ends up being worth almost exactly the same - our seven players were spread over the dramatic range of 51 to 56. And the 'semi-coop' element isn't nearly as interesting in practice as it is in theory either.

Overall, the fact this game can play 3-7 (with variants for 1-2) and takes maybe an hour tops, is really impressive. It's got some nice drafting and simple enough scoring. But I wish the game had some more meat. Some tiles' scoring is dependent on adjacency, some on number, some on orientation, and some on having the most in your city. But there's no complexity beyond that. The game is smooth and streamlined, but it's just a little too light for me. I'm not saying I wouldn't want to play it again, it's a very easy game to play, it's just frustrating that it doesn't really feel as engaging as it could be.

Not bad, but not great either?  Easy to teach and plays fairly quickly - usually less than 30 minutes.  Can also play up to 7, I believe, which is nice.  High player count improves the game and does not extend playing time.  Probably best used as a filler when you have a lot of people.

RATING: 8.5
I really enjoy the 3+ player game.  It's really nice to have something like this where you can cooperate with other players so everyone will help each other out during the game because you are very vested in your partner doing well on the city between you.
I feel neutral towards the 2 player game.  There doesn't seem to be much depth in the play or meta.  It's something good and quick to pass the time though.
I have yet to try the solo variant, will hopefully update this review after I try it out.

Concerning the 3+ player game:
Positives:
Everyone has a vested interest in helping their partners out.  This makes for a positive experience with even the most aggressive people.
The game plays very fast.  After the first game, your games will probably take a lot less time than advertised on the game box.
There are some moments with make or break excitement like when your partner picks exactly the tile you needed in your joint city to make a very good score, or you don't get a tile you really need.
Small box makes it easy to store and travel with.

Negatives:
Very competitive players can get very annoyed when partnered with less experienced players who don't pick well during the secret tile draft and basically already know they've lost before the game starts.
Scoring takes a long time for a game which is so fast at all other times and can lead to lost focus on the game.
Components are mostly cardboard and I usually like a little more plastic or metal in my games.

A basic drafting game with a nice quirky twist. I like working semi-cooperatively, but exclusively with my neighbors. There's a satisfying level of player negotiation going on every round which makes Between Two Cities a much more personal experience than 7 Wonders. Scoring only the worst of your two cities also keeps things exciting.

Basically, I'll buy any half decent game that supports this high of a player count, but it also helps that this is a genuinely fun game, ripe for interesting expansions.

1-7 players.  Works well even with a lot of players.  OK with 3 players, but probably better with more.
This is a fun, lightweight alternative to 7 wonders. I would almost certainly rather play this than 7W just because of the extreme ease of setup and speed of play. We played 4 player in about 20 minutes with final scoring, and because you are limited to playing just in your two neighboring cities, I don't see this going up by much with more players, even up to the 7 cap.

It is definitely light, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. As an appetizer/filler it has quite a lot going for it. Recommend you try this before buying 7 wonders.

You're building one city with the player to your left and one city with the player on your right.  You get scored based on the WORST of those two cities.  Semi coop.  It's fun.  Great game.

Jogo muito simples, numa mistura de "7 Wonders" e "Cities", que para não ser tão descarado levou uma mecânica de semi-cooperativismo, que creio até ser desnecessária, pois o jogo é muito mais agradável se jogado "à la Sushi Go", pelo menos se a 3 jogadores. Desnecessário é também o gigantesco quadro da pontuação, bem como os belíssimos pontuadores, mas que servem para usar mais tarde em qualquer outro jogo, pois há muitos que precisam de um acessório assim; seja como for, o jogo está aprovado!

It's a pretty good filler, which plays a large number of players - and is interesting without being too taxing. My only real concern is that I don't see much replay value - I suspect this will get stale fairly quickly. (But it hasn't yet after 2 plays.)

É simples, rápido e bem gostoso de jogar, mas não tem absolutamente nada de novo. A própria colaboração na montagem das cidades é bem pouco relevante para o jogo como um todo, na minha opinião. Se cada um tivesse uma única cidade para montar sozinho, o feeling seria o mesmo.

Pra outras partidas, eu tentaria jogar sem negociação. Cada um escolhe o tile que quer pra cada cidade, e o máximo de decisão conjunta é onde colocá-lo. A negociação gera um certo AP pois força a ficar contando os pontos de cada cidade coletivamente toda rodada.

I love competitive games that allow players to cooperate for individual benefit.

Between Two Cities actually forces players to cooperate. Each player is involved in two alliances: one with the player to their left, the other with the player to their right.

At the end of the game, the player's score is equal to that of his lower scoring alliance.

You need to calculate all possible tiles for both your cities many many times, both when you select tiles from your hand to play and when both you and your neighbours show what you have chosen. Without knowing the respective score of your two cities you lose the main thing that the game is about, to try to make your two scores equal. 

To make both of your cities the best you need to calculate the score of the other cities too, but it is just no fun to do that constantly. You have to check the other cities at least a bit, to know how they are doing in industry and what they are picking that you will not get. 

So you just have to do it mostly by feeling and just do a little calculation from time to time. But for a game to play by feeling this is too long and much too maths-heavy. It ends up feeling random, you play it through and see who won.

This is a perfect example of lazy game design - take a great idea (sharing two scoring areas with partners, trying to maximize both) and then design the most minimal amount of game around it.  Almost no attempt to attach any theme - I can't even recall what the art was on the tiles.  Sushi Go, pretty pasted on theme, puts B2C to shame.  So much potential for creating a cool-looking city, with building with special abilities, a major road, outer walls, etc. that was abstracted to yellow/green/red/etc. tiles with some background art you don't notice.

And the scoring system missed the boat - trying to maximize your lowest scoring thing is a great idea, but it works in Ingenious so well because you track exactly each of your scores at all times.  In B2C, you can sit down AP-style and track in your head how each of your cities is doing score-wise but that's not really in the spirit of the game - why not make a way to track, like mid-game scoring after each round?  When you design a game that's almost guaranteed to have at least a two-way tie every game, it's kind of stupid to call them tie-breakers.  Why not have scoring be the combined score of your 2 cities, or better have ways to get bonus points for cool stuff on your side of a city that your partner doesn't get.  

Great idea to encourage discussion between players about how to place tiles into their shared city, but then give no mechanics to facilitate this? It's kind of against the spirit to indicate to your right-side partner what tile to take, but why not encourage this?  Have money that you can bribe your partner to take a tile you want, or place a tile where you want it (especially if you prefer some tiles to be on your side of the city, for bonus points).  And why not take just one tile each turn and leave the decision to the player about which city to place it in (another source for negotiation), so each city doesn't need the same number of tiles.  Maybe have different goals a la Suburbia that you and your partner are trying to decide which to try to design your city towards.

So much potential, so much meh.

Between two cities packs a lot of fun into a short timeframe.  In Between two cities players are building a city with the  player on their left and  another city with a player on their right. Players all draw simultaneously and place the pieces in the city with their partner. However this game is not a co-op  and you need to work on both of your cities because the lowest scoring city is going to be your score in the game. A really fun tile laying game that can accommodate up to 7 players.

The best part about this game is how quickly it plays with a large number of people. That's a very rare thing in hobby-gaming. Usually the more players you add the more time you add.

I enjoy drafting games and this one is just so interesting to play. I love that you are playing co-op with two separate people and having to balance which tiles should go in which city.

Simple game, but the scoring is a lot harder than the playing of the game. Players are guessing / estimating how well their neighbouring cities are doing and trying to even up the scoring - the lowest scoring city is your score. Yeah, there's not much to it really. A bit of a simplified Suburbia with a selection mechanism and scoring mechanism we've seen before. It would have been nice to see something new. Great components.

Kickstarter deluxe edition number 1020/5100

After 1 play and with only 3 players I am really loving this game. Went with 2 different strategies for each city. One was heavy offices and taverns for 54 pts and the second and highest scoring city was factories and houses divided by a row of 4 shops for 57 pts. Can't wait to play this with more players and see what happens. Amazing Stonemaier production and kudos to Rossert and O'Malley on a wonderful design of tile drafting and city building with a nice dose of negotiation thrown in.

Edit: 10/11
After 6 plays highest city has been 64 points. My second city that game was a second high of 61 for the win. 5 houses for 25 pts and all 4 tavern types in the city worth 64 points. This really is a wonderful filler: easy to teach, great fun to piece together, and enjoyed by all!

I really like the way this game plays but it is really let down by its lacklustre artwork. To some extent I feel judging a game by its artwork is a bit like judging a book by its cover - but then the theme of a board game is much more important than the front cover of a book. Perhaps someone can point me in the direction of an alternative game with a similar mechanic but much more visibly engaging?

2016: ?. Not sure what I think of this game yet.  It's not terribly complex, the decisions aren't terribly interesting, and the scores aren't terribly different from each other.  And yet...it's strangely pleasant?

2016: 8. After a number of plays, I'm coming in at 8.  I really like this game!

The game *is* light, the decisions aren't super intense, but there's some forward thinking/mind reading to do when thinking about what tiles you're passing to your partner, and hoping they'll pick up on your signals.  All that aside, what I like most is that *everybody* ends up talking with each other!  The game is very social and creates a really wonderful vibe around the table.

The spacial aspect of the puzzle also gives a little more to chew on beyond something like Sushi Go.

I wonder what this would be like as an ice breaker game.  At the start of each round, make small talk or ask a personal question of your partner?  Something to try...

There isn't a lot of game here. The gimmick of having to build 2 cities is cute but the gameplay is not very deep. It's weirdly a little too complicated with the scoring for non gamers but way too simple for someone who wants a challenge. The city tiles are also pretty bland to look at. If I have a light city game, I want it to be pretty.

Semi-cooperative drafting/tile laying game.  Players work collaboratively to draft tiles and build two cities with their neighbors.

The game itself is relatively simple, but it plays quickly and presents some interesting decisions.

The gameplay here is really, really good. I enjoy how you're working with your neighbors at the same time you're drafting tiles with them to build the cities and the scoring is varied enough to generate some interesting decisions. What really stops me from liking the game and putting it into the top echelon of games is the endgame scoring. Since you're sharing your cities with your neighbors, much comes down to tiebreakers and so a win here somehow feels unsatisfying. I realize that it's a central function of the design and is what makes the gameplay good, but I didn't feel necessarily like my endgame result was really something that I had earned. Maybe subconsciously I don't like the semi-cooperative element when it comes to deciding the winner.

1 play, 6er

It's a pretty simple tile-laying game: each round (of 3), everyone gets 7 tiles. You draft 2, passing the rest (round 2's tiles are doubles, like dominoes, and you only get a hand of 3). Reveal and place the 2, one to your left and the other to your right -- you're building 2 cities, one with each of your neighbors. You'll discard the last tile at the end of the round. Tiles come in several flavors, each of which score at the end of the game in a different way (e.g., a bunch in a line, or total number in the city, or most in the city, etc.). At the end of the game, calculate the value of every city. Each player's score is the lower of the 2 cities they built (tiebreaker is the other score). Most points wins!

After the end, we discovered Ken has been playing this wrong. We played that you choose and allocate, then reveal and position the tiles. The actual rules: decide how to allocate your tiles [i]after[/i] revealing your chosen 2. I think Ken's variant is a MUCH better way to play it -- I would hate to have to negotiate every turn about where each tile should go!

It's OK, I guess, but I don't really love drafting, and seems to be too random for my tastes. At least it's quick ... but I don't need to own it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is one of the better fillers I've ever played.  I was super intrigued by the original concept that each player shares a score with both their left and right neighbors.

This is a tile drafting game.  Each player is handed a set of tiles, picks two, and passes the rest.  One of those tiles will go into the city you are building with your left neighbor, and one into your right.  Each tile type scores in a different way and at game end you score your lowest scoring city.

This game achieves something very few games do well.  Creating a very deep rabbit hole that can be played perfectly fine on the surface as well as offering players to go as deep down that hole they'd like.  In my first game I simply tried to score the best I could in both of my cities.  I didn't worry too much about what my opponents were doing, what I was passing, or even the exact scores of my cities.  I just put tiles into both of them that I thought would score the most points figuring as long as I did that they would score about evenly (which should be your main goal in this game).

If I were to play again I would certainly pay more attention to my exact scores first and foremost as well as watching what I pass to my neighbor to make sure they get something I want them to play in our city the next turn.  From there I can start actually looking around the table to identify the biggest threats and try to manipulate the game around that.  There's a lot of depth still to mine out of this game that can be played for the first (or really any time) with reasonable ease and accessibility.

It also goes lightning fast.  I was surprised by how quickly this game went in our first play where nobody knew how to play yet.  And I still got a lot out of it, it didn't feel like a truncated or rushed experience.

Interesting semi-coop as you are building a city with the person to the right of you and another city with the person to the left of you, and your individual score is determined by your worse city. You build your city via a tile drafting mechanic. The artwork was rather bland/generic. The idea of building a city with each of the players next to you was interesting, but not enough for me to request another play.

A really neat twist on co-op play and city building when you build 2 cities, one with the partner to your left and the other with the partner to your right, while you are still out there for your very own win. 
The mechanics of the scoring remind of Quadropolis, though this is one is older. The short length plays in its favor, I think it is great game to start the night before you move to something meatier and I love that it can hold 7 which I haven't played at yet but I would like to think that this scales well. 
Haven't tried the 2-player or solitary variant and while I don't think they are necessary I think it is great that "Between Two Cities" provides that option.

I like this game. It's like a very simple version of Suburbia, where the complexity comes from the fact that you are building [i]two[/i] cities, one together with the player sitting to your left, and another together with the player sitting to your right.

It's easy to learn, it plays quickly, and it's a very interesting take on semi-coop.

The only question mark is how well it holds up for many plays.

7 Wonders with tiles; instead of making one themeless point salad you're preparing two, one with each neighbour. The same drafting mechanism is there, but players take two tiles, one for each adjacent city. The winner after 20 minutes of tedium is the player with the highest score for their lower-scoring city.

It's quick but the placement puzzle is relatively dull and the luck factor is both significant and annoying, particularly in the double-tile round. 

The charm comes from the semi-cooperative nature of play, which creates a convivial atmosphere and makes the game feel more interactive than it is. Gute Nachbarn did the same thing better 30 years ago. 

I like it more than 7 Wonders because it's faster and therefore over sooner. Happy to never play again.

I like the game. My strategy, however, stinks. You build two cities, but you don't score your best city, you score your second-best city. But your second-best city has to be the best second-best city. Yeah, you heard that right. So, should I sabotage the city on my left so it isn't number 1? Oops, too much sabotage, now it's in last place.  Darn it! Usually my cities end up in the happy medium. Unfortunately not medium enough to win. You can play with seven people and it doesn't take much longer than playing with three. This and 7 wonders are go-to games when we have 7 people at game night.

This is a tile laying game with partners.  you are making two cities with the partners next to you.  one city with the partner on the right and one city with the partner on the left.  then your score is the highest of the two.  the city has 6 different categories of tiles that are scored in different ways by how and shape the tiles are laid out.  The game has a tile drafting system where you take a couple tiles form a pile and then send the remaining tiles to your neighbor.  Game plays quick and works well.  It is just not my cup of tea.  I like much heavier games and this game just felt way to lite for my tastes

The game is just way too light, doesn't have nearly enough meaningful decisions, and what decisions you do make do not appear to have much influence in the outcome  at all because the scoring drives everyone into the same VP pool (unless one of the players obviously screws-up).

Plays fast (under 30 minutes), but it completely failed to hold my interest even during that short time period. In fact, I disliked this game intensely (sold) - it is dull beyond words.

tl;dr: Teamup drafting [thing=123260][/thing]

This game combines tile laying and scoring similar to Suburbia (me likey) with the drafting of [thing=68448][/thing] with a teamup element as you're teaming up with both your neighbors to build the best cities. So you always participate in the building of 2 cities, one with each neighbor, and the nice twist is that the lowest scoring one determines your score. And it only takes 25 minutes, no matter the amount of players. Very nice, I enjoyed it!

I'm a big fan of coops, but they have been feeling pretty samey lately and usually have the same alpha player or replayability problems.  I also don't like the semi-coop feature of games like [thing=129437]Legendary[/thing] where you all win or lose, but someone is the "best" winner.

What intrigued me about Between Two Cities was the fact that it's a competitive game, yet every action you take is cooperative.  The game play is similar to drafting in [thing=68448][/thing], except instead of building your own civilization you are building 2 cities, one with each of your neighbors.  Your personal score is the lower of your two, so you need both of your cities to do as well as possible.  The rest of the game is standard tile placement where each time score various points depending on the number and position of certain tiles in your city.

The city building is nothing revolutionary, but the game gets a lot of credit for creating a new form of semi-cooperative (my favorite form yet).  It can also play 3 to 7 players in less than 30 minutes, so a lot of the advantages of 7 Wonders apply here too.

A pretty plain little game that manages to achieve much more than it should.  It really shines as a more social game, akin to dominos.  There is not a great deal of depth, very little strategy, and it does not have great legs.  

It is however pretty close to a very good gateway game.  The only hurdle would be the six different ways of scoring points.  This can be a little daunting to non gamers.  To be fair though, most of the ways are halfway simple.  

I'd say that 90% of players, regardless of gaming experience, would be able to fully grok the game within two plays.

I was not a fan of the company's flawed previous game (Viticulture), and Euphoria just seems to be mediocre at best, so I was hesitant on this one. I decided to get a copy of B2C since it at least had a different designer and seemed interesting.

As for this game, it seems like there isn't a ton of strategy and your decisions don't really affect the game too much. So why give it an 8 rating?

Cooperating with your two neighbors is fun and feels really unique for a non-cooperative game. You work with your neighbors each round to maximize the the amount of points in each of your cities. Also, this would serve as a great gateway game, even easier to learn than 7 Wonders. The whole cooperation aspect would even allow veteran players to directly help new players while also helping themselves and explaining elements of the game. Really smart design.

About the strategy, it seems like you're a little bit at the mercy of the tiles there. The draft should mitigate some of the luck of the draw, but since every hand of tiles is completely random you can still get stuck with things you don't need or you can be missing the one thing that you do need. The game is fast enough, though, that even at the higher player counts you can finish a game in 20-30 minutes so you could easily play multiple games in a row so that everyone would have a chance.

Still, even with that criticism, the game is just so simple, fun, and unique that I can easily recommend it.

Update: The expansion is out now and it is great. I highly recommend the expansion, even with first-time players.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 4+[/b]
With two players the game loses everything that makes it interesting because you lose the cooperation. The three player game is just okay, but there won't be enough variety or competition.

Tiledrafting, coopetetive play, 7 players - that sounds great for my weekly group. And there is a dolo automa, too. First plays with the solo intro and two player variant reveals a nice light puzzle that feels like a great match for our group. Feels a bit like a lighter Suburbia with some 7 Wonders (the drafting) thrown in.

Between Two Cities is a very quick, drafting/city building games. You start the game with 7 tiles. You pick two to build and pass the rest. You are building a city with each of your two neighbors. After everyone reveals the tiles they kept you discuss with your neighbors how you want to place the tiles you kept, one much go to each city. The cities will end up forming a 4x4 grid and placement and how things border each other is a big part of the game. At game end, you score whichever of your two cities got the lower score, so there's an incentive to build fairly between your two neighbors.

On the first draft, you'll pick 2 tiles 3 times. Then there's a second drafting round but this time you're picking 2 tiles from 3, but the tiles you pick are a rectangular double-length tile. On the third draft, you'll pick 2 tiles 3 times again, but these will be the standard size tiles again.

There's six types of buildings which score different ways. Blue scores for having a lot of blue buildings and being next to red buildings. Red buildings score for having different types of red buildings, yellow buildings score for having a lot of yellows in a straight line. Green scores like yellow, but doesn't have to be in a line. There's a majority contest for Grays. And Browns score based on how many other colors you built, but only if they don't border gray. It sounds a little confusing at first, but it makes a lot more sense after you play.

The game is very quick, but gives you some interesting decisions to make. And you're often torn trying to figure out which neighbor you need to help most. The only downside to the game is that you're very dependent on your neighbors. So if your neighbor does something boneheaded, there goes your game.

Apparently you can discuss whatever you want when placing tiles, not just where to place the tiles (as implied in the rules). I think this is a bad idea and I would rate it higher if discussion were strictly limited to the current placement.

What a pleasant surprise! I wasn't impressed with the initial presentation, but I reluctantly backed this project, putting my faith in Stonemaier games. That faith has been maintained - B2C is a fantastic gateway game. The simple tile laying mechanism and scoring feels a bit like Carcassone meets 7 Wonders, but with ample negotiation to make it interesting. The components are also top notch - lavish, thick, perfectly punched cardboard tiles with brilliant artwork. My two complaints - I feel a score card could help (although the company decided that a scoreboard is better in KS update #5) and I didn't spring for the collector edition!

Great little game!

This is a pretty easy to learn game that I'll often get out with a group of friends for a quick game, even if some of them haven't played before and people tend to really enjoy it. The drafting mechanism is simple and the reference cards are easy to use after a quick explanation of how they work. Sometimes it will take a minute for people to understand the scoring since all buildings are scored in different ways. 

Where the game loses a couple points is in its scoring. Because you will always have the same number of buildings, you can only score so low. Most games are only won by one or two points. Therefore you have to be exacting and very strategic, fighting for every point if you want to make sure to win, which is a bit odd for what feels like such a light game. 

But this game really does the competitive cooperative element wonderfully. I get to work with the people beside me for the best interest of our city, yet I am still out to win for myself. Overall, I play this game for the experience: the fun of drafting, the competitive collaboration, and building a city.

Provisional rating, one play at Spiel. Enjoyed the co-operative drafting, but the tile placement/scoring wasn't very novel and I felt there wasn't enough variety there to support repeated play.

A decent game, I like the ideas of the concept more than the actual gameplay.  I was hoping for more tabletalk, and maybe that's group dependent but it always seemed like I picked a tile with a distinct purpose and there was little need to ever talk about the decision.

It's a nice, light game that is easy to teach and accommodates a large number of players so it's great for that reason.  Nothing I'm that excited about playing though.

Between Two Cities is a partnership-driven tile-drafting game in which each tile represents part of a city.  You work with the player on your left to design one city, and with the player on your right to design another city. Your final score is the lower of the scores of the two cities you helped design.

Special Edition # 240/5100, for whatever that's worth. That said, this one always goes into the bag whenever I go to or host a party. So easy to teach, and if some folks don't quite grok the strategy the first time around, they tend to fare much better the second game. Not something I would want to play all the time, but as an introduction to "modern" board games, it serves me quite well.

RATING: 6
The game is fun, logical and intuitive to play. The problem is that in our 6p game our cities scored between 56 and 59 points... every single one of them. Now that just makes me doubt if any of our decisions and optimizations during the game had any impact at all or if the optimization problem was too easy so we all ended up at the same scores. In any case it felt like a null sum game which dropped the rating from a potential 8(play again) to a 6(don't care about this one) after the scoring was done.

Nothing particularly innovative in the mechanics (basic tile-laying), but it's the concept that is excellent: you are cooperating with both your neighbours at the table, and you score points based on the lowest of your cooperation effort.

Quite a bit I like about this, including how quickly it plays but really not sure how much influence one can have with regards to the competitive element, given the required cooperation.

I liked the idea it was so close, but really may have been too balanced.

Another cultural darling that I'm fine with being so, I just don't find it interesting. Three people is too many stakeholders in a game of this ilk, especially when you can't stab them in the back - or front, as it were. Sure, it's short, but then in order to be so, it's overly simple. There's something odd with the graphics that make it completely unappealing and dull - ultimately the semi-coop then secondary tie-breaker dynamic just isn't interesting enough. It actually is more interesting just straight-up being in competition with other players as far as city-builders go.

Here’s how I’ve been describing this game: 7 Wonders + Suburbia with a bit of cooperation, all in under 20 minutes. My description is by no means unique, but people have been excited to play this one due to it’s unique game play.

I’m always on the lookout for a good filler, and for my group our fillers tend to come at the end of the night and play as many people as possible, so a 7 player filler is the sweet spot. Combine that with mechanics we know and love, but done in a new way, and you have a game that my group really took to (several players were figuring out how they could buy the game).

In case you haven’t played, your goal is to build a city with the neighbors to your left and right. Your score is the lower score of your two cities and the person with the highest score wins (ties are broken using the other city’s score). Your city will be composed of a 4x4 grid of single square tiles and duplex (2x1 rectangle) tiles. In the first round you’ll draft 3 tiles per city (so each city will have 6 tiles at the end of the round. In the second round you’ll draft 1 duplex tile per city (so each city will have 6 tiles and 2 duplex tiles). In the third round, you’ll draft another 3 tiles per city, which finishes things up. You’ll then score each city based upon the sets you created using the different buildings.

This is one of those games that you could teach to any gamer and most non-gamers. It’s easy enough and different enough to draw in new gamers while keeping people who have seen everything entertained. I really enjoyed this one.

RATING: 7
The components are great, and the flexibility of the player count is excellent. I appreciate that it has solo rules, though it is a bit on the fiddly side to manage building 3 cities alone. While the box is small, it isn't quite small enough that I would consider it easily portable. It's also a bit too light to be fully engaging as a solo puzzle, but on the other hand, that will probably help when teaching it.

City builder card draft of tetrus shaped building elements to be placed on a square grid. The key element of this game is the partnership dynamic with your player to the left and right. You simultaneously build 2 cities and the least scoring mechanism forces you into interesting negotiations with each partner. You cannot simply ignore one partnership and max out one design. This alone is a unique game play element that is a must play in my humble opinion. I cannot think of another game that provokes this kind of decision making and negotiation.

A "super-filler" that's easy to teach - to experienced gamers at least. Art is very disappointing for a Stonemaier game, none of the tiles pop, the back of the tile is some general art and components were overproduced for what should have been a little card game or at least carcasonne-type of game. Drafting and working together to build cities works really well though, that's the aspect people seemed to enjoy the most.

Theme/Art:
You build a 4x4 city out of tiles and it looks great. The different building types have different colours and everything is very clear and looks great.

Production quality:
The game is basically only tiles (and double tiles!), which are cardboard. The only other components are the city meeples, which all look very nice.

Replayability:
There are a lot of tiles and you draw them each round, so you build different cities each game. However, you follow the same basic concepts in each city due to the scoring.

Depth/Difficulty:
The game is very easy and takes about 5 minutes (if not less) to teach.

Strategy:
You have to keep an eye on your cities, because you score only the worse of your two cities (which is a phenomenal mechanic in my opinion!), so both of them have to be as good as possible.

Luck:
You draw tiles blind from a box of tiles, so there's a lot of luck involved.

Between Two Cities takes 15-25 minutes to play, depending on the number of players and their familiarity with the game.

I think it's a great filler game and people love it, because you can see your cities grow and you have to plan them with your neighbours.

Co-op / Competitive game that teaches and plays quick.

RATING: 7
Short and simple game with a unique social interaction mechanism. It's cool that you build two cities with your neighbors then your final score is that of your lowest city - that prevents you from focusing too much on one side. Scoring will be a little goofy to new gamers, so expect to help out with that.

Good party game to play when waiting for people to show up to board game nights or between games. Everyone had fun, just not a ton of depth to the game.

Some of the most fun I've had with a really short, simple game - with a great twist on the collaborative / competitive mechanic.

Played once. It was alright. Surprisingly simple once you know how the buildings score. Can see this getting old pretty quickly after repeated play, though. Would certainly play again.

6 after 2 plays

A rather awkward game mechanic where the first tile placed can be rather luck-driven. Interaction is somewhat limited, mainly with your two neighbours. Artwork is ok and some game components seem redundant. Replayability may be on the low side.

Good tile drafting game that can handle 7 players without bogging down. Scoring is about half the game length which is unfortunate.

This was only marginally better than 7 Wonders to me. Another drafting game, with little else going for it. While it supports seven players, it's not interesting enough to want to try to see what kind of towns the other players are building, and therefore I lose interest. Not my kind of game. It may work as a decent filler at a game con to make new gamers become introduced to each other.

Super elegant, quick, great multiplayer game! Great for folks who like 7 wonders, but it even works with 1 to 2 players! Love this game.

Like 7 Wonders with a strong spatial aspect would have been enough... but the partnership building is really unique and interesting too.  Pretty easy to explain, quick (and fun!) to play and scaling well is going to make this a fixture in my game bag for a while.

It's fun game to play. I don't like the you are so depentent on you partner, but that you can't win togeather.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Not a fan of the art style.

RATING: 7
A light tile-layer that has a nice amount of interaction as you try to work out the best ways to  help yourself, but not help your building partners too much.

I like Between Two Cities because it plays six comfortably, there's no down time, and it simulates co-op play without succumbing to its game-breaking pitfalls.  Great purchase.

RATING: 7
After my first play, I felt less in control than I'd like; however, after my second play, I was starting to savor the game's subtleties. The lightweight negotiation, and little surprises that can happen due to the building types' different scoring schemes make this rather interesting. By design, you do not have as much control as you do in most eurogames, but it provides the unique charm of this offbeat concept!

RATING: 8.5
Great game for a large group. I love how well it scales thanks to the simultaneous play. I also love the mechanism of scoring the lower city, so you really can't abandon either of them in favor of the other.

Extremely satisfying 15 minute game, the 'negotitation' between adjacent players is just divine, well done to designers and stonemeier.

I was surprised when playing the game for the first time. I wasn't expecting it to turn out that nice. Will definitely play this one again!

Alapvetően tetszett, de kevés volt az egyszeri próba, szívesen játszanék még vele. A mechanika megfogott egy pillanat alatt, érdekes ötlet.

Ritkán játszunk vele, így mindig kicsit át kell nézni a pontozást, de ennek ellenére élvezetes a játék. A kieggel együtt próbáltuk utoljára, de az is nagyon rendben van.

I like my filler games to have some weight to them, meaning interesting choices every turn. This one fits the bill quite nicely. Scoring can be a pain and takes a good amount of time. You get better at it but new players always seem to struggle with it.

I was positively surprised by this game. Its like a fast paced puzzle you get to solve with a buddy. Playing with a timer is also advisable :) for faster and more enjoyable playthrough.

Play tested this game.  Great, fast tile laying game with very interesting cooperative mechanic.  This is a mash up of my favorite parts of Suburbia and 7 Wonders with out any of the fat.  Supports 1-7 players and the 7 player game takes the same time as the 3 player.  Everyone I played with liked it and wanted to play "just one more game!"

excellent filler game, plays super fast because everyone takes their turns at same time.  combines drafting, tile laying and teamwork/extortion.  fun stuff

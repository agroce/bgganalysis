RATING: 10
Werewolf games cant get better than this. Finally there IS actually deduction and reasoning  not only "you are a wolf because you are"  which I heard soooo many times in Lupus in Tabula.

RATING: 5
Too much complex for casual gamers, too much random per expert gamers. Player elimination is also a very bad element of the game.

It appears overcomplicated with respect to Lupus in Tabula. IMO, a party game should remain simple. Player elimination is an issue.

RATING: 7
Hard to find enough people to, without the app it can be complex to keep track. Very immersive and easy to play (just parlor)

This, IMHO, is the Ultimate version of Werewolf. I've been playing for two years now, and still I'm discovering new tactics and interactions. It's the most sophisticated variant, since each character has layers of abilities, factions, mysticycsm and corruption, making for a rich, cinematic gaming experience.

Non è un gioco di ruolo.
Non è un party game.
Il fatto che sia il gioco "ufficiale" del Mensa Italia qualcosa vorrà dire...

Il confronto con lupus in tabula non sta in piedi è completamente di un altro spessore: l'analisi psicologica e le deduzioni logiche sono assolutamente più varie e più approfondite così come le chances di bluff o di giocate da parte dei "cattivi".
Stanno nascendo dei gruppi regionali in Italia di Wherewolf (cercate in facebook) per chi vuole giocare ma non ha un numero sufficiente di amici.

Il gioco più coinvolgente in assoluto.

I got the game just yesterday, mabe it's too early to say but having just finished the third match in a row I thik I can state with no doubt that this is really an amazing! I love the graphics and the artwork, moreover the concept behind the characters is awesome!!

Rate 8 only because of two things:
- the cards are made with a not soresistant material

- you must be quite a few players to really enoy this game, we were ten today but it is not always so easy to meet up in so many!

Anyway, my very  best compliments to Cristian and to all the team that worked to create this game!

The idea to give everyone a special role seems good on paper but it slows the game down to a crawl as multiple roles need to be activated during the night phase. The deduction goes out of the window as roles present and votes are kept secret so there is hardly anything to build some reasoning about who is who.

I'd like to get my hands on an English copy of this game!

Finally the project becomes reality! After years of plays with prototype the game takes form, thanks to Christian who had the first idea several years ago and bring it now into a game design. This version is the best available for who love this kind of party game based on logic, deduction and psychology mechanics.

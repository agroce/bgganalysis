Fantastically fun game, if you can stomach the politics. The game definitely swings from the left and demands a cynical view of geo-politics. If you find yourself lacking in these qualities, however, never fear -  just watch BBC World News, read the Guardian, vist zmag.org or listen to some Chomsky and you'll come around soon enough.

RATING: 4
A game that was clearly conceived to make some political points in a humorous manner.  In this it succeeds, aided by some amusing cartoony artwork.  The game itself strikes me as a variation on Risk with income handled in a Settlers style, each area generating revenue when its number comes up.  There is a huge amount of luck in the game, which combines with powerful cards to create wild swings of fortune.  Large hands of cards, with more drawn at the start of your turn, can lead to a fair bit of downtime as players assess their options.  Like Risk, War on Terror can drag on and on, long outstaying its welcome.

This game gets a bit of a bad rap having the "broken" tag applied to it. In my experience, while gameplay has been slightly predictible I feel that numerous plays among the same group will cause certain strategies to emerge.

Hands down, terrorist units are the most powerful entities on the board. They can grind the game to a standstill (which is likely why it has recieved the broken tag) however, with experienced enough players the game does not degenerate into who can most effectively use their terrorists. Instead, it becomes a risk variant until one player gets drunk enough to fall off the wagon and ruin everyone's day.

Its a decent social experiment - as everyone knows terrorists don't necessarily "help" in the long term, but one person will inevitably get greedy and start training the buggers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
The satire and tongue in cheek nature of this game might not appeal to all given the subject matter. But look beyond this and there lurks a really good board game. A fine effort from the guys at Terror Bull. It has the feel of a game that was produced and play-tested by a far bigger company and that speaks volumes for their attention to detail.

After one play ( incomplete game )
This is Risk, meets Settlers, meets Diplomacy, with nukes thrown in for good measure. The whole thing is very cheesely based upon the mad, sad world we live in turning the 21st century. There is luck based on card draw and dice rolls, there is a money making engine build, and a whole host of evil and despicable things to do to everyone else on the board. Comparable to Nuclear War in its intent, but with a modernised theme. Good fun with no one ever being "eliminated" from the game.....they just have a different goal. It might not be the "best" game ever but it does need to be played.

After one play:  Hilarious game, but unless you are playing with a group dedicated to trying to win solo (i.e. not go terrorist) or with some variant, then this game has the "Supremacy effect" where one player will go terrorist as soon as he (1) starts to lose, (2) thinks he's starting to lose, or (3) get's bored, and then the next player will follow, and so on, until everyone turns terrorist.

A game like Junta for very particular players

Played this at Ubercon this fall and adored it.  Finally got my own copy.  Mechanicswise it's Risk crossed with Settlers, but it's so much more than the sum of it's parts. The theme is used beautifully.  The satire is sharp and witty.  Passing secret messages rocks, especially when I can tuck $25 million in a folded message just to play mind games.   What other game makes wear the Balacalva of EVIL when you're the global scapegoat?  If you're the sensitive type or a hardcore conserviative, stay away.  If you love messing with people and live to sow chaos, this is a great game.

RATING: 6
This is one of the coolest RISK spinoffs I've seen yet. Pretty clearly, the designers took a classic RISK map and a few loose concepts from the game and proceeded to reinvent the game. There's a fine balance between devoting effort to creating an empire and investing in terrorists groups to thwart the other players. And like real groups, they can turn to bite the hand that feeds them--or turn on one another. Like the old Flying Buffalo title, Nuclear War, this has a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor and takes a grim subject and stands it on its head. And the production perfectly suits it for that role. The game is also careful to not underscore the terrorists as Muslim fundementalists or Communists or Basque separatists anyone else. Empire and Terrorist alike are whoever you say they are. Heck, they could all be pod people. The balaclava is an unnecessary promotional gimmick, but something you might expect the designers would hope to put the game "over the top."

RATING: 4
Rating based on one 4-player game.  Wanted to like this game, but it was a frustrating game with killer downtime.  First couple of turns are slow-moving ramp-up, then suddenly everything hits the fan and the game is over.  Cards seem wildly imbalanced and terrorist powers seem way more powerful than empire powers.  Our group tried to play quickly, but each player's turn took about 5 minutes, so there was a LOT of sitting around watching your holdings get bashed around while you're unable to defend against the attacks.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A chaotic, quirky, mean and sarcastic war game. As such it's quite fun. It's not very elegant though, mechanically.

Voluntarily becoming terrorist and the combined victory of terrorists are weird mechanics. It would be interesting if playing terrorists would be a path to victory, but becoming terrorists is actually more like surrendering.

The cards are incredibly unbalanced, on purpose I must assume. A nuclear bomb can make a huge swing in the game, destroying several turns of progress without any chance to defend, unless you happen to have the right card. Other cards, for example, provide huge amounts of money, or convert other player's developments, all of which can be the equivalent of several turns of progress.

With such powerful cards it becomes very difficult to win, if everybody bashes the leader, and the game can drag on for a while before some players become terrorists and the liberation points needed to win are reduced.

Those of you not put off by settlers' randomness may enjoy this cross with risk + 'take that' cards but the combination is rather too random for my taste these days.  Don't be put off by the theming though - the inclusion of the 'balaclava of evil' should tell you all you need to know about how the designers' tongue in cheek attitude.

It's a fun game... for a while. Played once and it took about hour and a half to play with a full 6 players. Game turns are reasonably fast but the game gets a little repetative the longer it runs. Terrorists look more likly to win the game than the player empires, which is a bit meh. Worth one or two plays but thats it IMO.

This is stupid, sloppy fun. Forget about the loosey goosey quality of the game design. Get crazy with this and go with the flow. WoT is delicious, topical and satirical fun.

Controversial? Feh. I played back-to-back games with ideologically antipodal family members and all of us had a blast. It was fun to hear conservatives say things like, "Screw you, then. I'm dropping a nuke on the Eastern U.S.! Woo hoo!"

If only the real so-called "war on terror" was this fun... I suppose it is for some people (those who are perpetrating it, or profiting from it, perhaps).

Who wants to wear the Balaclava after someone else has been breathing into it for 15 minutes? Kinda gross. And it's really hot in there. Most often, it was draped over a shoulder, which doesn't exactly scream "evil." Fun accessory, nonetheless.

This is a fun game... as long as you play it tongue in cheek and can avoid politics.  ;)  The game itself is fairly good, although it seems it could drag on if you don't completely knock someone out.  I really enjoyed wearing the balaclava of evil though.  If you cannot separate the real world from the game, you should not play, you will be annoyed.  Another fun thing is writing notes.  I wrote random things just so that others would have to intercept them and be confused.  I laughed when they grabbed the paper hoping to see some secret plot against them.

A very creditable effort. The execution of the game is very well done in terms of artwork and components and it provides a good play experience for the first two-thirds of a game. 

I think that the end game needs a second edition rule revision mainly around turning terrorist and terrorist wins. Perhaps something along the lines of although all terrorist players share a turn they are still competing against each other in some way. If the end game is tidied up rating would rise to 8 or maybe slightly higher.

RATING: 9
A seriously under-appreciated game.  It's Risk with strong elements of Catan and a little Monopoly thrown in, and exceptionally fun.

The secret notepad is a MUST for this game, as it adds such a fascinating element: create allegiances, threaten, buy nukes, or just say "hi" while freaking everyone else out.  My friends and I go crazy with the notepad, which add length to the play time, but seriously worth it.

And it comes with an evil balaclava... which is just as awesome as it sounds :)

This was actually the game that got me into boardgames, and led me to BGG too. It's got some Catan elements, some Risk elements, some amusing card effects and liner notes. It allows for player elimination without removing anyone from play. It's also very swingy. They've released a 2nd edition that addresses this. It also can be a lonnng game, about an hour per player in the games I've played!

Flawed but fun if you've got the time.

The secret to this game is the secret note pad. There is a lot of down time and if you don't use that time sending notes back and forth, then you may get bored or even start to care about the seventeen terrorist cells Orange player just dropped into the middle of your empire. I suggest you send notes with drawings of the other players in compromising positions and if you can't send notes declaring secret alliances, send notes that threaten and use loads of swearing words.

Also, you have to wear the balaclava. It's a rule.

An excellent experience (I always have fun), and surprisingly cogent political commentary, but a pretty poor game.  Very loose regarding the rules, and far to free-form for my tastes.  The rules for turning terrorist are pretty much completely broken, especially since most of the people I know are just as happy with a shared victory.  While I only want to play this once a year or so, that once is always a blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The art style in this and indeed even the humour within is not to my taste.

This is a risk-esque derivative where there is an added deck of 'events', either empire or terrorist, and they sort of removed the combat.

I say sort of because whilst you cannot actively attack one another you do play cards forcing your opponents to react and/or convert to terrorism.

The game rules were not explained very well and so I doubt we were playing the terrorists correctly, and I certainly was not prepared in anyway to don the balaclava when I became the 'evil' empire, its unhygenic!

There are lots of complaints about the game length and I can see the damnable thing dragging on all afternoon however we were spared such a fate when one player was left free to colonise all of Asia (accidentally on purpose?) thus reaching the required 9 points.

RATING: 4
We didn't finish our first game, having to jack it in after three hours because we were pushed for time.  The main issue with this game seems to be the obvious advantage to turning terrorist when you are in an untenable position; it is very difficult to win as a sole terrorist but then again if all the empires remain it is very difficult to win if you are losing.  As more players turn terrorist, the likelihood of victory going the way of any empire decreases - dramatically.  The only real chance an empire has is by being in a strong position when every other player has given up on an empire victory - then the empire might, just might, make a low points victory.  This is highly unlikely because the terrorist players have a much easier target as more of them join - thus it becomes very difficult to do anything but win as one of the terrorist players.

With some mild tweaks this game could work so much better than it does; but there are so many games of its ilk that once the initial joke wears thin there isn't much left that this game can use to compete for its place in my collection. I am strongly considering trading it away - it simply suffers too much Supremacy syndrome.

RATING: 5.145
A tough one to review as only one play with 6, and I don't think this is really the optimal way to play it.  I like the theme and the embedded jokes within the cards, I can see what they are trying to do with the risk and settlers fusion, I appreciate the mechanic that instead of a player being eliminated, they are still part of the game by being terrorist.  But, ultimately, it is simply too long, and too chaotic for what it is.  I might consider a 3 or 4 player game if I had a long holiday and plenty of time, but as I'm sadly long past being a student, this type of game just doesn't fit in with the fortnightly 3hrs of board gaming cycle. And I am not a fan of board spinners. So, will probably keep the game mainly as a show & tell (in particular the Civilian Protest Card), but very hard to see myself playing it again (hence the harsh rating of 4). {March 2013} UPDATE For some reason I starting to want to play this again (Rating 5.145 Jan 17)

Basicly it's a mixture from Risk and Settlers of Catan with some twists such as are: Attacks are card driven and rolling dice is only meant for the attacker.
The only game I played I won!  I pretended having barely any victory points but in the endgame knowing that if the action die shows minimum a three I could turn a continent mine and creating some additional Cities to get 10 VP (in a 4 player game). So it's a typical bash the leader system. Not bad at all if you like Risk and settlers. The Theme is set up in a comic style which makes it a little bit less controversal.

Empires struggle for dominance and resources (oil). At the same time they finance and fight terrorism and when everybody gets tired of being an imperialist swine they turn terrorists. It's good to amass loads of money before committing to a life of terror. A broke terrorist is useless.

All in all it is a great party game. It is too long for its own good and needs a few house rules/tweaks to become an excellent game (hence the 6).

Empires compete to develop oil-rich countries whilst funding terrorists as a cheap but unreliable way of destabilising the compeition.  Money comes from a roll of the oil dice; if you're lucky, then not only do you own the countries that spew forth but you've already highly developed them. Two packs of cards (one Empire and one Terrorist) give you the ability to wage war, incite terrorism, and other nefarious deeds. Losing players don't drop out; they switch to controlling the terrorists, and "liberate" whole continents from the alternative liberation of empires.So it's a very interesting game, with plenty of interesting choices, lots of laughs, lots of chances to upset each other's plans, and if you're not going to win at least you can switch sides.The only problems with it as a game are that (i) the rules are occasionally confusing and (ii) turns are quite long, and there's only so much time you can spend wheeling and dealing while you wait for your turn. If there's any demand, I might post some unofficial errata.In the event, I only mentioned to muster two other players, but it was more fun than I expected. The government in Indonesia switched loyalties to J and back to me. J's empire repeatedly lost Pakistan to the terrorists and rebuilt it. I threatened M's oil wells in Libya with a dirty bomb if he dared continue his attacks on my village in West Nowhere from the Falkland Islands. M failed repeatedly to conquer Iraq. J pulled out some UN Weapon Inspectors and confiscated my dirty bomb, at which point M started attacking again.

George Bush's war on terror is here given the kind of satirical treatment that's bound to upset a whole bunch of American conservatives. As a moral tale it certainly has points to make about how the present war originates in the superpower-funded insurgencies of the Cold War and that ethical behaviour ought to restrain the terrorized as much as the terrorist. 
As it game it has serious shortcomings. It's absurdly random, has no sense of moving towards a conclusion and drags on far too long. I'm sure it will continue to find a modest market among the students and older teens that it's clearly aimed at, but adds nothing to the game designer's art.

Only mildly entertaining - too much down time between player moves as there is a lot that a single player can do each turn. Calculated that with the full six players, downtime between moves could easily be 45-60 minutes (up to 10 minutes per player to perfom all actions).

Relatively easy and simple game, fun potential is there, ruined by nature of downtime....and that was with three to four players as I tried it.

I wanted this game for quite a while and finally decided to spend some money and buy it. I've had quite a bit of fun with it, already.

My rating may drop over time as I continue to play it more with different people but, for now, it is one of the jewels of my collection.

It runs long but it is very engaging and you have things to do when it's not your turn (bribe, cajole, bargain, beg...).

It has its tongue planted very firmly in its cheek but it does make some interesting points regarding geopolitics.

Not everybody is going to enjoy this game as it definitely requires some bargaining and manipulation. However, if you like Diplomacy but think it's too cutthroat, then this might be the perfect game for you. If you knock somebody out, they won't forget and now they'll be a part of the terrorists. Good luck keeping them away once they get rolling (and likely get some funding from your enemies).

This had some interesting elements like getting paid for the oil. The downside was that it didn't seem to pay often enough especially early on. Later in the game it depended on how lucky you were in the oil tile numbers that you had. Also using the terrorists gave mixed results. You could attack someone, but then the terrorist was in your way for expansion. With three players we finally got tired of playing and called a draw.

RATING: 6
A satirical look on America's War on Terror. Is there a game in there? Yes, but it isn't very impressive. Its long, a bit tug-of-war-ish and doesn't quite capture the feeling of being Empires or Terrorists. 

Cities and towns get wiped away far too easily and it just seems to take forever to get anywhere in the game. Even the Diplomacy aspect didn't really work. The game was just too long for what it is: a humorous poke at the futility of war on terror.

Components were mixed. A nice big board with some funny art, good cards and paper money. But the plastic bits, what were they thinking?! Tiny flat discs which were extremely hard to pick up and rolled everywhere. That probably added an extra quarter hour to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Chaotic fun.  There are some actual lessons to be learned from playing this game, mainly that Karma will eventually get you.  * Rating lowered. House rule needed to keep everyone from turning terrorist.  The new version 2.0 will address the problem mainly by requiring all countrys to contain terrorists to count the continent for scoring.

RATING: 4
I suppose that anything on a subject like this should make people think even if the game situation does not lend itself to such discussion. Most people will treat this as a silly joking experience (the card text and the mask help a lot with that). I didn't mind doing it once but I won't be playing this again.

RATING: 7
I just got it. No rating yet since I haven't played it. Quality is high though. The mounted board is very nice and the plastic bits, while simple geometric shapes, do their job just as good as  wooden bits would. Included is everyone's favorite, paper money! Otherwise after reading the rules the game is very straight forward and I like the mechanics. How they'll play out with the cards I guess I'll find out when we get it on the table. Finally, on a personal note, I love the art! This is the first thing that attracted me to the game, and no, I don't consider myself an art critic. :)

After finally getting to play (with the 1st edition rules), it's a lot of fun! It accomplishes what it sets out to do I think... gets its message across and entertains at the same time.

I got this as a gift when it was still in print. The box was split in delivery, but I didn't do anything about it because the game was in good condition otherwise. Just to get a feel for it I attempted to simulate a four player game with two players. We made it about half way through before giving up and deciding to wait for a full table. Years later, it had become a collectors item and had still never made it to my table. Found a buyer who didn't mind the box damage, and we settled on a discounted price that still allowed me to add six much smaller games to my collection. I hope he gives it more love than I was able to.

Really wanted to like this game, but doesn't seem to really work with 6 players.  Way too much down time between turns, and some confusion during play.  Points for the coolness of the evil balaklava, the humorous illustrations, and the guts it took to come out with this game.  Maybe better with fewer players, but was pretty boring the first time so not really anxious to try again.

RATING: 7
I utterly despise Risk, but I still managed to get some enjoyment out of this comical Risk-variant, in which players "join the terrorists" as they are eliminated. I can see how with a lot of practice, players could figure out how to co-ordinate their efforts in such a way as to fight back against the inevitable upsurge of  terrorists as the game progresses. But I doubt I'll ever get in this much practice (I did mention that it resembles Risk, right?), and in my first play-through the outcome of the game was only very briefly in doubt.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
This game is funny and fun.  Excellent dark humor and political/cultural satire throughout.  I think it's a decent game as well, as long as everyone at the table buys into the general concept of bashing the leader and timing a transition to terrorist state correctly.

I played with the first edition of the rules and cards, would love to try it with the revised edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1.4
A sometimes amusing game that simply takes way too long after you reach midgame. If everyone is on their toes and the empires help each other then it turns into a near stalemate situation between the empires and the terrorists. Playing WoT was fun at first but soon became a chore and keeping interest while waiting for your turn to come around is difficult.

RATING: 7
First play last night with my wife.  An entertaining experience.  Blends elements from Risk, Catan, and Monopoly with a silly satirical theme.  My wife and I enjoyed it but I think the game would work better with more people.  Also, the game tends to go on way too long.  Some house rules could easily tweak that problem.  

UPDATE:  After playing it with 4 people I can safely say that this is a fun Risk-like game that blends a lot of backstabbery and take-that elements in it.  Borrows from other games certain mechanics and is fun but the length of time it takes to play is its serious drawback.  A time limit or changing the number of points to win could improve it.  Still a fun game I'd be willing to play if offered.

Based on the first game I played this would have been a 7 or 8.

On the second game it lasted 8 hours long.  Nobody was having any fun but at the same time nobody was going to give up (or let up) because if we're going to suffer through an 8 hour game we each wanted to be the guy who "won."  Based on that my rating would be a 4.

I think the game has potential but would require some minor rule changes to make it work.  The problem is I doubt after the last time my group would give it another try.

11 July 2007 - Another play, another several points from the rating.  The game needs a forced end condition because we find it just drags on and on until someone happens upon the win.

This goes into the trade pile.

I bought this game only weeks after finding out it existed, and then had to wait months before I could get a group of people to play it.  The wait was worth it, though, as it was an absolute blast to play.  Players start out the game as an empire, with the goal of "liberating" the world (by taking it over), but in the process of liberating the world one quickly discovers that it's much easier to pay terrorists to do your dirty work for you.  The problem, of course, is that funded terrorists can be used by any empire, and players can even voluntarily dissolve their empire and start controlling the terrorists (and can even win as the terrorists).

This game is absolutely dripping with theme, and is a blast to play if you're with a group of people who just want to have fun.  This is a vicious, backstabbing, cruel game wherein anything goes: secret alliances, payoffs, and bribery are all fair game anytime, anywhere.  If you love freewheeling backstabbing fun with a decidedly liberal political theme, this is the game for you.

After the first play, I can already see what a fun time this game is. However, I do think it is more effective as biting, painfully biting satire than as game--it seems absolutely set up to make the the point that when countries fund terrorists in secret wars against other countries, the only people who win are the terrorists. I couldn't agree more, but I must say it hurts a little to be reminded of that fact.

The balaclava sold it for me!

How many other games are there in which you can threaten rival governments with Nuclear War whilst funding terrorism only to be crushed by an evil allience and forced to become a terrorist yourself? This is one of the only resource games that I have played and actually enjoyed.

Sadly it has been almost completely spoilt for me by rules abuse such as lazy players opting for the voluntary terrorist rule as an easy way to duck out and mess about rather then play the game to completion.

Had to resort to house rules to get any enjoyment out of it which dragged down the rating a couple of notches to the point where I no longer feel its worth hanging on to. Sad but true.

In some ways its a satirical cross between risk and settlers of catan.

Feels like someone played Risk and built this game on top of it. The same basic concept of area control, but you spend money earned from random die rolls to build up your control. All players can fund terrorists, but they can be a double edged sword as they don't work for anyone and can always be bought.

RATING: 3
Take large chunks of Risk and Diplomacy, with dollops of Catan and Monopoly. Stir well and throw in a contentious theme, and you have War On Terror. It's important to play with the right group - this is certainly no 'wives and grandmas' game - and with people who enjoy the backstabby goodness. It's far, far too long though; too reliant on dice rolls to balance the wealth; and the Balaclava Of Evil is the only component I've ever had to put through the laundry after every game.

I say the game is very fun and offers lots to do, but that becomes the downside fast.  Much of our game boiled down to a lot of flip flopping who was in the lead.

RATING: 7
Fun game on global superpowers resorting fight over the control of oil (placed in random countries) and usually resorting to terrorism to offset their opponents. If you are not doing well you can switch to being a full-time terrorist and try to win that way and one of you may be the Evil Empire (balaclava included) who may use both the superpower and terrorist cards. Can be strangely like Labyrinth in the way it pans out.

I had this rated as a 9 but had to decrease the rating dramtically because of some major issues in the game: it should be a punishment to become terrorist - not the easiest way to win. And then there's some cards that are just too powerful that they destroy the fun of playing.

I still love the game in soooo many ways; but it's almost completely destroyed by a few things.

Incredibly popular game that plays like Risk, but allows players to, at times, don the EVIL balaclava once their Empire is randomly designated as EVIL, or to throw their lot in with the terrorists and just attempt to destroy and extort money out of the Empires. Very tongue in cheek, pretty easy to play.

RATING: 7
I've played enough times now to give this game an honest score.. that score is a 7.

It's a 7 because I can't see myself willingly playing this night after night.  It is true that I've had a lot of fun with this game, however, it takes a heck of a long time to play and is as chaotic as all can concieve.  

With that said, I won't turn down of a game of WoT if there are willing people to play it.  This game truly is a niche game, and I would certainly say that this title is not for everyone.  A lot of the cards and tactics in this game are a bit too close and a bit too brash for those people who have truly been victims of the war on terror - I cannot deny it.  Many of the cards, ideals, and strategies go against much of what the free world strives to eradicate. 

The basics are that, similar to settlers of catan, each territory is given a secret token which will dictate its owner's earnings.  When each players rolls the revenue dice, those players who have establishments on each of the corresponding countries will earn money equal to that country's build level.  From there, like Risk, players will attack one another in an attempt to control a majority of the world map.  Should a player be eliminated (or should a player just feel like being eliminated) s/he will join the terrorist faction; this is a faction that represents one 'play' or one 'member', regardless of the actual number of players that the terrorist faction holds.

There are a lot of different ways to win but I must say that every time I've played it the game has lasted for a very long time - to a point where gamers must truly be dedicated to see the game through, lest the game falls to an easy empire or (more likely) terrorist win.

What I will give this game, however, is the fact that this is a game of 'Risk' that is similar to our times.  Much thought has gone into this game, and without a doubt, it will be a collector's item in the future.  Although I have given this game a 7, it's a 10 in my 'must own' category, as it holds a lot of societal interest in its presentation.

After the initial amusement factor, this game isn't all bad in the fact that it serves as an object lesson. That lesson is: Settlers of Catan should not have rules for destroying your opponents, since it would make the game drag on forever.

And I had to wear that silly mask for over an hour. When you wear glasses, it gets annoying really quick.

This is a parody and can be as much fun as the game Nuclear War if you approach it in the right light. 

The key difference between this and Nuclear War is that this is not just a parody but has a real game underneath with some depth and meaningful choices during your turn. The game feels like a series of political cartoons - funny in an irreverant sort of way while entertaining and not superficial.

RATING: 3
I usually enjoy these silly games as much as the next person, but I'm not sure I can bring myself to play this one again. Ok, I've only played it once, and I admit it has its novelty value, but playing this game is like hearing the same joke over and over again. The game drags on for what seems like eternity, reminding me a lot of a completely mundane Monopoly endgame. By the time it was eventually over I couldn't help feeling that it was a pointless waste of hours of my life which could have been spent doing something much more fun, like watching paint dry.

RATING: 9
You'll get the full flavour of the theme/attitude from the game's website. If it bothers you, don't buy it. If it amuses you, do. This is pretty much Risk meets Settlers meets Guillotine, and they've been combined very effectively. The game is surprisingly easy to learn and runs very smoothly. (Minor criticism: they could have cut down the amount of dice-rolling in combat, but it's just about acceptable and nowhere near as bad as in Risk.) It can feel like the game's going to be endless as it's so easy to gang up on any empire that looks like it's close to victory, but I think there are enough subtleties to ensure that that's not a problem if you build steadily and stealthily. Rated 9 after one game.

I wasn't going to give this game a shot because I thought it had an overly cynical, eurosnob, leftist, crap on America sneer to it. Reading some of the reviews convinced me to give it a try despite my misgivings. It turned out to be overly cynical, etc. but it was fun and the humor at least made a small attempt to cut both ways (frex, the Koyoto Accords bankrupt countries foolish enough to sign them). My real problem with the game is that the only way to end it was to have the person on the left of the winner make a sub-optimal move. It seems (warning: from one play) that the only move is to beat up on the guy that's going next--unless he is obviously way out of it. It went on long enough for the humor to wear thin(and wearing that Balaclava can get pretty hot! :) Near the three hour point most of the players seemed to wish it was over; they actually groaned when someone went after the current leader. I would still play again.

RATING: 4
A chaotic game where your choices are dictated by card draws and limited by die rolls, and your success is determined by die rolls, where planning ahead is nearly useless, and a single decision can instantly change the entire situation. The one game I played ended when I decided I'd had enough of the game, turned terrorist, and immediately shared a victory with the previous terrorist. It can be fun for the right group, but all in all, it's not what I'd consider a particularly good game. (And nobody wanted to wear the dumb ski mask.)

RATING: 4.5
If Steve Jackson made a game that combined elements of Risk, Settlers of Catan, and Monopoly, this is what you'd have.  This game can be a ton of fun as long as everybody is really into it and willing to play it out.  However, flawed victory conditions (akin to the worst designed Martin Wallace games) can lead to abrupt endings (not quite table flipping events, but that might be more in the spirit of the game).  Lots of good comedic ideas, but very poor execution.  However, it's something that can be fun to try once, even if you're left feeling highly unsatisfied.

Evil Balaclava is a hoot. You want to wear it (for the terrorist cards), but you get too hot very quickly and kinda want to get it off.
Normally I don't like the kinda infantile graphics that the game has, but they fit the game and the theme perfectly.

After first play: (6 players) Set up a game of this with some trepidation, but it did not disappoint. Most players had studied the rules a bit, so were reasonably well prepared for play. Wonderful the game changes through play, and surprising the way a real geo-political feeling somehow emerges. Not a million miles in feel from Imperial 2030, although by way of very very different mechanics. Also hilarious. Might get tiring to play too often, but I'd be very happy to play this again. In spite of it being very tight (and me being the axis of evil for nearly an hour) I wore the balaclava fully. Hard core!

The game makes you wear a balaclava. That was the highlight of the game and pretty much the only good thing I can say. Gameplay wise there is no linear progression. After 2 hours of playing our cities and player-states were comparable to what we started the game with.

Then there is a retarded 'Armageddon' rule which blows up 80% of the board and resets the game back to it's starting state. You can never finish this game unless people willing give-up or do something stupid.

One of the worst game designs I've seen that year.

Bought the game for an event based around "war games."  Not wargames, mind you, but games like Risk or Chaos in the Old World where managing armies and area control are important.

Opened the box and promptly threw it out.  The components are abominable and the rules made it sound like the trash Monopoly players would come up with on a really bad high.  I had this suggested to me as a great idea for the event.  I've learned not to just accept suggestions at face value anymore.

Not bad. Essentially card-driven multiplayer light wargame with a contemporary & irreverent theme, perhaps at the complexity level of Risk. Grow your little empire (income from oil similar to Settlers), develop your villages, towns, cities. Create terrorist cells to threaten your opponents. Acquire & play cards to perform actions, like attack a neighbor, incite terrorists in a region, etc. First 6-player game took 4 hours, with one 'good' empire achieving victory conditions just after a couple of empires had turned terrorist. The nuclear attack card seemed a little powerful (duh..) but we could see how to nullify it (through hoarding, disarmament, bunkers). The balaclava is too itchy.

We hardly see any of the terrorist cards, as the Axis of Evil rarely gets to pick our color :-(

crazy satiric "Risk"-like game

The basic idea is interesting.


It doesn't really work with 2 players although in the rules. Usually the first player that is allowed to attack wins by pushing the other off of enough continents and then turning terrorist.
Not much better with 3 players.

Awesome! Hilarious satire in game form.

But the game itself is surprisingly good. There's actually quite a bit of strategy going on here. The empire cards vs the terrorist cards, the hidden information of not knowing the resource value or a territory until AFTER you've taken control of it, the choice of becoming a terrorist (which is a nice way to get around the issue of player elimination as well).

The game mechanics are not only fun and deeper than might be imagined based on the comical/silly artwork and character of the game, but actually provide an interesting political commentary about the modern world and the trend toward globalization. There's an implicit (and often explicit) critique on the neo-realist paradigm as applied to first-world and third-world relations and the asymmetrical conflict between the nation-state (empires) and non-state-actors (terrorists). A tall order for a game that seems on the surface to not take itself very seriously.

Summary in a sentence: a clever game that combines Risk or Axis & Allies (or Risk) with ideas from Settlers of Catan, Twilight Struggle (or Labyrinth: The War on Terror for that matter), and with the feel that if John Stewart and Stephen Colbert made a wargame it would be this.

Yes, I called it a wargame. Flame me! If the war on terror can be called a war, then I can call the War on Terror board game a wargame.

The goal of War on Terror, the boardgame is to liberate the world, ridding it of fear and terrorism forever. Naturally, only the biggest and strongest Empires are up to this task and so a certain amount of dominance needs to be proved. Alternatively, you can play as the terrorists, fighting for a world without empires.

Everyone starts the game as an Empire, with a couple of free villages and they can settle anywhere in the world. Although peaceful (we had to ban fighting in the first round) the 'politics' of the game already start to form, depending on what oil is discovered and how 'aggressive' the initial settlement choice is.
Empires then spread over the planet grabbing all available land, searching for the best oil and the most strategic borders. Some go for towns and cities, other spend their cash on extra empire cards, building up their political options. Maybe, if they're lucky, they'll get an early nuke.
Sooner or later someone takes a pop. Maybe the Axis of Evil has declared an Empire evil, giving them a few terrorist cards which are just too tempting not to play. Maybe someone is looking too strong already. Maybe you've got a grudge from a previous game or maybe you just want to win. Either way, war is declared or the terrorists strike!
Although it is possible to win the game with all the players still playing as Empires, the more likely outcome is that Empires are destroyed, bankrupted, or simply cave in and become terrorist players. As more empires fall they work together as a single terrorist player. With each new influx of terrorist cards and cash for the terrorist cause, the remaining Empires begin to wish that maybe they shouldn't have funded quite so much terrorism as they did.

À essayer. Jeux à la Risk, chaotique. Jeu à base de cartes (CDG) avant tout. 

Vision simpliste de la géopolitique mondiale. Éducatif à la limite du cynisme. Mais avec une bonne part de vérité. La diplomatie (les alliances) est de mise sinon c'est impossible de réussir en tant qu'empire. Si jamais ça tourne mal pour votre empire, vous passez au plan B et devenez terroriste contre les empires restants. Les gros poissons vont manger les petits et de gros empires vont émerger. Il y aura automatiquement plus de "frustrés" qui opteront pour le terrorisme (une façon de gagner "en groupe" contre les empires restants au fur et à mesure que d'autres joueurs tomberont et deviendront à leur tour terroriste).

Gamers looking for a heavy brain-burning affair should look elsewhere, but for those who are willing to stomach a bit of take-that screwage and a healthy dose of luck, this is a great game.  The theme is well supported by both the graphic design and the flavor text.  All kinds of nice touches are put in the game, like the Axis of Evil, the War cards, and lots of other stuff that evokes the absurdity of the situation.  The rules are far from airtight, but the best part of the game is the great satire that happens to be packaged in a box with a board and some pieces.

A fun, irreverent game in bad taste, with plenty of negotiaton, backstabbing, and the oh-so-elusive chance that Peace may break out.

This game requires people who like a back stabbing. We played with 6 people and it took just a few turns to understand the mechanics. From then on we just had fun and time few by. At first everyone was trying to kill everyone else. But as soon as 3 players had turned terrorist, the rest of us became allies, gave each other cards and money. The African Empire player won by building up his settlements and being very agressive against the terrorists.

Seething  nuclear chaos! Not a game to take seriously, but extremely fun when played with the right group of bloodthirsty backstabbers.

A one-trick pony - basically, you cannot win the war on terror - as far as this game is concerned anyway.  Even though it's a comedy game, there are too many really stupid events, such as terrorists setting up bases in Antarctica, for this to be enjoyable even on that level.  Having said that, it did produce some dicefest 'Jack Bauer moments' which were a joy to behold.

It's a bit unbalanced in favor of the terrorists, but I think that's part of the point.  I have seen an empire player win, but it was mostly because the other players weren't paying attention (and was early enough that the terrorists hadn't started filling the board yet).

I have only played the iPhone version, which I've read is quite different from the board game, so take my comments with the appropriate helping of salt.

War on Terror is a decent little game swaddled in fantastic satire.  The core mechanics borrow from classics like Settlers (roll to see which countries produce oil, pay to build outward and up) and Risk (dudes on a world map with an emphasis on controlling continents).

The coolest mechanic is, of course, the terrorists.  Rather than just attacking your neighbors, you can more cheaply (but less effectively) fund terrorists in their region.  The hitch is, you don't know which of your neighbors hired the terrorists that pop up in your territories (I think this part is unlike the board game).  While this isn't really fully taken advantage of in the iPhone version yet (no multiplayer), I think this mechanic has all kinds of potential.  For example, to sow discontent amongst friendly neighbors by hiring terrorists all along their border.

Also, the game made me feel guilty about dropping a nuke by reminding me that lots of people would die.  Good job, game.

Even with playing a few rules incorrectly, the game is fun.  Everyone is in it until the end.  I'd play this over Risk any day.  It kind of reminded me of a combination of Risk meets Settlers meets Redneck Life.  Note, chaos abounds in this game and backstabbing politics is the norm.  The only cooperation you'll see is when two or more players become terrorist.  Also, if you can't handle the theme, stay off the planet.

My favorite Boardgame. It matches my political views AND it's a heck of a lot of fun. A must have for anyone who hates the Right-Wing and/or anyone who liked Diplomacy.

I want to rate the game a 3 and a 9 at the same time if that makes any sense.  It is both repulsive and intriguing at the same time.

WEAR A BALACLAVA, TURN TERRORIST AND HOLD YOUR BEST FRIENDS HOSTAGE FOR OIL MONEY OVER THE TABLE....AND IF THEY LOOK AT YOU THE WRONG WAY - NUKE 'EM!

One of the best games I own!  It's satirical, 'wrong' funny, plays well, art is good, violent and it's simple to pick up.  Gives loads of opportunities for back-stabbing, secret alliances, screwing people over and ultimately taking over the world!

It takes some of the best mechanics of classic games and uses them in a rather slick way - great for new players.  It has a Diplomacy feel with passing notes, truces and bribes, it has resource deployment not unlike Settlers, the board feels like risk/A&A, the money feels like monopoly money and all the action is played using cards this simplifies your turn and choices.  The art is funny and satirical as mentioned above and the 'axis or evil' (random spinner thing) chooses an evil empire at random - adds a wonderful element of luck/injustice to the game.

One 'nice' thing about the game is if your empire gets smashed your not out of the game - you just 'turn terrorist' and start getting new cards and new opportunities - and you can still win!  No one feels left out and goes home early if they get battered early on. 

Best played with good friends who can play a game and not take it too personally, add some beers, pizza and snacks and you are in for a memorable night!  This game is a romp from beginning to end.

A game which includes a balaclava as an intrinsic item needed to play the game is a winner in my book!

Felt like a glorified Risk with Settlers of Catan-esque resource rolling and card driven actions added in.  Our game only took 3 rounds to complete but they were very long and had far too much down time.  The complete randomness with which someone can be eliminated without even taking a turn is kind of a turn off for me, even if they remain in the game as a terrorist.

I'm not going to comment too much on the theme but I would understand if people felt offended by it.  Overall there are some nice concepts in War on Terror but the execution is pretty sloppy.

Played a 2 and a 6 player game.  Once somebody went terrorist, the terrorists completely took over within one turn.  Some people felt the game was broken because of that.  Need to try it out more to see.

Definitely a funny game if played with the right crowd. We had a blast with the hilarious satire on the current state the world is in.
The game works really good even if you leave the theme behind. There's a lot of stuff going on everywhere and negotiations are essential. Lots of backstabbing and intrige - prepare for the War on Terror!
Our group really liked the game, we played it with non-gamers as well as more "experienced" gamers. The rules were easy to get even without some preperation. We will definitely play this again. (note of interest: we played it with americans from the military and no one was offended ;) )

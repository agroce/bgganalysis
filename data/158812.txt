Shadow Throne is a quick drafting game with a high degree of randomness.  A lot of the cards in the game have effects that target the cards played simultaneously by your opponents.  The problem with this is that it is extremely difficult to predict what your opponents will play each turn, making the outcome highly random.  This can be mitigated somewhat at higher player counts since there is an increased chance of your card having some effect on at least one opponent's card.

The game plays quickly with minimal down time and the rules are easy to pick up, so it makes a decent gateway game.  You could use it as an intro to drafting games before moving onto something meatier like 7 Wonders.

I definitely recommend playing with at least 4 and preferably 5.  The game is just much less interesting at 3 since the various card effects are less likely to do anything.  If you're really into card counting and can remember what cards you passed to your opponent and what cards came back to you, then you might enjoy the 3 player game more.  I just don't think the game is deep enough to expend that kind of effort on it.

The only fault I have with it is describing the game play. "Evil Poker" gives people the wrong impression, but I can't think of anything better. You're revealing cards to make a full hand, to see if that beats out everyone else's, and laying them down in an order that either convinces them that you have a strong hand or a weak one - depending on which you're trying to accomplish - and you're betting on your ability to read everyone else as you decide what to put down.

You have a lot more control over the cards you get and which cards you want to put down on the table, and the whole battle aspect is close to Magic than Poker, but....

Anyways, very fun.

I am fond of games that put players in the position of shadowy power brokers manipulating individuals or factions.  Shadow Throne is one of those.  In this game there are three factions that are nicely asymmetric. The King has the most powerful cards, the Church relies on converting members of other factions, while the rebels gain strength in numbers.  Card drafting gives you a hand of cards to play in battle and a feel for what else is out there.  Despite that, the battles play out quite chaotically, with potentially powerful card effects dependent on what others have simultaneously played.  With four or five players, it can seem that late in the battle the outcome is already decided and there is nothing to do but jump on the bandwagon or waste some cards.  Not a bad game, but it just doesn't stand out.

Production quality is reasonable.  My one gripe is with the cards that all have a faded patch that is either bad art or poor printing.  The artwork is decent enough.  The rules are well written and clear.

Interesting drafting game; as it hits a sweet spot between Sushi Go! and 7 Wonders.  The player interaction is higher as well, so it has appeal to those who like a bit more direct conflict in their games.

RATING: 7.9
Essentially it condenses all the drama and intrigue of a dark fantasy or feudal political thriller into a card drafting game, in which three factions are vying for power and the players put them out in waves which can give them influence or resources. Fun and pretty fast, and I like how the factions are slightly asymmetrical in how they can affect the others.

[thing=158812][/thing] is an excellent [b]card drafting[/b] and [b]hand management[/b] game that will certainly appeal to any Game of Thrones fans. Players draft their entire hand first, then the cards are played simultaneously (one at a time). This two step process introduces two different levels of decision, speculation, second guessing, and deduction with some luck mixed in. 

The game plays and feels quite different with player number (3p-5p) but are all equally enjoyable (for me). The higher the player count, the more swingy the battle may be!

This is a very enjoyable light filler length game.

Before I became a boardgame geek, I would consider this a pretty good game. Now that I'm spoiled with wonderful games, I consider this one merely okay. It's neither boring nor exciting. When you're constantly being introduced to new games, there really needs to be something special to get much in the way of positive commentary from me. I'll leave it at that.

Drafting game with players supporting three factions throughout the entire game hoping to score more influence that the other players, no real theme at all but the game art is great. Very dark comic book type look.

I played this a while back, and it was a fun game. It has the typical card drafting mechanic that you'd expect, but there's a CoOp/Competitive element to it that makes it even more interesting. I'm looking forward to getting my KS copy and playing it with friends!

I've seen this similar drafting style in majority so it wasn't new to me.

At first I thought you could play off people's cards and try and set things up. But most of the time it turns out pretty random who is going for what and what comes out ahead. Most of the time, once a faction gets ahead in a round, it will finish strong, everyone just band wagons on it

I think the play that seems to work well is to horde up money and 1 faction and go for a big power play.

Shadow Throne wants to be an intense game of memory and anticipation, demanding that players use the knowledge gained in the card draft as well as the state of each faction as the round plays out to figure out what cards their opponents will play.

Instead, there is so much to remember that it is difficult to keep track of all the possibilities. It's too chaotic to make most plays more than random guesses. Perhaps experienced players more familiar with the cards would find more depth in the gameplay, but I can get this style of play from other games without the high cost to entry.

Shadow Throne is a pretty cool drafting game with a very cool "puppet master" kinda theme and gorgeous artwork. (Generally) clear mechanics and clear iconography make it very enjoyable to play.
Luck is a rather big factor... More so than the drafting games I usually tend to like (ex. Fairy Tale, 7 Wonders, Among the Stars, etc).
The game can feel like it's been badly shuffled simply because the money generating cards recur a lot more often then the more iconic cards do. I only tested the 3p version and do think it would work better with 4-5.

Got to play this game at a convention, and it's very good. Lots of interesting decisions both in the drafting of the cards and deciding which to play and when. I particularly enjoyed the cards that have special powers on them and the interaction they created. Very fun game.

All of the excitement of drafting Magic: The Gathering, but with core mechanics that intelligently marry said drafting to the actual game play. 

Usually I wait until a couple plays to evaluate a game but I won my first game, so clearly the game is basically perfect.

Played this once with a local game group. It's a card drafting game whose theme is supporting factions trying to take a throne. There are three factions, and by playing cards of a faction you increase its power in a given round; at the end of the round, whichever faction wins grants victory points to people who played cards of that faction. Interesting and pretty fun, but I wasn't compelled enough to put it on my wishlist.

Nice, relatively quick drafting game with some reading your opponents mixed in. Played with 3; I suspect some of the card effects will get stronger with more players (because many affect cards played in the same "wave", which contains 1 card per player), but I also suspect that this will make reading your opponents more difficult. Either way, I would definitely play it again.

It plays a lot like Fairy Tale, though the designer has never played the latter. You draft a hand of cards representing characters from three factions, then play them out to compete for points.  The cards interact much more with other players than in Fairy Tale, there's a gold mechanic that limits your ability to play the best cards, and the game length is variable, continuing until someone has enough VPs.  Decent light-to-medium filler.

2015: n/a. Have played a couple of 3p solo games to get a handle on the mechanics.  Very intriguing game, I really like how you need to stay fluid, be ready to pivot away from your own plans for a round in order to ride the coat tails of another player's stronger play.

I would think it's a little tough at first for new players as they try and get a handle on the different Noble and Elite card abilities and how they interact, as well as keeping track of the balance between intrigue points and power.  Eager to try with some other humans!

2017: 6.5. Finally got this to the table tonight, and while I liked it, I think some of the card abilities kind of require dumb luck in order to use them to their fullest ability, without any clues about your opponent's cards and what order they'll play them, it definitely comes down to more luck than smarts.  Great art and really nice idea, but it felt a little too random for my comfort.  Plays better at higher play counts, some abilities are more likely to be effective.

While the game's concept was very interesting, it felt like it mostly came down to luck. I'm sure that, with experience, there's a lot of strategy involved in guessing what other players are going to play. Gaining that experience would take more time than I'm willing to devote to a mediocre game, though.

Good game. The trick is to focus on the final outcome of the war and not on the single battle. Alas, I am not much of shadow behind the throne and tend to win battles and loose the campaigns. However it is still a pleasure to play. Very good art, more than enough tokens and a small box , easy to pack and carry around.

 This was the chance to try out a game endorsed by Tom Vassel where players try to obtain influence within three factions vying for political power in the game world. There are three of these; Church, Empire and Rebels, all of which have leaders and followers who provide a mixture of influence, gold and special powers. The special powers allow some Empire cards to kill a specific type of card; commoners, nobles or elites, Church cards convert others to their cause and Rebels improve influence on winning factions that can be quite dramatic if sufficient cards are played for them. The mechanism in this game revolves around card drafting and playing cards in 'waves' (turns) until such time as one player accumulates fifteen influence points. Players can agree beforehand if they want to lessen or increase this target. I think the game allows a lot of subtlety once the players become more familiar with the options as they don't necessarily want a given faction to win but to nudge the faction(s) they anticipate will be most responsive. Playing successive cards from one faction incurs a non-cumulative penalty of one gold so there is risk in a strategy of following one faction more than another. Of course, the cards chosen are what they are, so making the best of them is key to victory.

RATING: N/A
Medieval intrigue card draft game. Players, as kingmakers, influence and subvert the opposing factions while hopefully backing the winner. I love how each hand is drafted prior to card play. Unlike 7 Wonders, for example, this allows players to draft a card strategy without the other players knowing exactly what you are doing--nice added tension. I also like the dual objective to back and thwart the empire, rebel, and church factions while trying to build majority position for the winning side.

Solid mechanics that are easy to learn with a refreshing amount of strategic depth with it's simplicity.

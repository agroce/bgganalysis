[i]3 games in 1[/i]

I especially like the [i]Hannibal versus Rome[/i] game, the predecessor of the brilliant [gameid=3201]. But the Circus Maximus is also not bad.

[i]Circus Maximus[/i] is a pretty good game. Play with the two cards per chariot variant rule for a more balanced play. Otherwise the strategy will be: race with one chariot to the finish as quick as you can. Then you are able to play 5 cards on the remaining two chariots. This is a sure win against beginning players

Imperium is too Euro-ish for me.

RATING: 6
3-in-1 game.  Circus Maximus is a chariot racing game that is not luck dependant.  It is light and a pleasant break from more serious titles.  Imperium is a multiplayer influence game that is slightly more sophisticated than Circus Maximus.  The 3rd game, Hannabal vs. Rome, is limited to 2 players.  It is okay, but not a contributor to the overall set.  It would be better if all 3 games were all multiplayer.  Individually, the games are not good enough to stand alone, but do work as a set.

Have played two of the three games in this package: Circus Maximus and Hannibal Versus Rome.  The former is a clever little chariot game, worth the price of entry alone and is a great party game.  Hannibal is a quick and dirty strategy "wargame" and can be over in minutes.  Imperium is waiting to be played.

Imperium : very chaotic, but also short. For this reason replayable. Score : 6
Circus Maximus : very nice racing game. Rules are so easy that's it is surprising that such a fine racegame comes of it. Asks for some more plays. Score : 8

Finally busted this one out.  Played the chariot racing with two.  It was surprisingly fun and there is room for tricky play in this one.  Looking forward to playing this one with more than two.  I would give it a 7.  Then played Hannibal and wasn't so enamoured with this one.  Too simplistic.  I would give it a 4.

RATING: 6.1
Not bad, but stereotyped after a few playings.

RATING: 6
Circus Maximus is an okay race and efficiency game.  It is a simplified chariot race in which you cannot whip other drivers or crash into opposing chariots.  During each round each player has movement cards numbered 1-5 to distribute between 3 pawns (chariots).  A pawn cannot use less than the full number of movement points on a card except when finishing the race.

I have not played the other two games included in the box.

Several playings, all with 5 players... not bad if everyone tries to play at a decent pace.

RATING: 5
Circus Maximus is by far the best of the 3, Hannibal versus Rome very poor - overall a 5 

Traded my copy, aquired another, traded it again. I think I'm done with this one now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Rating (5) based on one play of Hannibal versus Rome.  Has much the same feel as LOTR: Confrontation, but with no hidden special powers, so not nearly as interesting.  Will revise rating as I play the other mini-games.

Update: after playing Circus Maximus and Imperium, upping this to a 5.5 overall (6 for Circus Maximus, 5.5 for Imperium).  The games aren't horrible by any means, but there's nothing particularly compelling about any of them.  If I'm up for a light area majority game, I'll pull out Mykerinos instead of Imperium, and if I'm up for a no-luck racing game I'll pull out something else (can't think of what CM reminds me of, but something).

RATING: 7
"Imperium" = 7.   It's another pared-down Knizia success, between light and medium weight that traces basic El Grande elements, easy to teach, fast rounds, simultaneous play, little downtime, rewarding choices, tactics and strategy, dynamic, satisfying so far.  I've only played without the proconsul rule so far. (I wonder what it would be like to add an El Grande type Castillo to this one.) --"Circus Maximus" = 6.  Card choices, player blocking, tension, with necessary yet thrill-lacking bean-counting and recounting element of hex path efficiency that I don't care for in a race game. UPDATE: much better when using both of the two variants given in the rules (limit 2 cards/chariot, must discard to make 2nd turn) . --"Hannibal versus Rome" = 6.  Quick wargame with lots of choices.  Two play so far, both stalemates. Does it tend to stalemate? I want it to work... perhaps it needs a bit more to it. But it is quick so there isn't much pain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
As this is actually 3 distinct games, I'll comment and rate each separately.

Imperium: This is a very simple area control game where each player has their own deck of cards to manipulate the scoring a bit. It plays quickly and there is some room for cunning play, but its probaby too stripped down to be really satisfying. I'd rather play El Grande with some extra chrome.
Rating: 6

Hannibal vs Rome: This is a 2-player game with strong similarities to the skeleton of LOTR:tC. There are no special character abilities and the cards are only valued 1-5, no text cards. Each player has several winning conditions, and that is where the game draws its tension. Again, this is fun and plays quickly...but perhaps not enough there to really keep you engaged. At heart, its a simple bluffing game.  I'd rather play LOTR:tC in about the same time.
Rating: 7

Circus Maximus: This is the jewel of the lot, in my opinion.  A simple, quick, yet cagey chariot race. Players have cards 1-5 to spend as action points on their 3 chariots. It is a game of positioning and blocking. I haven't gotten to play with 5 players yet, but I suspect that is the best payoff...when there are 15 chariots jostling in the corners. The play time is so quick that there is no appreciable downtime while waiting to move.

(GMT edition) Three decent but unspectacular games add up to a nice value.  None are classics, but all are worth playing.  One of them could be the world's only honest-to-goodness wargame that is playable in under 20 minutes!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Imperium gets a six --- area control with shades of El Grande and Capitol. You have to decide whether to place influence in a minor region that is about to be scored or to let the other players duke it out there while you go after a major region that will not be scored for several turns. 

Rome v. Carthage is a five --- a rudimentary wargame for people who don't like wargames, but those folks might not like RvC either.

The two-player version of Circus Maximus is a tedious affair that rates a five. With more players, blocking tactics may make the game more interesting. The game reminds me of Ave Caesar.

RATING: 6
Just played the chariot racing part.  Really cool mechanics, and weaving your chariot through a pack is a rush.  But this is at heart a total information mathmatical exercise.  That kind of game stresses me out.  I don't mean I need dice rolling, I just need some element of mystery.

Imperium: simple majorities game with an escalating scoring system for future provinces.  Feels rather chaotic, but it plays very quickly and worth a play every now and again.

RATING: 6
Hannibal vs. Rome: A predecessor to Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation. Very simple and extremely short.  Imperium: Yet another majority-influence game.  Some interesting variations on the theme-- a hint of Taj Mahal-- but it doesn't really excite me.  Haven't tried Circus Maximus yet.

RATING: 7
My rating is for CM and H. VS R. , I have not played the other game yet.   I really enjoyed the racing, at times I felt like I was driving the darn chariot (especially when turning).  Great simple fun, my son loved it as well.  I am looking forward to trying the other game.  

Finally have played Imperium, it is a fast well thought out filler game.  Will gladly play this anytime.  The war game is the weakest , but still decent; all and all a good bang for your gaming buck.

RATING: 5
One play of the Circus Maximus chariot racing game that was better than expected, but not my cup of tea. It’s standard Kinizia “number optimizing” in how you play your 1-5 movement cards. Not without interest as a filler, but I’m just not a fan of racing games in general. I will say that of the racing games I've played, this one was the tightest and less prone to the runaway leader that I've seen in most of the race games I've played. Usually someone gets a lucky roll or card and runs away from the pack. This one at least forces you to consider all your chariots.

Imperium gets a 3.5. An extremely basic area majority game which is so dull that it doesn&#039;t even serve as an introduction to the genre.

Hannibal v. Rome gets a 6 based on one-and-a-half plays. Very simple and quick, but enough tactics and bluff to make it playable as an occasional filler.

Circus Maximus gets a 6.5 - decent quick filler that can accomodate up to 5 players.

Slight extra points for having three games in one box, even it one of them is useless.

The Chariot Race, it is allot of fun.  I did not understand the turn order rule, So I made this rule for turn order; At the beginning of each round the ranking by furthest along the track is determined and this is the turn order for the entire round. After a piece is moved for the first time in a round it is turned on its side. At the end of the round all pieces are turned upright.  Imperium has been more popular among the gamesters.  The worst thing you can do is to get into a battle with the same player.  The both of you will fall way behind the players not participating in your little slug fest.

Three plays of Hannibal vs. Rome, two plays of Circus Maximus, and one play of Imperium. A package of three mediocre games from early in Knizia's career (one war game, one racing game, one area majority game). All of the selections are, shall we say, "aggressively minimalist," and two rely on simultaneous action selection. It might have been okay if Rome had been an inexpensive package--it would have been very easy to skip the stickers and have the cards and pieces do double duty--but for the same price you could get one really good game instead of three weak ones.

So how do you rate a game compilation? I figure two sevens in one box adds up to 7.5, but don't ask me to explain it.
Imperium: a very clever, tight area-influence game. Very fast, which is always a plus, and actually forces you to win some contests outright as opposed to sneaking in a cheap second every time.
Circus Maximus: also clever, also tight, also reasonably fast. I didn't think I could like a racing game this much, but it's fun to block people and pull off cool maneuvers.

Rome vs Carthage: 7.5 An engaging and swift 2 player game that feels like an abstract on a map. Really keen to try this one more. It is so simple yet offers much to explore. (4/15)

Imperium: 9 The best in the set by far. A simply amazing streamlined area control game that is truly a hidden gem of Knizia. (2/16)

Circus Maximus: 6 A fun, light racing game with lots of tension. Knizia's trademark in offering a lot more than its simple components suggest. Maybe a little long. (8/15)

Played Circus Maximus, which is a racing game where the first player to get all 3 of their chariots into finish wins. You have cards numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and must assign at least one per chariot each round and must move the FULL movement in one direction or move none. A bit of an exercise in efficient movement, but still very simple to teach and quick (under an hour) to play.

Circus Maximus would be a 7, and either there is something we don't understand with Hannibal versus Rome or the game stalemates too easily, as there is no reason not to play your strongest card while in battle.  For this reason, I rate it a 3.  Imperium is meh.

8 - Circus Maximus is a wonderful 5 player racing game that plays like an abstract and has no luck. Opportunity for tactics and screwage abound!

7 - Imperium plays like an El Grande lite. Nothing that will blow you away but a great filler, particularly since it is an influence/area control style of game. Knizia manages some very strong game play in the simplest of rules and set up.

6 - Hannibal versus Rome is another very well balanced Knizia offering. A simple 11-space abstract with a powerful ancients theme, the combat system is purely bluff and card management. Given the 5-card hand size, the bluffing and management is very light and limited. But the absolute speed of the game (10 minutes, tops) makes it a worthwhile, if not overly engaging, endeavor.

At this point, rating is based on Circus Maximus only.  CM is an enjoyable game, kind of relaxing in a way.  The mechanisms and objective are so simple and your options so limited that it feels very much like a Knizia.  It seems like there would be more room for blocking and screwage, but as long as you are smart about conserving some cards to get out of bind, it usually isn't a problem.

[Played 3 times / once / once] 
Three simple and quick games: a wargame (with quite limited options), an area control game (based on simultaneous selection of actions; may be very chaotic with more players) and a racing game (with no luck involved, but your chances can really depend by the decisions of the opponents).

I enjoy all three of the games in this package.  The Imperium game is something I can get just about everyone to play and no one has a distinct advantage: gamer buddies, my wife, father-in-law, and my young son.  The game plays fast, ends just when it is clear who the point leaders are, and smart card play at the end game can determine the final rankings.

This rating is based only on the 10-minute Hannibal vs. Rome game, which I played a couple of times at Geekway 2006.  I think it's neat.  It's very simple, with a good strong theme that I enjoy, and it can really be played in ten minutes.  That's pretty cool.  This is a nice filler for a pair of latecomers to wait on the big group to finish whatever they're playing at your weekly gaming night.

A collection of three decent games in one box, none of which is spectacular on its own.  All short and light and decent enough as fillers, but a little dull in two, even the head-to-head game.  Would appeal to Knizia completists, though.

Circus Maximus is all I've played, which manages to capture some sense of a chaotic chariot race in an enclosed space.  Well recommended.

RATING: 7
Haven't played this "New" New Games in Old Rome yet but played those three games many times in original New Games in Old Rome. As far as reading the rules, original version seems better except the rule about proconsul bonus, which finally uses some geographical aspect of the board.
All the other changes don't seem to improve the quality of the game. (Hannibal vs Rome: One extra starting piece, ship recovery and ability to pass the turn just prolong the nice 10-minute original game. Imperium: Special cards just seem impure and 40-point game seems too long.) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One play of Circus Maximus only, so my rating isn't worth much ;-)  I thought the game mechanisms were clever and work well, but the end result is rather dry and calculating -- the Knizia hallmark, I guess.  Some kingmaker problems are apparent.  I liked Ave Caesar much better -- it's a lighter and more random game, of course, but the race has more excitement due to hidden information about players' movement points.  With CM, there's no hidden information, so the game involves plotting out every other player's possible moves based on their remaining cards, which doesn't make you [i]feel[/i] like you're running a chariot race!  CM does have cool blocking plays, though -- a trait it shares with Ave Caesar.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While I don't rate all three games of Rome a 7; just the fact that it comes with three separate games moves it up a rating. Individually, I would probably rate Imperium an 8, Circus Maximus a 6, and Hannibal vs. Rome an 7.

Played a 4-person game of this tonight and quite enjoyed it.  It moves very quickly, but there is enough going on to make it feel somewhat meaty.  To categorize it, I would say that it shares some aspects with games like Condottiere and Attila.

RATING: 7
All three games have their own merits, including relative simplicity and quick game play. Different people seem to like different ones among the three, so that appears to be a matter of personal preference for theme, game play, etc. Me? Uh...not sure yet--having trouble interesting others in playing, which leaves the jury out and my longterm rating in flux. As of December 2010, have played head-to-head with "Rome Vs. Carthage," which is very clever Knizia--not a war game per se, but more of a Euro: easy rules to learn, mathematical precision in how the game plays out and being able to think several moves ahead, and requiring much thought as one plays. I'm not one to put down games for what the aren't, so I really do like "Rome Vs. Carthage," which to me is a neat little, quick-playing but challenging warm-up game. Purchased used, April 2009.

The Rome vs Carthage 15 min 2 player game surprised in a good way by how something so simple can provide really nice, hard choices inside a theme that makes sense. 

The chariot game plays well, as does the token placement affair. All of them are decent, but none of them are interesting enough in their own right to get the box pulled out regularly.

RATING: 7
Hannibal is a quick game employing the card choice mechanism as in LOTR-Confrontation.  Imperium has an ordered scoring of provinces like Taj Mahal, with some points going to all but the lowest player.  Connected won provinces give a bonus, again like Taj Mahal.  Circus Maximus is a solid race game in which congestion adds to the fun.  Probably best with 3-4.  Given to MJ family.

Played the "Circus Maximus" race game.  There was no random factor except for initial setup, so you knew what everyone could do.  There were some good decisions to be made with blocking and deciding what chariot goes what speed.  That said, I'm not really a big fan of race games, so there you go.

6/7/06: Picked up at the Unknown in Scranton for $20 on closeout. First impression, had to use a knife to trim the stickers as they are about 10% too big for the wooden blocks that you are supposed to attach them to. Attractive board, lots of nice wood bits. Manual is black and white and short. 6/10: Played chariot game with son, enjoyed. Look forward to trying with adults, perhaps as an end-of-the-evening game to settle the days events, with starting positions based on wins from previous games.

RATING: 6
Circus Maximus: subjectively the dullest game of the 3 as there is no secret information, so no tense uncertainty. With all your 5 cards face up allows short term strategy, so the competitive attitude can slip into analysis paralysis. Nice angst when you realise you have to waste a card due to being blocked. So far, towards race end it has become obvious who will win, removing any climax. Maybe best with 2 players managing 2 teams each to make blocking effective. (Rating:6/10)

Imperium: Best with 3 to make the discerning of opponents scoring values easier. El Grande-lite in scoring and with play being like the dialup mechanic(my only favourite part of El Grande),players instead using provincial cards to place influence markers, scoring where the roaming big dobber has rested. A little repetitive using the same province cards but assessing opponents next placements is interesting, as is deciding when to play the one use special effect cards. Extra half point for an educational map. (7.5/10) 

Hannibal vs Rome: so far the highlight of this modern compendium. When a conflict occurs you have to evaluate how valuable the area is to you both then play strength cards and reveal simultaneously, which is deliciously tense. Has the interesting aspect of sacrificing if you have a comparatively weak hand so that you can then claim back all the cards once 5 conflicts occur. Nice narrative in such a short game. However, one of the winning conditions takes alittle absorbing. (8/10)

Rating for Imperium only. A quick, fun, area control game with some nice ideas. The play involves some pure guess work, but not so much to render tactical plays and planning futile. Because of the inherent randomizing element created by players themselves (8 areas to put influence markers in plus the special cards,) the replayability should be fairly good. Although, repeated plays will probably reveal some general winning strategies.

O.K. little fillers.  They play quickly.Imperium has elements of the typical area/influence game (El Grande, etc.)  It is easily taught to people new to this style of gaming. This is the best of the three games in the package.  The chariot race - eh? Better done with video games.  H vrs R is a very, very short 2 player game that simply doesn't have enough going for it - it feels more puzzle than game. There are many ideas here that just don't carry the package.*** With so many other games available, other than for Knizia fanatics there is nothing here that is worth playing.

All 3 are good filler games - all three play very quickly.
Nice looking map and game board.

Circus Maximus - Personal favorite - use your limited actions to jockey for position. Allocate the 1-5 cards across the chariots to minimize wasted movement. It is all about getting there first. However, keep an eye on how you can use your chariots to get in the way of the others.
Watch out if the Blues & Greens get together (read up on the Nike riots in Constantinople).

Imperium - A light area control game - again since symmetric, trade off of current benefits to position yourself for the future.

Hannibal - least favorite - use the 1-5 cards to engage in battles game of bluff and misdirection.

One play of "Hannibal versus Rome." Interesting generic light bluffing game. Plays quickly. The only bit of real "chrome" is the ever so slightly asymmetrical troop strengths (Carthage has the Hannibal counter in place of one of the soldier counters), otherwise with different map graphics it could be any battle, anywhere.

Circus Maximus [1 play] Garrett and Drew (~age 7) taught me the Circus Maximus chariot racing game 6-22-07 and I liked it very much. It isn't a total brainburner, but there are tactical challenges here that can be quite enjoyable. It plays quickly, has nice components, and could offer some really lively action with competitive, engaged players. Rating 7.5

Imperium [1 play] Most recent play 4-25-09 at Net Lake with Garrett, Michael, and Corey. This is a really fun Knizia-style majority control game. Feels like a combination of Web of Power, El Grande, Battle Line, and Condottiere. I really enjoyed this for it's quick play, bluffing, short/long term planning, and hand management system. Rating 8.5

Overall rating for the two above is a solid 8, maybe a 9.

[b]Circus Maximus[/b]
There are 3 games in the box and apparently this is the best one. It's an interesting, quick, straightforward racing game. You have to optimize your card play while trying to block other players movements, forcing them to waste their cards. Nice filler!

[b]Summary[/b]
The board is covered in hexes, in a circular (elliptical) track with the finish spaces in a long row in the center. Players place 3 chariots in the starting area (3 rounds: 1 in turn order, 2 in reverse). Each player has 5 cards numbered 1-5 face up in front of them.

Each round, all chariots will move; frontmost moves first (inside before outside). To move, use 1-3 of your cards (flip them face down); each card's movement must be used in full (except when entering the finish spaces), in a straight line in any direction. You MUST save at least 1 card/chariot. Max 1 chariot/hex.

After all chariots have moved, unflip all your cards and repeat above. The game ends immediately when a player gets all 3 chariots into the finish spaces = Winner!

Shouldn't the games really be rated individually?  My votes:

Circus Maximus: 6
Hannibal: 7
Imperator: 7

Hannibal's another one of those games where a small number of rules are used to a disproportionately good effect.  Scoff if you want to about simulation value, but my kids now know more than most adults about the 2nd Punic War.

Circus Maximus is decent, but I don't feel it has a lot of replay value.  I suspect there's a single best strategy, namely finishing one piece as quickly as possible so you can use your cards more efficiently on the two remaining pieces.

Imperator is pretty straightforward fun.  A good family game.

It's better than I thought it might be. But I've played many a stat baseball game and this isn't the best. But it's a nice overall package and I'm glad somebody is still trying to make this type of game. I have the classic 2002 ed.

One of the best baseball sims out there.  Solid game design with good batter-pitcher interaction.  I own the classic version where some results are based on single die rolls.  Even with that, the results are diverse and entertaining.

More than any commercially-produced game I have ever played, Replay captures the "feel" of baseball.  It has supplanted all other games in my gaming closet.

Been playing this game since the late 1970's and always thought that this is what the APBA Master Game should have been (fixing the problem of pitchers hits and home runs given up).  Nice idea of combining hitters and pitchers ratings to come up with a play result.  Have found the more classic version of this game to my liking as it produces accurate stats while maintaining very high marks for playability.  Some of the more recent rules have complicated an otherwise easy to play game and the playability suffered a bit.  Still, the game offers the player a variety of options to choose from so, part of the learning curve, will be for the gamer to find what options they most enjoy.  Excellent quality parts and the customer service is excellent.  Highly recommended

I like Replay Baseball a lot.  For a long time it was my game of choice.  I know like it just a shade below APBA because of game play time and it just has a lot more rules.  Still, I could see why a lot of people would choose this game first.

I'm not a huge fan of stat-based sports sims, due to the low number of meaningful player decisions and the existence of quality video games. But with a kid who's really getting into sports and needs to be pulled away from the PlayStation, this seemed like a decent bet. All things considered, we are having fun with it. So far, so good!

Have the "Diamond Decades: '80s" team set.

RATING: 9
I am one of the rare birds who enjoy the older version vs. the newer versions created. Not to say the newer ones aren't fun. I do play them as well, but most of my play is with the 1*6 pitchers - the classic version. 

I enjoy the simplicity of the game and it's flow. It's reasonably quick to play a game, yet you do have decisions to make frequently. There are charts, but you memorize those quickly. It's statistically accurate. I've done a 1940 AL and a 1946 AL replay with the game with positive results. 

My favorite table-top baseball game.

A very clever system that models the pitcher-batter confrontation well. Following the charts creates a great baseball "play-by-play".

Hands down the best baseball sim game ever, and I tried them all.  Can't wait to see what Replay puts out next. Customer sevice is the best I have ever delt with! They are friendly, and they ship their product out to you fast!

RATING: 9
The game which finally caused me to retire Great Teams Statis-Pro Baseball.  Ease of play, pitcher / batter combined ratings (red, white and blue dice), laminated three part fold out results chart, rare play book, solitaire capable, and classic seasons and teams availability make this game great value for money.  I own the Diamond Decades: 1970's and 1980's sets, and the 1980 set almost makes the 1970 set obsolete; which is an example of the leap in quality between set production.  You sometimes have to wait a long time between new Replay games, sets and seasons but it is almost always worth the wait.

First foray into tabletop baseball! Nice components in comparison to the other sims out there. Still grasping at some of the rules, and there are some details that I'll have to track down. Having said that, I can tell that this is a game that goes deep, and the gameplay matched the pacing and feel of the game very well. Also, as has been written elsewhere, the customer service from Replay is top notch!

Also own 2014 postseason teams.

RATING: 8
This was my main baseball simulation for over 5 years. It is great for solitaire league projects and replays, especially in terms base stealing, defense, and player rest.  Several exception codes were tacked-on to fine-tune pitching, but ultimately I got tired of the batter-centric model at the heart of the design.  Most strikeouts were of little consequence for pitchers, which never felt right to me.

I have the 1989 season.

Yes, the game sort of feels like real baseball, but I am not convinced (at all) that this game is as good as Pursue the Pennant or Strat-O-Matic.  While the game does a decent job at accounting for each of the various interaction types, i.e. power, strikeout tendency, batting average, fielding, etc., there is simply not enough variability when you examine how each batter interacts with each pitcher over multiple at-bats.  And having a single superscript number in the #2 column REALLY, REALLY bugs me.  I do like the automated steal system.

DISCLAIMER: I have only played the two-dice system.

RATING: 8.5
Very good baseball sim and good value for the buck. It has an excellent balance of playability and simulation. Nice details included like pitcher fatigue over the course of a game. Minimal charts, especially compared with APBA Baseball. Rules could be better written. I think I like this best of the three baseball sims I have (Replay, APBA, and PC Strat-o-Matic). The influence of the pitcher is the best realized (barely there in ABPA and somewhat arbitrary in SOM), there aren't as many charts to look up, and enough chrome to make it interesting. Graphically, it's not wonderful, but the laminated chart book is nice--if a bit chaotically organized.

RATING: 8.5
The current version of "Replay Baseball" is a significant improvement over the older, two-dice version of the game. Although the variety of results may not be as varied as claimed--at times the same play may come up unrealistically often as in the case of line-out doubleplays, for example--and I've noted some unrealistic results between certain pitchers and batters with very low homerun totals, the game feels like baseball, the mechanics are pretty smooth, and it provides ample complexity, including rare plays. 

Though I appreciate the extra chart/rolling for ball park effects, I also find that feature hurts playability, and that's the one rules set with this game that is genuinely fiddly--that is, difficult to keep in mind, even with many plays. But it's optional, so not using it speeds up play. 

Also, the base advancement rules are pretty generic, based on generalized speed and arm ratings. But I'm finding the game to be very accurate statistically, including even fielding stats. After playing the game about a hundred times, I got the time needed to play down to about 25-40 minutes per 9-inning game, depending on how much offense there is, plus substitutions, and so on.

As for my experience with this game, I completed in the summer of 2016 a replay of the 1923 Kansas City Monarchs season (the research for the 1923 Negro National League card set and the company's production of the card set is a dual achievement) and then returned to a replay of the 1908 Cubs' season. I also own the Deadball Era Great Teams set and have dabbled a bit with that, too.  

Overall, I like this game very much, and, as other Geeksters have noted, customer service is top-notch from this company. 

{Addendum: I also own the 1991 edition--1990 cards--which is a different game, employing 2 dice instead of 3.}

I like it somewhat, but dislike the "refer to another chart" sports sims (SherCo II, APBA, Strat).  I prefer to know the final result upon seeing one result after one or two dice rolls, right on the player's chart.

After having tried virtually every baseball simulation game out there, I settled on Replay Baseball as the most satisfying  combination of playability and realism.  Everything about this game just 'feels' like baseball. There's also a very supportive discussion group for Relay Sports games.

As with most sports games, the rules are sketchy (you are supposed to already know what to do). Once you figure it out, the gameplay is good. Pitching, hitting, defense, running are all factored in to an easy to use system.

The best baseball game i've ever played. Best system that considers pitcher and batter.

RATING: 9
This may be the most statistically sound
tabletop game available.  My statement is based on a limited, but rigorous 
examination of some of the hitters' cards.  The results also seem realistic
mafter playing about 40 games.  Another
good point is that the teams have large
rosters (often about 30 players each).
Ratings for fielding range and running are not quite as precise as some sims.

Finally took the plunge on this after finally deciding to move on from Strat-O-Matic. The component quality of Replay is much better than SOM. Need to play a few more games before rating this one.
17 games into replaying the 1908 Tigers' season now, and feel Replay is a notch more difficult than SOM in terms of ease of play. Do like Replay's interaction between pitcher and batter than SOM's.

Excellent completeness of every player on evey team. Thoroughly thought-out. However, it is difficult to gauge a players' stats by looking at his card since it just looks like a bunch of random numbers on a chart. I have the 1989 season game.

If you like baseball, the modern incarnation of this game is a "must-have."  It just feels like baseball.  The stats marvelously mirror the real life MLB stats.  It plays easily and quickly, but it has levels of sophistication that portray the real life game seamlessly and without undue complication.  It just flows.  The components are of excellent quality, and its publisher is a class act all the way.

The perfect blend of statistical accuracy, play-ability, reliable and factual research, and customer service.  
These four categories, and Replay Baseball's excellence in blending all four into a compelling package, is unequaled.  

The game components set the standard for quality in the tabletop game industry.  They are consistently of a gold standard quality.  

The customer service from this small company is so good that it should be a course of study for good business practice.  The owner, Pete Ventura, interacts with his customers as if they were family.  He is not aloof, nor distant, like many other sports game franchises.  His honesty, and integrity as to game quality, and customer satisfaction, compel one to support his efforts to produce the best baseball (and basketball) games on the market.  This, in itself, is a boon for the customers, as other tabletop baseball games have fallen victim to negligent owners, leaving customer support, and at times game design, in unqualified hands.

The game itself, flows so easily, but has such depth of feel, and such richness as to detail, that many nuances go unnoticed at first, as they are subtle.  But, after a number of games rolled, one then can truly appreciate what a marvelous design this game was, and how magnificent it has become since Mr. Ventura revived it in 1998.

The interaction between batter, pitcher, and fielders is present for most results, driven by a confident and accurate game engine.  The design of the game, and the incorporation of new features over the years is brilliantly offered by means of keeping the original game engine intact, while adding optional features which may, or may not, be incorporated into game play.  Even when using all the bells and whistles the game now offers, the play is smooth, seamless, and does not feel forced, or contrived, like some other tabletop baseball game offerings.  

Obviously, then, this game has my highest recommendation.

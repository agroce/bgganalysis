Played this a lot before I knew there was a board gaming community. A friend had a copy and we played at our regular gaming sessions.  We played the old rules so, whoever got the most catapults would win, an hour later ...

Gets an 8 for components. But a miserable failing grade for the catapult rules. What's worse, the conception or how it goes unnoticed through playtesting?
Maybe it wasn't playtested at all. Even the most obtuse gamer should see it.
Thankfully, there are alternate rules I believe.

RATING: 8
While Axis and Allies got the lion's share of plays back in the day, this one was a close runner-up with our group.  The mechanics are familiar and easy to learn, while there is a pretty good amount of strategic diversity that can result in plenty of plays.  And the theme/historical accuracy isn't bad for a relatively mainstream 80's Milton Bradley board game. Overall it's a lot of fun.

Beautiful map and pieces.  I only played it as a kid, and I don't remember how much I liked this game then.

RATING: 7
I had high hopes for this game given it's stunning map and minature pieces.  The gameplay was good but not quite good enough to ever come close to level of strategy in Axis & Allies.  I'm looking forward to playing the 2005 edition someday though.

Milton Bradley Gamemaster Series (1984)
2nd Century A.D.:The Roman Empire Under Siege
This game will NOT play with either 3 or 5 players. The game has poor mechanics with 6 players also as the 5th and 6th players have unequal opportunities to expand in the first turn.  A very likeable game with 2 or 4 players.

One of the weaker of the GameMaster Series (best was Fortress America).  Catapults ridiculously overpowered and limited to 20 shared between all players, so often strategy came down to picking fights just to generate casualties that you could rebuy on your own turn.  
Components were of a brittle plastic that ended to snap off.  
Rerelease edition by Eagle Games is much better
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Might be ok with some rules changes, but the catapults and inflation break the game.  Insanely expensive.

Great (but fragile) little pieces jazz up a somewhat bland and simple war game from the MB Gamemasters series. The inflation element does add an interesting twist. Doesn't get played often, but impresses those in the know when you pull it out.

Nice components, great era for this kind of game, but the rules are a bit flat.  If you add Axis and Allies style combat resolution, it becomes much more fun.  6 player is a blast, and just when you think you have another player on the run, someone else can stab you in the back.  In a recent game, we saw three players go out on the same turn.

Fond memories of this, the first MB game I owned.  Loved the map at the time.  Pieces are almost all torn up due to use and their tendency to break easily.  Not terribly impressed by Eagle's remake.

  This game is #1 in the Game Master Series. I have all 5 of the Games in the Milton Bradly Game Master Series. Conquest for the Empire takes you back to the days of ROME. What a great game. I could not describe it's play to you for it would take to much time. You need to own it and play it to find out, I wouldn't ruin the surprise. I suggest getting 4 other buddies all of which are cutthroat and don't cry when they are attacked, Trust me it makes for a more interesting game. Also check out Milton Bradly Shogun, Another great game in the game master series.

Milton Bradley.  Decent multi-player game right up to the mid point of the game.  Players then tend to create monster forces and the player with the most catapults is going to crush.  This was an obvious problem and was remedied in the remake of the game by Hasbro.  Still fun to play however - even if somewhat broke.

Relatively fun empire-building game which suffers from some balance issues in the 4 person game as well as some over-simplicity.  Would be a lot more fun if it didn&#039;t take forever to play. Great components, however.  If you do play, make sure to incorporate some of the house rules on random events.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fun multi-player strategic game, with nifty Roman-era theme. Rewards combined arms forces. Economic system is interesting, but does require some book keeping. Components are great. The finite number of units available probably fairly reflects limited availability of manpower in this age. In all, a solid game that continues to get played. 

UPDATE: The new COTE from Eagle is a significant upgrade to the original in every way! Can't really picture ever going back to this one.

Update (1/28/2010): Traded away.

Was good in its day (the mid-80âs), esp. when we changed the catapult rules to allow a maximum of +1 bonus in combat.  Shorter than many other multiplayer wargames (incuding the other MB Gamemaster wargames), which is a bonus.  The combat rules are too simplistic and tedious, and need revamping (you need to be able to kill more than one unit per combat round).  The map is imbalanced as well, allowing Galatia, Spain, and (sometimes) Macedonia to be the powerhouses in every game.

After years of sitting on this game I finally find a group willing to engage in this historically significant game about an historically significant period! CotE is designed by Mr. "Axis & Allies" himself, though this one has very little of the rules-load as A&A has.  Instead, this is a rather straightforward "purchase units and go conquer" sort of game, in Risk style but definitely with more development and layers.  As killing one player's Caesar is so significant and gives a great lead, the game moves quickly and is over within a couple of hours (4 players) which is perfect for this type of game.  Also, the catapult rules as they are written didn't show their true ugly side this time. Players did buy an assortment of different units and only by the end were catapults becoming a decisive factor. It'd be interesting to see how the game plays if one player only invests in catapults and then storms around. All that said though, this is a very straightforward game - a little too straightforward for my interest.  Combat is a trudging pain, with combat happening one die roll after one die roll for a couple of minutes at points. It just feels slllloooww.  But there are tense moments as you target another player's catapults.  Also, I'll say, turns go by fairly quickly, which is a nice part of this game.  Components are beautiful, for sure! But for a game this big and with a lot of stuff, it should have been deeper. I feel like it was designed more as a game for younger boys to get them into the next step of wargaming in that era (next stop: Axis & Allies?)  In that, in succeeds. But the game feels dated these days and not engaging enough to elicit feelings of wanting to return soon.

One of my favorites, and unlike many who think it's broken, think that it actually works wonderfully.  In some ways it's a civ/expansion type game at the beginning, with warfare as the basic concentration in the second three quarters.  The limited number of troops and generals balances it out wonderfully between players, and due to the limited numbers makes it so you have be more strategic in how you wage war.

My game group played this a lot when I was much younger.  Then two things happened, the game owner moved and I could not find it in stock.  I made my own set...

OK, serious geekness here.  The original rules had 3 people, 4 people start with someone in greece.  We played that the greece player starts in Egypt, becuase otherwise they got eliminated early.  Also, we did not let the winner take all vanquised pieces when a player was eliminated.  We did this because the person who won from the first eliminated player could otherwise quickly sweep to a win.  

I rated the game low becuase, it has some serious problems that need fixing (like being all about catapults) and is too long for what it is.  However, at the time it was a significanat improvement over Risk.

RATING: 5
Derisively known as "Catapults of the Empire" because the combat system fails to reward combined arms, and thus players just build the strongest units.  A number of published and house variants exist to fix this problem, but even so, the result is a fairly pointless multi-player free for all.  The game needs historical scenarios, or powers that have different characteristics, or barbarian incursions, or something.

Probably the most simplistic of the Gamemaster Series games.  Only three types of troops (unless you count generals and fortified cities). Some fun but it seemed to be just a big buildup to a huge battle.  Buckets of dice rolling.

Gain money... buy more catapults than your neighbour, expand, buy more catapults, win.  Fun, huh?

This game usually ends up with the two players who have the most catapults, and whoever rolls the best dice  wins!

This was the first "War Game" outside of Risk for me. At the time Risk had plastic symbols. This had real gaming goodness {toys}. Sculpted cavalry, infantry, galleys and catapults, how cool. Once I played it, it was hard to go back to Risk. For the day this was an excellent, quick and simple war game. WOW! I could actually capture generals and hold them for ransom. What would they think of next?

RATING: N/A
This was my favorite of the Game Master series back in the '80s. I remember it as much shorter than the others. I liked the "Romans" theme best of the series. And I remeber the components fondly, especially the plastic coins.

I'd love to play this again, even though I don't expect it to compare well to today's games.

RATING: 7
Great game with a fantastic board and bits.  One of the first "Designer" games.  Catapults rules need mending, but as we know, most every big box game needs a FAQ (or three) these days (it truly was ahead of its time!)

RATING: 4
Used to love it, now see problems.  A few starting positions are vastly inferior to others.  Strategy is one-dimensional (build catapults!), so after 5 to 10 games of this, there's not much left to explore.  I'd rather play "Samurai Swords"

That gorgeous board!  The minis!  The colors!  This is a deluxe experience in the MB Gamemaster tradition.  I admit, I haven't played a lot of serious multiplayer with this one (mostly 2er) which I imagine would make it shine.  But I was thrilled to own it as a kid, and am just as happy to have it in the collection now, even if the gameplay (i.e., it's all about catapults) is a little creaky.  Checking into remedy variants.

Listed for trade, but not looking to unload it.  Would consider for right offer, though.

I prefer A&A or War of the Ring for this style of Ameritrash war-game, and then I prefer a smaller number of players (2 to 3). With 5 or 6 players there is too much downtime and there is a tendency to get stuck in the middle and pummeled from two sides. I admit I am not very good at these types of games so my enjoyment level is fairly low. Not my cup of tea overall.

Really fun R.I.S.K.-like game!!  I will agree that the catapults are too strong with the original rules... but, one can always adapt some house rules!!  I have played this game many times and would say that a 4 or 6 player game is best.  If you play with 5... the players on the North side of the board have to spill blood for their hard earned talents while the players on the South side can just expand easily the first couple of rounds!!  I also think there should be some rule changes in regards to the cities and their fortifications and how much they cost.  Also rules regarding road travel should be changed to give an advantage to someone having just two cities right next to another with one road in between!!  According to rules... roads don't actually help until you have three cities in a row... that's no good!!

NOTE: the following applies to the MB version as I have yet to play Eagle Games revision.  CotE is a Risk derivative set in a semi-historical period (Roman Empire).  The game has some good mechanics and at first appears to be an improvement over Risk however, the inflation step is too potent and any player not prepared to accept double prices is basically wiped out.  A second problem lies in the strength of the catapults; they are too damn strong making anything in their way fall like blades of grass.  This may have been historically accurate but it makes for terrible game play.  Nice attempt by MB to enter the light wargame market with excellent components but a third rate game.

This is the best of the Gamemaster games. Fun, strategic and the increasing cost of war pieces, due to inflation, is a delightful novelty.

Had a lot of fun with this in the 80's, but it's too long to tackle nowadays.  Also, with little time to play, I have little tolerance for elimination games.  I seem to remember a big problem with this one if you got stuck playing Italy (the problem being that you CAN'T WIN).

This is in reference to the original Milton Bradley version (I've never seen the new release): Cool pieces, great theme, but *very* flawed combat rules. House rules are a necessity to make game even remotely playable by serious gamers. Rules are in need of a complete rewrite to make this game worth playing regularly.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good with 4 or 5 players, although it is quite a long game. Feels a bit dated now, winning being based on player elimination rather than control of territory or elimination of a certain number of troops like more modern war games. The catapults are definitely overpowered, and because of their limited supply, a major part of the game is focused on killing off your opponents' catapults so that you can immediately buy them up. Money is also limited, so a player can choose to horde money (usually when you kill off one player and get a $100 bonus) and prevent players from buying new troops, which should help shorten the game.

Great game once the combat system is modified.  The original combat system is a ridiculous gambit of which player can amass more catapults more quickly and plow through the entire fractured empire unopposed.....stupid.  A more Shogun-like combat system makes the game really enjoyable, and is a truly unique, enjoyable, innovative game experience.  The Italia player must always go FIRST, never LAST (or they never have a chance in heck).

[3 plays] [2p=?, 3p=7, 4+p=8] Great game with a big group in the mood for this type of combat and conquer game. Easy to understand but just complicated enough to allow for some clever and occasionally surprising moves. 3 player game can tend to make the inevitable truces and alliances totally necessary, but a bit uncomfortable. 

Players need to care, but not so deeply feelings can get damaged.

More guesswork here on the number of times played.  50 is probably a good guess.  One of the first "real" boardgames I ever got, back when it first came out - I was 9 years old.  It led to Axis & Allies, which led to Fortress America, which led to wargaming and miniatures gaming.  It was Pandora's box.

Played our first game last night.  Struggled a bit with the rules, but the game started rolling a little better as we went along.   For the two player game, you start a little too far apart.  It might be better to start next to each other and get the conflict going earlier.  We were probably 10 rounds in before we had our first conflict.    With 6 players this game would be a mad house.  The rules for catapults are broken, but there is a pretty good fix for it on BGG.

As far as I know, I never got to play this game. We had it, along with Shogun (later called Samurai Swords), and Axis & Allies. It looked cool, but it was one of those huge games that we could never seem to find time for. I think it's in the basement of my brother's house right now. I should ask him about it.

This was the weakest of the Gamemaster series that I played.  It had a lot of good things about it, but a broken combat system.  You had to have more catapults than the other guy, so there was often a cold war catapult race.  Not at all thematic.  This problem was fixed in the reboot.

The weakest of the MB Gamesmaster series IMHO. Fantastic components as usual, but catapults completely break the game. Strange, considering how well developed the more well known games in the series are.

Seems like a cool knife fight in a steel cage at first. 
In the beginning manouvering is key since you MUST win and/or be out of reach of an counter attack. If you fail to make your investments count, others will mop you up in a blink of an eye. Therefor play is rather static at first.

It seems to pick up the pace when two or three players are eliminated but I don't think I'll ever give this a second go while Samurai Swords is around.

RATING: 6

It's a very fun game! I enjoy this about the same as I do with regular Risk. (the revised rules of Risk are probably equal with this game)

I really like the inflation mechanic, it really makes you have to re-think everything you are planning because you can't afford to waste any troops. (or money!) It's a very slow, progressive game, but not in bad way! It's not as if you feel the game is dragging on, but you are always anticipating your next turn.

It's worth playing! I loved it! I think the end of the game, when it's only a few players left, it becomes a "rush for the catapults" but you can still win with strategy (and some luck!). The game is much more simpler than Axis & Allies and just about anyone can play this game and enjoy it!

We like this game, but it comes down to who has the most catapults I'm glad Eagle games is going to rework this. I have high hopes for the reprint. The pieces are great, if just a little brittle.

Conquest of the Empire is part of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series. It is set during the Roman Empire and depicts the struggle around the Mediterranean as rival factions attempt to take control of the empire. Each player plays one of these factions and receives a Caesar figure, several general figures, and ships of a specific color. Along with these leaders, players utilize a pool of generic units composed of infantry, cavalry, and catapults. All game pieces are plastic figures.

Players attempt to conquer their neighbors and build up cities and fortifications to increase production of wealth. Players also may build road networks that allow for faster movement, by all armies. Along the way players have to contend with rising inflation which makes military units more and more expensive. Eventually through elimination one player pulls ahead for the win.

For me, this was the game that started it all. I know '9' is a high rank, but the nostalgic aspect of being one of the first owners of this game and the delight in 'hobby' gaming for both myself and friends that it spawned is beyond measure.

Better than Risk, because it adds an economic element and inflation. But still, essentially a long player-elimination slug-fest.

If I want the economics, unit-purchase, and combat, but in a more tightly focused package, I prefer to play Nexus Ops.

I'm a sucker for any game with an ancient empire theme, and this is the best one on the market (or used to be). Lots of fun for anyone who likes Roman movies and such. My only gripe is the awesome power of catapults. A legion full of them could destroy anything! I finally made the house rule that no one could have more than 5 at any one time.

RATING: 6
The inflation system and overall ambience was very nice, but the catapult rules were broken, and every game wound up feeling the same. Even moreso, oddly, than A&A. The weakest (structurally) of the Gamemaster series, though I haven't played Broadsides & Boarding Parties.

The reprint seems like a great idea, with two quite distinct rulesets. Just not much of an environment for me to play 6-player multi-hour conquest games....

The Eagle Games 2005 version is supposedly fundamentally a reprint of this game. It includes rules for another games too but this game is included as the "classic version".

The reprint however has a different combat system and some rules changes. I found the rules of the original on-line and so can play the original version with the reprint and standard dice. This fixes the much overstated "catapult problem" as well in that the supply is limited.

My review of the Eagle Games "reprint" discusses this game as well.

Hmm, definately "old school". Still played this with my kids, (three player game), and while it went very long, it was quite a bit of fun. I was Macedonia, so I got crushed, and Egyptus ran roughshod over her part of the board and won pretty easily. Does require house rules. We used 3 catapults per legion maximum, "screening infantry" rule, and Calvalry at a cost of 20 instead of 25. Seemed to work.

My kids loved this game. We played it over and over.
But we also learned the secret of the game. When I bought it at the hobby store the salesman advised me, "buy catapults"! And he's right. I gave it to one of my kids years ago and last I heard his kids were playing it.

My least favorite GM game.  Can be quite boring, even though the theme is right on.  Just not a whole lot going on here.  Most of the map is either irrelevant or not used.  Bad design choices here, and even the components I found lacking.  Pass it on by.

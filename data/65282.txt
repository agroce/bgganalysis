A deck builder with anime maids? Ok. We're in. We love anime/manga and there are just hardly any games out there with that theme. So we pounced on this one as soon as a friend told us about it.Thanks Erich. Lighthearted with just enough strategy to make it engrossing. Though the event cards in the game (bad habits & illness) are just so annoying in game play that we've pulled them out. A bit like Dominion only with theme. Check it out.

RATING: 8.1
Cute, simple deck builder, would probably make a good introduction to the mechanic for someone who was feeling the theme. Which is, of course, moe anime maids who you're hiring to serve you for victory points. As someone who has been around a while, and watched anime for most of that time, it really doesn't bother me, since it's somewhat tasteful here and not terribly exploitative. Hell, we own Kanzume Goddess, Tentacle Bento and Barbarossa, which are all more risque and likely to ruffle the feathers of the over sensitive. But as far as the gameplay itself, this is a smooth system which is comparable to Dominion or Ascension, only much different in terms of its visual look.

Looking forward to the Oktoberfest expansion if I can ever buy the thing.

While I admit I did play this with my wife and two Japanese girls in french maid outfits, this game is nothing more than another boring re-themed Dominion. The game reminded me of erotic progression style anime (where the girls take off more clothing or change to more alluring clothing). The highlight of the game was that having extra actions allowed you to keep maids in your private quarters for VPs AND took them out of the circulation of having to do "work" for your deck (yeah I said deck).

This is just selling Dominion to otakus and other anime nerds. I prefer Dominion over Tanto Cuore, because the first one actually concentrates more on the game and not just on almost revealing maid girls in short skirts. This game is a bit socially akward. I mean the text on Tanto Cuore cards is just too small, because they wanted to have bigger pictures in the cards. The actual playing of the game is not bad though.

Owned by friends.

RATING: 8
Dominion re-skin with an emphasis on "skin." The theme of anime maids is either adorable or horrifying, depending on what kind of frame of mind you're in and who you're playing with.

Needs more variety of cards to truly sing, but it does introduce some interesting and worthwhile mechanics. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Based on playing the IOS app:

I'd forgotten why I disliked Dominion so much, but this one reminded me why.  There's just something so clinical about it that it ceases to be any fun at all, which is strange because I get a sense that I'm about as OCD as the next BGG, but I'd rather do chores around the house than play this.   

Regarding this game specifically, I found the terminology used in the instructions really confusing.  I've played a few deck-building games (Dominion, Ascension, Penny Arcade) and can't recall any of them being quite as obtuse. 

I did like some of the new mechanics, but didn't think they were enough to overcome how dry this game is.

It plays like [i][thing=36218]Dominion[/thing][/i], but with a way to cull cards from your deck and still be able to score them at the end of the game. The draw back to this is that there just aren't enough different cards to have the replayability of some of the other deck building games, so you pretty much will want to buy an expansion.

Dominion rip-off, but I like the "chamber" feature and the special, always in play cards (but they are pretty powerful and really sway the game).  Perhaps it was our card set, but I disliked how many targetted attack cards were played.  I like Attack cards that affect everyone better than targetted ones.  The text is way too small on the cards to be easy to play.

RATING: 7
Underneath the petticoats of the dodgy theme lurks a good game. A straight Dominion clone, but with an interesting set collection mechanism that boosts the player interaction a little by adding some competition for cards. Has a lighter feel to it than Dominion, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Would have bought a copy in Essen but €40 was steep for what it was. Maybe next year...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played twice.  This is clearly a knock-off of Dominion.

I suppose I'd be willing to play again, but I don't see much point.  This plays like a fan expansion of Dominion.  For the most part all of the changes are for the worse, and appear to have been chosen arbitrarily in effort to distinguish it from Dominion.  A few of the individual card mechanics are novel enough that they may have been worth developing for an actual Dominion expansion, but on average most appear to be just more expensive and/or clunkier versions of what Dominion already has.

The guy who I played this with I had previously played Dominion with some years before.  He wasn't really interested in Dominion, but was enthusiastic to play this.  However he assures everyone that his interest isn't due to the "sexy" cartoon maid theme.  He has shown no interest in playing Dominion since he has begun to play Tanto Cuore even though he explains that while it is not a knock-off it is very similar to Dominion.

This is the game that made me ditch Dominion. It has everything Dominion should have had from the first box and no need for six expansions to work.

I have no problems with the artstyle, which is more chaste that many would want us to believe. If it is a showstopper for you, okay, pass after this one. But I am sorry to say, a gem will be lost to you.

Really surprised me. Everyone kept telling me that if I can get my hands on a copy (not easy to get here) then I ought to because I love Dominion so much and this would be clearly superior in mechanics.

And... having it, yes, it pretty much is. I'm surprised how well this plays. Also, the art style isn't half as annoying as I thought it'd be.

Is it fair to lean this heavily on the theme when critically pole-axing a game? I say yea; the veneer of original ideas pretty much begins and ends with "Dominion plus several design elements the designer of Dominion rightly thought were poor design choices plus a whole hell of a lot of implicit boffing of bug-eyed purple-haired anime creatures in French maid outfits for some reason." So I can't help but feel compelled to point out that Tanto Cuore, whatever it's slender merits might be in a hypothetical world where Dominion does not already exist, is one stank-ass concoction that, like Jackie Treehorn, treats objects like women.

Lest I be thought a prude, let me stipulate that everyone has their kinks, and that this is a fine and natural state of affairs. But my interest in defending your right to have your kinks (and live them out amongst consenting adults out of my line of sight) runs in almost perfect inverse proportion to your desire to make them my business.

Irrelevant to the game play? Perhaps. But the game play brings little if anything new to the table so, again, hard to talk about anything else. Plus it keeps finding new ways to interfere with the experience even when I gird my teeth and grit my loins and just try to experience the thing with an open mind, like when I can't even read the agate fucking type on the cards because God forbid they allow a little more room for material relevant to the game since doing so would take up valuable card real estate currently devoted to spanking material for Otaku upskirt fetishists.

I rate this a three because I can't in good conscience ding what is largely a cosmetic makeover of a very good game any lower than that. But some things are too ugly to be much fun as games, this is one of them, and I say this as a man who earlier tonight played a thoroughly enjoyable game in the role of a Wehrmacht officer on the Eastern Front.

Pros: Plays well. Has some nice synergy to it as you get some bonuses for getting certain cards together as multiples or in combos. Has an interesting "personal" deck that injects some powerful but balanced "unique" cards. Probably biggest pro is the ability to move VP cards out of your deck into a "reserve."

Cons: Print is WAY too small to read. Too many piles in play to start with. Theme. I don't get it. I am not an anime fan. I feel dirty for playing it even though it is basically PG. But going beyond that, no clue what I am doing. Just collecting a bunch of maids to work for me. Ummm ok.

So-so: Borrows heavily from Dominion. Might be a plus, might be a negative in that regard. But it is a basic: 1 Action, 1 Buy, Clean-up, Draw to 5 game. Cards give you the +X draw, +X Action, +X coin, +X Buy. Hearts = Coins and in same denomination of 1, 2 and 3, but they all cost 1 heart more.

RATING: 6
The art is gorgeous if suggestive. It's not as bad as some of the more blatant anime, but it's still a little much if you're thinking it might be cute for your kids. (example: the worst one is probably the maid that's squirting a giant thing of white cake frosting, and her face is covered in it.) The mechanics mimic Dominion, but without all the wonderful options and complexity. Tanto Cuore is a Dominion where the same few cards are the only ones available to you each time.

It's a shameless Dominion rip-off.  By rights I should give it the same rating as Dominion, but I will knock it one point for being unoriginal in almost any significant way.  I would also have knocked off a point anyway because of the clumsily handled attack cards.  Really?  You can just pay to ruin a player directly?  That's stupid beyond words.  Hell, I should drop it another point.  Thankfully, you can just ignore that and pull those cards (and those private maids) out of the game.

Players are masters of a large house, employing maids and trying to earn the most victory points.  Players on their turn get to play one maid card from their hand and action it, which may lead to further actions (i.e. more maid cards played), and so on.  Maid cards grant bonuses, and "love" cards (yes, love cards) grant money to purchase further maid cards.  Maid cards can also be established into the private quarters, typically for some sort of end game bonus points award.  This is another deck building game, in the spirit of Dominion, and in fact is a good one once you move past the weird anime art and theming.  Game play is quite interesting as you have to constantly assess whether to move a maid into private quarters, or keep her in the deck to retain her bonus giving usefulness.  There are some excellent deck builders out there these days, including this one, which is making Dominion more and more redundant.  I liked this one a lot, but I wish the card text font was larger.

Ouch. Of all people, I really really wanted to like this one. I braced myself for a bad Dominion clone before playing, but after playing it I was left with a sour taste. It is exactly dominion in card effects, but with way less elegance.

In theory the private maids are a good idea, but in practice it was unbalanced for me. No one wants to waste a turn replacing one, so you make sure you just keep a good one. Problem is, if 2 turds are dealt out after other players get their private maids, you can be out of luck with no way of dealing out better options.

That being said, I would of still played the game IF the artwork was closer to my expectations. I own Barbarossa and was hoping Tanto Cuore would have similar tasteless panty shots. Oh well.

Essentially re-themed Dominion in gameplay, some interesting additions to add slightly to gameplay, but your reason to buy will hinge almost entirely on whether or not you need a game with cute Japanese maids.

RATING: 7
It's Dominion, with some nice tweaks. Nice aggressive tweaks coupled with cute manga maids make for a nice enough deck-building game that has a less generic theme than its daddy Dominion. Might be embarrassing to play in mixed company.

RATING: N/A
A dominion clone without much in the way of innovation. There are probably more interesting games out there that take the concept in new directions.
The whole theme with the french maids is kind of awkward and embarrassing.

RATING: 9
Tanto Cuore is a shameless copy of Dominion under a more interesting theme. However, after you start to understand the intricacies of the added rules it becomes a much better game than dominion. 

The card design is what Dominion should have done from the beginning (having the +cards, +buys, etc in reserved places instead of the card text).

The only downside to this game is the small printed rules text on the cards, but as with dominion you will eventually know what the cards do from memory).

I've had people not wanting to play this game because the theme is oversexualized, I can't agree. I even have to say that for a japanese game it is very mild. The card art is more cute than sexy and there are only 2 cards that have "shy" panty shots.

People are free to have their opinions, but I usually don't see this level of "hate" against games that have violent art/themes. I think this "fear" of anime stems from not understanding the culture where this comes from.

There is a lot of room in my heart for Dominion clones and this is basically Dominion with (anime) maid theme and a set collecting aspect.

This was my second deck builder after Dominion and it fixed a lot of what I didn't like about Dominion. You can still build a deck that cycles pretty much every turn, but there is a lot more opportunity to gain VP as you play rather than making a mad dash when you anticipate end game. Some of the expansions make it a little strong, but the base game is a solid experience.

RATING: 10
I usually say "It's not Dominion, but what is?" With this I can say, "It's not Dominion, but it's the best non-Dominion game I've played."

It's no surprise then that it borrows a lot from Dominion, and adds its own stuff to the mix.

The game plays fairly quickly, has a more robust scoring system that is fun to manage in game, and seems to play more smoothly than Dominion.

If you love Dominion, and you either like anime art, or aren't put off by it, then you'll love this.

That said, Dominion still does what it does better, but with this game you won't mind.

On a side note: I was nervous that this game would be a game for creepy middle aged men, but honestly it's all G rated, and family friendly.

Beautiful Japanese art. Not a 10, because it can be a bit clashy at times.

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful game. Similar deck-builder to dominion, but with several little differences that make it quirky and interesting in its own ways. (Plus, the maids are much cuter than the Dominion characters.)

I highly recommended it to anyone who enjoys deck-builders. I mean - I love Dominion, and I will always have a fond attachment to it. But comparing this game to base Dominion, I'd probably pick Tanto Cuore, though I need to play it a lot more to make a final decision. I mean, if I could only have one on an island...

While this game is as about as close as you can get to being Dominion without actually being Dominion, it is the first Dominion-like game that I feel has improved upon the formula.

Perhaps, Tanto Cuore is one of the best Deck Builder games out there. I want to explore it further and I will back to re rate and re comment. For now I can say I’m indifferent to the theme, but the gameplay is very good. Love that the game has a static market offering trough each game allowing for strategic planning. The art is also very good. It is very Dominion derivati, but that’s not a bad thing and it seems it captures the essence of what made Dominion a great game.

Tanto Cuore has a lot of probabilities of getting an improved rating.

So, yeah, the theme of this bothers me. I try not to think about it when I'm playing, though, and the game lay is okay. The private chamber mechanism is new, but is really only a mildly interesting variation on deck thinning. In the end, more than any other deck builder I've played, this one feels to me like a Dominion clone with a lot less variation in the box.

RATING: 7
A Dominion-style deck builder where the theme is maids for the house -- albeit anime-style French maids with low modesty (so if the art is remotely offensive, avoid this game). Unlike Dominion, it has permanent maids that give bonuses but don't get mixed in your deck. It ends up more enjoyable than Dominion somehow as a result.

PLUS: more enjoyable deck builder than Dominion
ADDED PLUS: iOS app teaches the game well
MINUS: the theme may be offensive
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Plays pretty much the same as Dominion: go for money then go for points. However, the theme is MUCH more amusing! There's a little more "take that" play than in base Dominion, and I do like that there is a way to remove cards from your deck but still retain their points, and often gain multipliers for removing certain sets of cards. Dominion with a few twists and HOT anime maids. How can you go wrong?

Theme is give or take depend on person/group.

It's a fairly light deck builder, given how many of them are out in the market as of now. However, the game itself is very solid with a fairly amount of replayability. 

Introduced some unique scoring mechanic (Chambering) and target specific attack card (Bad habit, illness) to the deck-building genre, which again, could be good or bad depends on your group.

テーマを変えた、ほぼドミニオンのゲーム。ドミニオンは嫌いだが、このゲームは意外と面白い。ドミニオンやサンダーストーンとは異なり、いらないVPカードの一部は傍仕えとしてデッキから外せられるところがいい。直接攻撃ができる点も、ドミニオンの標準と比べるといい点。微妙に価格やVPに調整が入ったのが、いい感じかな。
ドミニオンより劣っているのは、一般メイドの数が少ない点。拡張を入れないと飽きが早いかも。絵はドミニオンよりも好みだが、この絵では子供とは遊べません。また、所有しているのが恥ずかしい。イラストも多くの人が関わっているので統一性に欠けます。売れれば勝ちと思っているのでしょうか？萌えのテーマは、このシステムにあっているか？と言われると、多分外れていると思います。インパクトがあるために、誤魔化されていますが。
あと、ドミニオンになれてからこのゲームに移ると特有な言葉（はあと、雇用とか）に非常に戸惑います。
ソロヴァリアントがフォーラムで公開されています。面白いとは思いますが、このルールの得点方法だと時間がえらくかかります。その意味でiOS版で遊ぶのが手頃です。iOS版はよくできています。ただ、自分で好きなメイドをセットできない点と拡張が含まれていないのが残念です。iOS版でソロならば評価7

So far as I knew, [i]Tanto Cuore[/i] was the first of the [i]Dominion[/i] clones and not much else.

Playing it to discover its unique quirks was an unexpected bonus.  The silver and gold piles are remarkably shallow and ran out early in our first play.  Furthermore, the player pursuing combos of low-scoring victory cards absolutely clobbered the province strategy I pursued in the first play.

My second play was much tighter and I am coming to appreciate the quirks of this particular game.  Repeated plays will reveal if the game can truly stand up to the deckbuilding powerhouse that is [i]Dominion[/i].

A cute and interesting take on the Dominion-styled game play that I came across while purchasing, ironically, Dominion: Cornucopia. 

It has a decent variety of cards to play with and with two future English expansions in the works, I can see this game being played as often as the other DBG's I have. 

If you like anime and like Dominion, this is a game you should take a look at. Be forewarned though, you may or may not get a raised eye brow or two when you get people together to play this game.

It felt like it played faster than Dominion though, but that was probably a function of the number of players more than the game.  I think I would prefer this over Dominion simply because there are too many people that have overplayed Dominion.

Tanto Cuore is a slightly more interesting deck builder than the themeless, and dry, Dominion.  This is mainly because there are incredibly well endowed, and scantily clad cartoon women on the cards.  It seems to be Dominion for horny teenagers, or perhaps depraved older men.

Other than the gravity defying cartoon breasts all over the cards, the game is a typical deck builder.  Players begin the game with a weak starting deck.  They use these cards to procure ever better cards that give them special abilities, and/or points.  The first one to get to a certain point target wins.

The game is so close to the worst deck builder I've ever played (the aforementioned Dominion) that I can't recommend it.  There are far better deck builders out there, and far better sources of porn.  Either way Tanto Cuore loses.

Not sure what the fuss is about, in any sense. Whilst the theme may be mildly questionable (and pretty weakly so for a Japanese game), there are only two cards that I've seen - the 1 Love and the 5-value card that gives 3 love and lets other players draw a card - which raise an eyebrow. As a game, there is definitely more interaction in the base set than its principal comparator, Dominion; however, there is also much less variety.

Maybe the expansions offer more, but I'm not in a hurry to try.

Ein Deckbuilder aus Japan, mal wieder :-) Aber Tanto Cuore weiß zu überzeugen. Das Setting ist natürlich wieder etwas verrückt, denn die Spieler sind Hausherren und müssen Dienstmädchen einstellen. Am Ende bringen die Hausmädchen Siegpunkte und der beste Hausherr gewinnt. Das Artwork ist toll und zeigt viele Anime Schönheiten, durchaus sexy aber die Darstellung von nackter Haut hält sich in Grenzen. Die Spielmechanik hat viele ähnlichkeiten mit Dominion, spielt sich in meinen Augen aber besser und flotter und liefert schon im Basisspiel, durch Angriffskarten mehr Interaktion zwischen den Spielern. Wer auf Animes/Mangas steht und mit dem Artwork/Setting etwas anfangen kann, wird an Tanto cuore seine Freude haben!

It's like Dominion and an anime had a baby. It's much more aggressive than Dominion, but it has cute artwork and a bizarre theme. I like the subtle differences in gameplay. The only concern I have with the game is that a few of the maids are a bit "racey". Now I don't personally have a problem with it, but it now becomes a bit harder to sell to people if I want them to play.

Card quality is so-so, but the artwork is nice. My biggest complaint with the game is the card text is SUPER tiny. Like...really, really tiny. I can read it, but if you had any problems with tiny font, you'd have a hell of a time with this game.

I own the ISO version and got it when it is on sale. Talk about taking a thin theme game of Dominion and turn it into a complete theme-less game. This game is made to appeal to the Otakus who have maid fetishes. The mechanic of some cards in Dominion at least have some connection to the theme. E.g. Mine lets you upgrade your income, Witch give out curses. In this game each card has a different name for a maid and they do different things. At least I don't have to play this in person.

Actually sort of like this one.  It IS like Dominion, but there's enough different to make it feel like its own game.  The art is pretty awesome.

RATING: 6
Setting aside the sexist and degrading theme/art/terminology, the game itself is ok.  Most of it is derivative and uninspired, but acceptably implemented and adequately balanced.  The private maids are quite random.

The one interesting idea is ability to 'chamber' victory cards -- spend excess actions to set them aside until end-of-game scoring.  That mechanic creates a willingness for players to buy low VP cards during the game and a way to deal with excess actions -- something that other deckbuilders have never really done.

But really, does playing a maid have to be 'serving' and do the best maids in the game have to hang out in your 'private chamber' and do the core resource for gaining maids really need to be 'love' (just to drive home the point that we are not simply employing maids to clean the house)?  Perhaps worst, but most subtle, is the fact that you are constantly sending the women in the game 'to the kitchen'.  Bleh.

I just got the game, played a game, and the theme is ridiculously flimsy (no jokes please). I mean, what does it mean when you have the most Colettes? Did the Japanese develop superior maid cloning technology? Why are there seven maids in my private quarters and why are they all ill? At least the cost of the anime spinoff would be cheap -- just hit copypasta for the foreground so we can have four Safrans in the private quarters scene.

For all I care, the General Maid cards could be creatures from the Cthulhu Mythos and the unique Private Maids could be Ancient Ones from the Mythos! Not sure how Hastur would look in a maid outfit, tho.

It's Dominion, with anime pictures and some different cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While Tanto Cuore leans heavily on Dominion's network,  it has a (somewhat suspect) theme that actually makes more sense than summoning buildings to do your bidding. The system also has more interesting decision points, with greater diversity in VP sources and the ability to set aside cards for benefits. The biggest problem with the series in general however, is that each set has poor diversity in cards. This means that you really need at least two sets to get some decent replay value out of the system.

I played the Expanding the House expansion extensively before playing this, and the base set has quite a different feel to it. While Expanding the House plays briskly and with little confrontation, the base set has more card-drawing combos and is certainly more hostile. While Illnesses and Bad Habits aren't as devastating as I thought they would be, they still are highly annoying and can create a kingmaker scenario. Also worth noting is that there are fewer VP sources in the base set. Still, I appreciate the change in atmosphere and the expanded variety of cards that the game badly needs.

Apart from Events, another issue with the base game is that there are many cards which grant cards and actions at the same time, leading to long chaining actions as the game progresses. A number of cards (the Crescent sisters and Ophelia) also require exact numbers to be efficient, which leads to players having to constantly recheck their deck composition.

This is remarkably much better than I'd anticipated.  I figured that this would be a straight rip off of Dominion and that they were only using other people's hard work as a vehicle to for people who want to buy cheesecake to justify their purchase.  I was wrong only in that it isn't a straight rip off, the rest of my assumptions I'm going to say are now reaffirmed.  

They actually added some cool elements.  I like the special maids, and the way the game encourages you to push cards out of your hand by sacrificing actions.

In Dominion (up until Prosperity), there was the dreaded 7.  What is kind of cool here is that the numbers clog in strange ways.  Your buys have more difficult kinds of decisions, especially with the silvers being more expensive and finite.  

Not bad.

Still, I can't imagine playing this in public and not feeling totally ashamed of yourself.

RATING: 8
This is the game that got me into the board gaming hobby so I hold it very dear despite all its flaws.

Play with the expansions and use randomizers to set up your games (I made a set by sleeving some Magic the Gathering cards and slipping in a strip of paper with every card's name on it) unless you want a mid-late game where everyone takes like 5 minutes turns because they're chaining multiple consecutive draw card effects to draw out their entire decks. zzzzzzzzzzzz

Edit: I feel like at this point expansion content isn't very well designed, especially when compared to Dominion. The most recent expansion has a built-in attack mechanic and the last two expansions involve entire piles of cards that only get used when a specific card is used. I feel like the distinction between maid and butler cards (ie: butlers aren't maids) opens up a lot of potential for interesting cards to be designed that isn't being explored by whoever's in charge of designing expansions now.

Another Dominion semi-clone; the main changes here are that some maid cards can be left permanently in play, and negative events which can be purchased and applied directly to another player. And, of course, the cards all feature anime maids.

Besides the theme, I'm not sure it's a huge improvement. (The theme I [i]am[/i] sure is a huge improvement.) 

Event cards are negative-sum and create the same issues of perception that make Nightfall unplayable (i.e., it's as much about the appearance of not winning as it is about winning). Private maids are interesting but increase the randomness. From Dominion the game inherits its tediously long setup, repetitive shuffling and potential for draw-play-draw-play-draw-draw-draw-play-hmmmm-what-should-I-buy downtime. Card text is unreasonably small.

It's not a bad game, and if you have to play a Dominion clone you could do worse.

The japanese vision of Dominion ;)

From Arclights deck-building games, this one is the one which has the most similarities with Dominion. I prefer it to basic Dominion, but it only has 16 different cards compared to Dominions 25.

Other Changes:
- Private Maids - Basicly those are cards which don't enter your deck and provide a bonus each round. Unlike the normal cards, each of them is unique. 

- More VP paths. You don't have cards which trash other cards, but there are multiple cards which can set themself aside and  provide a VP bonus at the end of the game. 

- Money costs one more. In  Dominion it is usually never a bad idea to buy a silver/gold if you are unsure. In tanto you will often instead buy a new maid, since money is more expensive and as already mentioned, many cards can "trash" themself and provide a nice bonus if done so. So the infamous silver strategy is much weaker in Tanto.


Rating up to 9. The second expansion is really good.

This game is pretty much Dominion. It adds a few different ways to get victory points which I like and the Private Maids and ability to chamber maids are all good additions. The cards ability's themselves though with not a lot of draw and not too many double actions as well as the cost of each card being higher does slow the game down considerably. It doesn't have that same speed and snappiness as Dominion.

An improvement on Dominion! If you have no tolerance for Anime stuff, then skip this one! But you don't need to be a giant Otaku to appreciate this either. The theme is also only as lewd as you make it. Only 1-2 cards are actually of scantily clad women (the summer vacation expac is a different story though) and the rest are just wearing maid clothes. I guess that can be a fetish but they're not really sexualized especially. 

Anyway, I like the chambermaiding to score points and added some variety to Dominion that it needed!

A rare interesting deck-building game. Other than having private maids for different powers to build your deck around, the different methods of scoring cards makes it easier to bring to the table. Theme is definitely a problem to many, though. In addition, storage organization could use a bit more of an upgrade than cardboard. The numbers on the cards at least help with that a little.

Quite aside from the theme, the game plays better than Dominion. There are more opportunities to get victory points, as a natural consequence of building your engine.

I enjoy the mechanisms in Tanto Cuore, which are obviously akin to it's ancester Dominion, but with a twist in the choices and collections that are varied and interesting. The anime-styled depictions on the cards are not harsh, but the expansions do get more 'racey', so this is clearly not meant for the very young...which is sort of a shame because it plays so well. However, for the more mature people who like Japanime, or those who can see 'past' the suggestive theme, this is an awfuly cute  and fun variation of deck-builders.

tentative rating

Its art is cute, and the theme is so very manga; however, while there are icons to represent certain common effects, they are on two corners of the card, so you can't see them by fanning the cards.  Also, the card costs are in a corner, but the Love is not, so if you fan your cards in the usual way, wishing to see how much Love you have to spend, instead of 1, 1, 2, 3, you see 1, 1, 4, 7.  Also, I am not a fan of the directed permanent damage, such as Bad Habits.  Finally, as with [thing=53953][/thing], the escalation doesn't seem to feel quite right.  [thing=69789]Ascension[/thing] has this issue, too, but that game is always progressing quickly, even if escalation stalls.

Puts an 8 here to begin with. I haven't played it that much, but it's a quite decent game, played with the Dominion rules but with one scoring difference, and quite a different feel to the system. First of all, the maids are generally cheaper than the action cards in Dominion, while the pure VP cards are quite expensive, which makes the "+buy" (+employ) a more important factor than I find in Dominion. Also, it's harder to get more pure coin (hearts). Second, some action card maids are worth VPs, and thirdly, some action maids can be set aside ("trashed") for one action. These can be worth bonus points if a certain number of them are set aside at the end game.
The end game is also quicker, as it ends when any 2 piles are exhausted. I haven't analyzed the cards, and don't know enough about card analyzing to determine if any card is broken, but my general impression is that the "silver strategy" simply doesn't work the same way. Some action maids can be vast VP if you manage to trash them correctly, so the timing is more important.
Also, there are "unique maids" - a deck of cards where every card is unique. These are revealed 2 at a time and give the owner a general power, like a +draw each turn or whatnot.

The game does break one of the Dominion golden rules - it has targeted attacks - sickness and bad habits can be bought as normal and are then put onto another players home (or maid).

However, at the moment I believe the main attraction isn't so much the game itself as the theme - the fact that you can play Dominion with cute maids. There is a decent game there, but as for now I can't judge if it's equal to, inferior or superior to Dominion.

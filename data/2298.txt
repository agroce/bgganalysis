Very nice. Invasion: Sciliy could seem a little small and constrained, Barbarossa can seem overwhelming, and Kasserine is just right. System seems a little klunky to learn, but once grasped it plays quite well for a "high-end" wargame. I am somewhat amused by the complaints about the dice-rolling; for me, if the combat resolution system is too transparent, *that* becomes a problem, and the efficiency checks here certainly don't get out of hand and add quite a lot to the game. Recommended; highly recommended if you like von Borries' other games.

RATING: 6
This is a traditional and very well researched wargame from veteran designer Van Borries but it seemed a little dry to me compared to other wargames. In fairness though this was one of the first wargames I ever played and it was probably more game than I was really ready for at the time.

Good game - though, on this topic, I prefer Tunisia from the Gamers.

RATING: 7.5
I have only played the small Faid Pass scenario several times, so my rating should be considered temporary and is based solely on that scenario. I am looking forward to trying the full campaign. This is an excellent system, with a lot of nice detail, even if it is a bit heavy on modifiers (and modifiers for modifiers, and modifiers for modifiers for modifiers... I exaggerate, but not by much). I finally created a "cheat sheet" with a full turn walkthrough, including lots of blank lines for penciling in modifiers (and modifiers for modifiers, etc.)...

An excellent 'clean' operational system, with less than 20 pages of rules. Sufficiently detailed rules to give historical realism but not to the point of getting onerous. What really makes this game exciting and different from other hex-and-counter wargames - efficiency ratings. They really give players something to think about. Provides a level of uncertainty in combat but not to the point of players getting hosed by random dice rolls. Gives you a sense why some units are more valuable than others and why commanders always use them! And good spread of scenarios too - from the short, to mid-length to long.

After playing it after a long hiatus, I decided to raise the rating. The system is very clean and effective. The difference between mobile battles and ste-pieces battles is interesting.

VVB's designs are always on the complex side of things. However if you have the patience and a love of the subject this is a nice game. Low counter density and nice graphics don't hurt either.

Not a bad game, but I didn't like all the combat system steps required to achieve what is often a foregone conclusion...Tiger Tanks go through American units like a hot knife goes through butter.... much better in smaller doses, ie the scenarios as it is less depressing to play the Americans.

Not as fiddly as some commenters suggest.  The combat resolution system is easily learned, and requires a few die rolls against a lead unit's efficiency rating to cooridinate artillery, air and offensive combat actions.  This leads to some uncertainty in attacks, which cuts down on factor counting, as players commit units, not a certain number for attack factors.

The rules seem complex, but are actually easy once you play out a turn.  They are just very thorough.  I've recently realized that I'm unlikely to ever play this FTF, and it's too long and detailed for solitaire play, so I've downgraded it accordingly.

RATING: 6
Plays very well solitaire.  The coordination requirements and efficiency ratings for each unit necessitate a lot of die-rolls to make engagements go off as planned, but the unit density is usually low enough to prevent that process from being too cumbersome.  The Axis are allowed to deliberately move into tenuous supply positions, whereas the Allies are not, one of the ways the game reflects the superior manuverability and tactical knowledge of the DAK at the time.  Fantastic looking map and counter art.

RATING: 8
A bit of an under appreciated gem this one. Great fun, beautifully presented and virtually errata free.

The situation in the Kasserine campaign is a very interesting one where both players get a chance to be on the attack and theres tonnes of room for manouver allowing for many different long term strategies and an emphasis on cutting supply.

The scenario mix is excellent with six in the box and extra one available through c3i which all vary in size and play time, from short 1 hour scenarios with 15-20 counters per side to the full campaign lasting an entire day with hundreds of counters.

Complaints? I wish the combat system was a little faster, each combat can involve air support, artillery and ground combat, all of which have different modifiers and restrictions and different decisions to be made. Its a rich combat system but it can get tedious at times. 

Also the counters and hexes are too small for a system which can often have stacks over 10 counters high.

Vance von Borris does it again (his previous effort is on the same battle: Decision at Kasserine)...would he be tired?  North Afirca + Rommel + Vance von Borris = Good game.

I overlooked this one when it came out because I already had Rommel and thought the theme well covered.  This game, however, knocked me out of my socks.  The system is very clean (works a lot like RTL) and there is little downtime.  Also, the scenarios (of course) are brilliant - these were awesome battles.

Will also sell if you have nothing of interest to trade. Make an offer and we can talk.

Good game. The efficiency checks become easy to master after a few game turns and add a nice uncertainty's flavour. Plan your attacks because the retreat through ZOC may seriously damage your orange-circled Flak if something goes wrong. The Luftwaffe and his CAS is a deadly weapon. Beware of the artillery power : an heavy barrage can completely change the odds. Good idea to keep some Sherman in reserve two hex behind the first defensive line : a quick reaction can save the situation wherever you need.

Not my usual cuppa, but I like the way this scale, which I think of as micro-operational, can portray the activities of an individual division.

RATING: N/A
Using a streamlined Invasion:Sicily system to recreate battles around Kasserine pass this Vance offering is an old-school design with some interesting scenarios, the usual great order of battle research, but which fails to find its place in the new world order of wargames... rules are a little bit too convoluted, stacks are a little bit too high, gameplay is a little bit too tedious...

RATING: 7
I have played all of the scenarios & campaign game and can say that this my favorite operational North Africa wargame and an excellent operational system.  It's as high as I want to go on the complexity scale for an operational wargame.  The various efficiency die rolls, and the choice of CRT are "realistic" and well-done mechanics that keeps players uncertain of combat outcomes.  Great for solitaire play too.

Really fun, but long, campaign game.  German marginal.  Bumped rating up one.

Good I-Go U-Go game, with combat resolutions taking some time to work through.  Played the Faid pass scenario thus far, with the Americans managing to rescue the last French unit in the pass.

Basically the same system as Roads to Leningrad minus the chit pull activations and a few minor differences. Not as good as OCS but this isn't that far behind.

I'd been away from war gaming for 15 or so years and am amazed at what the state of the art is now!

This game is excelent in teaching the way things happened,showing you how units manuvered, and what influenced the commanders decision.  Doing it yourself here goes a long long ways in explaining things.

The map is beautiful, as are the counters which doesn't detract from their usefulness.  I'd prefer 5/8" counters, but that would make the map much larger.

The rules are remarkably clear and play easily once you play a couple of turns.

All in all, simply an excellent game.  I only have five of Vances games so far, but plan on buying all of his that he's got in the works now.

I think all the die rolling adds too much luck.  Set-up cards were hard to use.  But it was fun and maneuver can be more decisive than numbers, that's a positive in my book.

This game has great mechanics of this battle, and gameplay is fluid.  A player playing the Americans may feel like he's being beat up most of the time, but they need to learn how to delay the Germans and use time on their side.

Excellent game system. One of the best operationals out there. Lot's of room to manouver. Beautiful map.

If you like GMT's operational series or East Front series, check this one out. Also a must for fans of Ardennes '44 and Roads to Leningrad

The rules are not nearly as complex as some say they are. After a few turns everything works smoothly if you're a somewhat experienced wargamer.

Although this is a refinement of Decision at Kasserine, I actually prefer Decision.  What made Decision fun is that it played fast, was very mobile, and was streamlined.  I found having to make tons of efficiency rolls for nearly every air unit, artillary units, and attackers slowed the game down and made battles less decisive (more retreats, fewer step losses).

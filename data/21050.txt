Diseño perfecto, con reglas sencillas, claras y precisas. La incertidumbre lejos de ser un handicap, refleja el combate táctico a la perfección. Y es que el campo de batalla no es posible controlarlo. Quizás se pueda echar de menos algún que otro tanque.

I love it! Even though some things seem underpowered or even futile at first (namely, ranged combat), everything has its use and place. Besides, the real point of the game is recreate the feel of a war movie, with lots of chaos surrounding your units, who run for their lives towards their seemingly insurmountable goal.

RATING: 10
Very playable game with rules that are much less intimidating than they seem at first blush.  Replayable to the extent that card draws and random events make every game different as well as random scenario generation possibilities.  What seem like minor differences in unit capabilities do create significant opportunities for each nationality but these differences can be subtle and the right way to take advantage of them must be learned the hard way.

RATING: 7.5
My first hex-n-chit wargame.  I must say, I really like it.  Very strategic and tactical, with a good dose of lucky/unlucky events.  Feels very cinematic, too.  Every game creates a memorable narrative and it feels almost like I'm watching a movie, only I'm an active participant in it.

The card-driven aspect is new to me, but I really like it; it seems to be a very innovative and cool way to take care of die rolls, random events, the confusion that happens in the midst of battle, and the advancement of time, all together.

I even have a great time playing this solo, just imagining in my head how the battle is playing out.

Seems to take me a long time to do much in the game, though.

This game has a cinematic feel at times, and while anything can happen, it rewards good planning and tactics. The card driven element makes this frustrating, but in a good way. Chad did a fantastic job. Personal preference is for Europe and Med editions. While I enjoy Pacific (it IS a bit different -- in a good way), I prefer the European theater more.

RATING: 9
My absolute favourite game, regardless of genre. Lots of interesting choices to make and every game so far has been really intense. Love how the game require both tactical sense and card management. Also, the various random events helps make every session unique. When playing, one can't plan every little detail but have to "think on one's feet" as the game progresses, which I like a lot. I'm no wargamer, but this game makes me want to become one. 

EDIT: Three years later I still consider this a great game, but after playing lots of different wargames my preferences have changed a bit.

Chad Jensen is a game designer genious. And the best rules writer ever. His aproach to wargames is opening this door for a lot of people who probably never aproached them before. And that is no small feat. When you play CC, you either hate it or love it. I am in the second group, needless to say. And there are tanks coming, fellows!

2010-04-14 (rating 6):

An OK game. However way too random for me. And also not very much in themes I like. I can play it if someone really wants to but on my own it is doubtful that I will like to play it.

The card driven mechanic is interesting however for me one has to small influence on the cards he/she has.

The units and weapons seem to be were realistic.

RATING: 8
GMT games are like crack to me. I want them and I want them to make me feel good about myself, but often they put me in a daze and ruin my life. I think it has something to do with the density of the rulebooks and the sneaking suspicion that I'm playing wrong in some way. However, there is still something about them that keeps me coming back. Combat Commander is a big reason why.

At first glance the game may look stodgy or square or for old people with no taste in the razzmatazz of modern board games. It looks like it should come with a bag of Werther's Originals. However, upon playing the game and seeing the excitement of opportunity fire, random sniping, triggered events, white-knuckle rally rolls, and unexpected swings of fortune, it reveals its true form - that of an unpredictable, yet satisfyingly strategic game of tactical prowess. 

It calls to me from the shelf, wanting me to match wits against a worthy opponent and see just what way the twelve scenarios (or countless generated scenarios) may go. It's just a brilliant game that is far more simple than at first glance and far more sweet for it. Just like a Werther's Original hard candy.

Solid wargame, it has a lot of rules, but it flows well and it is intuitive. If you are thinking to delve into wargames this one has a steep (but not impossible like ASL) learning curve but it is so rich and engaging I can see why it is considered a classic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Based on a few solo plays and one mutant hybrid four-player multiplayer game. A rip-roaring good time -- even for a three-hour game, it moved very fast. I can see that strategies will reveal themselves through repeated plays as one becomes more familiar with the various armies. I would play every weekend given the time and opportunity.

UPDATE: Upped from my original rating of 8. After a few more conventional two-player plays using the rules as-written (thanks to my eternally obliging son), the chaos and fluidity of the game really shine through. Choices and opportunities shift from round to round, forcing you to plan on the fly. I can't seem to win to save my life, but that doesn't diminish my enjoyment of the game one iota. Fantastic stuff, endlessly engaging and variable. A truly great game.

ALSO WITH: Battle Packs 1, 2, 3, 5, 7.

RATING: 5
ASL with 95% of the reason and accountability sucked out. Definitely not related to Up Front. Overall its slow [slower than ASL], cumbersome and not very intelligent. Tried a dork tactic as it seemed likely to work: I wheeled an HMG in the open road and had a duel with an LMG at the other end of the street and amazingly I won!! then we put the big gun back indoors. Smoke seems totally impenetrable, close combat totally deadly, but fire attacks not very. About the only impressive feature was fires breaking out occasionally in buildings, as this is accurate and also something ASL does poorly.

Antidote: anyone reading this really, really needs to play ASL. Having 100% of the story is a thousand times better.

PS: tanks will never work on this planet.

This is, quite simply, the most overrated wargame ever. I haven't played every tactical system, but I have played a lot of them: Squad Leader, Advanced Squad Leader, Up Front, Band of Brothers, Conflict of Heroes, Tide of Iron, Memoir 44, Frontline: D-Day, and Advanced Tobruk System. They all have one thing in common: they are better than Combat Commander.
So why is this game a dog? Well, first of all, we are on the battlefield. The enemy is closing in on our position.
Sir, what do we do?
Nothing.
Why? They'll kill us.
Because we don't have a fire card!
[ImageID=1707042original]
Sir, we found a stash of ammunition!
Good, fire at the sun!
The sun?
Do you have a problem hearing soldier?
No, sir.
Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!
Sir, the sun is setting quickly!
Exactly! The sun is afraid is bullets. It is night time now. We have secured the area.
Sir, won't they attack us at night?
There are no night attacks.
Why not?
It's in the rules.
Oh, you are right. Clearly written rules that explain how to play this moronic "simulation."
Even funnier is listening to fans of this game try to rationalize its absurdities. If you don't have a card, you are performing "ineffective" fire, but a card represents "effective" fire...unless you miss.  Then it's ineffective.
And firing at the sun? I heard that the space-time continuum changes. On Turn 1, 1 hex may represent 100 yards and at the end of the game, it represents 200 miles.  However, the range of your weapons do not change. Go figure.
This game SUPPOSEDLY marries the tactics of Squad Leader with the chaos of Up Front. Except the chaos is watered down Up Front and the tactics are so absurd, it makes chess look like a realistic war game.
I get other games I don't like, but I will never ever understand the allure of this one.

This is the first squad/company sized game that I have played and I don't know if I will get to ASL now that CCE is in my life.  I wish there was a better way to play this game than with carboard chits, but I don't know how.  I am looking forward to the British expansion!

First game I bought after being away from wargaming for ~20 years. CC blew my mind as to what a wargame could be: fast, interactive, intuitive, and challenging. Time is elastic. Play the same scenario five times in a row and it’ll turn out different every time due to the cards, events, and variable objectives. Near infinite replayability with the Random Scenario Generator, not to mention the 100+ scenarios available between the base games and expansions. The rules and mechanics are ridiculously tight. And best of all, it generates sticky narratives unlike any game I’ve ever played. A masterpiece.

RATING: 10
I keep trying to find something I don't like about this game and I can't. My first 10. 

This game isn't as random as many people make it out to be. With proper hand management and a little bit of card counting you'll find that you'll be able to do much of what you want to do. Personally I find the mechanics for hand management (playing actions, skipping turns to discard) very stimulating. That's not to say it's not random at all, just that the randomness is very well implemented and you can mitigate it with smart play. Most games where both sides make good decisions seem to come down to the wire which often won't happen in a truly random game.

I really like the fluid, sometimes non-linear way that the game models time and to some extent location. I also love how the card play creates a sense of uncertainty for both players. Nice fog of war.

Between fire/maneuver, hand management, bluffing, multiple victory conditions, random game length, and scenario special rules there are a ton of things to consider every turn which makes this a very engaging, satisfying system. You can keep playing and learn something every time you play. With all that plus a ton of scenarios in the expansions and the random scenario generator it also has lots of breadth.

The Initiative Card is amazing and I wish more games were aware of how swingy their dice results can be and included something similar to mitigate extremes.

I've revised my thoughts on this game quite a bit and my rating has dropped 3 points as a result. 

Pretty good system. The random elements are nice and spice things up a bit provided they don't get too out of hand. However, it does seem that combat could be a little more effective than it is. And it would be nice if all the card cycling could be reduced a bit which does get boring. However, it is an nice design that I'd generally be willing to play.

This is an excellent 2 player squad based infantry combat game. Sure, there is some frustration with a card driven game and lacking the order card you need... but thats war. Confusion rules the battlefield, and the army that manages/overcomes the confusion is the victor.

What to say about a game that has almost everything you may wanna ask for in a war game? Fairly easy to play, great mixture of cards playing and strategy, tons of different possible combinations of actions, events and order... well, needless to say this should be in the collection of every (war)gamer. Not extraordinary solitaire friendly (like Fighting Formations) but great even in solo if you identify yourself with both parts in equal measure.

I'm not a huge fan of tactical games. It takes too long for too little to happen.

Rating after 1 demo.  This was the game I saw last year but was not able to try out.  This time around I was able to get in to the demo at Conquest 2006.  Played against JaggedTech(Greg) in the demo scenario.  Very tight game, ended with  1 vp for the RUSSKIES.  The flow of the game works well with the card, lots of tough choices but yet played very fast.  We completed in 2 hrs.  Kind of reminder me of Up Front.  Glad I preorder on P500.  Received 12/23/06.

I'm not a great fan of tactical level wargames, though Combat Commander nearly made a convert of me.  Despite the 24-page rules booklet, programmed learning makes it a very accessible game. There is also a strong narrative feel, mostly generated by the fate cards. 

That said, the level of randomness in Combat Commander bothers me.  I understand the point of it being there; to snap us out of the perfect knowledge and planning of earlier generations of tactical games.  Yet random events, secret objectives, uncertain game length and the luck of the card draw take the game too far towards the opposite extreme for my taste.  Added to that, those unpredictable events are sometimes simply odd. 

Production quality and artwork are pretty much standard GMT.  However, the counters are rather thin. On one game's evidence the rules seem uncommonly complete.

Game literally driven by cards. Making a strategy or tactical plans are useless.

I experienced this game as extremely annoying. Almost driven by luck. I have seen too often situations where I or my opponent don't get the cards I or he desperately needed. You need to move and no move cards show up, but have a hand full of fire cards but no targets to fire upon. This kind of situations happen too often to my taste.

Or what about this situation. Your best leader - the one you can't afford to lose - get suddenly stuck in a wire - an event played by the opponent. The only way out is to play an advance card, which you don't have and don't get. Then suddenly out of nowhere a paratrooper is in your back. Again an event played by the opponent. You're stuck while the enemy is firing and there is nothing you can do about it. This is clearly no strategy game, where the cleverest will win!

The designer gives credits to many games, except the game from which it is clearly derived ... (Advanced) Squad Leader.

Initial impressions: Good tactical wargame. Not so complex as it first seems. Amazing rulebook, one of the best I have ever read.  The gameplay is a bit chaotic with unpredictable events happening all the time. Some people might not like this. I say just sit back and enjoy the ride! The components could be better though... 

Update: The card driven nature of this game starts to hit on my nerves. I find it pathetic that I have to pass for 2 or even 3 turns because I dont have a Move or a Fire card. I lowered my rating and traded this game. Conflict of Heroes is way better.

RATING: 10
The best squad-level wargame. And all expansions are good.
This is actually the best game in my collection.

I've been searching for the perfect game of tactical combat and Combat Commander is the closest I got from finding perfection.

Things I like about CC:

1. Easy rules. It takes 4 or 5 plays for you to internalize them all. But after that, you don't forget them anymore;
2. You can't do everything anytime you want. The card driven order and action mechanisms allow for some command confusion in the heat of battle, and that is a big plus in my book;
3. The random effects and events. I love them, for they will assure that no game will be equal to the last;
4. Immense variety of (beautiful) maps and (well designed) scenarios;
5. It really tells a story.

Better than... Tide of Iron, Lock'n'Load, ASLSK, Conflict of Heroes, Sergeants, Heroes of Normandie.

A freaking Masterpiece.

Pretty good.  Not a huge fan of the card-driven system here, as it makes things kind of unrealistic (inability to fire when the enemy is RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU).  No tanks, which isn't necessarily bad.  

Components look nice, and rules are easy to read, but sometimes it's just not enjoyable to play a game of hand management when you'd rather be playing a game about war.

RATING: 6
I think it hardly fair to rate this game after playing a single scenario, from a teacher, without having read the rules myself.  I think I've experienced enough to know that it's probably not for me.  I actually enjoyed the game deck, compared to other card-activated games like M44 and the like (which I tend to dislike).  Still strongly prefer area attacks/movement rather than LOS, and still feel - perhaps amusingly - that Axis & Allies miniatures is easily my favorite of the LOS lot that I've experienced.  I'd read up and give it another go sometime, though, just in case. Update after a second play: still like, but don't love. Impressive ability to jump right in and "layer" complexity. Love the deck-does-it-all mechanics. Units are just flat for me, though, especially the lack of differentiation with things like armor. Leader activation also a bit of a drag. Still happy enough to revisit.

+ Nice production. Big maps, big chits, nice cards. I don't like the result, but I can't deny this is a creative design.
- It's much more of a cardgame than a wargame. Yes, I understand it's supposed to be representing "the chaos" in battle, but there are much better mechanics available in other games. It's a perfect example of the worse card-driven wargames can be, with all the randomness and lack of control. 
When I found myself using cardgame tricks such as exhausting decks while paying close to no attention to what was happening on the board, I realized I have no interest in what this game offers.

Despite ostensibly well-written rules, I find them to be too terse. Perhaps I'm just too new to war gaming and jaded by excellent rules such as Conflict of Heroes. The rulebook worked very well for looking things up (though not always expediently, as you'd have to follow a chain of 8 references for an answer), but I feel like it's too concise and succinct.

Gameplay overall is interesting; the abstraction of the various mechanics into card draws is clever, if a bit frustrating, from time to time.

RATING: 8.25
Bit of a tricky sucker to get into....almost as confusing as the original Up Front rulebook. But if you've played ASL and UF you'll get this pretty quickly, and have a wild time playing.

I'm bemused by some of the detractors comments on this one...I've been playing ASL and Up Front for over 20 yrs, so can see the pedigree in this one...sure, there are at times a series of absolutely crazy events and situations that occur and as a player it may seem that you have limited control over what is going on...but read some small unit action reports and see just how much control a platoon commander had on what was going on around him. It's not better or worse than ASL, it's simply a different game and I enjoy playing it on a regular basis, but for me ASL is the ultimate WW2 small unit game.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating after 2 plays. What I like about the game is that is that it is light enought that you can learn the game and become good at it without having to own the game and spend hours learning it.  This is a game that a non wargamer could learn and become proficient at it in an afternoon.  The game flows smoothly and rapidly, you do not spend a lot of time looking combat results up on tables.  Much meatier than Memoir, but lighter that most wargames.  A wargamer may decry the game, and no, it isn't ASL, but then again it wasn't meant to be.  

It doesn't and shouldn't have tanks, despite the repeated requests.  That would horribly break a fine playing system.  If you'd like you can mimic the effect by saying the enemy assault gun is just sitting off the edge of the board out of range, and it slowly picks your side to pieces, just like round after round of artillery fire will do.

I think that a lot of people are going to be burning the the scenarios pretty quickly.  I can see small expansions or third party maps and/or scenario kits, the same as ASL.  I'm not sure what the replayability will be after you've played each scenario a half dozen times.

Like most wargames only really playable with 2.  Solitaire suitability medium.

The best tactical game in the business. Any wargame that tells a story like this is ingenious. 

Lots of pieces, lots of details, but you get lost in the moment, not the rulebook.

RATING: 9
The first time I played this game I didn't enjoy it, because some situations can develop where you can literaly do nothing, and it can be very frustrating (both my opponent and I spent some minutes just looking at each other and discarding, looking for cards that we could use); further plays have shown more variability and I've come to enjoy the game much more. The huge amount of scenarios available is a big plus.

The cards are a very interesting and innovative mechanic, contributing to fog of war and adding cool events and battlefield chaos. But they also mean that sometimes luck can play a big role. The game can be very fun and engaging when things are flowing well. Sometimes, however, the cards simply refuse to come out and then the best that can be said about it is that it's very frustrating. Fortunately the scenarios are short enough that you can simply give up and start over.

Strangely enough, I discovered that it actually plays well solo. Against an opponent, having him waltzing back and forth across open ground right in front of my heavy machine gun position, while there's nothing I can do about it because in 25 cards I didn't get a single fire card, is deeply infuriating; playing solo it's all happily part of the narrative, which is by far the strongest point about this game.

Excellent game with emphasis on the fun factor over strategic depth.  Lots of crazy chaos which can often be mitigated by careful card play.

Update: Dropped my rating after around 12 games, my main issue is the game is too long and tedious for something with this much chaos and randomness.  If it were a 45 minute game with less card shuffling, CC:E would be a classic.  As it stands, what we have is a game which sometimes has the randomness of Command and Colors:Ancients but takes 3 times as long to play with rules which are 20 times as complicated.  If I want to play a WW2 tactical game which takes 1.5-3 hours I know ASL Starter Kit will better reward the time it takes to learn the system and study the tactics.

Mivel a Dominant Species számomra az egyik legjobb eurogém, sokat vártam a szerző leghíresebb wargame-jétől. Éveken át várta a szekrényben, hogy kipróbáljuk, de csak most szántam rá magam. Pedig így utólag annyira nem vészes a szabálya, és elolvasva még inkább pozitív várakozással néztem a játék elé.

A legegyszerűbb küldetést próbáltuk, és 2 óra alatt ment le, a szabálymagyarázat szerintem nem volt több fél óránál, mivel ebben a küldetésben még a tüzérség nem jut szerephez (a tüzérségi akciók kicsit komplexebbek, de azok se vészesek).

Pozitívumok: nagyon sok olyan ötlet van benne, ami tetszett. A legjobb a nyilvános és titkos célok megoldása, Eurokból jól ismert játékvégi célkártyák mintájára, de valahogy itt letisztultabban jelenik meg. Konkrétan arról van szó, hogy 5 objektum van a pályán, amiknek a birtoklásáért pont járhat, de a legtöbb pályán nincs teljes információnk arról, melyikért mennyi jár. Néhány egyéb szabálymódosítás is lehet a célok közt (pl. több pont jár a megölt egységekért). A másik ami tetszett, az az egyik játékvégi feltétel egyedi megoldása a time jelzővel. A kártyapaklik pedig itt végre nem 55 kártyából állnak:) És a többfunkciósság ellenére sincsenek túlbonyolítva a lapok. A kockadobás is a kártyákkal van szimulálva (ez is jó) és a 4 féle speciális dolog (pl. mesterlövész, time jelző léptetés...) bekövetkezése is  működik. Sok játéknál látom azt, hogy a nagy újrajátszhatóság érdekében csomó kieget kiadnak és olyan modulokkal pakolják tele, amik biztosítják a sokszínűséget. Nos itt szinte végtelen parti lehet, mert a 100+ féle térképhez nem csak a gyári kiegekben kiadott küldetések állnak rendelkezésre, hanem generálni is lehet külöböző kezdéseket. (Tudom, hogy ez wargame-eknél nem egyedi, de ez azok közé a wargame-ek közé tartozik, amikhez irtó sok pályát és kieget kiadtak. Ennek oka gondolom az, hogy nem 100 km-es léptékű és éveken át tartó háború zajlik egy partiban, hanem párszáz méteres terepen küzdünk végig és az időtáv is rövid, így a világháború akár minden napjából lehet keresni egy csatát, és így lehet újabb és újabb pályákat kiadni. Ez a játékcsalád ezt a lehetőséget maradéktalanul ki is aknázza. Egy kicsit a Memoirhoz hasonlít ebből a szempontból.)

És ezek fényében tudom is mondani az egyetlen nagy negatívumot, ami végül is nem is a játék hibája: nem lesz kivel játszanom. Most felkészültem belőle, játszottam vele egyet, de az ellenfelem nem nagyon esett hanyatt tőle, és 1-1 alkalmat leszámítva mást se fogok tudni leültetni hozzá... Állandó partner híján meg annyira nem könnyű azért, és a 600+ jelölőjével, 20+ oldalas szabályával nem az a játék, amit bármikor előveszek, még ha néha kapható is lenne rá valaki. Így annak ellenére, hogy a játékot szinte egyáltalán nem ismertük ki, a többszáz közül a legkönnyebb pályát próbltuk, pusztán néhány fajta egységet megismerve, szégyenszemre el fogom adni. Azért a legtöbb Euronál néhány játék elég arra, hogy kipróbálja az ember a teljes játékot, lássa az összes kártyát, minden szabállyal találkozzon. Itt tucatnyi játék kellett volna csak az alapdoboz küldetéseihez.

Ráadásul, ha már wargame-ezni szeretnék, van pár olyan, aminek sokkal előbb nekiülök(C&C, War of the ring).

Összefoglalva: szerintem jó játék, de sajnos ez ráérős nyugdíjasaknak való szöszmötöléssel jár, csak annak ajánlom, akinek kevés játéka van, és rá tudja szánni az időt hogy rácuppanjon, van partnere, akivel akár heti/havi rendszerességgel játszhatják. Azért pl. egy Paths of gloryhoz képest mindenképp könnyednek számít, tehát egy nap alatt simán le lehet nyomni belőle 2-3 partit is. Hajrá!

Majd egyszer valamikor talán újra próbálkozom ha több időm lesz:) Tuti hogy ez még 20 év múlva is kapható lesz, elég meghatározó a maga műfajában.

Awesome! The demands this game places on you in terms of riding out the random storm that rages through the battles it depicts are frustrating and addictive at the same time!

RATING: 8
Quite enjoyable, time just flies by while playing it. Thematically similar to Up Front, but with interesting randomness and details handled via action and events instead of lots of rules. You get a nice narrative flow via (comparitively) simple events.

With this and CC:M and the first Expansion, I doubt I'll run out of gameplay anytime soon. The only real downside is the learning curve and transport requirements.

Solid WWII tactical game with card driven mechanics.  I love how the cards make the action pool smaller yet doesn't make the decision process trivial.  It is nice and smooth.  The turns between players are so fast that it feels like a fencing match.  Also the fact that the game has a typical length of 1.5 hours, you can actually play this in one and have another if you want.  Rating is based on 2 plays.
Initial Rating: 8

UPDATE: 12/27/06
I am playing/learning this with my wife and we are both loving it.  This game is consuming me.  This is all I think off and all I want to play right now.  This game just hits the perfect spot for me.  It is the right complexity that I can teach the game in 10 minutes (thanks to the cards) but still so much to take into consideration and the hand management decisions are very cool.  If you are a busy person with a few hours at night to kill and want a high energyand  smooth game, this is it.  You can actually finish it that same night, compared to other tactical WWII games out there.  Perfect combination of game length, complexity, depth and events. 
Upgrading: 8 -> 9.

UPDATE: 1/13/07
Well, there is no denying it.  After playing the game 20 times in less than a month, I am addicted and loving every minute of it.  I gave the game an endearing nickname: CC-Combat Crack.  This is the best warGAME system I have ever played.  This game is just so much fun to play. My very first 10.

As for my taste it has a good balance between strategy and luck. Random events add some flavor to the game. On the other hand, it happens that some of the plays are not as enjoyable as others especially when the game drags too much or when you're on the receving end of strings of bad luck.

hmm. I didn't like it much. I wouldn't mind more rules for a more realistic feel, but these rules just didn't stick well with me. There is the restricting element of card driven wargames,and although I didn't find it disturbing in memoir 44,it bothered me here. Perhaps a hand limit of 6 cards? anyway,maybe I need another try, since everybody else seems to enjoy it much.

I love Jensen's Dominant Species, and I enjoy the concept behind Urban Sprawl. Of course Combat Commander is quite a different game...

CC:E is a squad-level tactical wargame, with a simple card-driven mechanic, that wonderfully simulates the randomness and craziness of the battlefield.

Chad Jensen packed everything needed in each deck of cards: orders, events, dice rolls, machine guns' jams... The design is so neat and clever that even non-wargamers can pick it up quite fast!

CC:E is not a game for control freaks! Sometimes a random sniper shot or event can swing a scenario, and other times a lucky shot can make the difference between victory or defeat. But the game is tense and fun, in a "you can feel the battle in your guts way"!

Can't wait to play it again!

I am not good at remembering wargame rules exceptions, but can imagine how good this one would be with someone fluent with the rules...

there is a very small jump from this one to ASL starter kit. all the rules are basically the same, except that here the actions happen if you have the right card, while in ASL the same actions just happen every turn in a set order.

Initial Impression: This is a wonderfully crafted squad-based tactical game.

After several weeks of pretty intensive play (at least for me) I can now make a better assessment of this game. It's like the kettle corn of wargaming. Entertaining and rather addictive, but ultimately not completely filling. The variability of the card system gives it a certain just-one-more-turn quality akin to a pulp sci-fi page-turner. Quite often the system works well. Sometimes it doesn't. I rarely finish a game feeling that I’ve ‘simulated’ much of anything – but I nearly always feel like I’ve played a quality game.

My only complaint is the rulebook. It isn't laid out very well. A lot of questions will arise.

Bought at Tin Soldier closing down sale.

After 1 play:
Coming from ASL it's hard to like this game. The cards produce some really wacky behaviours - walking wounded in particular, Smoke doesn't dissipate for turn after turn and then goes right when you need it. Snipers are either irrelevant or devastating. The out and out randomness is a real turn off, not because it's "unrealistic" (an irrelevant consideration) but because it either feels like a distraction from the game or it impacts it oddly - this unit is a veteran, suddenly you have five more units when you just want the game to end etc.

For all the self-appointed pro players' assurances that hand management will make this next problem go away, I can't really get into the order system with such a small hand. You often need two move and two fire cards to do what you want to do, and you have between 4 and 6 cards. Not good odds, considering the other 7 types of card in the deck. It means long turns of nothing except drawing, which can be devastating if your opponent keeps drawing fire cards and you're in their range. A hand size of 7-10 seems more appropriate at first blush.

The end result was gameplay that felt clunky and unrefined. But I'll certainly give it another go to see if it gets better after a few plays.

The production values, on the other hand, are through the roof. I especially like the tracking sheet - open,e asy to read, easy to navigate and update. The maps are pretty good, too, and the counters are amazing.

You can see ASL in this game's lineage, from borowed terms to borrowed mechanics. There are parts of the game quite clearly put into it to avoid the rules overhead or complexity of ASL - the devastatingly deadly melee rules, for example, or the artillery or sniper rules. A big part of my problem is that I really like the way all of those rules play in ASL, so ultimately the rules overhead is worth it in my case. This game will never hit the table if I have the option of ASL, but givent he difficulty of getting others interested in ASL there is a place for this on my collection.

After 2 plays:

OK, I'm beginning to feel the hype. Once you get the rules down and start to understand how it all flows, it's really pretty good. I still really dislike anything with a random hex - it feels ridiculous. But the mroale and FP systems are good, Artillery is greatly streamlined over ASL (a good thing) and I'm even starting not to miss tanks. After a couple more games I'll rank this one, but I"m thinking around an 8.

After 5 plays: We were getting a LOT of rules wrong, and now I'm really beginning to get it - each unit only being allowed to activate once (the main rule we'd missed) really mixes things up and lessens the impact of not getting what you want in a given draw. Fixing that rule suddenly means it feels like each turn is only a few seconds, rather than along, drawn-out deckbuilding slugfest. Getting CC:M has also added a lot of replayability to the game. Looking forward to trying out some platoon-sized random scenarios.

I will say that I don't like the lack of memory that the game has - walking wounded and random-hex blazes are good examples - ASL is complex because it remembers EVERYTHING you do, which takes time. CC:E remembers nothing - not where units were when they died, not where your shells fall, not who moved last turn... It makes for a very odd game at times, and I'll never really get over that.

EDIT: ASL is climbing in my personal esteem again, and CC:E is being edged out - the main thing that has turned me off it is the realisation that leaders stack morale bonuses, so invincible kill stacks are too easy to construct. This sort of thing makes it all a bit boring. While I can see the point to keeping this in my collection to play when a non-ASL player wants a fast WW2 tactical game, I would happily trade it away to get some shelf space back - I really only need one WWII tactical and ASL is it.

Finally got to play this.  The rules weren't bad once we sat down to crank through it.  It seems to build upon itsself and it's easy to find a reference to what you need.

Gameplay?  Well, it scratchs my itch for a war game.  I was never enamored by Mem 44.  This is more complex but surprisingly easy to get into the swing of.  I like the squad level this game is at.  It gives me a much more clear pic of what is happening which gets me into it further.  Going to play this sooner than later to drive home the core rules.  I see this going up in rating.

RATING: 10
This game is incredible. The gameplay is fast and provides amazing mental imagery of the action taking place. Don't let the hand management naysayers fool you, a good general will always have something he can do even if it means dropping a few/most of his or her hand to find a certain needed card. The 12 base game scenarios alone provide tons of replay value when you consider two sides are available for play in each one as well as random objective counters. Different objective counters will provide impetus to incorporate differing strategies into each game as well as change the importance of the five objective spaces on each of the twelve maps. Add to this the fact that there is a random scenario generation system, as well as another big box expansion and battle packs to provide addional nations, maps and scenarios and you have something nearing infinite replayability.

A complete game system with infinite replayability.  Each scenario plays out differently each time.  CC feels more like a war movie than a war simulation.  Players try their best to form a strategy but usually gets thrown out the window when the first event card is played.  The fun comes in managing the chaos that ensues.

RATING: 7
Solid, squad-level WWII wargame. Does an excellent job of creating a detailed, tactical combat narrative (story) without the necessity of learning and correctly implementing equally detailed rules found in nearly all other squad-level wargames. Play time will vary for players depending on how much of the rules set that they can grasp. That is, players familiar with the concepts found in Squad Leader, Up Front, and Ambush! should warm to this game and play should move quickly. Players not so familair (or rusty from long absence, like me) may take a bit more time to find their groove. I think, with practice, games should finish in about two hours. Still slow for players that enjoy most euros or battle games like Memoir '44, but a reasonably fast and action-packed two hours for genuine wargamers. 

The price for playing a game where a lot of the detail is handled by a (IMO, superlative) set of Fate Decks is "control": control over your units and the things that happen to them. And if you are a wargamer who thinks that the actions and events generated by the Fate Decks in this game are true to your understanding of WWII warfare, you will probably enjoy that a lot of fiddly detail is taken off your shoulders. But if you don't think that the Fate Decks do a good job of recreating the events you read about in after-action reports and the like, then the game may come across as a tedious card-pulling excercise. 

For all the detail in the Fate Decks, however, the battlefield narrative feels a bit lacking in some respects. For example: there are no vehicles--of any kind--in the game. Not even lowly horsecarts, trucks, or jeeps. Ironically, there are airplanes buzzing overhead that make fleeting and potentially painful appearances. And there is off-board artillery (which are probably being pulled by the missing horse-carts, jeeps, and trucks) that will thunder in when called. Such a lack is not necessarily "wrong" from a game standpoint, but it does feel a bit odd to move down roads that have no vehicles (not even as the detritus of war) and into and past houses that shelter no people. In this respect, it has some of the alien feel of a first-person shooter or other 3-D TacSim computer game. It's just you, the bad guys, and your weapons. 

Overall, my impression is favorable. It's nice to get a meaty Squad Leader fix without also learning a ream of rules and dedicating a long afternoon or evening to play.

Fantastic Game! Like the tenseness of not knowing when to best play a card and not knowing what card your opponent may have just waiting for you. The ebb and flow of the game was fun with one side taking the lead and then through Events the underdog came back to sway the VPs their way. Simple game with lots of future depth and expansions. Compares equally to Conflict of Heroes and I almost see no difference between the two games. I'll play this anytime.

Even though I'm not a great fan of tactical games (prefer strategic level), this game is great. It feels like a mix of Memoir'44 and Squad Leader, you control squads but with a card-driven engine. There are 12 scenarios, but they are quite replayable because of all the random events that crop up no game seems to play the same.

I thought the lack of geomorphic maps would be a bit of a limitation - but having 12 specific maps is great, especially like that LOS is the actual line traced so you can fire between buildings etc

The game can be a bit of a culture shock for wargamers used to a more structured form - you can't always move all your units, you can't always fire. You have to hold the right cards, so part of the game (like Memoir'44) is managing your hand, getting the right cards to launch your assault. It's also possible to make a reckless move and pull it off, if your opponent is lacking in fire cards. Get your head around the system and it works great.

Only downside for me is it's currently limited to just German, US and Russian forces (need the expansion to add in the Axis minor allies, Italians, Brits)

I like the game, but I have two complaints:
- It can feel static at times when no side has the cards to get into a more favourable position (This is probably very realistic, but annoying anyway).
- There are no bigger battles than the 15x10 hexes. At 30m per hex this gives you 300mx450m to fight over. Once again this makes sense for a pure infantry game, but gaining 200 meters of ground in 2 hours of playtime can be frustrating.
I want to like this even more, but maybe combat in WW2 on this scale is not 100% my cup of tee.
Anyway, very elegant design, it just would be nice to see in a more dynamic situation.

Edit: After playing a bit of ASL starter my Admiration for the design elegance increases...

It's like watching Saving Private Ryan. The narrative of this bg is awesome.

Squad based WWII game that is very dynamic.  It is totally different than any other war game I have played.  The first time playing it you appreciate the sudden changes to momentum and also to initiative.  There are some great write ups on tactics for this game in GMTs magazine C3i.

The various scenarios seemto have some nice potential for future plays.

Dec 2013--Awesome game even though fate totally screwed me...(broke two medium machine guns, took out one of two leaders, randomly broke  2 units that were forced then to rout....gave the opponent a Unit with a leader... I loved it whilst losing....Thats a good game) :)

You have a map which provided the classic feel of a hex/counter game however the cards can completely help, or completely hurt.  Some players might be intimidated by the luck factor of the dice rolls.

(3 plays) This game has a huge amount of randomness. There's nothing wrong with randomness at all, as long as the game is short enough to allow for another play when Lady Luck hadn't been too benevolent, but this game is simply too long for this level of randomness. Nevertheless it is not without any fun and I could be talked into it again, but given the choice I would rather play "Up Front" instead.

RATING: 4.5
Rating based on one game (intro scenario).  I really wanted to like this game, but it suffers from card paralysis even more than Memoir '44.  I'd say that a good 25% of our turns were hand purges.  [rant] Seriously, why can you not give your guys an initial order like, "If there's nobody in the fuel dump that we're trying to take, go grab the empty building"?  But no, instead you have to hope that you draw at least one move card.  I also don't understand why you can't just tell your guys, "Hey, if somebody starts shooting at you, and they're in range, SHOOT BACK!"  I understand the idea that it's not always possible to give your guys perfect orders, but it seems crazy to assume a complete lack of survival instincts -- it's not like there's an option of hiding from the enemy or a need to conserve ammo or anything.  [/rant]  In any case, whatever real-life situation they were trying to simulate, it didn't make for a very satisfying game for me.

RATING: 8
Not often i purchase a new wargame that has "unique" methods, sometimes a game will have one but more often than not it'll be nothing new. So i'm fairly blown away by the design of this game, hat off to Mr. Jensen for packing the box with unique features. It's a phenomenal blend of card/hex/counter combat with a monstrous dash of events and randomness, if any game can lay claim to simulating Murphy's Law then it's this one. I been waiting many years to recapture the gaming fun i had with Squad leader and i have more than found it with Combat commander ( a long wait and many systems between). If you in any way enjoy tactical gaming you MUST play this game, i could not recommend this game enough, buy it, try it, fry it and eat it...it's that good!

Update...Dropped half a point for lack of tanks. Hey and it's not like i didn't battle the point with Mr.Jensen.

I didn't like this at first.  It is very chaotic and it seems your decisions don't matter so much.  I actually got angry playing it.  But one day something changed - I relaxed and realized that this is the whole point of the game.  It is simulating company command and a commander is never in control of everything and all knowing.  How well you adapt to changing situations generally defines how well you will do.  Just keep in mind this is not chess, some games you will lose no matter what you do.  But no other game will take you on a ride like this!

CC:E was the first real wargame I ever played.  For quite a while I'd sworn off wargames - too complex, too much die-rolling, and too much conflict.  Well, we finally got to a point where we needed more complexity in our games, and having exhausted most of the heavier Euros, we decided on this one after I'd been taught it elsewhere.  We wanted the experience of Memoir, with more grit and control, and CC delivers in spades.

What do I like best about CC?  The fact that you have to work to win.  It feels like war - you're angling for any advantage you can get.  I love the way the deck works, as both a timer, a random number generator, and as the main action mechanism.  The rules, while robust, are also fairly straightforward, easy to learn, and ensconced in a great, easy to reference rulebook.  The game has many scenarios, and I like that there are multiple paths to victory every time.  Plus, the random scenario generator is so much more than just random scenarios - it basically lets you craft a homebrew scenario for almost any theater and/or mode of combat.  

Having played and enjoyed both this and SoS, the edge goes to CC.  Why?  It just feels the most "real."  It simulates the chaos of combat better than any game I've played, and you feel connected to your men in a way you don't in more abstracted wargames.  If you have an interest in WWII and simulations based thereon, CC:E will certainly satisfy.

UPDATE: While I think the core ideas in Combat Commander are interesting, after playing it half-a-dozen times it just failed to inspire me at all. The not-quite-functional morale system, the ineffectiveness and awkwardness of firepower, the overwhelming chaos of the random events, but above all, the frequently tedious pace of the game combine to weigh Combat Commander down heavily. It's now on my "to liquidate" pile, which irritates me, because a) I bought it, and b) it's yet another expensive GMT game with huge promise that just can't deliver on its potential. GMT's lineup now seems to consist largely of this sort of game. 
---
So I've ended up playing CC:E half-a-dozen times now, and I'm still not quite sure what to make of it. It's a very odd design. For a simple game, the rules are baroque and bizzarely-presented, and there is still just too much junk in the system. Each deck has like 15 rout cards in it, but their application is so rare that it's kinda weird (in my games, they are usually played just to clear a card knowing nothing could possibly happen). Rally rolls are frequently automatic or nearly so. Even when you have lots of firepower you usually end up making many low-odds attacks due to the way the system heavily penalizes large firegroups. Doing anything requires far too many steps; the fire combat system - the core of the game - is tedious, especially in light of how infrequently it generates results (random events seem more frequent than effective fire). And the truly bizzare (and suspension-of-disbelief breaking) happens with too much regularity; CC:E makes Up Front seem like a hard simulation (in a recent 2.5 hour game, my German assault force suffered no losses at all to enemy fire, but had two squads eliminated by random event). And oh yeah, it seems like the scenarios might have some balance issues.

It's still kind of a fun game for what it is, though, although a bit too long for what you get out of it (not surprising in light of the above comments, probably). But the current high rating shows how much standards have fallen in wargames since the old AH quit the field and many wargamers defected to eurogames.

CC:E definitely feels, to me, like most recent GMT games. It's done by a first-time design team with apparently minimal development support. It feels like there are great ideas in there, but it also feels like it needed an experienced hand to guide it along, to file off a bunch of the rough edges, to get the pacing and play time of the game right, to manage the production elements to make sure the package wasn't too expensive, and to and to generally really turn the screws on the whole thing. CC:E is definitely OK and at least some fun, but it could possibly have actually been a *great* game with a strong and experienced developer; as it is, it's pretty far from there. I think the designer would have been better advised to try to aim for a smaller game and to get it right.

There are few games that I've obsessed about as much as I have this one and, even though I've played it only a handful of times, I can't imagine anything better.

I am an ASL player and initially thought CC:E would be a great game to introduce Eurogamers and wargame newbies to tactical WWII games. I couldn't be further wrong. 

CC:E is a very luck-dependent game. It is basically a card game with a board and cardboard counters to give it the grognard look. The card game mechanics basically involve playing one or two cards per turn and discarding cards in turns where your hand is crap and waiting for a good combos to use all in one turn. Getting the combos does not mean your intended actions will succeed, if your opoonent has the right card to counter your action. Imagine several turns of card discards and finally getting the combos required and doing some damage to the opponent's pieces, then the opponent shows a counter effect card which negates your actions.

The shooting mechanics, card response mechanics (to counter the other player's actions) and random event mechanics all contribute to what should be Up Front with a board, but, instead, resulting in a frustrating, chaotic, luck-dependent game enough to put newbies off wargames. You'd be better off playing M'44 with newbies. there is either something inherently wrong with CC:E's card mechanism, or there is something wrong with the mix of cards per say. The gameplay is terribly unexciting.

As for grognards, they will probably rather play ASL, or ATS, or anything less luck-dependent and chaotic. 

Update: Downgraded from 5 to 3.

The game did not have sufficient advantages over Up Front or Squad Leader for me. I expected a less process-heavy system and all that calculating made for a game that was longer than I had expected. The randomising produces a good narrative but a less than satisfying game because of the imbalance. Units seemed far too hard to kill. You hit them, they'd not break, or if they broke they'd then recover. It needed a little more incident.

Great game! Lots of chaos and a great cross between tactical and hand management. There do seem to be a lot of tactical factors to learn for such a "simple game". 
Card play- Easy- move or fire or do what the card says
Extra actions- very nice. good decision making between using the event or the action. Tough decisions
Tactical considerations- Seems to be a bit heavy as far as equipping units and leaders etc but it works well in the game
Dice rolling in the cards- COOL!
TIME!- Pain in the ass at times
Artillery- Randomness is always a nailbiter

RATING: 6
I'm not normally into tactical games, despite my general interest in wargames. Computer tactical wargames, such as Combat Mission, simply do such a superior job at solving the problems that are inherent to the genre that tactical board games just don't interest me. 

Tactical board games always make the mistake of either avoiding any attempt to solve these problems, ending up being too "gamey" and lacking too much in simulation (e.g., Memoir '44) or they try too hard to solve these problems in a misguided attempt to match the level of simulation that only a computer can acheive (e.g., ASL).

But Combat Commander strikes me as a reasonable balance between "game" and "simulation" for a light wargame. True, you get a few anomolies, like sometimes being unable to fire at troops in the open for lack of any "Fire" command cards, but it may actually have fewer major anomolies than ASL and its ilk in some cases. ASL seem to me to focus too much on physics (which way is the wind blowing? How hard? Looks like your smoke is clearing) and not enough on fundamentals such as command and control, schwerpunkt, fog of war (missing from Combat Commander as well), simultaneous movement, etc. But Combat Commander at least tries to solve some of these as best a light war game probably can. Overall, its a decent beer & pretzels game that's about on par with Command & Color: Ancients.

UPDATE: Played Up Front and found it to be the superior game. You would think that adding a map would be an improvement but, surprisingly, it isn't. Adding the map takes what is otherwise a good card game and a reasonable simulation (given that so much is abstracted) and breaks both, turning it into a nonsensical luck fest in comparison.

UPDATE: I've decided that CC is not only too random  but that it is random in such a way that it hurts CC both in terms of compelling game play and in terms of depicting realistic results. Sold.

Acquired, opened, but not played.  Just didn't get around to it, and with the introduction of the Band of Brothers series, now I won't devote the time.  Based on my experience with other tactical-level, WWII infantry games:

For a game about command-and-control of an infantry company, play Fields of Fire.

For a card-driven game about fog-of-war, play Up Front.

For a streamlined, fast-playing game about fire-and-movement, play Band of Brothers (Screaming Eagles, Ghost Panzer, etc.).

Of course, for nth-degree detail, and the best simulation of a WWII movie, play Advance Squad Leader.

System seems to err too much on the side of randomness and chaos for my liking, given the game's length. Defender frequently has little to do other than fire, recover, and play rout cards on the enemy, which takes little thought. More cut crystal than diamond.

Very intense!  Like Squad Leader, but with less control (which is, perhaps, more realistic ... )  The many variables in the game can make for wildly different dynamics from one game to the next, even when playing the same scenario.

Combat Commander is something that was on my radar screen as a good first "serious" wargame. Also in this group, I'd include C&C: Ancients, Tide of Iron, and Conflict of Heroes.

So far, I'm inclined to say I'm slightly more intrigued in those other titles. I played the defender in my first CC:E scenario, and I found the cards more frustrating than a fun challenge. It's hard to sit there and not have a card to fire back, and simply dumping your hand on a turn to give yourself better options just seemed... not so fun.

I'd try it again, but my inclination is to explore those other titles first.

RATING: 10
This game brings the tactical level combat game of Squad Leader to a manageable level that is fairly easy to learn and a blast to play. Some complain that there is too much luck and not enough pure control involved. However, I imagine that this is more like what battle is really like. You have to plan to the best of your ability and then roll with the options that are given to you.  The excitement of recent scenarios I have played has pushed this to a 10.

RATING: 2
three plays 2 player

Combines the best/worst of card driven - hand management games into the traditional WWII tactical combat space.  It's an interesting and innovative mix.  No more or less "realistic" than other games in the genre, but more dramatic than the SL/ASL take.

On the down side, there is a learning curve, and you can find yourself discarding again and again trying to get the cards you need.  It is not a quick game, in fact it could be described as overly long for the payoff.  The rule complexity remains considerable - it has simply been distributed between the rulebook, half a dozen player aides and the cards.

Contrary to what I've read, one can apply and must apply sound tactical principals and methods to do well ... but you do so within the confines of the card driven system.  So for example, if you're defending you want to be sure to keep "Fire" cards in your hand so you'll be able to ops fire.  At the same time, it is artificial that a unit needs such a card to Ops fire at all ... but every game has abstractions.

Update after two more plays.  CC:E seems to be forcing the card driven mechanic on us so that one never fully suspends their disbelief that it's all just a game.  I suspect this title appeals to fans of card games, but not those who are looking for reasonable historical accuracy.

What is it about squad level games that keeps me from getting engaged? I like them, but I don't love them. I was looking forward to this one as being a more immersive game than Conflict of Heroes. But all the random events just felt - well - random. Still entertaining, though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game.  It doesn't 'feel' like a wargame to me, as there is too much outside of your control, or modeled by the cards.  As an example, a benefit to firing at a moving target and/or an adjacent target is not built into the system but rather simulated with certain cards.  If you don't have the right card, you don't get a bonus for shooting at a squad across open ground.  That just feels wrong.

Still, there is a certain rush you get from flipping so many cards so fast (there are events and 'die rolls' galore in this game).

My initial impressions are very positive.  I really like the narrative that develops from this game.  For some reason I thought it would be in the same complexity range as Memoir '44, but it isn't.  It's much more approaching the complexity of the ASLSK series.  However, I had a much easier time with the rules for CC than I did for ASLSK, which is nice.  Some of that might be just maturation as a wargamer, but I don't think the price of entry is quite as high for CC as for ASLSK.  And what you give up in detail you gain in slightly quicker, more intuitive play.  I think both ASLSK and CC are great games, but I found CC to be a little more streamlined, which is nice since I only play wargames sporadically, so it's slightly easier to pick up.

1. Design - solid counters, beautiful cards, nice maps (big hexes)
2. Card Driven Game without dice rolls - dice rolls are printed on cards :) have doubts - is this a realistic simulation of tactical warfare. Too many events from the sky, strange melee resolve when fight is a tie (both sides are eliminated simultaneously).
3. Play - fast and lots of fun. Big dissapoitment - no vehicles (remember - this is a WW2, when vehicles are all over battlefields). No explanation for that

:tobacco::(:DMy experience with this title consists of two games of Scenario #1, so I speak from the highest authority on Combat Commander, much the same way that someone who's rifled through the SparkNotes to Merchant of Venice is an authority on English lit. That said, reasoned judgement born of long experience is for wankers. So.

Much as I generally love wargames, wargames at the tactical level have always been in a dubious cool-in-theory/annoying-in-practice place in my mind, not helped by the fact that there seems to have historically been a "how much baroque complexity can we stuff into this package" contest amongst designers of tactical games on the one hand, and fun-enough-but-hardly-groundbreaking stuff like Memoir '44 on the opposite pole. The search for the happy medium brought me belatedly to Combat Commander.

That's 'bout right.

Start with the design -- what we have here is a rock-solid set of rules aided and abetted by a rock-solid manual. I'm still hazy on some rules but the ease with which I found answers in the book leaves me with more of a sense than usual that any rules mistakes I'm making are my damn fault. Let us now praise famously well-written manuals! And one suspects that it's no coincidence that another rules-heavy game by the same designer has a similarly airtight rulebook. But this one leaves even Dominant Species' book in the dust, in part because it's rising to an even greater challenge of complexity, and in part because it neatly balances disarming chattiness that reduces the angst of absorbing said complexity with actually having the information you need where you need it. In my last game, I had to look something up 6-7 times, and each time the question I was asking was unambiguously answered in the first place I looked.

To me, the card play (as nutso as it makes people who feel a not-unrealistic sense of entitlement to move all their dudes every time it's their turn) makes the game work very well as a game. It has an underappreciated simulation value as well -- on top of requiring players to manage events and strike a difficult balance between managing the risk of holding back and waiting for the perfect hand vs. the risk of pulling off an imperfect maneuver and possibly getting reduced to kibble by those entrenched, it also conveys the desired tone of battlefield chaos, and it also neatly addresses (albeit in an abstract way) a big problem with this sort of game, which is to say: fog of war. You can see where everyone is all the time -- in a 30,000 foot grand strategic game like Virgin Queen, the answer is, you know, who cares, of course you know where people are. In a game like this, where ambushes and uncertainties are the name of the game, the inherent limitations of a single central map and pieces that must be moved around means that the uncertainty has to come from somewhere. The cards make that work.

Another thing: this game is not (usually) a simple matter of marching guys up to shooting range and plugging away at each other. Killing enemy troops is [i]hard[/i], unless they're standing in the middle of a field picking their noses, and you're unlikely to get such a blessing unless your opponent has had a lousy run of cards. You've got to build a hand that can really make a difference. If you're simply playing an Order, or even two Orders in your turn, you're likely to be faffing around. What you want is SICK CARD COMBOS BRAH. Orders combined with Actions, that's where you start making a real difference. And that means building a hand, which means there's some turns where you're just discarding and hoping to get what you really want.

I am increasingly pleased with this as a game; there's real layers that I've only just started to pull back, and there's a ton to explore in this box.

RATING: 10
A very fun game.  While it has some unpredictable elements, I like the system immensely.  I question the "realism" of the game, but then again, in actions this small, anything really could happen.  It also gives one hope, even if you're losing badly.  This game is a keeper, and I plan on purchasing the expansions as well.

UPDATE 06/29/10: After over a year since my last comments above, I am falling for this game more and more.  The "realism" aspect has been defended by at least one military officer with small unit combat command experience.  I have been taking my time learning the game, playing through the base game scenarios first.  I am currently on Bonfire of the NKVD, having played the Russians.  I will play the German side in this scenario next.  It appears that the attacker has a longer learning curve in this game - both I and my opponents seem to have a tougher time winning scenarios as the attacker.

UPDATE: 11/29/10: I am upgrading my rating for this game.  It's definitely one of my favorite games to play.  Thanks, Chad and Kai!

Fantastic effort from Chad, Kai and GMT.  Congratulations, you really hit this one out of the park.  It's like Up Front, Squad Leader and Ambush put into a supercollider, done up with superb art and put in a nicely decorated box (best wargame box art in a long time imo).  Short concise and wonderfully indexed rules make it easy to learn and a smooth system make it easy to play.  Very narrative as it plays out as well and seems very well balanced. Amazing amount of replayability due to varying objecives and random scenario generator.

Seven plays so far and this game could well end up as my first 10.

Played several scenarios face to face and have loved each one of them.  The game is a blast to play!  There is a lot going on: events, Snipers, reinforcements, etc.!  12 maps and the ability to "roll your own scenario" provides virtually unlimited replay-ability.  This is one of the rare war games that you can sit down and teach a newbie or non-wargamer and still have a great time.  The support for this game in the forums and on ConSimWorld by the designer and others has also been fantastic! Highly recommended.

Great game in a small package (I'm talking about the amount of rules!)  Plays fast and loose (sometimes with reality) but these are good qualities in a game.  

It's certainly more detailed then ASL, and in some ways not as realistic but I'm not sure there is much of a difference.  While ASL has more detail, CC:E has better fog of war and a better 'command and control' simulation.  Both great games, now if CC:E only had some tanks I think it might be my favorite.  As it is, it's too close to call.

RATING: 10
Fired all other WW2 tactical games for me. Creates a great narrative, has solid mechanisms, rear infinite replayability, a great rulebook and a manageable playing time. To enjoy CC, one needs to immerse oneself in the game, and see mechanisms like the random events and card draw luck for what they really are, a way to represent the uncertainty of war. Luck and chaos play a substantial role, it is war after all, but a skilled player will beat a non-skilled one nine out of ten times. 

A staple of any wargamer's collection.

Combat Commander is a very fun system...and easy to get into. I haven't figured out the best way to store my components yet, for easiest set-up, so that part can feel a bit fiddly. However, I'm happy with the quality of those components.

I was surprised at how high the luck factor was in this game. I like that there are multiple endgame triggers, and multiple ways that time can advance (often unpredictably), which really ratchets up the tension in a close game. Also, I love the way events can change the complexion of a single game by introducing new objectives, bringing in reinforcements, etc.

This game creates a fabulous narrative. Its really fun to watch the way the game unwinds. I also enjoy the hand/deck management. It translates well to the CDG system. Again, I was a bit surprised to see how wide the swings of luck can be. Since playing a particular scenario can be fairly quick, this is tolerable. After just a few plays, I was convinced to order the expansion. I look forward to lots of plays here.

BEWARE: this comments are made after just three games, so handle with care.
I found CC e nice game with great production values (except the card quality that is very bad). I love UP Front so I had some expectation on CC, unfortunately the game has a strange feeling. Some things are quite sophisticated (the cards and all chaos elements thrown in) while others are almost childish (the rigid stacking limits, the deployment, the melee). I certainly have to play more but I don't agree with all the hype about this game. I'll advise everybody interested in tactical WWII to wait for the dust to settle before buying it.
In the end I think the this game will appeal to those people who like to "be played" by the game, those of you interested in "playing the game" should stay healty away.

COMBAT COMMANDER is an exceptionally well-done game that yes, does capture some of the cardplay elements of UP FRONT while adding a more specific sense of physical space, time, and scale.  The game uses cards for everything- orders, actions, events, and even die rolls- and I think that by and large the system works pretty well and allows for some interesting narrative and drama.  At first I thought some things were a little odd, like wire popping up out of nowhere but it makes sense when you think about the scale and how your men might just run into some wire they didn't expect before they advanced.  There is "chaos", whatever that means within a very strict system of rules, but it's very controlled and navigable when it occurs.  I think the game does run a little long per scenario but it could just be due to the "newbie" factor and ultimately I can't see it replacing UP FRONT as my game of choice for this type of game and I strongly suspect that TIDE OF IRON might steal a lot of its thunder in much the same way that BATTLELORE stole C&C:A's.  COMBAT COMMANDER is definitely close to greatness though- the production is really outstanding (although WAY overpriced at $80 retail)and it's an accessible and exciting game that I'd definitely like to see expanded upon and developed further- the game sorely needs armor!

Really fun, light squad-level combat game.  This is much better than ASL for a "regular game" for me.  I'm enjoying the ASL Starter Kits, but they are more for soloing at my own pace.

It's OK, but not something I'm going to buy.  To much luck for me, which is not the same as "chaos of battle" that everyone says it has -- I particularly get turned off by the way victory conditions can change through the random introduction of objectives.  And the Op/Fire is just way to powerful -- unless, that is, you're not lucky enough to have a Fire card to play...

RATING: 6
Suffers from not being ASL.  SOLD

Update:  Rating is going down to a 7, possibly a 6.  I still enjoy this game, but the cardplay, at times, just feels like a broken mechanic.  When I spend the entire first half of the game (maybe less), dumping my hand to get a simple Move card, something is wrong.  I played the Germans in the last round I played, and I am sorry, they weren't that confused of an army.  The card mechanic needs some sort of tweak.  Two players, playing 2 different powers, shouldn't spend the first half of any game, not able to move troop and funcion competently.  I can't imagine the furstration level that would come with playing France where I can only dump 1 card at time.

Although far more accesible and simpler than ASL, ASL its not.  this game was inspired by ASL, that I can tell, but give me ASL any day over this one.  I will continue to play this one, but I hope the cardplay stops being a hinderance to the game.  I don't mind the idea of confusion in the game, but it shouldn't last as long as it often does in CC.

(2 plays).  This is a good squad level game.  It mixed both wargame and a mix of "euro-ness" to it.  At times the cards become quite frustrating when you have cards but still cannot do a single thing.  The game length is a tad random, the events even moreso, but if you are looking for a bridge between Memoir '44 and ASL, this is the game for you.

Traded for 'Funkenschlag EnBW' together with 'Corps Command: Totensonntag'.

Okay, after having played this one seriously three times now, I am willing to make a judgement. Let me preface this by saying that I never was a big fan of tactical wargames (no ASL-background). I have always preferred grand-scale operational or strategic wargaming. 

CC is relatively easy to lern and features an excellently written rulebook. CC does an excellent job at simulating battlefield command and confusion. No game of CC will ever be the same due to the effects of friction on the battlefield. I love it that the game does put you right in the role of the battlefield commander that has to make the best out of whatever cards he is dealt with (literally!).

Update: Upped from 8 to 9. I currently wanna play this all the time!

Update: It is one of those 10 games for me, that's for sure. As a two-player game, I will NEVER turn this down if I have the time!

The chaos element of fate cards creates a great narrative, seems more realistic to me than having perfect knowledge and control, and keeps the game from pretending to be something no warGAME could ever be: a uber-realistic simulation that recreates every little detail as some war games attempt to do with ludicrous amounts of acronyms and rules exceptions and hundreds of pages of rules. Rule book is fantastic and concise (per the usual GMT quality components). I love how the objectives for each scenario are semi-random so no scenario will likely play the same twice and I love the random events that occur in the battle that alter the scene. Great great game! I enjoy ASL, on a starter kit level, and I really like elements of the streamlined Band of Brothers line, and this is another great game with its own flavor.

this is not a wargame. This is a frustrating card driven game in which everything you do depends on your hand of cards. For simulating the chaos of war they say. I understand and know that wars are not a mathematical ecuation. I love wargames, but can t understand all the hype of this game. You will have many situations when all you do will be discarding and drawing cards in hope that the one order that you need will appear. Where is the simulation when a squad is frozen in the middle of the road for whole turns (and nothing happens to them because the fire order will be succesful rarely) or when it advances adjacent to an enemy unit but again stays there for whole turns just because you don t have that dam order in your hand. In this game your focus is not on the map and what is happening there, but solely on your frustrating hand of cards. Every time I play a wargame I forget about the passing time because it gets so involving; in CC, I even felt bored. Now I understand why many wargamers hate this overhyped game.

I had a fantastic time familiarizing myself with the rules throughout my first play of the game with the Fat Lipke scenario.  The hand-management, events and triggers made the battlefield come to life and felt like a part of a larger conflict.

It is too complicated if you compare it to Company of Heroes and the narrative does not come through as it should with this kind of system. And modern infantry combat is better shown in Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles.

This is a very, very good game! Only two plays so far, but hoping to get a game in tonight. I have lots of games I am waiting to play--but I am glad to have bumped this one to the front of the list. WWII, Squad level combat, fairly simple rules, great graphics, card driven, expandable....what is not to like? 

Changed rating after a year, although very good, more luck than ASL.

Biggest concern is how much needs to be learned and remembered, for a game that carefully stays out of the details, yet still manages to occasionally leave a player at the mercy of his hand, which is not dissimilar to playing M'44.  After playing it some more, I've concluded that the strong "narrative" element everyone ballyhoos about in this game goes a little too far towards the [i]deus ex machina[/i] end of the spectrum, in my opinion.  I still enjoy playing it, but don't put much credence in the end result, and how much it has to do with small-unit tactics, vs. how much it has to do with how good you are at playing this game.

Love this game!!!  As a long-time ASL'er, I was always challenged to keep up with the rules and it started to become a chore when I was unable to play consistently.  I was introduced to Combat Commander via my local gaming group and am now hooked!  It has the tactical level action I like, along with replayability at a level I never saw in ASL.  Control-freak types won't care for the random events, but to me, this is part of the "storytelling" that I like as a scenario evolves.  The rules are simple enough that you can win over new players - something harder to do in ASL even with ASLSK....

I really wanted to like this....but I never could. It's not the card driven mechanic, because "having the right card" is key to one of my favorite games (C&C Ancients), but more that the particular implementation in Combat Commander just didn't ever "flow". I had the game for a year, played it several times face to face and several more solo, but it just never grabbed me. Traded it away, and it will hopefully find a home with one of the many gamers who love the system.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Combat Commander produces an excellent narrative, story-driven game every time I've played it. It is my favourite tactical WW2 wargame.

Why is it considered good? I think that Combat Commander is an example of a traditional tactical-level WW2 hex-and-counter wargame that manages to recreate fog of war through its innovative and perfectly balanced card-driven mechanic, reminiscent of Up Front. 

Many will complain the cards add too much randomness, but to my mind, this is one of the few ways that tactical WW2 wargames can most effectively implement fog-of-war and the chaos of a WW2 battlefield as well as can be expected in a hex-and-chit wargame. And far better a card-driven fog-of-war and friction than a 10,000 foot general who can make his cardboard chits do his bidding without question, or know precisely the odds of his forces being able to accomplish something like rallying when suppressed. 

Combat Commander forces you to adapt to the moment, to accept chaos and unpredictable events, and to simply seize and exploit unexpected opportunities on the battlefield better than your opponent.

The cards in Combat Commander aren't there to create a barrier to action, they simply introduce elements on a battlefield that are true to the era and genre. 

A squad that turns a corner and runs into barbed wire, a hidden minefield in front of the main defenders line, reinforcements appearing, stray rounds setting a building on fire, weapons breaking and getting repaired, the ammo runner who never shows up ... these are all things that are nothing unexpected in a game trying to recreate tactical combat, and always add a source of narrative, delight and fun, even when that wire or minefield is played on you. Mark Buetow says that this sort of thing "... strikes an ideal balance of playability, surprise, and visceral excitement." Yes, it does.

Events unfold on the battlefield as they should, and the gameplay will create a great narrative every time. Combat Commander effectively compresses platoon- and company-sized engagements, and the chaos, heroism and events that may have lasted half a day or more in 1944, into a two-hour session of elegant, fun gameplay. Impossible things happen like they did. Units can't fire effectively at a hero dashing across a field to take out a MG nest or two? Some complain that not having a fire card makes no sense, why can't my machine gun fire at that lone hero dashing across an open field ... and yet, that's how my father-in-law won his Cross of Valour. That it can occasionally happen in this game makes perfect sense because it did happen. The game produces realistic results through one of the best design for effect systems ever made for this scale of wargaming. Combat Commander provides "narrative realism" with ease, and offers players a simple but nicely implemented system to differentiate national doctrines and unit capabilities through the decks of cards that are built to be specific to different nations.

I also equate the lack of a fire card in your hand to the enemy successfully concealing himself in the terrain while moving.

The rules? GMT has produced what are, arguably, one of the genre's finest examples of clarity and simplicity. There is an ebb and flow to the game, and it plays so fast and smoothly it's a joy. Did I mention that Chad Jensen's rules are one of the best examples of wargaming rules ever written? The Random Scenario Generator is fantastic and offers Combat Commander fans infinite replayability.

Obviously, the game borrows from, and is inspired by, some of Up Front's elements which is both a good and bad thing for some war gamers (though some of what UF does simply can not get translated well to any game that uses a fixed map), but the spirit of amazing fun remains. Combat Commander creates a fantastic narrative and the system provides for a wide range of theatres and forces. Combat Commander has become, without question, the singular tactical level WW2 wargame I deeply enjoy playing.

Oh, yes ... no tanks? At the map scale that Combat Commander reproduces, and in these scenarios, I love that this game is bold enough to be just infantry. I prefer it, in fact. There are other good games that model the map distances needed for pure tank tactics if you're after armoured action at a tactical scale.

Any aspects of Combat Commander that I forgive because the game is otherwise brilliant? Four things:

1) There isn't any real focus on realistic command and control (outside of what the nation-specific card decks represent). But the only game at this scale that does was designed to be that: Fields of Fire. 
2) Morale and suppression are still the two-state model of broken or "eliminated" we've been using since the 1970s. 
3) Players do not need to use proper WW2 squad-level tactics to play well. 
4) You can play movement cards in excess of your nation's legal card discard limits by using these to move individual units out of, then right back into, cover. Like ASL skulking, this is perfectly legal but intentionally distorts the intent of the discard rules, and is patently gamey and silly to my mind.

Those minor points aside I still feel that Combat Commander is a brilliantly designed, simple-to-teach, fun-to-play, WW2 tactical wargame that offers an excellent narrative representation of WWII tactical combat.  

Despite being a long-time ASL player "back in the day", I personally find the "lack of the card I need" in Combat Commander versus the gamey loopholes and odd mechanics any good ASL player can exploit to be an entirely acceptable compromise. Tactical WWII wargamers should read Mark Herman's brilliant essay on why CDGs offer, in many cases, the best solution to countering perfect battlefield knowledge:

"Having the ability to survive and even prosper with a bad hand requires new skills beyond the ability to count hexes and calculate combat ratios. The ability to deceive your opponent by making an unusual play that brings fear and consterna- tion to your opponent brings the com- manders skills of bluff and deception to the forefront. CDGs bring uncertainty to the equation in such a manner that the ability to gain advantage by confusing your opponent becomes the game, just as it is in real warfare.

Where the CDG takes a new path is the player does not know what his opponent can do with those forces and where he intends to act." 

This I like. A lot. It represents exactly what real-world commanders have had to face in combat.

RATING: 1
As a wargame, this title falls flat on it's face with absurd events and erratic and random gameplay. However, it does do something interesting: it makes euro-gamers 'think' they're playing a real wargame. It has the look of a wargame (counters and maps), but all the detail and tough decision-making have been rolled up into a deck of cards. For those who are cowed by making tough decisons - draw a card instead. For those willing to spend time after the game trying to rationalize it's events - sit right down and play. For those who feel that this game accurately represents the chaos of the WWII battlefield, I suggest you give electric football a try (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/7584) - a similar title boasting an equally accurate depiction of the chaos that occurs on a professional football field.

The best of the infantry tactics games I have played. The more I play it, the more I love it. Once you get the hang of the "wait-for-it" play it really shines.  The events mean that it is full of surprises and tension. Endlessly replayable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
If you want a game that models the chaos of combat at the squad level and value tension/excitement/story, this is your baby. If you need to have absolute control over how your units move (which is about as far from reality as it gets), this is not the game for you. An elegant design with a very complete ruleset (read the rules literally and you'll find the answer every time), great components, and with fantastic potential for expansion and design-your-own scenarios. Chad and Kai Jensen have hit one out of the park.

Rated 9.5 for now because I've only played five times. If I'm still as excited about the game after another five plays, it's going straight to a 10.

Lowered to 8.5 because of the tendency of the game to go pear-shaped at strange moments. This is a puzzle game rather than a story game, and each scenario teaches you different doctrinal lessons. Me, I liked the story part better.

Back up to a 9. Games have tended to be more interesting with people who play "correctly" and I've had several really fun games recently.

Rating based on some soloplays. Tactical wargames have never appealed to me, so I never tried one. But with all the buzz, I couldn't resist buying it during a local fair. 

Well, my first contact with a tactical wargame is ambiguous. I didn't know it could be so intense to fight over a barn. But somehow I miss the big picture.

Components: no complaints.
Gameplay: tense, but feels a bit artificial (and random).

So decided to let the game go - off to a better place.

Buen juego de combate táctico ambientando en la II Guerra Mundial. Cuenta con una mecánica de motor de cartas muy depurada que proporciona una sensación de inmersión realmente lograda, muy tenso por momentos.

Aunque sólo he tenido oportunidad de jugar los cuatro primeros escenarios, es un juego que promete.

Felt like this game was playing me, rather than me playing a game. Unlike other CDGs, I felt too restricted with the cards, spending most of the game discarding and waiting for that near-perfect hand in order to make a move. Similar tedium I feel when playing Dominion. Lots of handling cards and shuffling. 

Perhaps other scenarios are better than the first one, but I have no desire to find out.

A bit more luck and limitation than I like in tactical simulation kinds of games, but it does have a fairly short play-time and the lack of "psychic troops" going for it in that you can't always move or fire when you want to due to the limited imposed by the cards in hand. Pretty fun and with a solid chunk of skill for a fairly light game.

After 1 play (not counting going through the demo game) I really like it.  It has a similar feel to Tide of Iron but is much quicker to get to the table (only 10-15 minutes to set up versus a good hour!)  I like the "die roll" mechanism because it is controlled luck.  There is definitely a learning curve and a lot of "counting" involved but all in all I think this will hit the table a lot here.

RATING: 8
Very fast-moving, extremely easy-to-learn card-driven tactical wargame.  An excellent choice as a gateway game for someone just getting interested in hex & counter wargames, both due to the simplicity of the rules (I taught it to a complete non-gamer in 15 minutes) and the fact that the amount of abstraction and reliance on card draws narrows (but does not eliminate) any skill gap between players.  The abstractions and cardplay may turn off players looking for a serious simulation.

See my review for more info.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Definitely a step up from Memoir '44, without devolving into the complexity of ASL. It's entirely card driven, though with plenty of chaos, too. You either embrace it or you don't. Fortunately for me, I was able to embrace it. The local squad level, card driven movement and attack mechanics make much more sense for this game than they ever did for C&C: Ancients.

The playing time is relatively short, there are lots of scenarios, you can learn the rulebook in stages, and there are lots of expansions to suit your tastes.

Update: after a few more plays, slight drop in rating. Partly this is because I've played more tactical WW2 squad level games since my original rating, and I've decided that I prefer stuff like [i]Conflict of Heroes[/i] or [i]Band of Brothers[/i] over this, as too much can hinge on the cards. Still, it's a good game and I'm happy to play someone else's copy from time to time.

This game really scratches my Squad Leader itch fantastically. The card play means it feels less controlled and more prone to luck than Squad Leader - a trait it shares with Up Front.

Good stuff!

Rating may go up, but it felt like you could get screwed multiple turns in a row with bad card draws and there is nothing you can do about it; it's one thing to have cards that are not great but still useful, but you can easily get stuck with a handful of cards which are totally useless.  Some sort of mulligan rule for the first turn is probably a good idea as well.

Paul and I just wrapped up our first game of Combat Commander: Europe this past Saturday, April 1st. We opted for the 'Varsity Blues' scenario, and it proved to be a good choice. It gave us a solid sense of the game, without it being overwhelming. I would say it delivers as advertised: an easy to learn, squad-based tactical wargame that delivers a strong narrative while offering a tenuous, fun-til-the-last-moment gameplay experience. It's early, but I already feel like I'm falling for this one.

Combat Commander is a great game.  It's designed well, and plays fairly quickly.  My only problem is that it's a wargame (duh!), and I'm not very good at them.  So, it's not the game, it's me.

Well, I've given in and tried this several times now.  I have to admit that it has won me over.  More than that, it's actually convinced me to come out of the footlocker and proclaim to the world that YES, I am (at the very least  a casual) war gamer, and I'm proud of it!

This has never stopped being a great game for me, but Nations at War:White Star Rising  is getting more play than this one, so I traded it away.

Does a good job of representing the 'fog-of-war' and the uncertainties of command of the battlefield. It plays like a cinematic fire-fight and is more accessible than full ASL although it does have a couple of issues and I would still play ASL in preference for a number of reasons:-

- Luck and random factors play too much of a part in deciding the outcome. There are multiple layers of luck: do you have the right cards to take an action you want? does your opponent?; if you fire there is still the luck of a pulled dice roll; plus the layer of random events that can descend.....the latter are a big deal....
- .....they can be fun, and add to the chaos of war feel, but can be very random and game winners or losers, over which the players have no control.
- The system is just not as flexible as ASL, or capable of scaling up or down as well.
- Not as epic in the tales it tells as ASL
- No vehicles
- It's even more gamey and although it's gamey elements all fit together well and some may regard them as plusses, if you are hand managing and cycling a deck to end the game, the illusion of tactical combat is inevitably somewhat dispelled.


It's still a lot of fun and a terrific bit of game design - particular mention should go to  the VP objective mechanism which is very good, as is the attempt to reflect national command and control capabilities by the variable nationality fate decks .

Wow!

I expected to be disappointed considering all the hype, but finally got around to playing this 10 times over a gaming retreat weekend (Jan 2008)and it's great!

As an early participant in Bruce Wigdor's Internet Up Front League. I'm a big fan of Up Front, but I must say that, as a tabletop game, CC:E is a much slicker product.

This game appears to have been an excellent development effort on top of a great design. Well done everyone involved!

It's a bit too "wargame-ish" (detailed rules, line of sight etc...) for your casual Eurogamer, but for the large number of people who like both wargames and "heavy" Euros it's a "must have" game.

Highly recommended.

Update: October 2008 - moved rating up from 9.5 to 10. Perhaps my favourite wargame of all time.

I had a hard time with the rules. I'm not sure why. The organisation of them is near-perfect when you're looking something up.  But somehow that was (for me) counter-intuitive to actually learning the game.

That aside - I think this game is exceptional. The scenario generator is robust, providing almost limitless potential. Yes, there is randomness, chaos, plus those paralysingly useless card draws - but I happen to like that! The game is in many ways an exercise in controlling or avoiding those elements as they happen.

Not that impressed after the first few games. It's not a bad game, far from it actually, but the cards lock you down too much. If you're the defender with only a 4 card hand this is especially true.

Not faster or simpler enough over ASL to be worth all the sacrifices.  I thought the card system would make it play fast and exciting, but it just plays like ASL except with no tanks and not being able to control all of your troops.  Great production quality though.  I wish ASL maps were that size.

Update 4-2: Other WW2 games have since come out with higher production values, so this doesn't even have that going for it.  This game just doesn't work since your ability to preform basic actions is just out of your control.  "Walk forward two spaces."  "No."  That's just not a game.

Played a pretty simple scenario with the game ending all of a sudden.  Didn't feel like there was much to this game but certainly willing to give it another chance.  The cards are a neat mechanic to incorporate events but maybe dice and CRT is just easier and more streamlined.

Squad level World War 2 wargame.  Players are ... I guess platoon or battalion leaders sending their squads into action.  Players use cards to issue orders to units, which are carried out.  Orders may allow more cards to be played as actions, which enhance or respond to orders.  Units are leaders, squads and teams that are moved across the map.  As well as actions and orders, the cards are used to roll dice which can trigger various game functions (time advancement, events, etc).  Victory is points driven, and granted by holding objectives (which can be worth variable amounts of points), exiting your opponents map edge, and eliminating enemy units.  Nice game, lavish production from GMT, with the ability to play the US, German and Soviets.  The first scenario is a bit vanilla, but an excellent introduction.  The next couple offer tense and well balanced games.  A very nicely put together tactical system, with a strong emphasis on fun and narrative over realism.  Simple to pick up and play, offering some really touch choices via the card management issues, with clear and very well developed rules.  Excellent game (yes, "game"), but grognards stuck in the 80's will have a conniption.

My favourite company level wargame series. Huge replay value, simple to play, difficult to master, balanced and rewards good play.  I especially love the narrative that shines through each engagement. Uncertainty and chaos add to the drama -  OCDs and statisticians stay away.

Only out-done by CC:Pacific   IMO

I was very excited about the release of a new card-driven tactical game. But several major faults prevent me from liking this game. The game tries to use cards and leaders to simulate command and control limitations, yet even the most unwieldy of Russian recruits are very responsive. Having veterans just means fewer squads, not better command. 

The second major issue is that it fails use hand management effectively. Small hand sizes mean that dumb luck is more important than smart play. Up Front also used small hand size but often both players spent turns cycling cards. In Up Front both players are struggling at all times! 
 
However this game is a huge step forward in reducing the impenetrable wargame rulebooks. The designer took a page from CCG's and put the details on the cards! All of these chaotic details are elegantly handled via the event system and these succeed at adding a lot of flavor. The fun and elegance of this make this attractive to many new players, and I expect for most it will replace Squad Leader, ASL, Lock & Load, and similar games. 
 
Also, the designer did an amazing job with maps, play aids, and rules. So despite the fact it is a GMT game we found none of the glaring errors that have long plagued most of GMT's shoddy productions.

Good system that is a bit difficult to learn, but rapidly becomes simple after that.   Has a lot of the feel of a miniatures game, with LOS, terrain, cover, attack and defense rolls.   The main innovation here is the use of Orders and Actions on the cards, with the Events and Dice Rolls also coming from card flips.   Works better than I would have expected.   The scenarios have a good narrative arc to them when played out, and that helps the game too.   Fun stuff, looking forward to playing a lot more of this.

Finally own another wargame after my Conflict of Heroes series. A little expensive but a friend said the cost is part of the historical research. Game has paper maps therefore I plan to get a plexi-glass. Squad counters are a little small and way thinner than CoH.

A wargame that I'm looking forward to playing and mastering. Bought the game after watching few scenario videos, which I think are nice especially how the combat works

The Combat Commander series may be the greatest war game system I've ever played.  Now I've been playing since 1970s and I've lots of systems, but this system just knocks play out of the park.  When I retire in a few years, this and Pacific are games I'm going to keep.  If you want to play solitaire, try StukaJoes CDG (card drive games) solitaire system - it works great with these games.  To learn about the game check out Harsh Rules: Board Game Tutorials on YouTube.com.

Back the GMT P500 system if the game is currently out of print.  You have lots of games that still need to be played - so give those some table time (love) while you wait. :-)

Card driven hex based WWII strategy game. Cards determine possible actions, random events, chance of success, and targeting opportunities. Cards determine everything, but there's so much room for calculated, efficient game play. The narrative of each game is so eventful, it may take some time to understand everything the game has to offer, but it is a great exercise between experienced players.

60-120m with 2 experienced players. 30+ plays.

2017-08-28 : First play. Sometimes you come across a game-system where all you really want to say is that it's a bloody neat game. I had my doubts before playing it because I love to chuck dice but the card system here simply works. I love how it allows events to happen at the best and worst of times, how it forces players to think on their feet and take a chance .. or not. The litmus test of every tactical wargame is always : does what happens in front of my eyes look and feels realistic - and the answer in an emphatic yes. Some people complain about not being able to opportunity fire at everything that pokes its nose out from behind a tree but that's just how it was : an enemy is not spotted in time, or just for 1 second while crossing a street and you're too late to react, or you're low on ammo or distracted by the firefight to your left or a hundred other things. War is managed chaos - and those that can manage it best will do well at this game.

Chad Jensen has reinvented Avalon Hill's "Squad Leader" game, considered by many the gem of the tactical infantry combat genre, with an elegant simplicity.  This game is faster, and easier to learn and than Squad Leader, but, IMHO, sacrifices substantial realism and historical accuracy.  Card-driven mechanic seems to generate irrational results, like failure to fire on nearby enemy troops moving in the open.  Further, the game does not treat vehicles, which is a serious drawback in the opinion of this writer.  IMHO, the game's somewhat abstact scenarios detract from historical flavor. Recommended for players looking for a somewhat abstracted game of WWII infantry combat that can be learned, setup, played and put away in three hours.

CC:E is a valiant attempt at creating a simple squad-level wargame but though it may look like a wargame but IMO, it's not. Or at least, this is about as a wargame as Memoir '44 - whatever CC:E may be simulating, it's not WWII squad-level combat. The game revolves around decision-making that doesn't put the player into a commander's shoes at all. It comes across mostly as a hand-management game than a squad-level tactics game. 

Uneven card mix is a serious issue. Some cards are just completely useless in some scenarios, which leads me to question the rigor of scenario design as well. And the right card at the right time can be seriously advantageous for a player who had up till then been outplayed by his opponent.

Overall, it feels at times like a badly-designed Euro game with a pasted-on theme - so incongruous is the game to what it is purportedly simulating.

The core mechanism is order cards that one gets randomly from their own deck. You don't know what orders your opponent has or which ones you'll get next turn, so you're always feeling vulnerable. You might not be able to do something effectively or even at all if you don’t have the right cards. The result is both good (the tension of the uncertainty) and bad (a lot of hand cycling where you’re both fishing your respective decks for cards to move or fire). 

The game is supposedly inspired by Up Front which is the game I’d prefer to play before this one. Perhaps after I explore Up Front I’ll revisit this one and appreciate what the design is going for.

Despite some of the incredible chaos and friction and wackiness regarding the tactical card play, this is a rollicking fun game and game system.  There are some who can't stand this for a variety of reasons (no AFVs, for example) but I'm not one of them...it's a very good introduction into board wargaming at this scale and definitely keeps a high degree of tension and excitement throughout.  If games are sometimes blowouts, they are so short you can simply start over again.

What a great game. Fast enough that my teen doesn't lose interest. Complicated enough (although really rather simple) to feel immersive. After learning the rules and playing the first scenario, he wanted to play again immediately (we did).

To me the other big contenders out there feel clinical and chess-like in comparison.

Based on 35 plays:
+ The game tells interesting infantry combat stories, co-authored by the players. It happens that I like those stories, even when I lose.
+ "Sudden death" prevents a game from ending with absurdity. This would be a great addition to many games.
+ Excellent rulebook -- best I have seen.
+ The Initiative card is brilliant!
+ Once the players become familiar with the rules, the game is fast-paced.
> The game mechanics contain a lot of randomness. Yet, I believe that a skillful player outperforms a novice single-handedly.
> Haven't tried the random scenario editor yet.
> There is so much to play that I have not even played the expansions yet.
- Hand management aspect causes some frustration, as always: lack of control and unability to execute a chosen strategy.

Updated 9->10 in 2011 after 35 plays. After playing the game this much and still having all the expansions untouched, I see no reason why this game would ever fail me.

Well, MultiMan Publishing, eat your heart out.  You sat all these years on the Up Front game reprint and now we have an alternative.  A fast, easy to learn and highly replayable alternative.  While the game is not perfect, it is a whole lot of fun.  And people: we have a rules index!!!  This is one learning curve I will gladly hike.

Note to GMT: in this day and age of digital printing presses and high quality specialized papers and cardboards, it is completely unacceptable to deliver a subpar product.  The die cutting seems to be the exact same one used by SPI and Avalon Hill way back when.  Half my counters were off-centered and I had to use scissors again to clip the annoying little bits at the corners, all the while wondering how come I had to pay more for this game than the top notch Phalanx products.  Plus, I know I have more expense coming my way as the cards definitely have to sleeved if they are to suffer the punishment that's coming to them.  I will play this game a heck of lot, but I'm not a fully satisfied customer.  There is no reason that the components can't be better than this.

Update: 25 games thus far and I've yet to be bored.  Outstanding and now a staple of my gaming time.

Latest update:  I like it fine, but Up Front has more tension in the hand management because fire attacks are more lethal, especially at close range.  CCE makes you use Advance cards and melee combat to get anything done.  Bumping firepower stats would improve the tension in CCE, as it is it's not too frightening to venture out into the open with your squads...  This game borrows so much of the card play from Up Front that it's hard not to compare the two.

[1 play] Like every tactical WWII game I've ever played, it suffers from the all to frequent scenario of running to the best position, sticking your thumb up your ass, and hoping for good rolls/card draws before you have all that much to think about.  In the end, it's this time "hoping" that doesn't do it for me in these games.  I want more time spent making things happen and less time waiting for them to happen.  Still, the cards can tell a pretty decent story, and from that perspective the game is great, though overshadowed by Up Front in my mind.

First impressions are very good.  A lot better game than I was expecting.  It is really immersive and the combat abstractions really do work here.

I can't wait to play more of this.

May even go up to a 10 after some more plays. My first real incursion into wargames (light as it is) except for Twilight Struggle, and it's really great. Intense tactical decisions to take.  Love the rush of an advance order. Feels like war (in a good cinematic way). The variety that scenarii and events bring is also really nice and well balanced. Like Blood Bowl in its style, this one strikes the right balance for me between luck and skill. It also feels pretty deep and I hope to play it again soon.

RATING: 4
This is a CDG version of Squad Leader, with touches of Hannibal. It does have its moments occasionally: it's simple and can be fast playing, with plenty of scenarios and top flight components, but its cards are much, much too restrictive, which can result in frustrating stoppages. Now, this is completely understandable in many situations, such as when organizing a charge over open ground, but not at all in others. For example, in a typical game you might find elite German paratroopers defending a stone house overlooking a road. Now, I understand that getting green Russian troops to charge down the road might take some doing, but should it also take the same effort to get the Germans to conduct opportunity fire, or the Russians to find cover? In this game the answer is yes. Without further orders the conscripts simply stop walking and just stand around in the open taking fire until ordered to hide. But, on the other hand, without orders (that you probably don't have and therefore can't give) the Germans might only look out the window and not do a thing as the Soviets saunter by.  

  In other words, it's not unusual for nothing to happen in the most critical situations for the rest of the game or - if you are really lucky - until the right card shows up. This could have been avoided by having each card be a default "dig-in" or "op fire" card (after all, how hard can it be to get elite troops to return fire when attacked), but instead we've been given a somewhat disjointed and occasionally aggravating experience. So, if you can overlook these flaws in the name of "realism" so-called then this game might work for you. Although, why people insist on thinking this game's strength is its "realism" when it does not take into account the effect of distance on accuracy, or the effect of self-preservation on decision making or the effect of troop quality on melee is beyond me. 

Bottom Line: If you like Card Driven Games, if you like tactical World War II games, if you like games with much more than their fair share of randomness and if you are not high strung then give this game a play. However, I’d strongly suggest that you stay with only those scenarios that allow a large number of cards per hand and a large number of discards because if you ever have to play a 4 or 5 card hand with a 1 card order or discard limit there is a better than even chance your head will explode from frustration.

RATING: 6
CC:E clearly does what it sets out to do: create a sort of unpredictable war situation where players establish a plan and hope they can manipulate orders and on-the-fly actions to turn the tide in their favour. Random events also occur, which introduces something missing from many wargames: fate. In that, Jensen has designed a very interesting wargame that is accessible for all types of heavy gamers.  Both games that I played of this were a bit of a let-down. I think we were expecting the card-play element to be much more exciting. Instead, I find the lack of options at times more frustrating than tension-building and the order mechanics not giving anything unique enough to make CC:E stand out for me. I think it's a great game for those who like it, and I don't doubt at all their enjoyment of it. But for my personal tastes, CC:E doesn't create nearly as much tension as the C&C or COH systems, which are medium wargames of the same ilk and two systems I very much enjoy. I'm certain that if we were to play this more we would find the necessary subtleties to bring us through, but I don't feel particularly motivated to explore CC:E when there are a few other games I love much more.

My favourite tactical game of all time.Very tense,great replayability,just the right amount of luck , satisfying historical detail and incredibly fun.I am a big fan of  the  card management it brings to the tactical genre,its dynamic battlefields and its anything-can-happen idiosyncrasy.

RATING: 7
The chaos of the card system makes for interesting game play.  You really have to be able to adjust your plans to allow for the cards that you draw and the random event that happen in game in order to win.  If you can't remain flexible while at the same time keeping sight of the objectives, then you won't do very well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game will take you time to learn how to play your forces effectively.  You have to manage the "anything can happen" aspect. Best laid plans are dashed at contact with the enemy.  Sometimes it is the random event that will get the bogged down forces moving again.

It totally feels like you are playing out a story. A story in which you have some control of the plot.

I'm an old SL grognard. CC:E has chrome, action, thrill and a reasonable playing time. I would say that CC:E has inherited all the pros from SL and in the meanwhile it has solved all its cons. Really a great wargaming experience!

update: raised from 8 to 10 after 5+ plays.

RATING: 6
Far too random to be a good tactics game.  I actually think that many of the mechanics are accurate but there is very little control of the game.  You can rarely do what you want to do on a turn and the end result is usually a maddening mix of chaos and kinda sorta what you want to happen.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is pretty quick for a war game, and it is easier to teach than I would have expected. The swings of fortune can be extreme, but this adds a lot to the excitement and the replay value of the game.
The card-based actions work much better than in Command and Colors games. At the same time, they are simpler and more streamlined than something like Twilight Struggle or Paths of Glory.
I am loving this game more and more as I play. The crazy risks and gambles you can take, only to be butchered by heavy machine gun fire, really lends the game a storytelling aspect that is tons of fun.
Do yourself a favor, even if you aren't a wargamer, and get this game.

Update - Traded. It's still a good game, but hard to get to the table and hard to solo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game almost always creates an enjoyable narrative which is a huge plus for a themed game. The only problem I have with the game is that it sometimes seems like the armies don't have a high enough percentage of move cards as they can have several turns where they cannot make an obvious move - hey how about getting to cover.

RATING: 7
Rating is creeping up... The chaos is somewhat manageable. Culture shock for someone used to moving his squads whenever he wants. I appreciate that this is a squad level game that doesn't require a lifestyle choice. 

-----

I recently updated my rating from a 5, which was too harsh.  This is a fun game that is also fairly easy to get in to.  Text below was my initial assessment:

Gamey.  I found myself wishing there were some sort of protective fire provision that didn't require a fire card.  It just doesn't make sense to me that a squad would let the enemy move adjacent without putting up a fight.  I wonder if an optional rule could be implemented to account for this.  Something like final protective fire in ASL, which comes at a price: the firer must pass a moral check or break.  Yes, this very well could be a "hand management" issue on my part, but is this a game of battlefield tactics or card cycling?  In the end it seems that the game was designed around the card mechanic, with the tactics "shimmed" to fit.

My initial plays were enjoyable enough, but I don't think that I have the rules down yet.  I felt restricted by some of the cards.  Although, if I had a better grasp of the game, I may have utilized the cards more efficiently.  Looking forward to playing some more.

RATING: 2
Reasons for the 2 rating:

a) I absolutely HATE card churning games

b) It takes way too long for what it is.

I'd MUCH rather play Memoir 44 or Conflict of Heroes.

Someone wrote in a forum "Waiting for the right card... priceless" in gushing praise of this.  If that's what you want in a game, then maybe this is for you.  I understand the large random factor in combat and usually enjoy the chaos of a good battle game, but this game is just not that fun or realistic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I bought this game as "the next step" after playing Memoir 44, hoping for more tactical gameplay and lower luck factor.

I'm totaly disappointed and absolutely don't understand why this game has such a good rating.

Good things:
++ Material is of good quality.
++ Very good rulebook.

Bad things:
--- The annoying card-drawing-luck-factor is even bigger than in memoir 44. You are drawing and playing cards like crazy.
-- It seems that the board and the playing pieces are just a bad attempt to spice this card game up.

War games aren't my thing and I am not too into World War II as a theme for a game, but even so I did really enjoy my playing of this.  Lots of great theme in this, and yet not as cumbersome as you would think.  The game comes with a lot, but it still is a little pricey.  Even so, I want it.

RATING: 7
I had some fun with this, there are a lot of rules to digest though (it's not as "simple" as some make it out to be). I find the cards-as-dice mechanism to be fascinating and many of the cards are multi-use so even if you have a bad hand, you can still plan tactically. It's a very good game and I would like to play more to experiment with all of the scenarios. I might like Conflict of Heroes a bit more because it reminds me more of a minis wargame. This did not give me that feeling.

A very good combat game. At first sight I thought it was not my taste with all these counters and chits (I also had quite a lot of troubles with the LOS rules) but thanks to user Arracataflan who teached me trough the nouances and peculiarities of the system in just one afternoon, now I understand it and I really like it. I cant wait to play it more. I love many things in this game, like the hand management, the shift of situations, the existence of chaos and luck and tactics in just a perfect blend... all in all a true gem, and with all the expansions available a game that can last for years before getting repetitive. I got all the expansions for the european line so I wont get Pacific (with all the stuff I have right now I can play it for years without getting tired of it). Components are just ok for the eurogamer but good compared to the standard wargame.

Up Front with a map and counters, but with none of the issues resolved. There is a good game lurking inside, buried in an arcane rulebook and a long playing time. Cards are clunky and much of the game is spent cycling through the deck. Not exactly an exciting proposition. Oh, and hand to hand combat is more powerful than shooting. 

In the end the game plays you more than you play the game.

After numerous plays and reading through all the FAQs and the rulebook extensively, I found the concepts I was playing wrong.  Unfortunately the randomness of the events has completely ruined this one for me. I don't like the reasoning over the sniper (as a representation of battlefield luck) and its associated effect on weapon repairs, or the luck with events (we had 6 veterans in one game show up; come on!)  And the game is too pricey. 

This game has some of the Up Front feel to it, but it is no Up Front.  One of my friends liked it better than Up Front (probably because of the visual aspect).

Very good wargame from Chad Jensen.  There is alot of luck in this game but I love it!  Anything can happen and its unprediclable just like war is.  The story that each play tells can be very satisfying.
I like how each scenario brings a new gameplay element.  There is alot of rules (its my first wargame), if all the weapons and different terrains type were available from the first game that would be very overwhelming for a new player.
I have played the first 5 scenario and I can't wait to try them all.  I also look forward to try the random scenario generator which is something that reminds me of Toe Jam & Earl (one of my favourite video game of all time) that had a similar feature and provided infinite replayability!

Bought it today March 27th 2011.

Can't wait to play it, and rate it. :)

UPDATE

Based on one play. 

I finally tried this. Hum... it is a "meh" for now.

I'm not impressed. I really HOPE that this will become better with future plays, otherwise I'll shoot myself. Damn it!

UPDATE
The "meh" is still there. It seems to me that the scenarios are unbalanced. Yet this game's slightly getting better. 

UPDATE
Ok I think I'm starting to like this game. I'll give it a "7.5".

UPDATE
Ok, I really want to play this, when the occasion arises. So it did feel only natural to bring this one to a solid "8". 

UPDATE
Rating for CC:E always oscillates between 5 (I don't wan't to play this if not convinced) to 8 (wow, nice!). 
I'd really want to see if the campaign system in the Stalingrad module makes things better for me. As for now the lack of tanks is there, I cannot sit and pretend it is not there. The maps are small and cannot be combined like the geomorphic SL maps, this makes everything quite cramped. 
Alas, I don't know what to think! I'm desperately looking for something as good looking, as well supported, as popular as this title. Are there any? Hardly. :(

First play = instant classic.  Back and forth play with fast moving mechanisms.  We did a number of things wrong on our first run through, but we had a blast.  Fun factor makes up for tanks being MIA.

Second play without errors...even better. Command and control (or lack thereof) handled nicely with "Fate" cards.  Speaking of the cards, these cleverly make it easier to play the game because they guide you through the various orders, actions and events.  Players are not constantly looking at charts or having to remember arcane rule exceptions. you can focus on the situation at hand with the added tension of not knowing your opponent's full capability.

Third play...wow.  Great decision points and TENSION before, during and after those decisions!  Still trying to apply other tactical game rules (not an issue with CC, just my brain confusing CC play with ASL doctrine), but I think CC's approach/rules finally registered with me.  10...love to play anytime...win or lose.

RATING: 8
WWII tactical gaming is not an area of special interest for me but I wanted to try something in the genre and CC: Europe was the one I opted for. I really enjoy hand management, narrative and smooth, quick play and this one fit the bill. Played only once so far but I can see already that it delivers on all these fronts and will be a winner with me, particularly as I do a lot of my gaming on Vassal and it has the most fully developed and featured module I've seen for any game.
Edit 11/6/17: I've played all published scenarios solo and really enjoy the game and the narrative it generates. I have no skin in the historical debate that rages around its implementation of command and battlefield chaos. I just enjoy it. I'd like to be able to play it face to face more often, and a lack of local opponent lowers its rating for me, but it works fine as one of my solo indulgences.

CC:E is a very well designed game.  The designer has made intelligent choices in sacrificing the right amount of "simulation/realism" in order to achieve a higher degree of "playability".

The only things that will happen will be the random events, so a squad here and there will get randomly broken and killed. It will be sooooo fun, promise.

I wasn't sure I'd like CC, as I was an ASL addict for many years, and I thought CC would be too light for me.  But I love it!  It's got many of the same decisions as ASL with only a fraction of the rules load.  Plus, my kids love CC and play against me all the time.  Some people might find CC too "random," but that's what I love most about it -- I enjoy seeing a Blaze pop up and spread across the map.  And I like the card-driven mechanic: it simulates the lack of total control of a real commander.  All in all, a great game.

Played twice, no desire of playing ever again. Feels way too random. The Events should go, in my opinion. I don't see the logic behind some of the cards.

CCE has pretty much won me over. It brings a heavy element of battlefield chaos into tactical WW2 war gaming while still keeping the edge in things such as forward planning, fire-and-movement procedures, fire lanes and proper organisation of fire groups. 

The rules deserve a special mention for cleanliness and good design. Most importantly of all, it´s approachable, extremely enjoyable and plays in a short time. Also, replayability is extremely good on this one. My only gripe would be the high price, but then again the components are top notch. 

Who needs tanks when you got well done and thrilling company scale infantry combat?

This is a fun system. In no way does it compare to ASL except on the surface, but that is a good thing. I like the random events that you are forced to deal with. It creates a strong narrative, and all the scenarios I've played tend to be close. The events always seem to balance out too. Because you have to 'roll' to recover a squad, the likelyhood of an event happening is much higher than in Pacific. I also like the fact that this is an easy game to teach. It is hard to master, but easy to learn. Highly recommended!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
What makes CC imho not a good wargame (although it can be called a fun game) is the fact that it is all about events. Most events triggered by your cards have a positive effect. So it is part of the mechanic to act in a way that risking enemy fire is a better choice cause this is the way to draw cards what can cause events.When unit A fires at unit B, B might be uneffected, but unit C breaks, unit D appears, unit E becomes broken, hex xy starts burning, a.s.o.And the mechanics that a unit with a HMG better 'fires twice' instead together, because: 1st we have a higher chance for events and second every supporting unit/weapon adds only 1 FP is also a little odd.

Moreover, no vehicles are used in combat commander.

Update: played again but again, could not see the excitement. Might up/downgrade after more plays.

Gave it another try and this is the last time I have played. Just a brief overview: played the first scenario as Germans. Gave away initiative in order to move into the 10 VP central building before the Russians. The only movement I made throughout the 2,5 hour game. I changed hands 7 times in order to get one recover. None showed up.
My opponent relrolled on the sudden death track as he had initiative so the game continued for another half hour.
30 minutes of stalemate where we were shooting eachother without casualties. Worse, a hero was added...

For me it was a cardlaying only experience of the worst kind with little or no decision making.

I can see why some like this and I admire the game design but it is absolutely not for my tastes. 

Sold it.

First time I tried this game (without having read the rules) I hated it. After trying Pacific and reading the rules for both I gave Europe a second shot. This has turned out to be a really good squad-level wargame. The core mechanics aren't at all hard to grasp, it's a very well-done rulebook. Big time ebb-and-flow of battle through the card draws but the game itself does a lot, lots of chrome and basic wargame concepts are on those cards. The basics of infantry combat are definitely covered. It's too bad this game will never have tanks.

A '7' just comes up too often to be used as a random evvent trigger. The outcomes of the random events tend to overshadow what is under the control of the players - it makes me afraid to shoot at the enemy for fear that i will be struck by a falling anvil.

Other than that its an enjoyable game.

RATING: 8.5
This is a very good CDG of tactical infantry combat.  As in all CDGs the luck element is in the card draw.  The skill comes from maximising the benefits of a good hand and minimising the adverse effects of a bad hand.  It is imperative to know when to discard cards in the game and avoid the lure of holding on to a card for possible future use instead of ditching it to get the chance of pulling a card that will be useful in the present.  My only complaints are the rulebook layout which I found counter-intuitive for learning the game and the maps which seem to be of indifferent quality.  However, the other components, in particular the cards and counters, are excellent.

I have really taken to this game. Originally I had read things about the level of chaos in the game and how it prevented you from doing what you want to do. This put me off the idea of getting it and instead I opted for the Lock n' Load System and also Tide of Iron. Both of those games are great in their own right but to be honest I think CCE is a far superior game and having now played it quite a bit I am really impressed how battles tend to pan out. Really enjoy this game and it's sister games. Highly recommended!

Now have Battlepack Paratroppers #1 and #3 Normandy. Not cheap but there is just so much play in the game and the packs they are really a must have!

I like a bit of chaos in my wargames. I don't think a commander should have total control on the battlefield. I don't even care about the missing tanks. It feels distressingly hard to actual kill the enemy at times.

The way everything is handled via cards is appealing: the game requires very little rulebook checking after the first game.

Initial rating 08/08.  As my current "Game I am always thinking about", this is probably going to end up as a Top 10 game.  Just a fantastic system which rewards skilled play and crisis management while having enough random interference to keep the narrative interesting and fresh, even when using the same deck many times.

RATING: 9
Very original. At first glance seems like an SL-esque game (in part because of the components), only that has a card-driven mechanics.

But it's really another sort of creature. It's wargame without a sequential time frame, where "turns" doesn't happen in fixed chunks of time, and where the actions that have place in different segments of the board are not necessarily sequential or parallel between them.

Many times this game is misunderstood. A sequence of "turns" that could exhaust half of your deck, could really mean only few seconds of real action in a specific zone of the map (while you build your appropriate hand for dealing with a situation).

This misunderstanding leads frequently to criticisms like "Why do I need a fire card to fire?", "Suddenly I 'remembered' that I can do spray fire!", "I'm parked in the middle of the road with an enemy machine gun nest in front of me, and nothing happens!", and so on.

Que no lo juego, y leí mis comentarios donde el esc 7 no me había gustado mucho, por la lentitud del avance Aleman, la muy limitada acción por parte de los rusos , con ataques de guerrillas, donde el avance del tiempo impidió poner en practica la 'guerra relampago', y ahora me doy cuenta que estas características fueron la que se vivieron en esta cruel guerra en el frente oriental, esto hace que suba mas mi valoración por CC, captura muy bien los distintos pasajes de la guerra

A card-driven tactical wargame with a huge random factor. For starters it's infantry only, there are no vehicles and that sharply limits the variety of the scenarios. My most serious complaint, though is that the balance of the card decks feels quite wrong. There aren't nearly enough 'move' and 'rally' cards and your hand quickly fills with useless junk like 'rout' and 'commander confusion' (Just what was the point of including a card like that?). A simple improvement would be to halve the size of each draw deck, then you'd get the cards you want quicker and the game would be shorter, and don't even get me started on concepts like wire appearing by magic at some random point on the map.

Probably the most enjoyable, and dare I say immersive, straight up wargame I've ever played.  Normally when I see chits with multiple numbers on them my eyes start to glaze over, but Combat Commander held my interest quite well. The tension created by making your moves not knowing what cards your opponent is holding somehow manages to emulate the uncertainty of battle to a surprising degree. When I made a risky dash from one farm house to another and got wiped out by an enemy unit hiding in the woods, well, I wouldn't say I felt bad about it, but it definitely felt true to life.

Like this game a lot.

Easy straightforward rules, after a couple of plays the game, plays very fluent. As the game plays within about two hours, very suitable for play during the week.

Wont give it a maximum of 10, because sometimes the luck factor kills the tactical aspect of the game.

I've been reading a lot of good things about this game and given it's card driven should play fairly well solo.

I've been looking a different tactical games for some time. Toyed with getting into ASL but it has way too many rules although you don't use every rule for every game and it does have tanks! (I'm detecting "game creep" with ASL! I don't want to get into this game but you never know...)

Systems like Lock N Load and Conflict of Heroes look pretty good too, although L&L has no cards and card play is limited in CoH I believe.
That's what impressed me about CCE, the card play and diceless system. Im reading through a downloaded copy of the rules and so far am very impressed. I like games where you don't have complete control over your units and where random events can cause friction on the battlefield,even our cardboard ones!

Picked this up from the post office today! Top notch components. Can't wait to set up this!
Rating CC:E a 10. Lovely components and well laid out rules that are easy to access via the index. Great gameplay, even thought I've been playing solo there's the anticipation of what's going to happen next that's exciting. Now i just need to catch up with the extra modules and get CC:Med and Pacific!

It's a little complex, but tells a great story.  I enjoy being a player along for the ride.  This is a great "roller coaster wargame."

I just wish it would scale down to the 60-90 minute range better.  I'm having real difficulties in doing so.

Apr08: I'm moving it to the trade pile.  It just takes too long.  I know it's short by wargame standards, but I just don't live by those standards.

One of my favorite WWII tactical wargames.  The card-based mechanics work very well, and simulates the unknown factor of combat, instead of your units always doing what you tell them to do.  Just because you want to shoot at the enemy doesn't mean your troops do, and the cards help to even this out.

Just want to say that the guy who gave this a 1 and called it a fake wargame is a fool....In other games every piece moves precisely every turn (this is reality?!?) The cards are a mechanism to model chaos - if you have a better method, given that both players have a god like view of the map and pieces - please share it w/the gaming world...until that breakthrough I think card driven games are as good as it gets. (And if you always fail to have a Fire card when needed, perhaps You are not the card player you think, and my poker group would love to have you join!)

New Comments: Just played the full example scenario and this game is the perfect synthesis of Up Front and Squad Leader....It really plays a lot like Up Front! (or maybe that's just me)


Finally--- It is my favorite game of all time, so it has to be a 10.....

Comparisons with ASL and Up Front (UF) are inevitable, as it is a bit like a combination of the two.   If you have played either ASL or UF, the game is easy to learn.  For me, CC does not replace UF or ASL, although I think that UF will get somewhat less play in favor of CC.   UF is more portable, requires a smaller playing area, plays in a shorter time than CC, and hand management is a more critical part of UF.  ASL is infinitely more comprehensive than CC.  While CC is limited to one map infantry scenarios, ASL can cover anything from small scenarios up to huge campaigns on large historical maps.  Also, every aspect of WWII land warfare is there.  For example, one glaring omission of CC is the lack of armored vehicles (Heck, even UF has armored vehicles).  On the other hand, CC purposefully focuses on WWII "infantry" combat and does an excellent job.  The game is fast, fun and wild, with frequent events mixing things up (CC plays more chaotically than either UF or ASL, but in an exciting and fun way).  CC is a big step up from Memoir 44, but a lot less complicated than ASL or UF, with many of the details of UF and ASL abstracted away, or made into triggered events.  (Based on 25+  games played so far).

I normally frown heavily on randomness, high luck or especially chaos in most cases. I knew exactly what I was getting into with this and in a 2 player game not running over two hours I can deal with some of the above if the game makes up for it in FUN, well this game delivers. 

TONS of randomness and well most of it I'm just fine with, at least for now as honestly I think that is a big part of WHY the game was fun.  There seemed to be enough all over the place (random events, snipers & troops parachuting in at random locations, victory points, etc) that I think it evened out over the course of a game less maybe card draw. Also, most of it was themactic, added flavour and was good at simulating the feel of the true chaos of real war. 

Rolling dice by flipping cards was better than actually rolling dice I think and I also really like the initiative card to help mitigate a really bad roll at the wrong time, won’t always work but at least there is that chance, especially on a really bad roll.  So while I like the card flipping I DON'T like using your deck of much needed cards to do the dice rolling as you can burn though some of your much needed cards and this is really the randomness that kills you the most, not having the right cards at the right time which is something I didn’t like about Borg C&C systems. I would rather use a seperate dice deck for this but then that would kill the random event system and time etc, you really need two more duplicate decks to do this right, one for drawing and one for rolling, anyway it works fine and I've come up with an alternative fix. 

Overall a great little system and a fun game.  Lots of tough decisions to make and lots of strategizing in the game that I found subtle on first blush.  Tons of replay built into the system with 12 scenerios and each time you play a given scenrario it could play very differently depending on many factors.  Great semi-entry level (a little more than entry level) hex and counter which was my first ‘real’ war game played (although Duel of Ages was years ago and is more of a war game than most people think), after my first game which I thoroughly enjoyed I thought about it for a solid week after so that really says something as it rarely happens.  


Tidbit - Thinking about letting Attacker discard 4 cards to make any one and Defender discarding 2 or 3 for the same effect to help mitigate bad card draw instead of just possibly re-drawing the same crap and losing a turn (not tested).

After one play I'm very excited about this system.  It seems very very tight, with tons of room for replayability.  I love the trigger mechanic, lots of random elements that happen seemlessly.  Combat is a snap after a few battles.  We had a question about opp fire that was answered quickly with a post here on the geek.  I think CJ has a winner on his hands here.  My rating could easily go up with a few more plays.  The level of detail is very nice along with a fairly quick play time.  I'm eager to play this again.   

- After more exposure I think there's an excellent game in here, but you can have some fairly outcomes...routs are possible if one side gets a bad card draw

Tenative rating after one play.  Card draw can be annoying, but still good fun.  I'm sure that once I've played it a couple of more times the game will flow pretty well.

I really hope some creative folks begin published more historical scenarios, although the scenario generator is a nice addition to keep the game from getting stale.

The components are fantastic.  The maps look great, I love the bigger hexes and counters, and everything is laid out in a smart, functional manner.  The rulebook and player aids are amazing.  No errata, no stupid misprints, no rules that need a Supreme Court Judge to interpret them for you.

CC:E is meatier than A Victory Lost, or other "beginner" wargames, but I still feel I've got the rules totally under control after 5 plays.  The scenario creation tool is STELLAR.  I enjoy it more than the fixed scenarios, because it gives each player so much flexibility in terms of OB selection and setup.  

Chad Jensen is a Game Designing Deity.  He answers every question that has arisen, both here and on CSW.  The design process has been totally transparent from Day One, and the all the positive input and feedback from gamers that he put into this gem really shows.

After three plays. A very good game that I'm still getting a handle on. I love the multi-use cards, especially how they function as dice and events. There are a lot of little rules to learn, but they all make sense once you get to know the game. I just have trouble remembering to implement them all (but getting better at it).

First impression only. I wasn't terribly impressed. Chaos rules (which in my case ended up giving me the victory in the scenario played - but it didn't feel satisfying at all). With games like Squad Leader, Advanced Tobruk System or the ASL Starter Kits on the market, I don't really see any need for CC:E.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (April 2012)

I thought I was a wargamer, in theory I should like those games because I like heavy and complex games. However in practice I almost never have enjoyed a wargame, the exception is Combat Commander which is why I’m rating it that high. 

It’s been years since I last played it and the reason I haven’t played it again is because my desire to do so is rather low. For that reason I’m downgrading its rating. I enjoyed my only play of CC, but still it has lots of uncontrollable luck. I would need to play it again to write a proper comment.

Current Rating: 6.0

A tactical game with some innovative mechanisms for simulating time passage.  Has a realistic feel (not that I'm in any position to know realism in this milieu).  Given my other gaming interests I'm not likely to give it the 10-15 plays I'd need to get truly comfortable with the system, but I wouldn't mind playing again.

Perhaps the most difficult factor to simulate in a board wargame is fog-of-war. It can be difficult to disguise the location, identity and condition of on-map units without onerous record-keeping. Block games do a good job of disguising unit identity and condition, except that the owner still knows exactly what to expect from his own people. Chit-based activation is another good mechanic for increasing the uncertainty inherent in the battlefield. Combat Commander approaches fog-of-war from a completely different angle: the cards. The cards in CC:E simulate fog-of-war because players can never be sure that "what you see" (units on the board) will translate into "what you get" (the ability of those units to receive or carry out your orders). One example: it might look like your rifle squad is 3 hexes from a key objective, but if you just can't draw a "move" card after repeated attempts, that squad might actually have started 10 or 15 hexes away from where you thought it was. Card-driven fog-of-war is derived from what a unit can actually accomplish, rather than what the commander thinks it can accomplish.

RATING: 9
Very impressive, engrossing card driven tactical wargame, with (looking beyond the cards) some very neat design features. Comparing it to the older wargames in my cupboard, it is most reminiscent of the best bits of Up Front (unpredictability and neat card play) and Ambush! (the events make it feel like a story almost as much as a game, you're rarely sure what the objectives are other than in a broad sense, plus the map artwork has a similar quality). 

Much less deterministic and chess-like than something like Squad Leader. While there's room for both approaches, my instinct leans more towards the CC:E/Ambush!/Up Front way of thinking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is only my first impression, but I couldn't be more pleased.  It is the perfect "weight" and complexity for me.  I haven't had much luck trying to read and understand the rules to games like ASL (starter-kit) or Lock-and-Load. I could easily understand the rules to C&C:E.  Imagine that...they even decided to put in a detailed example of play!  How novel! (someone please tell me why the ASL "starter-kit" does not have one?)  Anyway, I've also played and enjoyed Up Front (with the "basic" rules), but I had always wished that it was played out on a real map.  Well....I think C&C:E is pretty close to Up Front played on a real map.  If you've found light wargames (like Memoir 44) to be unsatisfying, and you're looking for the next step up, I think you should check out this game.

RATING: 9
I was very skeptical of it at first, but I have to say the game is excellent and I really enjoy playing it.  As others have said, it is a good mix of ASL/SL, Up Front and Memoir '44.  It won't beat ASLSK as a relatively light, combined arms squad-level tactical WWII wargame, but CC:E is magnificient as an infantry-only squad level tactical WWII wargame.

One noteworthy difference in feel with CC:E versus ASL/SL is time scale.  ASL/SL selectively compresses an action that may have taken place over hours into a few minutes, which nicely mitigates its lack of command and control modeling.  On the other hand, CC:E stretches things out such that its seems like playing a very tense, slowed down version of an infantry-only ASL battle.  In this it excels and provides a nice complement to ASL.

Incredible game, whether face to face or solo.  Introduced it to a number of my non-boardgame playing buddies, and they all loved it.  Very immersive and the unpredictable events somehow feels natural and keeps everyone on their toes as they need to continually reassess the situation.

I didn't like this game.  I've heard the buzz and I've seen the same fanboi reaction when everyone disputes this being the greatest game ever.  However I just can't get over the sheer lack of options.  In one of the games I played I was the attacker and had to advance, only I didn't see very many advance cards.  So I lost, badly, and never looked liked winning.

The game which introduced Chad Jensen to the wider gaming public, CC was responsible for finally reviving my serious WW2 tactical gaming. There have been plenty of criticisms made of CC down the years- some quite astute, others simply fatuous; but the fact remains that it's a lot of fun to play and delivers what tactical WW2 wargamers want: bucketloads of tension and plenty of games which can go right down to the wire. I love it. :)

I am conflicted.  Initially I had a lot of fun with CC, and enjoyed playing one of the campaigns to completion.  As time goes on, I haven't had the urge to play again, at all.  I'm torn at this point on whether to keep it in the collection or see that it gets a good home.

RATING: 10
Combat Commander: Europe was my first "real" wargame, and I must say that I was immediately taken with it. The depth of design and attention to detail here is staggering. The rules are robust without being complex. There are many situational considerations, but the gameplay and mechanics are intuitive and smooth. The zoomed-in scale of the game puts you right in the heart of the action (there are chits that represent a single person!). However, it is the scope and timing of decisions and the multiple uses of cards that make this game a work of brilliance. The angst and opportunity costs both players must consider makes for a marvelous dance of tactics, feints, plans, countermeasures, etc. Combat Commander: Europe sweeps you up in its immersive narrative and won't let go until the last shot is fired (or even longer, as you will likely find yourself thinking about the game afterward). This is a truly special game, and it will always have a nostalgic place in my gaming journey.

I've only played 2 games so far (and one of those was solo), but I can honestly say that this is the game I've been looking for.  I started out in war games many, many years ago, with Squad Leader being one of my favorites.  I long for those days, but no longer have the patience or time (or intelligence?) to invest into "complex" games.  We enjoy playing Memoir '44 but it's a little light and has made me long for my old days.  I tried one of the Lock 'n Load games, and while it looked like a very fine game, my eyes glazed over after a couple of pages of rules.  Even if I could take the time to grok it now, I knew that with a couple of months between playings, it would be a real bear to remember it each time.  I went to PrezCon this past February and described my situation to the guy from GMT, and he immediately recommended CC:E to me.  He went over the basics in about 5 minutes, and then lent me the rulebook.  Twenty minutes later I had seen enough to know that this was a clean and straight-forward design.  I purchased it and finally got a game in two nights ago, with a solo play last night.  This afternoon I hope to get in another real game....

Update: Still enthused after 10 playings!

Pretty much the final nail in the coffin. I just don't care for combat-style games, with the exception of the Commands and Colors series. I love COIN and Eklund's Pax series, games where war is apart of a larger context; however I struggle when battles are the primary purpose. 

Combat Commander is well designed, has plenty of squad-level detail, some random events, and a unique dice rolling mechanism; however, I miss the human narrative and larger context of WHY they're fighting. Several people compared this with HBOs Band of Brothers and so I was under the impression there was a rich human narrative here. Sure, if you remove the people, relationships, and individual epiphanies and struggles of the men fighting.

RATING: 7
A couple of years ago I was testing the waters for entry-level wargames, and of course at the time, the most popular options were both tactical, squad-level WWII games, descriptors which didn't mean a whole lot to me. I chose Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear! Russia 1941-1942. I chose wrong.

Combat Commander: Europe seems like the more fluid experience to me. Designer Chad Jensen packs a ton of game into each player's deck of cards, which allow for unit orders, short-term plans, command confusion, random events on the battlefield, combat results, etc. There are no dice in the game, and instead, a full distribution of dice is depicted across a deck of 72 cards. This has some weird but fun effects, as players can start actively distorting their distribution at high levels of play. It also prevents the extreme anomalies that come with dice.

As for the units themselves, CC:E follows a standard template. Units have a movement allowance, firepower rating, and range. Terrain can block line of sight and provide cover (defensive bonuses). Units can initiate melees at close quarters, and combined arms is a key element of dealing damage. Leaders create command zones in which more units can participate in an activation, making it a real problem if they're captured or killed. Etc. It's all incredibly intuitive and easy to follow, though there is a lot to absorb as you go. My opponent commented at one point that the nice thing about the rules is that they're always what you expect them to be. Obviously that depends a little bit on your familiarity with some of the basic concepts here, but generally I'd say he's right.

I can't say whether I'll be playing lots of Combat Commander in the months ahead. I can say that if I'm going to play a tactical squad game, this is it. 

**Update: got well and truly obliterated on my 2nd play. With squad-level games, I feel like I have a tool-set that [i]seems[/i] straightforward enough, but expert combination leaves me feeling like I haven't the first clue how to make anything work.

April 21, 2008 -  Contrary to others I don't find the rules particularly straightforward and on a scale of one to ten I give the game bits and maps about a 5. This is not a pretty game... There are quite a few maps so I do have some sympathy with the decision to go with paper. Overall, after several plays, I find the fun quotient just isn't very high. Sooner be playing Memoir 44.

I found it to be surprisingly playable solitaire on VASSAL.

The combat is straight-forward and exciting, and tension is constantly mounting.

This game is quickly becoming my all-time favorite.

What a wild ride! I can't remember any other single game where I experienced such a wide spread of emotions from joy to frustration. Seen as an experience of enjoying the narrative, this is great. Seen as a strategic game this can be a blow in the face. I haven't made up my mind what I want from wargames or if I want wargames at all. For now it was more fun than any of its peer group (CoH, Tide of Iron, CC:A) while at the same time it angered me more than any of these. This could be a good exercise to keep my temper in control while gaming. If I succeed this rating could rise. If not, it could fall drastically. It even might prove that the game is less luck-driven as it appears since I lost both my games so far.

RATING: 7.5
Based on one (and probably the last) play:  (10-15-09)

One run through of this game, including the sample tutorial in the manual and scenario #1 from the playbook, took nearly six hours.  As we worked through it, I commented to my buddy that I would likely buy a copy of one of the Close Combat games just on the basis of the rules being so well-written and organized. After six hours of CC, I changed my mind rather abruptly - what started out fun turned out to be one of the most frustrating and not-fun games I've ever played.

Around 50% of the cards I drew during the game were unusable (no radios for artillery and no defender for scenario #1), an offense even the simplest gateway game in this genre (Memoir '44) never commits.  Firing mechanics were fiddly and required FAR too much manual consultation.  Weapons feel less like weapons and more like licorice whips meant to flog your opponents with.  The mix of two luck mechanics (dice AND cards) into a supposed wargame lends this game such a random feel that decision-making (other than really obvious things like not running pellmell opportunity fire) seems to be a non-factor.  Meh, meh, meh.

This only gets a two because of the obvious love and care that went into the game, especially the design of the manual.  Otherwise this is NOT a game I'll play again.

Update: (1-10)

Much better this time around.  First scenario is crap and I'd advise against using it unless you have some experience with the game.  Bumping rating up substantially due to having significantly more fun on the second try.

RATING: 8
After one brutal 2P game in which neither the orders nor the dice were of any help at all, I'll give this a provisional 7. **Up to an 8 now after a better Med game (Germans vs. Poles). It can still be pretty brutal if the cards aren't going your way, and there are quite a few factors to consider. On the plus side, there's a lot of variety here and the rulebook is very good.

RATING: 8
This is a fun game that reminds me of my days playing Battle Hymn. Although not specifically designed for solitaire as BH was, it plays solo nicely, and the game develops that same "narrative" that pulls the gamer in and personalizes it. The effect is kind of like how it used to feel playing Squad Leader -- you really end up rooting for that one routed squad or the leader who rallies and saves the day. 

There are endless possibilities for play. Many scenarios, none of which play the same twice due to the mechanics. And a random scenario generator as well to build your own, although I am happy to run through all the many scenarios in CCE, CCM, and all the follow-on "Battle Packs" and C3I articles.

Additionally, I am impressed by the loyal following this game has built. Great support on the Geek as well.

An excellent game.  Easy to play, but a lot of difficult decisions.  Learning the nuances of the cards makes each new game interesting.

It's not a replacement for ASL, but has a place on the shelf right next to it.

Each game of CC:E is like a new story. You usually never know how it'll end, and if you don't mind losing now and then to a bad streak of card draws, even those stories can be very entertaining.

Someone mentioned something long ago on a thread lost in the bowels of BGG that I agree with: Just like RPGs, I remember the various games I've played of CC:E far more than I've ever recalled a particular instance while playing a traditional eurogame.

Maybe it's the fact that there are names on the leaders, or I have bits on the board I care about in some way, but the narrative of the game sticks with me long after the game is over and that's a very rewarding experience above and beyond just the game play itself which I find rather fun and a bit chaotic, just as I imagine a real skirmish might be.

Update 2013: We have given it second chance and it proved even worse. Maybe it is good game however we were missing convincing narrative. Limitations from cards were too difficult to logically explain and overall it was really bad. From things like that you are doing stupid actions because you know that if you draw quicker through your deck you can end game earlier to things like - I have spent all my fire orders, so until deck gets reschufled I will not be able to fire. These all things are too absurd for us. It creates chaos of battlefield but in weird and gamey way.

System with lot of chaos. But it plays well, quite fast and furious and could be lot of fun. It is not my most favorite tactical system but holds pretty well.

CCE is essentially a game of card management with a high chaos factor in which I never have the impression that my decisions matter all that much. The overwhelming randomness of the design makes for a nice battle narrative but a subaverage game. If CCE had only half the playing time and complexity, this would be ok, but alas it hasn't.

RATING: 10
CC:E is an excellent game.  The victory conditions and scenario editor are brilliant.  However, it loses some people because the distribution of cards can leave you unable to fire at a key moment. I play with a few house rules to focus the game better.  First, I allow opportunity fire on your opponent's turn by throwing down your ENTIRE  hand, with each card after the first giving you a +1 to your roll.  Second, I changed the Sniper rules so that the enemy unit nearest to the random hex is suppressed.

I have folio modules 1 through 3 plus the boxed Resistance expansion.

Initial rating based on solo play.

It seems that the designer has achieved his goal of a fun, chaotic look at WWII tactical gaming.  As many others have stated, chaos is the primary thing going on in this game.  

CC:E repeats and reinforces the stereotypes of the Squad Leader, so it's not much of a historical study.  It seems to lean more toward the oppotunistic "truthy" type of combat systems like Command and Colors (use your cards to get a flag and hope the other guy doesn't have good enough cards to make you pay to much) then the deeper (SL, ASL, ATS, LnL, CoH) games available.  And it takes a bit longer to play than heavier games (like ATS and Lock 'n Load) that include more detail due to the amount of hand churning and random events to resolve.

Still, it's easy to learn WWII tactical.  It's fun to play and the actual mechanics (like fire combat and Line of Sight) are easier than most WWII tactical games.  It's not going to replace ATS for me, but I don't mind playing it on occassion.

RATING: 4.5
My interest was high as it borrows from some favorites, and other than the time-consuming TCS games there is a void for detailed tactical games that place order limits on command and control.  Extremely well-produced game, but the game play disappointed me with every session.  Only during initial setups was I able to think in terms of (as I assume it would be) WWII tactical combat; thereafter, it was a below-average card management game, with progress often determined by random card draw instead of player decisions, and quite tedious.  If the high-luck factor which affected most of our sessions is the norm, then I'd rate it a 2 on the BGG scale.  I hope some consideration is made to improve the basic game play before the sequels are released, but I'm not sure how it can be done...it combines elements of several excellent games, but this soup is already made.

RATING: 10
WWII ground combat (German, US, and Soviet forces) at the squad level. Card driven, big box, 12-scenarios, 12-maps, lots of random events and unlimited replayability. There are lots of expansion and editions planned. Playing time is 1-3 hours for most scenarios.

The game is chaotic as players have limited control over what happens. Some people don't like CC:E because of its chaotic nature. My response to them is that if you think combat is an orderly, by-the-numbers process, you have been spoiled by earlier, non-historical wargames. Try reading S.L.A. Marshall's "Night Drop, the American Airborne Drop of Normandy" and you will see how chaotic it is.

Replaced Up Front for me even though I can imagine a better replacement easily.  I just don't know what that game might be (please tell me!).  Like Up Front you have to suspend disbelief a little bit for certain occurrences but I'm still drawn to games like these having had a history with Squad Leader, Up Front and ASL.  From a purely tactical level wargame standpoint I probably still prefer Conflict of Heroes.

RATING: 8
The most fun I've had with a new wargame since the original Squad Leader. It captures the flavor of SL -- the crazy turns of fate and battlefield chaos -- without all the complexity and rulebook-flipping that ASL is saddled with.

RATING: 10
Much more meaty than Memoir '44.  Tons of fun got packed into this box.  A fantastic game if you don't mind some randomness.  Very pricey for what you get, though.  Other than the chits, not a piece of cardboard to be found.

Great game. Perhaps a bit to random, but always a lot of fun. While I think that third part of the series - CC: Pacific - has better rules, CC:E has slightly more interesting maps and scenarios.

RATING: 9
Small unit combat is chaotic and random.  CC:E represents this aspect of warfare better than any other game on the subject.  And it's just plain fun to play!  I think the level of complexity is just right, hitting that sweet spot between too simple and mind-numbingly detailed.  I like the uncertainty and chaos introduced by the card-driven mechanic.  I think this kind of uncertainty and inability to control your units in a "god-like" way represents, better than any other game on the subject, the chaotic nature of combat.

I hope the designer and developers leave "well enough alone" and don't start layering on additional levels of unnecessary chrome and complexity for the sake of "realism".  Many games have died from "expansion bloat" (remember how good a game Star Fleet Battles was before the expansions?).  I hope this doesn't happen with Combat Commander.  That said, I'm certainly looking forward to additional expansions and the new nationalities that will be introduced.  Expansion #3 will be the Pacific.  I think that will be a very interesting expansion.(December 2006)

RATING: 9.5
This is my favorite war game so far. Not being a huge war-gamer this is the one that has convinced me to play more war-games. Its rules whilst seemingly endless are easily interpreted once you've had a game under your belt.
Very tactical and an emotional roller coaster. Expect to be on a high as everything seems to go your way only to feel a crushing loss as a couple of rolls or events change the course of war. Very realistic. Here is an example. I had artillery & over 3 rounds I pounded the area with smoke grenades, there was a mass of smoke covering all the open ground, the Germans were in a building waiting, I moved large quantities of troops up close to the building under the cover of smoke, there was nothing he could do. I turn an event card and got Breeze, all the smoke blew away, I had about 8 units standing in the open waving merrily at the German machine guns. RUN AWAY!
Love it.

RATING: 4
Very interesting combination of card and board game which I had hoped would work. Use as many cards as you can every turn to try and keep things moving.

In general firefights seem to be about as deadly as the A-Team. One mostly has to close to hand to hand combat and that is an all or nothing affair. I did find it strange when you have bad card luck that the enemy could simply walk up to prepared MG trenches and take out defending troops while they couldn't fire back. Too much card luck, and don't give me that chaos of war justification. Can you really advance through open terrain at a machinegun nest or bunker and not get shot at? Try it! Damned card games!

One last point. The games that I have won were just an exercise in dumping cards as fast as possible once I had a point lead (and that's easy if you are the defender). All I did was get rid of all the cards I could every turn and triggered the end of the game to win. What kind of example is this of small unit combat? Now where is this in the small unit combat handbook? Seriously, I stared at the cards more than the map!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Many gamers praise the clarity of the rules, but I found them poorly organized and often unintuitive.  After a lot of flipping back and forth in the first few games, play became much smoother and the basic cleanness of the mechanics became more apparent.  The strength of the game is the exciting see-sawing of fortunes that leads to close, satisfying finishes.  The luck of the draw of the cards gives the game a randomness and loss of control that may make some wargamers uncomfortable.  However, it's hard to beat CC:E's excitement and ease of play in a tactical level game.

RATING: 10
Outstanding game about combat.  It captures a chaotic feeling, which I assume combat is like.  With the random events there is a strong feeling the world doesn't end at the edge of the map.  Taken together these add up to the 'cinematic' feeling that is so often cited.  To paraphrase, I play this game to find out what will happen.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent, simplified but not simplistic squad level combat allows for reasonable-sized scenarios to be set-up and played in three hours or less. Card-driven gameplay can be a little frustrating if you're used to Squad Leader or the like, but often results in more interesting game play.

RATING: 8
I like this game! The cards are a great mechanic, and there is no CRT or complicated sequence of play. Just jump right in and have fun.

There are some very gamey aspects to CC:E, but then it is a game. Last time I played, I held a VP building with my last unit, and so I was ahead in points. My opponent had more units, but was struggling to find the right cards to get everyone organized. So, we waited and discarded for maybe 15 consecutive turns. Obviously, the time length of each turn is abstract and not rigid, but it really pulls you out of the action, and you're left realizing you're just playing a hand-management sim.

Just know, this is not the solution to the "total control" issue of ASL. I'd argue it was never an issue to begin with, but hey.

Take all of this with a grain of salt. I think CC:E is a lot of fun to play, and I've taught it to a few of my friends. I like!

I'm a non-wargamer (I guess now, a recently former non-wargamer.) I'm still picking up the mechanics of play (what numbers to  /-, how to count movement) but the big picture has clicked. I'm really enjoying this. Any question we had, we could find the answer quickly in the rulebook. I can definitely recommend this to other beginners. The more experienced wargamers seem to be speaking up for themselves quite nicely...[Note: Chad's my brother-in-law. I've seen this played, and heard and read a lot about it, but I've only played 3 games so far. Ready for more!]

War Game that was a little too chaotic for me. I probably could have made a few better decisions but overall I felt like I was at the mercy of my deck, which is fine for some games but with a 2hr play time, I'd rather play something else
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Yeah, it has a lot of randomness, but personally I feel that imperfect control over your units (wanting your guys to move forward, but not having a Move card) and imperfect information (which manifests itself through Sniper triggers etc.) are more realistic than certain other tactical games where you have perfect information and perfect control over (and coordination between) all of your units.

With more plays, I may get tired of what feels like really "swingy" luck, but so far I'm still enjoying it, and after a game in which you get hammered, you can identify specific mistakes you made, or specific events which went the wrong way for you (like laying smoke between your mortar team and an enemy machinegun team, and having the wind blow it away at just the wrong time).

2009-10-31: dropping to a 6, as it's just not getting played.  In most cases I would probably want to play Conflict of Heroes instead, as I haven't gotten as much play out of that as I expected.

RATING: 8
Very good game - once I got past my own pre-conceptions.  I expected a light version of SL/ASL (or ATS, or Lock N' Load, etc..) with some cards thrown in.  Not the case!  While the units, rules, terrain, and all are certainly very similar to other tactical games, the play is not.  There are a lot of random events that occur.  The cards are, of course, very random.  The game plays in a chaotic fashion.  Seems to turn many people off.  Compared to the others, CC has simpler rules.  That is a plus and minus.  If you want to jump in, play a fun game, blast your opponent, and generally have a good time try CC.  If you want to get more into the nitty gritty, go with one of the other games mentioned above.  Personally, I like CC and the others.  Definitely room for all in my gaming closet.

RATING: N/A
Preliminary thoughts:

Counters are punched and rules have been read. The system is simpler than I anticipated (not a bad thing) which means it should eventually see some playing time. Overall I like what i've read and seen. I just need to play it.

I would say this game (rulewise) appears to be simpler than Panzer Grenadier (though interactions between various order and action cards could complicate things) and Tide of Iron. Tide of Iron's rulebook is wordy, and I found Combat Commander's to be more friendly than both PG and ToI. This may be because of my familiarity with tactical WW2 games, however, as they're all pretty similar at their core (LOS, LOF, terrain, cover, movement points, actions, etc).

Component quality is top notch, and I love the oversized hexes. No more huge counter stacks is a definite plus.

After finally playing I can say that this is one of the best rulebooks i've ever had the pleasure to use.

Definitely a fun game. 

What I like about CC:E is how things like your discard limit are used to represent tactical flexibility. Again postures (attack/defend/recon) being represented by how many cards you can hold is another great mechanic (CC:P looks to really expand on this) - it's just a great way to add chrome to a game without adding cumbersome rules.

Played once.  I don't get it.  I don't see it.  Where is the love for this game coming from?  It is NOT that great, and not really that different from other wargames.  It's just not as complex or heavy as some of the more traditional fare.  Good, not (even close to) great.

Very detailed CDG on a squad level.  Cards are used for a fascinating blend of dice rolls, actions, events, special actions, etc.  The tutorial game is an excellent way to play your first time to get a feel for the game although questions will still remain.  Rules are fairly well organized.

I´m not really sure if I like it or not.

The action is fine but chaotic and it´s not as random as one could think.

Maybe it´s just, that I like Panzer Grenadier way better as a system for "tactical" combat. I know those games are not really comparable but thats how I feel

RATING: 9
Pure genius! I love this game. Great tactical simulation covering so many types of scenarios. Perhaps the best gameplay of any tactical combat game, (but no tanks, so not up to the Yaquinto classics I rate higher). The supremely elegant solution to the "god's view" of the battlefield, that of using cards to activate, is not only the most innovative idea in decades, but implemented flawlessly. Further, the ease of play to achieve these results is just gangbusters! Once you get your head around the distinctions between "cover" and "hindrance", and the funky op fire rules, the rest of the game plays like buttah! My new favorite.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The complexity level is fairly modest but there is still a good amount of historical feel.  The game is certainly infused with randomness of many different types but that seems appropriate to the nature of WWII squad level combat.  There always seem to be interesting and significant decisions to make and I'm sure experienced players will generally defeat lucky amateurs over the long run despite the incredible swings of fortune.

RATING: 6
They say it is ASL Up Front CDG.  And so they say.  The cards, rulebook and playbook are very nicely done. The box cover and maps are not.  They are a bit cartoonish to my taste.  But I like very much the idea of random scenario generation system, with the point value system. This should be done with every tactical wargame for players to enjoy. I haven't heard a lot about ASL doing the same. It is not anything new which has been so popular in PC game system for a long time, from Steel Pathers to Civilization. 

The thick box comes with stuffs which do not fully fill out. So there is a lot of space inside. Don't be fooled by its apperance. The dice results are printed on the cards.  And the system does not shuffle the cards everytime a player draws.  So when you draw a single card for each combat, chances are that the probabilities change after each draw.  Deterministic on the apperance by your card deck and I wonder if this could replace the rolling of two dices altogether, which feels certainly better.  Yet the events, hex location for some of the events take place are randomnly determined.  It is this kind nice twist shown all throughout the game.  

Which scenario is the best to start? I prefer German and Russian.  We played scenario 10 "Command School" and enjoyed it a lot. An invaluable substitute to those who don't like the simpler Memoir'44.

Yep, this is a good base game with short playing time. Its random scenario generator offers tremendous playability value. I didn't like it the first time when I didn't have a clue of what was I doing. However, when I played the expansion game on Stalingrad, things starting to become clear. However, I think I have enough with the system as I didn't buy further the other expansions/ battle packs on the western front, e.g. Pacific, Mediterranean, Paratroopers, Normandy. (Note in 2014 Dec: finally I got all the Battle Packs except Nr. 1 Paratroopers and all the boxes except the Pacific.) Perhaps mostly because I thought it was too luck-dependent sometimes and the system might only be good under specific circumstances only, those that I defined to be the high-activity-intensity tactical situation. For protracted or long maneuvering war at tactical level, this game shows its limitations.

RATING: N/A
A couple of gripes made me not want to buy CC:E 
1: The lack of vehicles/armour is a showstopper as far as I'm concerned.
2: Some of the comments/replays seem to indicate that the game is more on the random side of things than I think it should be, and has some very odd effects - which is a shame, because I was really caught by the card-driven aspect. I will echo Lee Brimmicombe-Woods' sentiment that the game seems more like a collection of neat stuff than a simulation of WWII tactical combat

So. Regretfully the answer is no, I'm not going to spend the cash on it (Price is a big factor in this) - at least not until some hands-on experience has convinced me otherwise. - Maybe I should give FirePower or ASL another, closer, look.

But at the same time it tears me, because that game *really* looks beautiful - Downtown class beautiful!

Rating after five games. Brillant! If you buy one game this year, make it this one! Game plays very smooth after half an hour. My advice would be to make some small notes during the game for things like recover or rout rolls. Exciting gameplay, fast action and  decisions, decision, decisions on every card play. Your plan will crumble into dust. Your artillery will fail to arrive. Snipers will kill your leaders. But still you love it! Adapt, improvise and hit back to come in for a last-second victory!

Fast and furious squad based combat.  for those of us who want to play Squad Leader but don't have the patience.   I received this unpunched in trade, and definitely enjoying it more than what I traded for it (Fields of Fire).

I can see why some have issues with this one.   There is alot of random chaos.  Might be too much for some.   The cards limit you, and having to cycle cards to get the right orders feels "gamey".  but hey, it is a game.   Part of being able to play this well is to learn card management, and to learn when to combine your fire groups to get higher % shots.   but that's just part of learning what this game wants you to do to win.  

Ultimately I know its not super-realistic, but has enough meat to keep me intrigued while not bogging you down with minutiae.  

some great stories come out of this one.

I think this is going to live up to the hype.  My first game took quite a while to play for a tactical game.  So, it will depend on length of play for me to decide if I really like it.  Rules are not overly complicated, a la ASL.  The chaos of cardplay matches the fog of war at this scale.  Definitely worthy of further play.  I generally prefer the more abstracted play of Up Front.

Great graphic quality in counters (more than usual GMT standards), cards, rules booklets: maps clear and well done but cold to me, just a matter of tastes. The general idea is of a carefully prepared game package.

I really can't decide if this game is a 6 or a 8. The components and the general look of the game are top notch! Though actual game play can be tedious when both players sit with crap cards on their hands. The different scenarios have differing quality too. Some are good, but there are some scenarios that could have been left out too (scenario #2 for example). Despite this I'd hardly ever turn down playing it if a friend challenged me!

Takes a few games to get used to the flow, and speed up decision making.  There is some chaos here, but I found this can make the game far more intense (though frustrating at times) and makes players constantly chnage to handle the ebb and flow of "fate".
High production value, lots of support, the game is quite good.  If you are a strit, "move, fight, take losses" type of gamer, yo might struggle with the way fate enters into the game to mess you or both players up.  I like this apsect as you are always hagning on th edge of your seat, racing against time to ensure you can keep working towards victory.  Games tend to run long, but with more playing I know this will shorten them up a bit.

A fun game, but a lousy simulation.  That's not necessarily a problem in and of itself (I don't need %100 realism to enoy a boardgame, after all) but the zealotry on this site is a bit off-putting.  I'll just say this one thing about making a CDG tac-sim...the idea that a lack of a move or fire card somehow represents "fog of war" is about the lamest excuse I've ever seen vehemently argued.

The game is very random and it's hard to plan a strategy (like chess) because of it.  However, you will enjoy the game a lot more if you buy into the thought that war is random and the best plans can fall to goo even on sunny days.

Because of the 100% card based system you can't do the basics like move, shoot or attack without a card to support it.  Your squad can stand out in the open for multiple turns and be fired on.  The side note here is to make sure you have all the cards in your hand before you move.  If you don't you could be stalled out in the open unable to move or shoot.

Another harsh part of the game is that hand to hand kills instantly (with one card) but fire teams with huge fire power can never kill anything with a single round of fire.  Knowing this you have to split up your firing so some of the team fires and the second part of the team fires.  I still feel though if you have one massive fire attack that you should be able to KIA a unit (it's just not how the game works is all).

Other odd things are that your team can be routed and have to retreat for no reason other than the other player had the Rout card.  In one of the games my guys got run off the map and the other player didn't have to fire a shot other than the first one that broke the team.  Again you will have to use some imagination here.  If your guys retreated from the fight they simple have had enough and ran away.

The game designer probably had a good time randomizing all the orders (move, shoot, assault,...) actions (order modiers) and events.  I like the random actions and events.  For me I like to move, shoot, assault and etc ~ everything else can be random)

In the realm of card driven games this is top in it's class.  If you want something more like ASL or chess then you not like it as much.

Wow this game is just great. My first game of it was such a frustrating experience, I felt like a piece of flotsam and jetsam just being pushed around by the fog of war unable to effectively achieve anything. I would command my guys to make a dash for the trees under the cover of smoke, only to find them freezing on the spot, suppressed under fire in open ground. Then for the wind to pick up and blow the smoke away revealing them like a burnt sunday roast from a smokey oven.

I was getting frustrated and hated the game. Even my German opponent consoled me! Things were bad. Then I read the instructions ... and something clicked. Maybe it was the section in the manual that explicitly stated that euro-gamers would have the reaction I had. That they needed consoling and nudging through the chaos of the game.

I came out the other side a different gamer. I love the chaos that this game stirs up. My fear of chits with endless numbers on them has been quelled (well at least enough that I enjoy this game, I'm not ready to start playing games with tweezers yet!). I finally get that this is just a card game and taking the time to cycle through your cards is not always a bad thing. Your opponent is having just as hard a time as you.

If you haven't tried this before and you are in any way interested, try it. Just be ready to be consoled by the enemy as they pop their head up from a bunker and take pot shots at you ... because most of the time that's all they are pot shots ... grab your rifle, gather your squad and run like the wind for the trees, you might just make it.

UPDATE

Wow. Every game of this is different and Combat Commander for me seems to have a logarithmic enjoyment scale. My first few games were a struggle but since then (and my understanding that both sides struggle with cards in hand and no-one can do everything exactly when they want to) the enjoyment factor has just shot through the roof to the point where this is becoming one of my favourite games.

This time we played a scenario from the sea lion pack (which my friend has and is now on my radar!) where the Brits were holding out in a 3 story church tower and private Peavsly (name from memory I know it's wrong) sat at the top of it with a rifle which seemed to have the accuracy of some sort of 22nd century technology that was picking off my German paratroopers as they stormed his location.

The story that unfolded was fantastic with the Germans eventually taking the clock tower and then trying to hold out as the Brits stormed it. Throw in a wild roaming hero, some constantly extremely poor ordinance by the Germans and then a freakish perfect hit to wipe out a Brit leader who was co-ordinating the British storming of an outlying building that would have brought on a British win from a German surrender and you have just a brilliant game.

I was not one for this sort of game, or so I thought!

Just a wonderful system that is a blast to play. It's more of an experience than a game you try to win at. Will i get that artillery called in time? Will I be able to move to the objective? Can I bait the other guy into a close combat? So many possibilities and it is fun to watch it all play out.

Still loving this game. The scenarios are varied and entertaining.

I was unsure of this one going into it, but it is a wonderfully fun squad-level experience. The chaos of war is in full effect here but you need to plan your turns wisely to try and mitigate it. Loved it and can see that it will make a great solo experience.

This (and CC Med.) is one of my two favorite games, the other being Close Action.  I almost always have a good game whether I win or lose.  Since I usually play my son, aged 15, I lose the preponderance of my matches against him, running now at about 5 wins out of about 55 games we've played.  I know I'm not that bad, it's just that he is extraordinarily talented at board games.

VERY tentative rating after 1 game.  Unsure of how the cards would cause the game to play, I came away [i]very[/i] impressed.  I can't wait to play again.

Update 12/28/06: Raised half a point to 8.5 after two more games.  Incredibly fun and fast, and incredibly dynamic.  You're never out until the game ends.  Gives a good feel of what I imagine the chaos on the ground could feel like.

Update 12/31/06: Raised another half point to 9.  I can't get enough of this game.  After a couple of plays, the flow of the game is nice and quick and the action and tension is always there.  At the moment, this is a game I keep wanting to play.

Including this one, I've only played two squad-level WWII games, the other being [b]Squad Leader[/b].  These two games inhabit different game spaces.  SL is the heavier game; it's more methodical and allows players to come up with and enact a plan.  CC is more chaotic; it attempts to show the chaos on a battlefield at the low level.  I haven't found this to be a hinderence; indeed, planning with what you have and for opportunities is incredible in this game.  Also, as it's card-driven, it's fast; there aren't a bunch of steps you may or must do each turn.  Your orders and actions (as well as random events) are all determined by cards, so the pacing of the game matches the chaos.  All in all, it's one heck of a fun, addictive game that produces an exciting, believable narrative.  I can't wait to play again.

A great game that has a lot of small annoying features. 

Sniper! trigger is just too random (determine random hex and break one unit in or adjacent to that hex). I think it should be implemented like the Suppressing fire event (suppress one unit in the LOS of a friendly MG) that rewards good positioning of a machine gun. According to the rulebook the Sniper! trigger represents things such as friendly fire, panic or dirt in the eye. Ok, it may be realistic to model such things but it is not very rewarding when your opponent gets some dirt in his eye and dies compared to when you cut him in half with your machine gun.

Air support event: people die in a random hex. Lame.

Élan event: increase your surrender level by one. The scenarios in the playbook tend to drag too long. This makes them even longer.

Battlefield Integrity: Victory points for each of your opponents eliminated units. When you are behind this does almost nothing. When in lead you get further away. Bad.

I gave this full 10. Despite of these annoying features it is a very fun game. The card driven order/action system works. Playing each of the three nationalities is very distinct. Rulebook is great. Maps look good.

I'm drawn to this game in a wierd way.  There's a few things I really don't like about it, yet so much that I love about it.

The components are great, from the awesome maps to the huge variety of infantry units and weapons.  It's easy to learn, and easy to play, with some nice safeguards against lousy swings of luck.  The game communicates nicely the tension and drama of warfare, as the action tends to happen in short bursts followed by periods of anticipation.

However, something about the makeup of the decks that determine your actions in the game leads to long stretches of fishing for specific cards just to get your squad to run accross a road, or shoot at a stationary target right in the open.  It makes for a kind of choppy and overly long game.  It's just short of excellence, which is really a shame.

Played at GMT East. A guaranteed hit. Combines the entertainment of a card game with the tactics of a wargame in a format that should appeal to players who like both kinds of games. Playtime of less than 2 hours means you can get in a quick game or several games during an afternoon. Game will be expensive, but lots of value in the box (Russians, Germans, and Americans, plus lots of scenarios for each).

Won't get the BGG rating it deserves because lots of hard core WWII simulation fans will try it and not like some of the abstraction decisions. Also no solitaire options (although ease of play and VASSAL should make finding opponents not too difficult). But, for me, if I was stranded on a deserted island with a friend and only ONE game, this would be my choice.

Mmh... nice looks, but the gameplay is disappointing. Even the most basic actions like move & fire are card dependent. Also, squads are extremely resistant to enemy fire and recove easily. 

As a player, you feel subject to your luck in card draws - and that is no basis for an enjoyable game. It's a pitty for such a new concept.

Upgraded to a 10 after six plays.  I would play this game anytime, anywhere.  I would play it on a boat, and I would play it with a goat.  I would play it here or there, say, I would play it anywhere.

Great fun, great replayability, great sense of being there.  Randomness but much depth of strategy and the game rarely devolves to the "lucky" player winning because it all evens out.  My favourite tactical game ever and nothing else comes close.

I'm going to go ahead and conclude that CC is very nice but not for me.  The grafting of a card game onto a hex and counter game (in a way that is just that, and not a typical CDG) really is annoying.  I know I'm not a skilled player or anything, but it doesn't make me want to become one either.

Regarding narrative, it's really nice, but soloing the game is not interesting because it's more-or-less a card game at that point.  I don't enjoy soloing Magic the Gathering and the same applies here.

The first war game that I have played and really fallen in love with. The learning curve is steep at first but levels out very quickly. After two or three play-throughs, you realize the brilliance of this system. The card- driven nature of this game allows a brilliant range of random events which add huge amounts of flavor but rarely spoil the game's balance. Victory is always earned by the player who moves and positions their forces thoughtfully, focuses on their objectives, and budgets their card usage.

Combat Commander: Europe is one of my absolute favorite games. It is not only fun but cards combined with game play make for a great story.

Is it the most realistic treatment of WWII. Perhaps not. But I don't care--even if I am a professional historian who has dabbled in military history -- in both publications and as a fellow at West Point. I can play this with my pre-teen son and have a blast---quite a bit of complexity without hurting the brain. The introductory game is a great way to learn the game---it is basically a walk-through of the game with a "stacked" deck. One walkthrough game and we were ready to go.

Rarely do the games last for more than 2 hours but the yelling and screaming that can go on during the game makes it seem like far less. Once you get the hang of it, the game moves quickly.

The lack of vehicles don't bother me in the least...again, perhaps because my primary concern isn't simulation.

That said, some critiques decry the lack of control because of cards...being unable to move, etc. Or the chaos and wild swings of fortune that can occur. All I can say is that having ready accounts of military history from many different eras, the one constant on a battlefield is chaos and irrationality. War is not always logical or clear with perfect information and intelligence....something gamers don't often remember.

Without a doubt, this game has theme and narrative more than any other wargame that I've ever played! I can't recommend it enough.

Good quality components and some interesting scenarios.  I'm not sure what to make of it yet as the game seemed overly influenced by the cards and in what specific order you get them.  There seemed to be too many times where me and my opponent went for several turns each discarding and refilling our hands because we couldn't actually "do" anything.

It was very frustrating to traverse a well organsied defence and move into attack positions only to go for about 7 turns without drawing a fire card.  By that time, there was nothing left of my attacking force.  I understand the confusion of battle, but this seemed a little too reliant on luck.

Having said this, I did denjoy the game I am more than willing to play it again.  I will just put this down to poor luck and perhaps not understanding the rules enough.

This was one of those impulse purchases and I'm looking forward to playing it. The thing is that I tend to learn rules by reading them in bed at night so that they can soak in as I sleep. I then read them again before giving the game a go, and I find this helps. The problem with CC:E is, I can't stay awake long enough to absorb any of the rules. I've been trying for a week now. I guess I'll just have to go through this one when I'm wide awake and run a mock skirmish.

Another point: though I think the cards are great - very high quality with clear and appropriate artwork - I can't understand why people think the counters are of such high quality. I think they're thin, flimsy and prone to tear, plus the supplied counter tray isn't nearly adequate to carry them. The die-cutting isn't fantastic, and the tiles needed a lot of tidying and clipping.

I know I don't have much experience of owning hex-and-counter games, but if this is what a high-quality example is like, I won't be buying many more. Call me a chrome-whore, but I like bits that feel good, and that I have confidence will last.

Yes, gameplay's the thing, but I'm shallow when it comes to bits.

[Update:] Wow. This is a real "Shit Happens" game. I haven't, to date, played anything that's quite so chaotic, where picking up a new card from the deck gives you an itch of anticipation in your fingertips. So much so that I don't think I've really understood it, so I've loaned it to someone who is much more into rulebook absorption than I am.

That said, as a first solo impression I really like it but, other than variances in the Fate Decks, I don't know what CC:P or the other expansions can offer. This, plus the fact that I'm not thrilled by the components in what is an extremely-expensive-for-what-you-get game means I probably won't play, or even look at, the others. My main reason is that I might be tempted, but I can't justify the expense on this one, nor the time to read their rule variants. CC:E will have to be enough.

[Update:] This game takes a while to play - 3 hours each for the first two scenarios.

Having had a few goes through now, I do enjoy the game; however, I wonder whether its thrill is sustainable - after all, there's so much about it that's luck. Sometimes, you just don't get the cards you need. Last game, because of a series of TIME events meaning I had to shuffle like it was Dominion, I went six turns without a Recover order being available. This meant that my opponent was beating the shit out of me with attacks and Rout orders and I couldn't rally.

Whilst I prefer to win games, I'm not a sore loser, but it does frustrate me when the game gets in the way of any player. I don't mind games where dice are rolled or "you play with the cards you're dealt", but this was out of control. I'll write that one off to experience - sometimes things just don't go your way - but will be monitoring the game to see if this is recurrent. I think there's too much luck in here though for it ever to be a real favourite. It's good, but not exceptional.

Finally bought into this system...I think it's pretty clever, it's a war movie tactical game more than some hardcore sim of tactical combat, but that's fine. Very interactive, with 'interrupt' type card actions.

Pretty obviously inspired to some degree by both Squad Leader and Up Front. I love the unique maps (rather than the geomorphic maps in so many other tactical games), and the large hexes, and the low piece density. The small map footprint is also appealing. Takes perhaps slightly longer to play than you'd expect? Not certain.

One thing I love about this system is the sort of random victory markers. I think it would have been amazing if the original Squad Leader had included something like that. That, and the really clever random scenario generator are highlights. Not the be all end all tactical system, but deservedly popular, I'd say. 

Also, very well written, tight rules, which carries weight with me.

I'd have to play it more to know exactly how much I like it, but I'm quite sure I do like it. However, I think I like it much more as a game than a military simulation or exercise.

I'm a fan of dice, so I was somewhat put off by the dice-on-card idea. I'm not sure I unreservedly endorse the idea. But it seems to work well. The deck is also a resource, a timer and a random event generator.

I'm not yet sure how much luck is a factor. Certainly it is one, because you can be completely hosed by your card draw. I suppose if you're looking for a different sort of military exercise--you have perfect information and can just explore tactics without worrying about fog of war--then this won't work for you. On the other hand, if you're looking to explore chaos--men in position can't move, mission objectives are murky, random events interrupt play--then this will work for you.

One issue I have is that--at least at this scale--the assumption should be that a small unit will be able to move, shoot, etc. most of the time. Units seem to spend a lot of time doing nothing (waiting for orders?) when they should know what to do already. And you shouldn't need to call headquarters to get the okay to shoot at someone close assaulting your position. This game seems to want to make everything unpredictable, when certain things should be much more unpredictable than others. This isn't necessarily a flaw, just a design choice designed to create a certain effect. It works, but it seems less than ideal to me.

The best strategy for the defender can often be to just churn through cards as fast as possible to get Time events. It's gamey and detracts a bit from the immersion that I enjoy.

I'm also not enamored of the close assault mechanic, especially eliminating surviving units that exceed stacking limits. It seems like they (or at least some) should be able to retreat back to their original hex or be suppressed in their original hex or something. Maybe I've just been hosed one too many times by my opponent always having multiple ambush cards!

Complaints notwithstanding, this is still a [i]fun [/i]game, and that's really the most important thing. It does what it sets out to do, and it's a very clean, attractive, functional package that will provide many, many hours of fun for the WWII gamer. I just ignore the flaws (mostly.) They bump the rating down a bit, but it's still fun. It's just not massively fun.

I think I would enjoy playing it semi-regularly. I don't think this type of game could become my favorite, but it would be worth playing it now and again.

Absolutely brilliant. Not micromanaged like ASL, easy to learn and simulates the intensity of battle chaos perfectly.  As the rulebook says, no plan will survive the chaos of battle.  Don't start the game with a detailed plan that assumes perfect conditions. You have to be flexible and be able to improvise.  Although it contains 12 scenarios, the random objective chit draws ensure that every play is completely different.  This is my ideal game.

**************************************

Rating based on five plays.  This game is fantastic.   It can be random at times, but I think that adds to the excitement.   Every game really presents different situations and each scenario has gobs of replayability.  I really think this is one of the best games on the market.  I might upgrade this to be a 10 with some more plays.


*********  UPDATED 2009 **************

I really need to give the campaigns a shot, but I find myself less interested in bringing this to the table lately.   I think some of the other CDGs have caught my attention more than this.

I was shown how to play in about 15 minutes and I never once referred to the rulebook, so big points for accessibility.  
However, gameplay was an empty experience, without any of the narrative I've read so much about.  The cards generate a fair amount of chaos, which I'm generally in favour of, but this particular chaos is too often arbitrary and even nonsensical.

A good game for sure, but I have some doubt whether this would really enrich my collection in any relevant way. The cards do not seem that appealing to me, and having the random events in my own deck of cards seems like getting weird lookahead at future events (i.e., those that will not happen). I have already a couple of card-driven games with miniatures or blocks (not counters), and I could still move up to ASLSK if I want counters on hex-grid.

Update: Just returned to this to write a comment for how I should not be pursuing this... Apparently my younger self already came to this conclusion but the game ended on the want-list anyway. I think that C&C Ancients/Napoleonics gives me enough card-based tactical fighting. ASLSK and Band of Brothers give me enough WW2 skirmish and I do not think that restricting access to orders or having random events (beyond game mechanics and dice rolling) would make that any better.

I finally played this game at 2007 WBC. Someone was kind enough to teach me and another newbie the rules and supervised our whole game. That was so kind of him.
I think he was also having fun watching us both make mistakes and do crazy stuff.
After that, I decided to play it again with a fellow wargamer and we both enjoyed it. It's ASL with more uncertainties and maybe a little bit faster. Of course, the rules are simpler, too.
One thing I like a lot is that no matter what the scenario is, there's always several paths to victory.
All in all, a good WWII tactical wargame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Odd tactical WW2 game. 

Up Front works (due to the level of abstraction), but the map added to CC just makes the action depicted seem weird and very gamey... units under fire unable to move into cover because they lack a Move card, squads not firing at units advancing right at them across several hundred feet of open ground because they don't have a Fire card and so on.

Not that other tactical WW2 games are more "realistic" (ok, but just about all tactical games at this scale are much more game than simulation), but the narrative in a CC game is very often surreal.  Frustrating to spend several turns discarding tons of cards because you can't do anything with your current hand.  

Very difficult to execute standard fire/suppress/maneuver  (the Four F's) squad level tactics due to the difficulty in building the right card combos in your hand.  Often, even massive amounts of fire directed at a single hex is relatively ineffective... units can break and then recover fairly easily without any losses.  I don't like using the card deck as a random number generator instead of a dice roll.

Wished that the design used cards to provide random events and even combat resolution while using somewhat standard wargame mechanics for fire and movement, but alas, that was not the design that we have here.

The game in many ways, seems to almost play itself.

If you want a game about WW2 small unit tactics, best look elsewhere.  If you want a good game, play something else.

Combat Commander as a game system is a stunning achievement. I'm astounded at how it confounds and exceeds my expectations with every play. You might not see it until you've played enough for the rules overhead to mostly disappear, but this game is rich with narrative in a way that some so-called thematic games could only hope to achieve. Part squad-level tactical combat game, part experience game, the key to enjoying this one is to embrace the chaos and just watch the story develop.

Lastly, this game has the honor of what I consider to be the best rulebook ever.

RATING: 10
The best hex based wargame ever. A cross between Squad Leader and memoir 44 with the 'real' feel of the former and the fun aspect of the latter. CC is a card driven wargame with lots of random mayhem to cope with whilst trying to achieve game objectives. Each game played is so narratively strong that I can remember details from games played months ago. An absolute gem!

My favourite war game. Enough detail, and the rules are simple enough. The card system makes for some pretty tough decisions. However, the game is a tad too long for what it offers, I feel - something like Antiquity just seems to have more meat and decisionmaking goodness in the same timeframe.

Indifferent.

I wanted to like this more than I did, but I think this is probably because either 1. it doesn't play that well solo, or 2. it is a tactical-level game (few of which play well solo), or both.

I'm definitely going to play it a few more times to get a better assessment.

This is coming from a person who owns only a couple of games that can be called "wargames," and no GMT games other than Twilight Struggle.  And I've never played ASL.

CC:E is certainly not simple, and the rules can, at times, be a bit arcane.  But if you're willing to put up with a learning curve it seems this is a pretty good squad-level game.  The hand management really gives a rhythm to the game that I enjoy.  You have to choose carefully what you will do with the cards in hand, as only 3-4 orders can be given in a turn, and then only if you have the right cards.  Lots of neat mechanics make this what I would call an "elegant" game - that is, there are many things that can be represented with a finite set of rules.  It's amazing how many purposes the deck of cards has - die rolls, random events, counterattacks, modifiers to die rolls, random hex position, artillery scatter, and of course, an order.  I'll play again, and I might even buy it.

My tactical squad-level WW2 of choice. The winning points in my book are:
- cinematic tension, you can always do something (even if it's not what you've planned) with some weird stuff happening in between;
- immense replay value, thanks to the built-in scenario generator;
- huge support, and availability;
- more than anything else, it's really FUN to play.

Fascinating card-driven design that I instinctively like more than ToI for its elegance and boldness of design.  But, based on one play, it feels terribly chaotic and gamey regarding hand management.  There's something not quite right about actual firing of squads, and my win felt like I had little to do with it.  But I'd like to play more, and I definitely want to try the expansion.  It's an exciting game concept, if only I felt that I had more control.

A fun infantry squad wargame. It isn't fast by eurogame standards, especially because of frequent rule referral unless the players are very familiar with the rules. However, the card system is a great idea and adds a lot of chaos and and keeps both players engaged even when it isn't their turn, which makes the game feel fast.

The rulebook is OK. Despite what others have said, I think the rulebook could have been laid out differently for the unitiated to the usual GMT style, which appears to assume quite a bit of knowledge about card-driven games. The rules make for a fun game but aren't intuitive and have quite a few exceptions to consider and quite a few rules are easily forgotten (eg sniper checks on broken weapons). Even after 3 games under my belt I still find myself referring to the rules frequently, which I suppose will ease after a few more games.

Quick to setup and play. I love the multiple fold-out maps; each has a scenario with specific objectives and special rules, or you can use them however you want.

I find myself wanting to make scenarios with this game - it's very easy to do so in a balanced way.

I think CC:E strikes an excellent balance between brain-burner and light, quick play. You can't play just one game though. Just like Cheetos. Or Ruffles. I forget.

Randomness abounds - be forewarned. If you can't enjoy a game that you aren't in complete control of, don't bother.

It's really stressful because it's one of the few games out there I cannot help but take really seriously. The game is head to head tactical combat, and the card driven system is one of my favourite. It gives you randomness instead of dice rolling, but it's within a given set of bounds which is excellent. Each faction is different and the scenarios are manifold. I really, really like this game.

This is the tactical WWII game that does it for me right now. I used to play ASL but coudn't keep up with the hard work required to deal with the rules. I used to play and love Up Front but for some reason I no longer feel the need to play it anymore. CCE is a very successful combination of ASL and Up Front with the addition of many innovative mechanisms. 

The level of chaos that can occur is quite high. I have absolutely no problem with that since every war story that I have read is full of that element. The rules are very clear, well presented and complete. They do demand 3-4 playing before one totally familiarizes himself with them. But after that you can play that game without needing to go back to the rulebook. Finally, the fun-factor is just very high. And that's the most important element in the games that I enjoy.

Combat Commander is fun to play.  However...
  
After wasting several turns discarding worthless cards, I'm finally able to fire on the Germans in a victory point building.  My leader activates three hexes and I decide to fire each squad seperatly.  I fire and the Germans are broken.  Great!  I fire again and the Germans generate a hero.  Ok, no problem.  I fire at them a third time and the squad goes from regular to veteran status!  The Germans went from broken to invinceable uber-unit in an instant!  What's going on here?  Additional fire on their hex actually helped them!  The Germans easily rallied the next turn and fired right back using "spray fire" which broke every one of my units.  I was not able to rally them for the rest of the game because I didn't have the right card.   Apparently my commander decided it was nap time.  In fact, I was unable to draw the cards I needed to do anything purposeful. My opponent could have walked right up to my units and bitch-slapped them and I wouldn't have the cards to react.  Meanwhile, one of my squads far removed from the action decides to become supressed thanks to one of many random events.  

Yes, I understand that combat is chaotic and planning goes out the window when the lead starts flying.  However, I think CC is unrealistically chaotic, gamey, random, and luck driven to the point of being absurd. I like how snipers pop up, but other things seem to appear like magic. 

Update: Years after my introduction to CC:E, I played it again and, knowing what to expect, I had a blast.  I look forward to many more games and my rating has been revised.

Wanted very much to like CC:E as I'm a fan of chaos mechanisms in wargames. CC:E can be wildly arbitrary, which is fine for some I guess. In playing two consecutive times with the same opponent the box handed the victory to one of us--where's the satisfaction in that? Our feeling was, "Oh, I won[or lost]? Great... There goes two and a half hours of effort."

The problem isn't randomness; it's the degree of randomness. 

CC:E is very provocative however. Reviewing it caused me to re-evaluate what I want to see in a wargame. (I don't think this is an easy question for most gamers to answer, actually). For me, as far as tactical games are concerned, I want to learn something about actual tactics. Postgame sessions of a tactical should be revelatory of mistakes and the reasoning behind calculated risks. Yeah, yeah it's just a game--but some games lead to more intelligent or profound after action reviews than this one, rather than escalating rationalizations for bizarre occurrences. 

Why are there tactical doctrines in the first place? Because weird stuff happens. But CC:E doesn't teach anything other than "combat is random." A good tactician knows this but also knows that combat is less random than you might think.

The price is also too high. Hopefully I can trade it off before CoH occupies this niche.

RATING: 10
It's a 10. I want to play all the time. Just the right mix of strategy, tactics, and chaos to bring me ultimate enjoyment. Rules are fabulously presented and I rarely need to consult them during play, which is saying something for a wargame. Production is great, beautiful counters and maps, awesome big fat box, and good cards. Online support is fabulous. You can usually get an answer to even the most obscure question from the designer himself within hours. 

Just plain and simple fun.

I love the card-driven wargame system, and while Combat Commander: Europe is not a card-driven game in that strict sense, it uses its cards in such wonderful ways that it captures much of the feel and the excitement of a CDG.  This is a game in which the cards are everything.  They are your dice, your actions, your orders, your events, and your randomizer.  And the card management aspect that this introduces is truly fantastic.  The game is deep but streamlined, and it plays very well and rather quickly.  I love that it has eschewed the traditional UN symbols on the chits for more graphically pleasing representations of the soldiers, and everything about this game is well made.

The game can be frustrating if the cards are preventing you from what you want to do, such as not giving you move cards when you want to move, or fire cards when you want to fire.  This will definitely bother some people, but I actually enjoy the choices that it forces you to make.  This is definitely one of those "make the best of what you have" games, and some people will be turned off by that.  But if you enjoy maximizing your sometimes limited resources, you will love this.  A fantastic game.

Rated after two plays: I really wanted to like this game but the order cards are too restrictive (in both games I went through long periods with no functional cards and could do nothing); the game needs more double order cards like the move/fire card (they maybe should ALL be double) or some house rule to combat inaction.

It's no wonder this game is so well regarded on BGG. The game mechanics are great, and the 'story' that unfolds is almost always engrossing and tense. I even enjoy it solitaire, though, because of the importance of the card-driven mechanics, it really shines in head-to-head play.

My tactical board game of choice lately.  Obviously not as exhaustive or detailed as ASL, but it scratches that itch.  It is fun, fast, and easy.  Also easy to find opponents for because the game is just not as daunting to new players...or players that don't normally play wargames at all.

You show them the ASL rulebook and the laugh at you because they think you are joking.

I don't like being limited by the cards, and waiting to get cards I need. Card-driven games should have cards which can be used for several things, so that you don't lose flexibility. I like games which gives me options, instead of taking them away.

Fast, frantic, and fantastic squad level combat system. The system is inherently chaotic so if you want a chess like game go elsewhere.  But for this reason the scenarios rarely play the same twice in a row.

Good random scenario generator system.

RATING: 10
Really fun system for small-unit action.  I like playing this game a lot.  It might be a touch too random for some tastes (though I'm fine with it).  Lots of clever ideas in the implementation.  The only weakness I can think of is that it seems odd to have no options for any armor in the game.  A vehicle or two would be very appropriate for the scale and some of the scenarios.

Edit: upgraded my rating to a '9' after more plays.  Every game seems to be memorable!  Sometimes the events come off a little silly, but not that often and I love how the game plays out with so much tension and memorable moments.

Edit: Ok, up to a '10'.  The only game I like playing more is Combat Commander: Pacific, and that only by a smidge.

It's no ASL, but it scratches an itch that means I can play with my less obsessed WWII buddies - and - if I squint really hard, and let one eye wander a little, part of my mind thinks I'm rolling dice playing ASL instead.

Apparently its meant to be fun but I just find the lack of control that its card-driven nature creates unbearable. Yes, yes, I know, not always having your units do what you want is more realistic. But really, I prefer to have my units refuse their orders (see the proficiency roll in Ghost Panzer for example) and not my hand of cards... which in any case represents what precisely?

I'm no grognard it seems. I can see myself playing CC:E and enjoying it but I prefer games with more streamlined rules. I can't see myself playing wargame much heavier than this. Rules aren't that complicated but there are many modifiers etc. that at least I easily seem to forget. Playing itself is a nice mix of skillful moves, cardluck and random events. 

About components: I'm not really a fan of millions of counters but I really liked cards and how they are used multiple ways. Not only they have two different selectable actions/action modifiers but all cards also have event/dice roll/hex that are needed more or less during the game. Using them this way felt instantly natural.

Fun mechanics. Simulates nicely the lack of total control on the battlefield. Might be frustrating on a occasion but really rewarding next time. I've played 50  games and expect to play a lot more.

The game has some minor issues with random scenario balance but these come up rarely and can be avoided by players familiar to mechanics.

There was a lot of rumors about this game and the idea of a "pocket-ASL" was exciting. Unfortunately this game can give a good appeal to non-ASL players only. There is too randomness with the cards and some melee can have drastic results. The packaging is very good, you have a lot of scenarios, many expansion possibility, but at the end the enjoyment seems to be reserved to non-ASL players. Sorry guys, a scenario of ASL is not much longer and you can play with a luck factor that is about 1/10 of CC. True, you have to spent 12 times the time necessary to learn CC... it's a question of taste

The more I play it the more I appriciate the card-play system of giving orders to squads and the random elements that pop up throughout the game. Every scenario tells a story through them if your willing to let it. Yes, even here can be wild dice-streaks where one player just gets high scores and other one just manages low ones, but at the same time - even when your down and seems its impossible to win, there's always possibility. I've seen some crazy comebacks where I was thinking its in the bag. Most excellent tactical masterpiece.

Met the designer (He is an awesome guy! his wife rocks too!)

I would consider purchasing this because of the quality of the graphics and components. The personality and attitude of the designer. The reputation of the publisher.

I would not purchase this game because in my opinion:
It is a CDG and *I* don't believe that there is any way you can truly build a winning strategy for a specific situation as you will always be subject to the luck of the draw for movement as well as for combat. In dice driven Squad/Platoon level games, the dice don't control movement, so you can build a strategy that you have control over when it comes to achieving your objectives. True you have no control over the combat results or the morale of your troops, but that is more historical to me than anything that uses cards.
2: It is another ASL/Advanced Tobruk/Panzer Grenadier/Lock and Load/ ASL Starter Kit/ Panzer Leader/Panzer Blitz style game; and while imitation is the highest form of flattery, do we really need another?

If CCE were a tool in your arsenal to introduce more gamers to the hobby because of it's easy learning curve then I would expect it to be rated 10 across the board. However, for grognards (war gamers not Euros)when the available gaming dollars we have to spend is in most cases limited, can we afford to use them to purchase a system that is a very close relative to something we most likely already own?

If you are not a platoon/squad level gamer then this is definitely one of the two games I would choose as a vehicle to get into that level of gaming.

I don't undetstand why this game is so succesful. Played three times and I find it a very silly game. It is the system that play for you; In my games I did more damages with events than taking decisions. Everything is random, snipers are an hell. Of the same author much better is Fighting Formation; a pity it has not expansions (rumors say it could be possible be one very soon!). IHMO better spend time with FF than with combat commander

Feels modern, first of all for the "moderated dice rolls" and the rapid fuent card driven mechanic. I don't have that much experience with tactical wargames, but it seems I'm a more traditionalist type of gamer. I'd prefer CoH, for example. Easy to learn.

Seems like a fine game (and system), but after playing through the first two scenarios I doubt I will be playing again.  Up Front does a better job of giving me the card-driven "fog of war" and uncertain command elements, and I just don't want to bother with counters and the old ASL-like LOS checks any more.

Never got a chance to try this. I got a great deal on it, but before I could play it I spotted a trade offer I just couldn't pass up--CC:E for another game and two expansions. It's just as well, though, since I'm committed to the Lock 'n Load series now and CC:E would just be a distraction.

RATING: 9
This is a fun, fairly simple, game on WWII infantry combat. The rules are easy to understand leaving the player to concentrate on what's important - the current, ever-changing, tactical situation and how to manipulate it to win the scenario. The game has a very nice narrative flow where the pendulum of fortune can rapidly swing from one side to the other normally leaving the result in question up until the final moment. The command control limits and the randomness will mean this game will not appeal to everyone but the game scratches my WWII tactical itch with five percent of the time investment that I'd need to learn ASL and covering eighty percent of what I want to play. It's not ASL and it's not trying to be.

Still the best compromise between the attention to detail of classics like Squad Leader, the innovative card play of Up Front, and the agonies and misfortunes of real combat. Combat Commander can frustrate sometimes, but it is never dull and never less than genuinely thoughtful about the challenges of infantry combat in the WWII theater.

I shied away from this initially because of the lack of armour, but when I finally chose it over Tide of Iron, I found that the lack of armour wasn't important - it's a brilliant game anyway. The use of the cards for multiple purposes (orders, actions, events dice-rolls etc) adds to replayablity, though the frustrations of not having the right combination of cards in you hand is constant!

You can't do everything you want on every turn, so you have to prioritise and hope you get the results you need to move on to your next priority.  However, even shots that seem certain to break or kill a unit can be influenced by your opponent playing an action card in your turn. When the game ends is never set in stone either, and leads to many cinematic "just one more push (turn)" type actions, when you a praying for the game to go on so as you can get that elusive victory point to win, whilst you opponent is praying for the game to end for the same reason. This variable time encourages the attacker to take the initiative, as he is bound to lose if he doesn't, because the defender usually starts off holding most of the victory points.

National characteristics are also built into the system without seeming overbearing, with the year the scenario is set in dictating troop quality and equipment.

Anyway, I can't praise this game enough, and the criticisms it received for being too random don't seem fair. Things go wrong in battles despite the best-laid plans (guns jam, people run away at the wrong moment), but if you use the wrong tactics, like advancing over open ground towards a HMG, then you will lose (opportunity fire can be punishing). I read somewhere that the 1st play of this for someone was like playing the original Squad Leader for the 1st time, and that struck a chord with me - it has that freshness which I remember from Squad Leader, and that is definitely no bad thing. 

Recommended (especially if, like me, you are dithering over buying it!)

There are people who are going to say that since it is not ASL, it can't be any good. You would also have people regurgitate the overstated argument about the fire card (or not having one) and you will have people who will bemoan the (sometimes) weird situations that happen during a game of CC (even though this same thing happens in every other tactical-level game) or even more loudly bemoan the lack of tanks in the series. 

And yet...

These people will be missing out on a whole bunch of fun that can be had with this game. From the excellently-written rulebook to the plethora of well-designed scenarios, there is a lot to like here.

As a Close Combat series fan who's way too scared of ASL,  CC:E pushes all the right buttons without crushing you under tons of baroque rules. My only (very minor) complaint is that the designers didn't dedicate more attention to campaign/linked scenario play - but as I understand, the Battlepacks partially solve the problem. Sweet, endless, decadent fun.

The most awesomest tactical WWII game ever, and I've played ASL.  This  one hits a sweet spot in terms of time, but has an enormous amount of detail and tactical options.  I do not mind the luck factor inherent in the card driven mechanic; to me, this simulates the uncertainty of actual combat, requiring players to "roll with the punches" and improvise.  Excellent game that I wish I had the opportunity to play more often, like, say, every weekend.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Interesting system with vast replay potential as the card play should keep the same scenario from ever really playing out the same.  

Small arms fire seems on the weak side as there is no way to kill a squad outright and most fire attacks seem to have no result (large firegroups are necessary to stand a chance at impacting enemy units through firepower).  Contrast that to melee which has a very simple system to the immediate elim of a squad.

While the cards bring the most fun to the game, they can also bring the most pain - card fatugue.  Be prepared for going long spells where you do very little that you want to due to poor card hands (or you could do something - just not nearly what you want to do!).

A truly great game that keeps you involved right to the end.  Don't worry about whether it perfectly models small unit combat, instead just enjoy the back and forth action.  Embrace the chaos ... sure your troops won't always be able to do what you want them to but this just adds to the fun.
Plays remarkably well solo.  Both hands are 'open' but I always move as if my opponent has a fire order and could shoot at me.
Always enjoy playing.

Tried to get my wife to play Lock'n'Loaded Heroes games or Nuklear Winter '68.
As we had played Memoir 44 before this seemed a comprimise as the rules seem pretty easy and there is the random element that can even up the playing field...

Looks good and also seems to have a lot of replay value in the box. Card management is a must and unlike Memoir I like the fact you can discard!

I've played this 3 or 4 times now. Every play I disliked it more, until now I've developed a really visceral dislike for the game. I just find it totally unconvincing in relation to any account of WW2 combat that I have come across. I find myself completely unable to imaginatively immerse myself in the action in any way at all - the silliness is too jarring. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Little  to no illusion of historical action remains as managing your hand becomes the sole focus and the map and counters recede into irrelevance.  A couple of nice ideas (hidden victory conditions, variable length that adds to the defenders victory points the longer the game goes) are wasted.  What might have been interesting in a deck-building game is frozen in place by a fixed deck to force some kind of psychological communion with the frustrations of command.  But it all just adds up to punctuated tedium.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A wonderful alternative to ASL for people who would like to play a quick tactical game. 

After 15 solo plays, I can say that the game definitely has legs and is also suitable for solitaire. Virtually all of the scenarios I have played thus far have been exciting and I would play them again in a heartbeat. Haven't even tapped into the random scenario generator yet, so I can see myself pulling this game out for a long time. 

Too bad there was no official solo system or guidelines presented, because I don't feel it would have been too difficult to do and the demand is definitely present. But I cannot penalize this game for that because it is very modest about its solo potential (rated 2/10 on the box).

OK, I have to eat some humble pie here. The talk of random events put me off getting this game for quite a while. To give credit where it's due though, they add colour to the game without making it FEEL random, and they aren't game-breakers.

Although my personal taste will always be for Grand Strategic games rather than squad-level, this game will definitely be a keeper for me. It is driven by multi-use card play (my favourite game mechanic), and to me this game is INFINITELY better than Conflict of Heroes (which I have traded)

The game index is AWESOME, and I didn't find the learning curve at all steep. Highly recommended.

After playing this once and getting burned (my unit got booted from my key objective by a random fire...) I thought more about it over the last year or so and decided that I like the concept still, even if the implementation left me wanting.  I must say that it was more fun solitaire than I expected, and I think it's because it's easier to just look at like a series of events that you're watching play out.  I've raised my rating from it's initial 6 since I realize that I was going into it with an incorrect understanding of what my role as the commander was.  I think I was just too used to games where I could actually plan my turns out a few in advance better.  Looking at it more like a commander simply trying to manage battlefield chaos (Chaos Commander anyone?) to get my objectives completed and realizing the the events that get triggered shouldn't be looked at with any sort of causal relationship to the die rolls taking place make it quite a bit more fun.

Took me ages to get going with this game. At first it seemed to bloodless but once you get into swing of game the strategies become much clearer (depending on which nation your playing).
What I like is that you can get it done in one sitting say 3-4 hours and it’s usually very tense as the game end is variable. Thus lots of replay ability.
Where I think they’ve missed a trick is that the pacific expansion came out later with some really good ideas (esp around rally) but these weren’t retrofitted back into cc Europe.

Combat Commander is an exercise in chaos gaming in which the chaos seems overwhelming. It certainly didn't feel anything like World War 2 combat. One imagines a real infantry battle as having an impetus that is ground down, or suddenly peters out into inertia. In CC it was difficult to get any impetus going at all. It was surprising how the game seemed to drag. For long periods of play, I felt unable to do much and discarded hand after worthless hand. Play was fitful and spasmodic. Doing anything 'tactical' invariably required multiple cards or card combos to pull off, and these combinations were rarely available. When things did rolling (if only briefly), then combat turned out to be very indecisive. Units in cover were tough to break and there always seemed to be sufficient recovery cards on hand to negate the effects of fire. Overall, this was a game too chaotic to exert any coherent control over. The lack of options made it dreary and uninvolving. The clear heritage, the descent from Up Front and SL/ASL, invites invidious comparisons. Colour me underwhelmed. The counters are pretty, though.

Of course there are a lot of random elements, of course there will be situations were the game will be decided by luck... but that's war for you! And this is a really fun game! You get to play around with flamethrowers, assault buildings, lay down wire, throw some smoke grenades, see heroes rise and perform great deeds... this is band of brothers stuff! Sometimes your plans will work. In others, everything will fail and you'll be forced to take desperate actions... and be lucky enough to get away with it! Really amazing design! 

Rating just keeps getting up!

Wuite a many things are abstracted in this game, but given the idea of being some mid-heavy wargaming with easy-to-teach rules, this one succeedes well.

The cards are quite compact. Amazing how many things can be put into one little piece of paper...

CC satisfies the wargame hunger quite well on those occasions you only have ~2-3h of gaming time. And because of the lenght, I'm giving this one a six, despite all its flaws (simplicities).

Best design ever played

"I only thank the heavens that 30 years ago the current philosophy of gaming just could not come out with a game system like CC. At the time a sort of "modernist" thought was dominating that wanted games to "simulate" everything, but just could not understand that the battlefield is fuzzy, and chaos is what they had to cope with. CC is a true postmodern game, that gets rid of the neat algorithms of the true battlefield and plunge players into the chaos of the real battlefield."

It's more Save Private Ryan than a simulation, and without the movie scenes going on in your head, filling in for a much more vast battle where a bit of shrapnel, friendly fire or a far away sniper feeling helpful may turn the tide even in the most unlikely of situations, it's going to feel random. But if you can visualize the hero breaking away from his team and running towards a nest of enemies hiding in foxholes with a machine gun, betting on the slim chance that they won't notice him as they are focused on the weapon team, and wreak havoc upon them, allowing the rest of the team to run and fight the nazis in melee, you definitely have an experience there.

Combat Commander produces a tense experience, punctuated by constant surprising setbacks requiring adaptive planning to accomplish objectives and often strings a series of significant challenges into memorable story arcs that resonate long afterward.

Sure it's a luck-of-the-draw card driven game with layer of die rolls adding to the uncertainty, but it's still a lot of fun. Lots of room for decision making and tactical play. Setting up in leader directed groups is all important but mostly it comes down to just doing the best you can with cards you have (including often discarding them for new ones) and enjoying the ride as it develops. Falls in between Battle Cry/Memoir'44 and real Wargames.

(The more I think about it the less this feels like a wargame and more like a card game with a war theme.)

Combat Commander uses cards to acquire orders so you can do something in the game.  A unique concept but I found it doesn't really work that well. 

The designers say this game is not based on reality as much as it is based on play ability. That is very true.  Lots of things in the game end up making no sense as to why they are happening.  So that is just bizarre for a war game. I play a lot of games using cards and non are as strange as this one.

I also found it very frustrating in that I didn't get an order that any normal combat situation would dictate that it could happen.  But I can't make it happen because the cards didn't come up to be able to do the obvious normal order that one would do.  

The game felt like a card game of limited actions wrapped with the disguise of a combat game with a lot of frustration and down right stupid things coming up.  

A 6 is a generous evaluation based mostly on art work, well written rules, and a lot of additions to the game.

The upside:
- WWII
- The feeling you get when you try to accomplish a mission with the troops and cards you have.
- It's FUN, even for non-wargaming standards.
- The production quality of all components.

The downside:
- Maybe it's better to have a teacher than to learn the rules for yourself (Great rulebook though).
- Has some rough edges (whick I believe can be mitigated with experience in playing it).
- Frustrating at times when you're not able to do an obvious and "normal" action for a given situation just because you don't have a card for it.

This game can be very frustrating if you are unlucky. At the same time there is a very nice narrative due to the events so there is a lot of action going on, but it can very well go all the time against you. If you can cope with that it's a fine game... I for myself are not always able to bare the randomeness.
My impression is that you have to base your actions based on your estimated which cards will show up, instead of being based on the given tactical situation on the board.
The abstract card mangement aspect does not fit the very detailed situation on the board from my point of view.

OK, it is more realistic than CoH, but it didn't do it for me. I really didn't like the diceless combat system and the frustration of dud hands, while rifling through the deck for an elusive fire or move card made it quite a tedious experience - yes, that's what infantry combat was about, the chaos and inability to plan and excecute your tactics perfectly, but as a gaming experience I was bored.

Hands down my favorite game and series. Will play any time, with one of the hundreds of GMT scenarios or using the outstanding scenario builder.

My first play was at GenCon 2011, and it's still in the rotation. Very playable with lots of maneuvering and decision points. The card driven format creates the perfect fog-of-war and makes a great narrative. Didn't think I'd like the pre-printed die rolls, but it keeps the game from feeling "dicey" like a lot of other tactical-level titles. Tension from the first turn through the end of the game. 

CC is an easy 10, and I've actually had to recalibrate the ratings for almost everything else in my collection. Own several squad-level WWII games, but CC is the one I keep coming back for. Recommend this title to anyone interested in tactical games.

RATING: 7.5
Reglas fáciles de entender y bien redactadas, pero me cuesta coger las mecanicas del juego. Hay momentos que aun teniendo buenas cartas, me entran dudas de como puedo con lo que tengo tomar ese objetivo o hacer tal cosa, me falta hilar las mecánicas para conseguir el objetivo.

Con la cuarta partida las mecanicas me han quedado bastante mas claras y con pequeñas consultas al manual todas las dudas se han resuelto, creo que no hemos cometido ningun fallo con las reglas.
El juego me gusta cada vez mas, hay que saber como gestionar tu mano y cuando retirar cartas que a priori parecen buenas pero que en los proximos turnos no tienen utilidad ninguna.
Subo la nota medio punto.

Si te gusta tener control sobre tus unidades y las estrategias a largo plazo, este NO es tu juego.Aunque el azar este compensado con las tiradas de dados de las cartas, el azar no esta controlado (obvio) y puedes sufrir una racha de mala suerte y tu contrincante una de buena suerte (tiradas bajas cuando hacen falta y altas también cuando hace falta), esto unido a que las cartas salen cuando quieren y que por ello no puedes hacer lo que quieres cuando quieres, puede dar lugar a partidas que provocan una gran impotencia en el jugador que sufre estos efectos, eso si, lo mismo te va fatal que en unos pocos turnos todo es maravilloso y sale perfecto.
Conclusion: las estrategias no son validas mas alla de un par de turnos y preparate a pasar de la sonrisa a la tristeza varias veces a lo largo de una partida.

Escenario 2 --> 1 vez
Escenario 3 --> 1 vez

I wanted to like this but I just don't appreciate the card driven aspect as much as others.  It is not the usual "I don't have a move/fire card", I can easily explain that to myself but I discovered that I really do not like CDGs.   I do admit that it is quite an interesting concept.

Have found the joy in this system finally!  Tense battles that can go either way until the bitter end.  The key is to have a "general" plan but make the best out of your current situation.  Great fun.

Played solo and had a blast.  Probably the only tactical level wargame that I will ever truly enjoy.

EDIT:  Hugely enjoyable, even solo.  I absolutely love the story-telling that grows out of the random events and shifting tactics as the game progresses.  The Fate Deck shakes things up so much it really produces games that evolve in unusual and exciting ways - for example, events and card draws will lead to that unit you set up on the flank because you didn't know where else to put it becoming the game winner.  Excellent stuff.

Includes 'Mediterranean' expansion, and additional scenarios from C3i 22 and 26, and scenario reference map from issue 26.

The rulebook is over-rated, in my opinion.   It is very much a reference, and this game engine badly needs a tutorial.

Quite a bit more complicated then Memoir or C&C:A.  First few games were a bit hard to get through, but once the rule system sinks in, it is a pleasure to play.  Game of tactics, after further plays I realized that I enjoy the strategic and operational level war games better.  Regardless, still a solid game.

I have switched to playing CoH which has a better flow of play in the game.  I would say that CC is more "realistic" (i.e. models the chaos of battle well); CoH is more fun!

RATING: 10
Hex and counters tactical combat game with Word War II in Europe as its theme, and squad-level in scale. The production quality is good for its genre, with lots of units (with good artwork), twelve scenarios and six double-sided maps. The orders, actions, events and rolls are all made through "fate" decks specific for each army (American, German and Russian). The random events that can occur in each game and its random scenario generator add to the fun and replayability. It's also rules-light by wargame standards, specially because it's card-driven, which also greatly reduces analysis-paralysis. There's (little) room for improvement, but there's yet to appear a better squad-level wargame.

The game is fantastic and highly recommended. 

It may not be perfect, but it's closer to be being perfect for this gamer than any other tactical WWII system out there.

The sense of chaos and the level of control (often lack thereof) feels just like it should. Strange things happen in battles and you find yourself needing to adjust.

The components are first-rate, and Lee's counters are very evocative.

Wonderful wonderful game.

CC resolves mostly around hand management, going through the deck and trying to create the hand you want. The gameplay just becomes overly procedural since you do the same things over and over again the same way each turn.

Historical accuracy is blown away with some of the very static game system elements and on the other hand very random occurances for each scenario. Running off the map to get victory points? There are just many possibilities for overly gamey gameplay that makes absolute no sense historically. 

Recovering units is way too easy. The best you can usually do with ranged attack is to break one or two enemy units. Your opponent will probably recover those units next round and effectively making your last turn "no effect". All that just makes a longer game with no extra contribution to the experience, quite the opposite. On the other hand melee is overly powerful and building up a hand of advance and ambush cards is the only way to cause major casualties in a shorter time frame. 

The exchange of fire could go on for hours since the game doesn't have a fixed number of rounds. The unfixed timer doesn't make the game any more historical, it just makes the game last longer which is not reasonable compared to the lighness of the game. If you add up the time for the setup and full game, the total session time probably averages at 3-4 hours or even more. Over 2 hours is just way too long for the lightness and the same way repeating player turns. This game shouldn't last more than an hour. You'll just do the same over and over again for way too many times.When you add up random snipers and events that don't necessarily make any sense, then you'll have something that doesn't make an enjoyable experience.

The game creates a random variation of a given scenario each time but when you add up some of the gamey, unhistorical and gameplaywise annoying elements then you don't have an accurate historical representation at any level. For example the Tolvajärvi scenario from the Mediterranean: The Russian convoy is ambushed in the first round but yet the Finnish player might have a poor hand and you can't even shoot at them. The Russian can just melee rush from the road to the woods. Really? Basically any Russian would be blown away with Finnish rifle fire. The Russians attack from the road and ambush the Finnish soldiers in the woods; it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

If a game represents history at any level at all in a given scenario, it really needs to have special rules for each scenario that modify the basic rules or add up special rules and that they make the scenario somewhat historical representation. Many wargames handle this very well but CC fails at this utterly. 

Overall I don't see CC gameplaywise enjoyable experience. It also fails as a historical representation. When you add up the overly long but yet very light, random and yet same way sequencing gameplay then I'm fully confident to say that CC is a game that I won't be playing in the future.

OK, looks like it's settling in as a 10. Nail-biting tension and some of the best narratives in my gaming experience are the norm. And the designers have managed to incorporate all sorts of variability and play texture in the wonderful variety of scenarios.

======================================================
Revised rating up again. The scenarios seem really well thought out. This is dozens of stories in a box.

======================================================
Revised rating upwards after recalibrating my expectations and playing with an experienced player. Saw a faster playing time and some enjoyable swings of fate. I can see potential for tremendous replayability in the variety of scenarios, nationalities, set-ups, and victory conditions.

Meh. Awkward marriage of hand management and tactics. Chaotic. Rather fiddly for the payoff.

I didn't like my first play as I felt I just didn't have control and then one of my men got shot by a sniper from a random card draw ?!?!! What the !?!?? 
I went away and read about it more and more and actually what I enjoy in wargames is a narrative played out and I returned to the game with a new perspective of managing my hand better and seeing the swings and snipings for what they were - narrative. After that I've enjoyed every game since. Not the greatest simulation but so much fun with the right attitude :)

A two player wargame for world war 2 on a very small scale (counters represent single officers, weapons or small squads). There are no vehicles, this represents small unit infantry engagements. The game is quite traditional but instead of a very lengthy rule book the players each have a deck of cards which gives the basic optins (Move, fire, Artillery, Recover, Advance (for close combat) and also brings in most of the exceptions through events and actions (representing snipers, hand grenades, automatic fire etc). 
It has an interesting pacing (lots of pauses and halts punctuated by dramatic unfolding action) which certainly feels like accounts you read of infantry engagements. Its biggest problem is that is makes no real concession to the non-wargamer so it it is still a minority product and the book includes no solo rules - which is something you really need with a wargame that has a lengthy play time.

This is not a bad game, but it isn't very satisfying.  The randomness takes away the feel of a historical simulation, and you end up with "just a fun game."  

The scenario results went as we expected, but during play, the random events often felt overpowering, out of context, and, well... too random.  

The random order availability via card draws are also dissatisfying. For some reason I don't dislike the mechanic in Memoir '44, where cards determine which troops can be ordered instead of the specific orders available.

My rating is based on one play.  In a nutshell, the game is a card driven Squad Leader lite.  There are so many elements of Squad Leader in this game (including the mapsheets which look like they could be color photocopies of the SL mapboards - which makes the claim in the rules that the mapsheet art was done by the designer seem a bit strange) that comparison with that game is inevitable. But it has so little in common with Up Front that I really can't understand how some of the comments here are making that comparison.  Anyway, forgetting about the other games, CC Europe was rather fun to play despite some lengthy bouts of discarding cards in an attempt to find something needed or even usable.  I'm giving the game the benefit of the doubt that in subsequent scenarios (we played the first one), the availability of more ordinance will make more cards usable, and therefore less need for seemingly endless discards.  The Russian player had a heck of a time inflicting any damage on the Germans who were in buildings or even woods.  But with only one play, it would be unfair to assume balance flaws.  Anyway, I like card games, card driven games, and wargames.  This doesn't really qualify for the latter, but it's interesting enough as a card driven game that I'll definitely be giving it some more play.

After many, many plays, I've upgraded my rating to 10. The game is now my favorite game of all time.

The best WWII tactical game hex-mapped, right for my tastes:

- Compact map size: doesn't need a huge table to deploy and the counter density is manageable

- An engine run by decks of cards for chaos, fog of war, random, events:
it creates a very fun narrative, every game is different

- Plentiful of historical scenarios available from the start and more with C3i magazine, Battle Packs and expansions: a Note Of Merit to [URL=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/86957]Resistance[/URL]

- More scenarios created with Random Scenario Generator

- Appealing graphic: GMT standard, maps have a very good palette/color/contrast, easy for the eyes

- Rules booklet very well written, clear, understandable , with an index. The milestone of the rulebooks

- One or two games can be played in an evening

Original and fun!  Different than ASL and many other card-driven war-games.  A slashingly good and fun time when you don't want the weight of ASL!

However, it definitely isn't as interesting or as drawing as ASL.  I'd rather play ASL if given an "A OR B" scenario.

RATING: 8
I like it. It's similar to Tide of Iron with the exception of the card driven mechanism which, in practice, makes it a very different game. The cards limit one's options, introduce luck and uncertainty, foil best laid plans, win battles and get men killed. The cards encompass orders, actions, fog of war, combat resolution (similar to Up Front) and random events in Twilight Struggle fashion.

RATING: 8
Rating pending a second play, at minimum an "8", but I was postively stricken by the seamless cardplay, the player agency, and the ablity of the game to tell such a compelling battlefield narrative.
***
Update: After another play, my sentiment is unchanged. For context, this is (so far) the only hex-and-counter war game I have played. It can be difficult to appreciate this game from just appearances, but what it lacks in visual appeal, it more than makes up for in rich narrative; providing battlefield drama that is, at times, almost cinematic in nature. Some gems from our first scenario play: Russian troops hidden in a nearby woods withstood sustained gunfire over the course of a few minutes, surging into an objective post and overwhelming the German troops within. German troops advancing strategically upon a Russian position, only to have three of their squads break due to a hidden sniper's attack. Half of the broken troops were then immediately routed off the battlefield. A final encounter between the two opposing sides culminated in a brutal melee by lakeside, leaving no survivors. 

I acknowledge that treating these events as such requires  a bit of leap in imagination, but I found myself naturally creating this narrative in my mind. In fact, it was hard NOT to feel immersed and invested in my troops, as the ingenious card-play seamlessly drove the narrative.

Chad Jensen has created a fascinating system here that allows for some truly memorable moments to be played out, within the timeless context of Axis and Allied conflict in the European theater of World War 2.

Game not that complex (rules wise) for wargamers.  I found it very easy to learn the rules and dive into a first game - making a few look ups as needed.  But after that first play, I found that the system just flowed together rather nicely without having to look up results on charts and tables.  The cards do dictate what you can do and as a result, doing well takes practice as one needs to manage the cards in hand to coordinate your units to achieve the desired results.  And even then, success in combat is likely to be the result of attrition and slowly wearing down the opponent instead of a single devastating blow.  A very tactical game with a good abstraction of the chaos of war via the many events, snipers, etc.  I like the decisions and the need (and ability) to respond to the changing situation on the map.  Initial plans get revised and new tactics tried.  A scenario can be played in one sitting (ranging from 2 to 3 hours on average) but even if I lose, I have a wonderful narrative I can relate about what transpired during those tense hours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very solid tactical wargame that combines some of the best features of games like Up Front and SL into a playable 2-3 hour game.  The cards provide a necessary chaos to battlefield that is missing from almost all tactical games--the negative is sometimes it is little too chaotic like when my men moved into a VP-bearing building which randomly burst into flames.  Shouldn't have thrown that cigarette into the ammo dump. ;)

RATING: 2
Rating after one play of Scenario 1 and one play of the "document destruction" battle.  The terrible static nature of our game left me feeling nothing at all like I'd watched some gripping WWII movie -- neither of the Band of Brothers/Private Ryan nor the Sgt. Rock/John Wayne variety.  I was terribly bored by the fact that units almost never stayed broken long enough to dislodge them, movement was stultified by the card rarities, and some of the events were not improbable, they were impossible (like the dead Russian squad magically appearing, broken, on top of my healthy German squad, or the Russian mortar team that teleported onto the back row, opposite the Russian entry row).

There are a plethora of aspects of this game that are downright annoying to me, but largely it just doesn't feel the way I want a tactical WWII game to feel.  Just not for me.

This game has no chance of dislodging plain old Squad Leader as my tactical game of choice.

Good fun game that gives a glimpse at the chaos of battle. The chaos does a good job of creating an interesting narrative. But the game is more game than simulation, or else I would probably rate it higher.

RATING: 4
CC has many nice ideas. Especially the Scenario Creator is a very good thing.
BUT I do not like the idea of needing certain cards to perform certain actions. Not beeing able to shoot (efficiently) on a target because you do not have the right card in your hand is rather frustrating. IMHO this system is better named 'Card-hindered' than 'card driven'. On the other side I can understand that people do not care about this problem and even like it giving the possibility to simulate some kind of fog of war and lack of perfect communications.
So the rating of 5 is a personal mark. Combat Commander seems to me a decent game which is just not for me.

RATING: 9
Love this game!

While incorporating traditional wargame concepts like hexes and counters, the player card decks result in real fog war unpredictability. You can never know just what your opponent is holding so movement carries unknown risks. Conversely, managment of ones own resources and timing is critical. Finally, the random events and die rolls yield narrative style play.

Lot's of fun. When Chad develops a larger scale game with vehicles, I'll be in line.

Great fun WW2 tactical game, playable usually in a couple hours, unusually clear well-written rules, great support in the forum by knowledgable players and occasionally Chad Jensen the designer.

It comes with 12 fine scenarios, but I have particularly high praise for the [b]random scenario generator[/b]. (And I wish more tactical games had good RSGs, or RSGs at all, for that matter. CC has spoiled me and raised my expectations in multiple ways!) I sometimes get the impression I'm the only CC player active in the forum who does not instantly auto-buy every CC expansion! I'm sure the expansions are great, but be aware that if you're not a completionist, or if you're just trying to save money or shelf space, then the random scenario generator [i]really does[/i] create an endless supply of great scenarios, so one doesn't [i]need[/i] to keep buying expansions to enjoy playing CC again and again!

[i]Comparisons with other WW2 tactical games:[/i]
Before CC I was playing Conflict of Heroes with a friend who owned it, and we both found we preferred CC. (But I am rather curious to try CoH again when its true solitaire module finally comes out, and CC's card-based core makes it notably less solo-friendly than non-card-based games for me, though I've tried solo CC a couple times.)

I've solo played some Panzer Grenadier, which is an interesting system, but notably slower and fiddlier than CC, so I doubt I'll ever convince a friend to play it with me, and I prefer CC.

I've recently started playing Band of Brothers, which has more simple elegant rules, but lacks the random event flavor and detail of CC, and like most tactical games, alas, lacks any kind of random scenario generator.

RATING: 6
There is no reason whatsoever to play this over Memoir 44.  Because of the randomness of the card draw (there are cards in the decks specifically designed to just clog your hand! how is that interesting?), the attack/defense rolls (a 2-12 modifier is a big range), and the events (it would be much better if these were universal-affecting events that hit both players rather than stupid sh*t like snipers), this game actually has much fewer meaningful decisions than M44, but takes 3 times as long. It does do a good simulation of foxhole warfare, where a squad refuses to move into oncoming fire - when I played the game, I often saw little point in actually doing anything. Now to be honest, maybe later scenarios with artillery support are better, but they don't do a good job of making introductory scenarios that make me want to play more.

I've played this game a couple of times and I really think I'm going to enjoy exploring it more.

It hits the tactical/chaos spot that I tend to enjoy in games. I'm a big fan of Up Front and, of course, that feeling is here in CC:E.

If only I could find opponents willing to play wargames more often.

----------

The game is highly tactical, with most of the strategy coming from initial setup.  It seems like attacking an army is ridiculously hard, and conversely, defending is easier.  I like that the game has a historical background to it and tries to keep true to the theme, but the gameplay just doesn't appeal to me.  Don't have a desire to play this one ever again.  War games just aren't my cup o' tea.  

Also doesn't help that I've never been a war buff, so the theme falls very flat.

Nothing really needs to be said that hasn't already been said about this clever and welcome Tactical WW2 game. Sure it doesn't have Tanks, but not all battles had Tanks present, and yes it can sometimes be chaotic (game-play wise), but that's part of its charm to me -never knowing what might happen next.

Also it can sometimes be difficult to kill enemy units so one must be sure to have enough FP to succeed. But in general a great Tactical WW2 game and my first ever, oh and the manual is probably the best in War-games so I hear, very well written and a refreshing change.

After 15 plays or so, I'm revising my rating upward.  This was by far my most played game of the last year, and will likely continue to be my most played game this year - I've still played only a fraction of the available scenarios, and the scenario generator will keep this fresh for a long time.  This game is frustrating in all the right ways.  I really enjoy the uncertainty that comes with the cards.  There are a few gamey abstractions, but it just works.  The rules are incredibly clear and complete, and the player aids are fantastic.

RATING: 8.5
At first I felt the card mechanic to be forced, and....well....mechanical. It in no way scratched my CDG itch like I thought it was going to. What the cards in fact do for you in the game is just limit your options on what you can do, not how much you can do. Normally you can activate 1 leader or a succession of leaders or x amount of spaces or whatever, and then move and/or shoot then melee/shock attack or whatever, then its your oppenents turn. In this game you can only move or shoot or assault if you have one of the corresponding cards. So if you don't have any "Fire" cards, then you're not shooting this turn, even if you can move all your units. Likewise with the "move" cards, if you ain't got any, you ain't movin', but you might be able to shoot. Sometimes, you just discard your whole hand cause you literally cannot do anything. That was sometimes frustrating, but at the same time it takes out alot of the AP and numbers crunching out of the game, and reduces the ruleset to something almost anybody could understand. I think what the cards take away as far as simulation and the natural ebb and flow of combat games really adds in playability and streamlinedness. Although I can see it getting kind of old if played too much.

***Update***
Bumped up to a 8.5 with further play. Card Mechanic is genius and takes alot of the "what should I do now" out of the game, as you only have a few options. The random events and such make it great fun to. For example, in my latest game I sniped one of my own units and my opponents sent Artillery down on himself. Game is not long enough for this to encite rage, as PoG or something would have it doing.

A real surprise. I bought this as a gift for my SO, who wanted a light wargame to play. I personally didn't expect to like it much - but I really did. 

I'm now almost always up for a game. I like the light-but-still present tactics, the effective portreyal of the limited options in battle, the story each game tells... It's pretty much everything I look for in a thematic game, as well as being a nice tactical wargame, and there's even space for some strategy in there too. 

The random game generator gives great replayability, and the huge variety of maps, sides, units and expansions avalible make the game even better.

Quite frankly, this is one of the best wargames I've ever played.

Played six times now in the space of six days, working sequentially through the missions (played mission 1&4 twice). I've won four times and lost twice, and I can recount the stories of each battle, with the little anecdotes of heroics on the part of my favourite leaders and heroes. Its the ability of the game to create these strong narratives that make it enjoyable. Its strange in that I really want to win when I sit down to play (which is rare for me), but when I lose I don't actually mind. This is because I love my little men and want them to live and beat up the enemy, but the game is so good you enjoy it whether you win or lose.

Right now I'm not in a rush to play anything else than this at the moment (which I did again, beating the Buckle. Yay for me :)).

Need to update my comment after playing every scenario at least once now.


OK, I HAVE played every scenario at least once now, mainly as the germans. All I know I can definitely say about this game is that, TO ME, it is revolutionary as far as wargames go by making the game the most important thing. However, I believe that it needs to be evolved to a more elegant state. I've dropped it down to an 8 because the little fiddly bits of the game make me ever so slightly doubt wanting to play it, even though I enjoy the game enough when I do.

RATING: 7
It's got your same basic ASL unit size and scenarios, but it's driven by a card mechanic that throws in a large number of random events and severely limits your control over your forces. While this has the effect of throwing some spice into the gameplay, it can also be odd at times to spend your turns fishing through your deck while enemy troops take a leisurely stroll right by your position. To me this cries out for some sort of reduced intensity fire option if you don't have a card, but that's not what they're going for in Combat Commander. If you want more control and realism then I'd suggest ASL - there's some good starter packs to get you going. If you want a smooth flowing card driven system that limits your options each turn, but injects some battlefield chaos and plot twists into the mix then CC:E is a good choice. Hard to get started, but once you've made the effort to learn the system it's a good little game.

After reading [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/22825]Tide of Iron[/url][/i]'s rules, it seems like these games are very similar to each other.  Both are simulations of World War II tactical combat and, in general, the players act in both as commanding leaders of a platoon of infantry and of some other company attachments, like vehicles and artillery.  Of course, the differences are also big between them, being the main one that [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21050]Combat Commander: Europe[/url][/i] is a card driven game with easier rules at first sight.  Nevertheless, both are very nice games that scratch real good the World War II wargamey itch.  Speaking of other things, [i]Combat Commander: Europe[/i] looks in a way like an upgraded and fortified [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10630]Memoir '44[/url][/i], which makes it a nice option for newbies or casual players, and, at the same time, its simplicity doesn't take away the depth and realism, which makes it a good pick also for gamers.  My rating definitively is going to get higher as I play the game more often and start to see the different strategies and combinations.

I played this a fair amount and it never really clicked with me.  I had several issues with it.  First, I did not like the lack of control.  I often found myself frustrated by not being able to do basic things like move or fire because I did not have the right cards.  I don't mind that in shorter, lighter games like Memoir, but there is too much chaos for a 3 hour medium weight wargame.  At least with a true CDG like Washington's War you can always use a card for operations if needed.  Not true here.  A second problem is that the victory conditions seemed too gamey to me.  For example, you could score points by moving your men off the edge of the board.  They would later reappear on a different edge.  That just seems weird.  A third problem was game length.  Our games lasted 3 hours +, which is too long for a game as random as this.  A fourth problem was that it seemed too hard to kill enemy units.  It was hard enough to hit an enemy, which would normally just break them.  And then after you broke them, they would usually rally before you could score another hit.  From a game perspective just slowed the game and gave me the feeling of being in a knife fight using butter knives.  This game is one of my bigger disappointments.  I really wanted to like this game and invested a fair amount of time in it.  

UPDATE April 2013:  Tried this again and still disappointed.  This game just does not do anything for me.  I don't know what others see in it.

Played as the Germans in the Fat Lipki scenario my first time through. It seemed it was all the Russians and my Germans didn't seem to stand a chance.  For the most part, I just couldn't get any move cards and seemed destined to sit in the there discarding my hand, being slowly picked apart by superior forces.  However, a few things went my way, including all of my hidden VPs being in an objective I held.  I was able to hang on and finally made it to sudden death. When the points were tallied the Germans, battered as they were, managed to pull off a victory.

All in a all a great game where planning is good and being able to adapt is critical.

Combat Commander: Europe is just plain fun.  The rules, cards, maps and player aids are superb.  Tightest written rulebook of all time.

Scenarios included are solid.  The Random Scenario Generator, however, is the foundation of the system and it is, as time goes on, the bedrock of the game.  Fantastic.

A note to those who miss tanks and AFVs: get over it.  This game doesn't need it.

Combat Commander really is Up Front crossed with Squad Leader.  Evolutionary, not revolutionary... but very highly evolved for that.  You lose the perfect control of SL but gain solid topography and visual nuance over UF.  Everything is very procedural, and no question was left unresolved by a quick reference to the rules, which are well-indexed.  I question the value of the Suppressed status vs. its rules overhead, and the way broken Weapons are fixed/eliminated seems a little wonky, but overall the seamless integration of chaos and tactics works very well.  The rules are tight, and Chad seems to have thought of everything.  I've played some randomly generated scenarios lately, and they are at least as interesting and cool as the "fixed" ones.  90 minutes is optimistic - 3 hours to learn the first scenario, and I have a hard time seeing play time get below 2 hours.  Easier to learn than Up Front, but not by much - not even remotely approaching Euro territory.

UPDATE: EARLY 2011
Having played a lot of ASLSK lately, and thereby seeing where a lot of bits of CC came from, I am less enamored of the way they are used here.  CC is still an interesting game, but it looks more Frankensteinish to me now.  The RSG alone is worth the price of admission.

UPDATE: LATE 2011
As I dig deeper into ASL, I have less patience for the oddness of CC.

One of the most creative designs I have ever played.  Combines the best of "Up Front" with a simplified "Squad Leader" feel of maps and units.  Replay value is huge and the game actually feels like you are living a movie or a real life unfolding of an adventure.  Some of the luck of the cards can seem extreme, but it is amazingly fun and tests your flexibility to the max.  A real winner in every part of the word.

RATING: 6
Up Front with maps and smoothed out rules (and that's about the highest compliment I can bestow on a game).  There is some SL in here as well, but the game plays much more like Up Front, and it has virtually none of the rulebook rummaging that goes along with SL or especially ASL.  In just about every case, the designer has opted for simplicity over minutia, and yet the overall experience feels very authentic.  I was a little worried about replayability when I saw the small map sizes, but every game has felt different and fresh to this point, and the scenarios are widely varied in terms of terrain and force types.  (I still haven't found one that has grabbed me like the old Guard's Counterattack, though.)

Update- I have always enjoyed playing this one, but I've soured somewhat on the way that chaos is modeled (it's not that I don't like chaos, but that I don't think the model here works properly).  It's fun to play, but there are better squad level games out there.

I'd like to try it if I was able to find other players, as I doubt it would work well solitaire. Also, after reading every review and comment I can find, I'm starting to doubt that I'd like the system. The amount of luck and chance involved creating absurd constraints sounds like it goes way beyond the plausibly realistic. I'm a sucker for nice design and production, though -- one of the main reasons I like board games so much -- and this game shines on that front.

Up Front meets Squad Leader. Playable in 1.5 hours? What more can I say? MMP has just lost many potential sales of an upfront reprint to his wee game.

How does it work? Players pick a scenario, set up their units and have a hand of cards to drive the game. The cards are fairly similar across the board and act to activate units to move, rout, recover, advance and request arty. There are also bonus actions that can supplement regular play as well as a die randomizer (2D6 x 72 rolls).

So far so good. However, while the game mechanics work fine, it seems to degenerate down to a level of burning cards to get the right one/s for the situation. Historical accuracy is sacrificed for playability and this often results in strange results. (EG: Walking wounded can end up 'teleporting' a lost unit onto the board, one might get a high scoring secret object next to where they setup units and score easy victory points).

The rules are brief but leave room for much ambiguity (EG: What happens when a moving group takes op fire and breaks?) and games seem to take longer than advertised. I think that trying to mesh SL and Upfront is a good idea in principle but CC:E ends up being too ambitious and somewhat of a hit and miss.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] One play so far. I enjoyed it; nice medium-weight squad level tactical infantry combat game. The card system adds some randomness, but the system is well designed and is more palatable to me than the M44 system, for example. I need to write up an SR for it.

Update: played twice more. I definitely enjoy this game. The vagaries of card draw almost add to the pressure to manage your orders and actions effectively, in a way so much more satisfying than M44. Bumped rating up to a solid 8.

Boy, did I ever have a bad experience with this one!  First of all I'm not a big fan of most World War II games or a lot of tactical warfare games, although I've always been a fan of the game "Ambush!" and tend to think "Band of Brothers" is probably the best thing ever filmed for television.  I think my Russians spent 4 1/2 hours shooting two heavy machine guns.  Maybe it wasn't that long, but it felt much longer than that.  They didn't scratch a damn thing!  So I ask my instructor, if I need to move the machine guns up.  No, apparently there's no bonus for being closer.  My Russians can only kill Germans bare-handed.  That doesn’t feel like World War II to me!  The game definitely needs a pair of dice.  The "cards used as dice" feature is just silly.  There was no artillery in my scenario, so half the cards were useless.  The artillery cards could not be omitted since that would violate the 36-card multiple needed to replicate all the rolls for a pair of 6-sided dice.  We must have had 20 sniper cards that were activated during my game.  They seemed to be everywhere.  That made no sense.  Most of the game didn't make any sense to me.  My opponent and I spent most of the game discarding our hands and waiting to acquire fire and movement cards.  This game seems to take some of the worst aspects of the Command and Colors-type games and makes them worse.  If I remember correctly, I believe you can use the cards in most of the Command and Colors-type games to either move and/or fire.  The problem with this game is that the move and fire cards are split, making your troops much more difficult to command.  If you're out of fire cards, you can't even shoot a couple of troops running across an open field.  This type of card system might be okay for a game like "Bang," but it seems quite inappropriate for a two-player game with a more serious theme such as this one.  At one point I attempted to place two counters in the same hex, probably not the best tactics, but this is not allowed because all soldiers in this game are apparently colossal fast bastards sort of like Mr. Creosote in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life.  If they can't move or shoot properly, perhaps they could explode on the enemy by attempting to digest a solitary thin wafer.  

UPDATE: The more I think about it I think a lot of the game's problems can be solved by replaced the card system's use of dice with a pair of actual dice.  This would allow players to toss out cards inappropriate to a scenario which would speed up the game.  I also think that a player should have a chance to move or fire without having an actual move or fire card.  I would say that any player should always have about a 83% (5/6) chance to fire and a 50% chance to move at ANY time.  I can understand a soldier's fear to move into a dangerous area, but the inability to fire a weapon seems rather ridiculous unless the soldiers are really pinned down.  The sniper cards also seem to be a bit too much in many ways.

UPDATE #2:  Another thing against the game is that the card "dice roll distribution" is fixed, meaning that only one 6-6 or 1-1 will appear for each set of 36 cards, killing off much of the randomness.

Although this game is maybe the most elaborate and innovative wargame in recent years, it has issues.

The game is frustrating because sometimes (or when you're unlucky; all the time) your squads can neither shoot nor fire. Some people argue that this is realistic, - I don't have any combat experience to dis-/prove this point, but from my understanding an elite unit accompanied by a competent leader should be able to move when there's no enemy unit in sight. The same goes for a MG in a prepared defensive position which should be able to fire at advancing units when manned by an attentive crew and when the gun is neither jammed, unloaded nor otherwise restricted in its functionality.

Defensive positions are almost impenetrable. As opposed to other games, satchel charges, panzerfaust rockets and even artillery strikes leave houses or pillboxes unscratched. Preparing units for close combat against defenders in these fortifications is a pain in the arse, because you need a good set of "Advance", "Fire" and "Movement" cards, which is very hard to build. And don't get me started on melee combat.

Furthermore you only lose units through bad luck. You can have a unit fired at by an enemy flame-thrower and this is no problem when you have a "Recover"-card at hand.

The system is also very gamey. Firing at units without any chance of success, just to use up cards and "advance in time", is a plausible tactic, as is blatantly ignoring one's objective to move units past the enemy.

The many possible random events spice up the game, but some are just illogical in some situations.

The game is a really neat design, but it fails to simulate combat in WWII, when compared to [gameID=1035] for example. Compared to this old shoe, it's also only slightly more fun. Another war might really fit better, I thought about WWI trench warfare, but this in not relevant to this comment.

This rating is very subjective and displays the disappointment I had missing this game's supposed greatness.

I might want to try [gameID=28181] though, if it contains some rule changes or a different composition of the cards.

Sikerült kipróbálni az egyik top wargame-t, amiben kimondottan közelről látjuk az eseményeket. Katonákat irányítunk, akik fegyvereket is magukkal vihetnek egy pár négyzetkilométeres területen. Változatos térképeket kapunk a játékhoz, amin bőven van lehetőség taktikázni. Fontosabb célpontok szerepelnek rajta, illetve a győzelmi pont szerzéshez egységeink kilépése a térképről is lehetőség az ellenfél oldalán. Ezen túl vannak nyitott plusz célok és lehetnek rejtettek is. A játék kártyavezérelt. Egy-egy kártyán három fő dolog szerepel. Vagy parancsként, vagy akcióként kerülhet kijátszásra, illetve bizonyos módon eseményként is. Nekem kicsit az tetszett kevésbé, hogy ezek nem túl változatosak, bár ez első játékra talán merész kijelentés, de valahogy a TS teljesen különböző kártyáihoz szokva volt más. Az viszont zseniális megoldás, hogy a kockadobás előre generált a kártyákon. A teljes paklinkban két d6 dobás összes lehetséges variációja fordul elő és így nincs szükség tényleges dobásra és a szerencse is kisebb, mert ha rossz dobások jönnek is, idővel akkor jók maradnak. A játék elsőre is megérhető, de azért nehezebb, mint egy Conflict of Heroes és jelenleg én még azt érzem nem ezzel a gémmel tölteném el az időm. Ettől függetlenül nem véletlen a sikere. Egy jó játékról van szó, ami azért bárkivel nem játszható és inkább idősebbeknek való, sőt talán nyugdíjas korra részemről.

Counters are all punched, clipped, and sorted into GMT trays.

Probably my favorite 2p hex and counter game.  Possibly my favorite 2p game of all time.  Every game tells a story.  Every game has one side set up a puzzle and the other side try to solve it.  And every game is a white water rafting trip where you really don't know if the boat will get flipped over unexpected.

This is simple squad level tactical skirmish game, for those that want to pretend that they are playing ASL without actually having to commit to that  800 pound gorilla.  It has all the excitement of the card management of Up Front without any of the nonsense (try close combat fighting in that game and see how far you get).  Sometimes there will be wild swings from the events/snipers, and finishing off units can really come down to getting lucky. I can't give it a higher rating, because it is just so hard to kill units with gunfire, which seems the most logical way to kill other units.  I'd like a little more movement, rather than spending most of the game pinned down and trying to out draw the other player with lucky breaks.  

That said, I have a fun time playing it.

The game is very fluid and is driven by cards. Even though you can see the enemy all over the board you still have to have the right orders in hand to execute your strategy. There are many random events that can effect units not directly involved in combat. So if you got a big fat elite squad just sitting on top of and objective and dug in, event triggers can also effect them as well. I once had six squads of Russian infantry poised to attack a few Germans, but could not get my orders to activate them, meanwhile the Germans could execute and slowly picked apart the command paralyzed Russian units in their tracks. The game is not complicated and plays decent solitaire. There are no tanks or planes but can be abstractly represented by certain random events. The big bonus is the random scenario generator, giving you the ability to create virtually endless battles. Games last from 1-2 hours but can finish quicker if you eliminate enough enemy units to cause a surrender result. This game plays beyond the borders of the map, I have never experienced that in any wargame before. I am very pleased with this game and can't say enough good things about it.

Playing this game really makes me want to play a game of ASL instead: in ASL, cards don't determine your choices, you can try to do anything you want to do, and you have tanks and everything.

As has been said before, this game does have similarities with both ASL and Up Front.  It's very streamlined though and easier (by far) to learn than those other two games so it makes an excellent introduction to small unit tactical games.

The artwork on the maps and counters is very pretty and the cards are stylish as well as chock full of data.  These cards are the heart and soul of the game.  They are used for orders, actions, random events, combat results etc. etc.  It is a very clean and playable system.

The criticism most often made of Combat Commander is that the system is too 'random'.  I can't actually deny that - so if you don't like games where you have less than total control over things don't buy this one!  I quite like the chaos and randomness generated by the system but can easily see how it would piss some people off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a very cool game, although I think it's likely still too much of a wargame for me. I love the card-driven nature of it, where the cards are used to:
- issue orders on your turn (e.g., move, fire, advance one step with no op-fire possible, call in an artillary strike, recover -- flip a broken unit back to full strength, rout the other player -- force them to make checks on their broken units)
- take actions on either player's turn (e.g., ambush them in melee, opportunity fire, modify combat strength)
- make dice rolls (every card has 2d6 at the bottom)
- trigger events (trigger words on die rolls)
- enact events (e.g., sniper fires at a hex, weapons break, weather effects)
- choose a random hex (hexes are coded; each card shows one such code)
- advance game rounds (each time a player depletes their deck, advance one step on the time track; defender also gains 1VP and other stuff may also trigger)

But I don't like:
- setup: wow, there are a lot of chits to dig through to set up for your scenario!
- charts: there are charts and charts for stuff like reinforcements, terrain modifier summaries, etc. I just don't want to have to deal with that stuff! Of course, after playing a lot of this likely becomes unnecessary.
- dealing with little chits during game play. I like how 1941 has big chunky tiles

On the other hand, game play is pretty cool. I generally don't have a feel for combat tactics, and stuggle to figure out what I should be doing at any given moment. But card-driven games help you in that respect: you can only do what the cards allow you to do! Maybe I will try this on Vassal some time ...

Combat Commander has been created with the desire to make a sharp contrast with other tactical games that give too much control to some sort of übercommander to launch a perfectly cohesive assault with multiple squads. Here, your forces will behave, on the contrary, like a student project's robot under heavy rain. You might be able to move an "arm", then maybe a "leg", but you may not be able to move that other "arm" for turns (if ever), because of serious command and movement limitations. Maybe you  want to move thoses forces to flank here, while attacking there, but then, how many turns will this take if you don't have 3 "Move" cards in hand already (and you won't) ? 4, 5... 6 ? How long can you wait for that elusive "Move" card ? Will your planned tactic even be possible later ? 

You could send those squads through an open field far away from enemy forces, then you don't a move card and they may stay there for turns until this enemy MG is right there to shoot at you - and you still won't be able to budge. I once had a unit adjacent to an objective after a movement, just waiting to get inside while staying covered behind it in the meantime. But I had to use a "Move" card elsewhere and it just sat there waiting until enemies came from 9 hexes away to take the objective in 3 turns and I was unable to move in before they did. What were my units doing there all that time ? Smoking in front of the farm ? Talking to the farmer's daughter ? You can go wild trying to make up explnanations, but at which do you go from a system that favors some form of chaos to pure non-sense ? I just wish the movement system was not dependant upon the fate decks...

 There's a few other things I have problems with here: squads are closely tied to leaders, which are so important that the loss of one might sometimes be so tragic for your moving capacity, you'd better capitulate. Opporunity fire that depends on cards (I was able to move 5 squads in front of an MG in open terrain because I could see, from one of them moving, that my opponent was out of "fire" cards). There's also the powerful "recover" cards that can annul LONG-prepared assaults in a blink, units that score VP coming out of the board before they come right back on the other side; some strange, illogical events, but those are all minor things. My only real complaint is the slow, tedious task of moving largely uncoordinated units on the map, having to stop to wait for "Move" cards that just don't want to show up. Taking turns and turns to just discard all of those "artillery denied" or "command confusion" cards just kills the pace of the game.

I don't want to be too severe here, because I believe that there is a lot to like also. Combat is fast and efficient, graphics on the units are great, and many ideas are well implemented, like the "actions" and some of the events. I also like the system concerning the objective chits, the way time passes, the surrender rule, etc. But if you like your tactical games to be fast, furious, dynamic and in-your-face, you might want to look elsewhere.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I am surprised to see this game so high on the list. I don't think that a game needs to be realistic to be great, but a tactical wargame system that allows units to walk in front of the enemy without getting fired at, or prevents a squad from getting behind cover just because you have run out of the necessary cards does not make any sense to me.

My 5th GMT Games game, and has the highest quality components of all of them. Only spotted a couple typos in the playbook; rulebook is well done. Oversized hexes on maps mean no unit stacking! Random scenario generator seems well thought-out, not just tacked on; replayability will be very high with this one. Generally having fun with this; do hit some irritating stretches waiting for the right card to come up; events can be a bit too chaotic - one ended a game at a crucial moment. I'm thinking the ability to discard one card every turn even when you play one might help things, or permit one action when you dump your hand.

I am not really a war gamer and I just dabble in this aspect of the hobby.  Combat Commander is more of a pure war game than most of the others I play (Twilight Struggle, Commands and Colors Ancients, Sekigahara, etc.  I found learning it a bit difficult, but the game does work for the non-wargamer, although it is heavy by non-wargame standards.

It's a very neat little package.  The use of the cards is one of the best things about it.  It is also feels, very deeply, like WWII combat.  I like it but will probably have a hard time getting it played.  Interesting game and it tells a good narrative.

The perfect single evening WWII squad level game.  The varying game length can mean games that go almost twice as long as others (before an end-game condition), and slow games do actually go as long as it would take 2 skilled players to play through a small scenario of ATS or ASL, but the game play is so different and unique as to warrant owning and playing this one as well.  you can easily teach someone to play and play a "real" game in a single evening--something you definitely cannot do with either ASL or ATS (unless they are already highly skilled wargamers and the scenario is *very* short).

Good theme play.  Game somewhat easy to learn and play, although getting the tactics down will take a few plays.  There is a element of randomness to play that turns me off.  I realize there is an element of 'Fog of War' in battle but this game takes it a bit too far for my taste.  The components are excellent - mounted board, thick chits & durable cards.

RATING: 7.5
A great beginner tactical wargame. I've had loads of fun with this game and will likely have loads more. The thrill kind of disappeared after drawing hand after hand without a fire order and the deficiencies of a order/card system reared their ugly heads. Still a fantastic game with great potential for a spirited and varied match.

RATING: 9
A quite steep learning curve. An unexpected depth among the apparent chaos of the Fate cards, with a narrative unfolding before your own eyes.

[Nov-2013]: my rating upgraded to 8 after 4 games with a good and patient mentor. The interest lies in the difficulty to learn how to balance the command energy needed to progress into the scenario. Beautiful design, high replayability. Warning: an experienced player is a big plus to learn the game and flatten the learning curve. Two beginners in the tactical wargame field will struggle before starting to appreciate the game - the first few games can be very frustrating.
Reading the developer's notes by John Foley published in C3i magazine (available online as PDF) is recommended to every CC:E player, it helps in understanding the flow and the management of the hand cards.

[Update Aug-2014] Rating gone up to 9, after a furious summer seeing several scenarios from the base game and the CC:Med expansion being played - I have been hooked for good! These games were entertaining and engaging, and gave me a lot of fun in terms of narrative. Once the basics have been mastered, the discovery of the different tactical layersof this design is very pleasant. I even had a couple of solo runs of CC:E - the game is working amazingly well.
My main recommandation is to learn the game with an experienced player to avoid all the pitfalls of the tactical field.

The WARGAME! Usually I don't like games with randomness, and I don't care about the theme. But this game stole my heart with theme and chaos. CC:E has great mechanics, the best use of cards I've ever seen and quite nice components.

If you want to have a WWII wargame, choose Combat Commander!

This game is as good as it is difficult to find opportunities to play it. If only I could play it regularly ... but Conflict of Heroes is just SOOOOOO much easier to get to the table. Combat Commander is like going to the beach with small kids. So much preparation and packing and, sure, you're gonna have a great time but what a hassle. CoH is like those innocent, pre-kids days when you just ran out the door with your girlfriend and forgot everything and were starving and sunburned when you got home but what a great time. I've forgotten what I was talking about.

in the foot foot library. owned by Funpaul. I have enjoyed my playings ofthis game quite a bit. Although I think that the squads are a bit too strong, it's quite hard to break them, and then get themselves right back up when ever they get a recover order. So too easy to rally, too hard to break. Combine that with sparodic attack orders and some really high building cover numbers and you get a lot of sitiuations where either side has nothing to do. I do like it despite all this though, but ASL light this is not. It's more like Memoir '44 heavy.

Its a very flawed game and it feels like it plays you instead of the other way around. THe chaos and luck is way over the top for me to be able to enjoy it. Sitting around waiting for the exact order as the russians turn after turn is no fun. There are many things that I don't like about the game such as way to many of the cards are useless, events are overpowered etc.

On the plusside of things is the nice artwork and there are some nice ideas in there somewhere but its unfortunately annoying to play.

Wow. That's pretty neat.  The counters are smaller than I thought after looking at the pictures here on the geek.  About 1/2" to 5/8" for the men and smaller for the weapons and status. The game plays really smoothly and I really like the card decks.  With the combination of a main order and a supplemental action on each card you really have a lot of options when looking at your hand of cards.  As with any game with probabilities for success, there is randomness, but you just have to try and combat that by putting the odds in your favor.  Lots of tension and lots of fun.  I look forward to playing again. 2007/04/01

RATING: 4
My problem with this game is that the "amount" of chaos and order issuing hiccups is most often above and beyond what would happen on an actual battefield.  And major randomness happens in EVERY BATTLE. I have a hard time believing that every firefight in WWII was that chaotic. In dire circumstances most troops will fire back or hide or move out of harms way instead of just sitting there doing nothing (waiting for the right cards to come around). And yes I've heard all the arguements to the tune of "well you have to imagine that they're pinned down or out of ammo or something".  I'd rather the game tell me so than to have to make up an excuse as to why something happens.  Chaos does happen on the battlefield......but most often it is inflicted upon you by your enemy or opponent not just randomness popping up all over the place.

RATING: 10
I'm not going to bother reviewing the gameplay as their are countless great reviews of this game. Suffice it to say I agree with most of them. I will comment that this is at the very top of my complexity acceptability and I'm struggling to keep all the rules straight in my head, not to speak of the nested action sequences which can be tricky to track. It's slowly coming together but I look forward to the day when I can stop constantly referencing the rulebook and player aids.
I should also comment that I don't really care for WW2. I don't remember how many people are in a team or a squad though the rulebook did say, I don't know or care what a volksgrenadier is or if a German pioneer is the same as the American engineers (those numbers sure looked the same to me!) or how a guards rifle unit differs from a regular rifle unit. But the game just manages to capture the imagination so completely that I forget all those things and just focus on keeping my little guys alive in the swirl of battlefield mayhem. It is fantastic.

Scenarios
1.FL was not a very interesting scenario but was simple enough to learn on, at least using the basic strategy of grabbing and holding the lake house (a drawn chit raised the VP value of this by 10). That raised the stakes as the Germans did their best to hold on but at the end couldn't keep the overwhelming firepower from the forest at bay. The Russians who had unbelievably lucky draws throughout the game advanced and the Germans were sent packing. They had been holding out for one more time trigger for quite a while but it just never came for them. 
2.Wasn't a fan of Hedgerows and Hand-grenades.
3.Bonfire of the NKVD was good fun. The Russians fighting retreat didn't go quite to plan and they had to surrender well before the end.
4.Closed for Renovations was suitably stabby and ended quickly as the smoke cup seemingly pulled out only values of 5 and up across the board, well before the reinforcements arrived.
5.Cold Front - the dash across the river played out well with a tight win by the Germans on VP primarily due to some timely reinforcements.
7.Poor Germans were obliterated by some very lucky Russians who managed to grab a hero and a .50cal and then stuck them with the pointy end in close combat all across the board. Ended by Surrender with the Russians on 26VP!
8.Very poor setup by the Russians allowed the Germans, by a couple of lucky events to break and rout 3 russian units off the board, and then do a dash through the brush whilst popping off smoke to get off the board. The rest of the Germans managed to spread the russian forces but were playing more for time and locations (drawn objective) than trying to escape. Easy German victory.

Seems an interesting take on wargaming. Card-driven decision making, random events thrown in the mix, secret objectives. 

Not for me though. Guess I'm more fan of 'light-hearted' wargaming such as Battlelore, Memoir '44, Heroes of Normandie. The 'traditional' crap components and traditionals fallbacks of wargaming (paper map with bland art, carton chits for units, spreadsheets lined up besides the map, fiddly tracks with critical markers, tons of little rules and exceptions to those rules) still being there sure don't help either.

Guess I have to grow more into wargaming. Might be a great game if you are really into 'heavy' wargaming, don't mind (or even are accustomed to) the components and you dig all those 'reality' rules, but not for me (yet).

That all being said, would like to play against someone that can really demo this game well to see if I can grow into it. As there seems a ton of variety in it so pretty sure this game can be absolutely awesome if you get past the learning curve, bland art and crappy components (compared to 'regular' boardgames, not other wargames).

They kept telling me CC is a rite of passage that every wargamer has to try. I have to say they were right. The combat is fairly fluid, the hand-management is tricky , but not totally frustrating (most of the time). 

I just can't get over how well this game tells a story. I felt like I was watching a documentary about a famous skirmish, it was so alive. There's nothing about this game that I don't enjoy.

After one play, I can't say it's going to replace either Squad Leader OR Memoir '44.  It may be unfair at this point to say this, as we may be missing something, but it felt like you were only occasionally able to order your units due to the randomness of the deck.  We'll try it again, as there are many things that seem pretty cool, but the command and control system of this seems vague at this point.  We'll see.  I'll revise my comments afterward.

Second play: we fixed a few errors on which the rulebook was a bit nebulous or too brief and concise.  Tempo is still an issue.  I realize that this game does away with the common "God's-eye-view" of the battlefield most wargames have, but I get the feeling the designer felt that no mission--ever--went according to plan and relatively successfully.  Jury's still out on this one for me, despite almost universal acclaim elsewhere.  I will persevere.

Really decent squad level combat in a CDG without being too complex and heavy. I'm really glad I traded away Memoir 44, because this game is WAY better. There is more complexity in this than M44, but not so much that you are bored trying to remember every rule and looking up 15 tables of crap for each thing. 

The story that unfolds in each game is just as interesting as the choices you make. This is Band of Brothers the boardgame.

This is superb game that opens the world of wargames to new players in a very enjoyable way. Card driven system is interesting and reminds hand management from other board games yet it's still interesting enough for wargame players. 

Battles are fast, furious and the luck is shifting from one side to another making every play a cinematic experience. Tactical level is easy to comprehend and the only downside is the lack of vehicles. But in the heat of awesome battles you can easily forget it completely.

A few of my pals told me how great this game was.  How much narrative, how much tension, how much fun the chaos was. 

I was skeptical.  

I don't really get war games most of the time.  As much as I hate to admit it, I do place a decent amount of weight into how a game looks, feels, presents itself.  It is just too hard to get my wife (or most other gaming buddies) into war games.  

This game is far superior to most of the other games I own--it is that simple.  It is actually in another class to be fair.  It does not try to present anything with elegance, classy mechanics, or wacko stuffy themes.  Nope.  It just does what it does, and it does it awfully well.

It is a war game.  Therefore it is different from many other popular games on this site.  There is no farming, no kings to impress, no engines to build efficiently, there is nothing but war and chaos and an ingenious use of cards to throw it all up in the air.  

And it sticks.

Hugely entertaining, not terribly complex, and (as promised) creates a great sense of narrative.  Not for the anti-chaos crowd, but I love it.

Best game ever.  I had this as a 9, but now that I've gotten to really understand it, I'm really blown away by it -- the tension, the subtlety, the building-a-realistic-battle narrative, and the over all fun.  Although I think it consistently goes over the 1-3 hours listed on the box, I played this recently and simply didn't experience the passage of time.  One moment I sat down to play, the next minute it was 5 hours later!  And it was worth every minute spent playing.

I really, really want to like this game more than I do but it frustrates me. The game mechanics are clean and elegant but are let down by the start/stop nature of the card play and the indeterminate game length which seems to outlast its welcome.

RATING: 4
What a disappointment!  The game simply swings so far toward "anarchy" on the 'God/control to Chaos' spectrum that it robs players of any coherent course of action.  No planning, no ability to rely on the most basic of actions.  The game should have been 'card assisted' instead of 'card driven.'  Let me give you one example;

In most tacticals, running men across an open field in enemy LOS is one of highlights of the game, where the chance of enemy fire killing your men is at its greatest, but something that an attacker must do in order to advance.  In CC, if the opponent has no fire card, you stroll across without a shot.  Period.  Its not just unrealistic, but boring, robbing you of that adrenaline rush.

I was frankly astonished that even the most basic of squad actions required a card to execute.  The cards should have been soley for unit activation and random event/clock advancement, with subsequent unit behavior following tactical wargame standards.

However, I do credit the designers with integrating random events, the clock, and other features into the card deck.  its those elemnts that can bog down an ASL scenario, and the mechanic works to include those things while maintaining the game flow.

First Impression:
This game offers company level battles in great detail. Everything is included (except vehicles), from air support/artillery down to weapon jam and the occassional soldier tripping. All in just 2-3 hours per battle. The narrative after each battle is quite simply a small novel...

BUT

As a game, it plays itself. Really. You'll try to form some plans, but the game is so chaotic that they'll rarely work. Something quite unexpected will give you or the enemy the edge. Sometimes it will be the interperetation of some random combat element (that randomly appears out of nowhere) or the gamey fact that you simply didn't draw the correct orders/actions first. Which... sucks. The game is supposed to tone down luck by having dice results printed on cards, but honestly that's a laugh for anyone with basic understanding of statistics. And as if a bad combination of hand-management and random chaos wasn't enough to ruin this wargame, combat is ridiculusly unbalanced favoring melee! I thought this was ww2, not the middle ages!


To sum it up, this game keeps you drooling, but never really delivers.

As I love tactical games I wanted to try this system. I tried it in a convention and got completely wiped out from the map. Nevertheless I found it interesting and gave it another try. Once you understand the importance of the deck, you control a little more what happens. If you play it like any other tactical game you'll suffer most of the time.
This is a very unpredictable game, but I like it a lot.

Upfront meets Squad Leader in a very happy marriage. This game is without doubt chaotic and unpredicatable. Normally I would hate that in a wargame, but as each game only last an hour or so I'm OK with it and it just feels right. The game, because of it's relative simplicity moves at a very good pace and it feels more like a tactical WWII fire fight than the constant rule/table checking dice rolling of ASL

I've been toying with the idea of wargames lately and was happy to have the opportunity to give Combat Commander a shot. I'd only played a few before, and generally the simpler and perhaps somewhat atypical ones, such as Hammer of the Scots, Twilight Struggle, and Bonaparte at Marengo. I've found that I don't really love wargames. I don't think they're exactly for me. I like simplicity in my games and streamlined rules without many exceptions or caveats, which doesn't seem to gel with the wargame mentality. I also found this out when I started a thread on BGG seeking wargame recommendations and people asked what time period I was interested in, and I said I didn't care at all. Apparently people playing wargames are often interested in the background and time period, which I am not. That all being said, I do enjoy the wargames that I own mentioned above (i.e., HotS, TS, BaM), and was happy to have the chance to play Combat Commander. I liked how the cards were so versatile, including being used for die rolls, which I thought was clever. I did feel it was odd in my one game how we had this big huge map with a bunch of units, but the fighting got bogged down in one contested area, then again maybe it was just a quirk of that match or maybe it really was a key, decisive area.

The only small minor negative is the length of the game, including set up it often takes 3 hours with the people I play with. Maybe this will decrease after more plays.

Fantasitc Game.  MY ONE AND ONLY DESERT ISLAND GAME. Forget ASL.  This is THE tactical WWII system to play. Wonderful looking components (thank you GMT and the design team)with an elegant design with a clear and concise rule book. Each game plays fairly quickly -- the narrative and theme sucks you in.  Now with over 100 scenarios you can experience WWII tactical warfare like never before.  Kudos to Chad and Kai Jensen.  Wonderfully done!

I have experience with Advanced Squad Leader and found this game very accessible. Gameplay is quick, fun and narrative. Snipers played an important role in my first game and I felt that my forces took quite a beating from my opponents events. I wish that the card were of the same quality as those in Twilight Struggle. The cards has taken on a distinct u-shape.

I've only got to play this once, but it left me wanting more. It's a shame that I find so few opportunities to play because I think this game is top-notch. It's the perfect balance of hardcore war game, while still retaining a relatively short playing time -- and is pretty easy to pick up.

RATING: 8
A bit more complicated than Conflict of heroes, but still very playable. The card system is actually very interesting. There will be surprises for both sides. The use of the leaders give's the player a bunch of options to choose from. So i think that it will take quite a few games to really get into CC:E. 

Edit: Now after 3 games i'm really starting to like this game. It plays smoothly with tension. The game mechanic is brilliant. I wanna play more!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
On the positive side: It's a very dynamic system continuosly requiring your attention and very exciting. The scenarios are well balanced and usually it's a hard work to establish who is going to win the game, cause the situation changes quickly in unforeseeable manner.
On the negative side: if you don't have the right cards it's not easy to turn the outcome of the war.

I am a hardened Squad Leader fan - no other WWII tactical game could ever come close to matching it for general game-play and excitement. Least that's what I thought until CC:E arrived on the scene.

Didn't like this one at first. Now I like it a lot.  I think people who don't like this game just give up too easily.  If you hang in there and use every available tactic, sometimes you can turn a hopeless looking loss around. Plus there are a lot of laughs generated in some of the volatile situations that can occur.

Medium complex wargame that does a great storytelling job. Planning and manouvering with just the perfect dose of randomness and chaos. This is a game I could play forever, I think, especially since there is a 'random scenario generator' included. And oh yeah - it has got a crystal clear rulebook.

RATING: N/A
Now THIS is how to write wargame rules - fabulous! 

At last, a truly accessible and fun wargame providing genuine surprises and suspense within a system that is not overloaded with itty bitty rules. 
I love the events and the uncertainty both these and the card draws provide. I love the Artillery Strikes – if you miss the targeting roll it will still impact but in the wrong place and may bring down friendly fire to devastate your own troops, genius!

I have only played solo so far using the variant in the files section – duly tipped, thanks Fardoche – but very much looking forward to 2 player.

Only downside is the fact that there are no Brits, they are relegated to the expansion! Kind of ironic given the circumstances; Hollywood rewrite of history extends to board games!

RATING: 9
WWII squad combat, descended from Advanced Squad Leader, but considerably streamlined. Squad activations for movement, attacks, retreats, etc. are driven by a handful of cards, which speeds the game up and prevents turns from devolving into endless analysis in search of the "optimal" action. The initial game includes the Germans, Russians, and Americans.

Nice game. I actually like the random elements the card generate.
Not a game for analysists or chess players. Gets somewhat repetitive after six or so scenarios...

RATING: 7
I can't help compare this to Up Front. CC:E is an OK play, but in some ways the element of card draw detracts from the suspense instead of adding to it. Maybe there is not the same desperation (Oh Jesus God, where is that Move card to get rid of this Wire?) or the same variety of cards. It just seems like the cards are an aside to me.

This game, one that I was able to play with Chad some years ago, the same day that he had planned to meet with the Gentlemen of GMT to see if they might "take it on," finally came in the mail, after a relatively short stay on the P-500.  The game plays Much Faster when playing with Chad, as rules were never in need of checking, yet, finding the rules necessary to play the game properly were sensationally easy to locate the exact rule desired.  This is a huge plus, and benefit for those of us who have been frustrated by the organization of rulebooks having to do with historical simulations.  This, hearkens a renewal to the days of Avalon Hill, that, in my estimation, and humble opinion, were the epitome of ease in introduction of rules, concepts, and follow-up, including a Designer's Page, which CC has. 

Simply the most fun a guy can have with cardboard counters!

I had no interest in trying tactical level wargaming.  The few games that I had tried were not to my taste at all.  Then, along came Combat Commander.  Suddenly, I see why people want to play tactical games.  Here's a narrative!  Here's diverse strategy, with a twist of luck!  Here's a clever use of a deck of cards to keep you guessing!  Not only that, but it is really easy to jump into.  I felt completely comfortable with the rules by the end of my first play, which is a rarity for any wargame that goes longer than an hour, and particularly one with this level of chrome.  Components are fantastic, facilitating gameplay very well and still managing to keep a good aesthetic.

Very elegant design. Most of the fun of ASLSK without the rules complexity. The card-driven mechanism will certainly put off simulation or total control freaks, but it works really well in CC:E to create command confusion, a certain fog of war and random events. CC:E is all the fun of a squad level wargame without the traditional hassle.

Fantastic card driven wargame. Some grognards do not like the luck factor (cards) which may allow a player to walk freely towards the enemy because he does not have any "Fire" cards. But I still love it. (It may represent supply problems or similar)

Wargame basado en cartas extraordinario. A algunos wargamer no les gusta el hecho de que el azar de las cartas propicie la posibilidad de que un jugador pueda pasearse tranquilamente con sus tropas en el campo de batalla. Pero a mi no me molesta (puede representar problemas de suministros, por ejemplo)

RATING: 6
This game is my first foray into wargaming proper, and I'm not 100% certain that it's my thing.  It's an interesting system, and it seems straightforward enough to learn and play.  The game does have a lot of exceptions and fiddly details to remember to apply at the right times, but after about halfway through the game, they make a lot of sense.  The card-driven mechanism is also interesting, and clever in the way that the cards can do four different things, but it is possible to be hosed by an unlucky draw, which can be fairly frustrating.  I can see how this system would be a great one for wargamers, but I'm not sure if it's for me.  I would certainly play it again.

Played three times now, and it has everything I want in a squad-level combat game. The playing time is perfect (around a couple hours), the unstructured feel of the time flow is wonderful, the chaotic nature of random events is exciting, and the hardiness of units seems appropriate given the low stack sizes.

When I purchased CC:E and CC:Med, I did so after reading reviews that convinced me that if I only owned one tactical combat game that it should probably be this one. That opinion has certainly not changed. This game is very, very strong, a great deal of fun to play, and pitched at just the right level of difficulty.

RATING: 10
This is in my opinion the best squad level wargame ever created. Others are more detailed, but nothing tells a story quite like Combat Commander. Every scenario feels meticulously researched, yet the game engine ensures that every scenario feels alive...even when you play it on more than one occasion. A game of this is like an interactive viewing of Saving Private Ryan. Your best guys will die by random snipers, isolated units will rise to greatness under the spontaneous generation of a new leader, when one of your privates take control of a hairy situation and rallies his unit. It's an incredible experience, every time I play.

The basic system is reminiscent of the Command and Colors games from Richard Berg, but there are so many more glorious details. Random events, heroic actions, and command paralysis, all will affect every battle. On top of all this, if you ever inexplicably get tired of all the historical scenarios, there is a random scenario generator and it's utterly brilliant.

Honestly, I believe I could sell every game in my collection and as long as I could hold on to this, I'd be able to live with it. It's that good.

Update - I've played the following scenarios:1 - Russian victory. 2 - details. 9 - American overrun for an instant victory over the eliminated German forces that started on the map. 10 - solitaire, the Ruskies knocked out the Germans during Turn 6 via a casualties Surrender. Very hairy battle that saw a hero for each side, the German Private, Russian artillery, many melee combats. Nearly all support weapons lost or broken. And one raging flamethrower - before it ran out of fuel.(Original Comment) Got my first game in on May 7th as my Russian recon force met and defeated the Axis at Lipki. Good stuff. There were swings of fortune and chaos ensued on the battlefield. But effective leadership swung the battle in the end.

Fantastic game! It does take a few scenarios to digest the rules, after that the games SHINES! It's a roller coaster game, meaning that many things happen, for good or bad. It will test your nerves and there's a small line between hallelujah and 'the ugly word'! Time is flying by during this game, and just as in a real roller coaster, you just want to jump right in again. I like games that play with your emotions, like Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage and Twilight Struggle. If you like these games, try this one... C&C: Europe scores high on my adrenalin scale.

Just right.  I've longed for something a step down from ASL with a bit more uncertainty than Band of Heroes.  This one is easier or more accessible than both and card driven.

After the first 10 plays I've rated it 10, after 20 plays I've rated it 8, and after 30 plays I've rated it 7 and put it back to the shelf. I wanted to make plans in my games and expected to be successful with them, but CC is a game with a lot of randomness, so most of my plans didn't work. 

Now I have accepted that CC is a real good fun game (with some card management). And I had a lot of fun with the Mediterranean and Paratroopers scenarios. 

When I want to play tactical/strategical squad level scenarios, I take ASL or ASLSK ...

RATING: 8
Yet another long time player of ASL & UF cracks open CC:E. It's no substitute for a months/years long grinding HASL match (and it isn't supposed to be), but so far, I think I prefer this to ASL as an infantry-only platoon-to-company skirmish game. I especially like the quick random generator. I prefer this to UF, too. The system feels like ASL would play if the Command & Random Event rules from the SASL module were made a standard part of the two-player game.
I like CC:E enough to have:
1. bought the Para & CC:M modules
2. clipped the counters!

Only an 8 instead of a 9 due to:
1. lack of single atack KIA (a single leader running in the street can be shot at point blank by an entire platoon, all their MGs and a flurry of grenades, and still just suffer nothing worse than a 'broken' result.
2. no multi-level buildings.
3. apparent LOS conflict between T88.3.1 & T88.4.1 which suggests that hills are both taller and shorter than buildings/woods because you can see over them, but are not tall enough to cast a blind zone?

Incredible game. Way better (and easier) than I expected.
I'm tempted to give it a 9, but I'll wait until I've played more and the initial euphoria has worn off.

Two player Axis vs. Allies scenario based WWII strategy war game. Card driven squad level tactics that use 12 different paper terrain maps. This game has a bunch of new(or not seen often) and clever mechanics for me that could(should) be used in other genres; tug-o-war style victory point track, casualty track triggers game end, random scenario generator with random open/secret objectives, love the element of when to use the iniative marker, time track triggers scenario "sudden death". Each side plays from a nationality fate deck. The cards serve multi-use for dice roll amounts which can trigger events. I love how rounds of time are not predictable and advance from events or dice rolls. As a wargame newb, I love the many detailed action choices and how their play conditions interact with the units and terrain. Game includes inset to organize unit tokens. Leader units can influence adjacent units. I love how broken troops can become more dangerous despite being weaker. Eek does a great job breaking this game down.

ASL lite. This is a very well thought out, easy to learn and play game. The rules are clear and easy to absorb. This is how rules should be written. After a couple games they seem second nature. The scenarios are tight, and players should never quit in the belief they can't win, as this game can quickly turn. I have had some good sessions with my 13, now 14, now 17 year old son, who also finds it exciting to play. I am forever getting my butt kicked by him.

Adequately detailed WWII tactical combat with a healthy dose of chaotic fun!  Good narrative feel, good game.

Update (10/19/2009):  This is the WWII tactical game for me.  You don't have total control, but you have enough control.  The rules are easier than the length of the rulebook suggests because the rulebook describes every card in detail, but the text on the cards is adequate for actual play.  I like managing the chaos that the game throws at you.  Games are tense and frustrating in a good way.  There's a good variety of units and weapons.  The included scenarios are varied and fun.  I'm looking forward to giving the (reputedly) excellent random scenario generator a try.  The rule book is amazingly clear and well-organized.  There is excellent support for the game both here and on CSW.  You can have a lifetime of fun with just the CC:E set, but there are also plenty of expansions coming out at regular intervals.  This will likely become a 10 for me after not too much longer.

Update 8/9/11:  I've gotten a few RSG games in.  It's great!  Making your way through the RSG is a mini-game before the main event that has a real influence on the "actual" game play.

I love playing this game.  For some reason of all of the hex and counter games I've played this one is the most enjoyable.  It actually plays out like a movie in my head.  Once you get the rules down, this game just flows right along.  Very intuitive. Love it!

Unfortunately, not really my cup of tea, due to too many random factors (hey I rate chess highly as it has none!).

Based on only one play.  I look forward to revising my rating with more plays.

I really enjoy playing this game. Plus it is a great way to get non-wargamers to give a wargame a try as the card mechanism attracts the non-wargamer crowd. 

My only complaint is that it sometimes takes a while to decide and set up a scenario with all the counters/maps/scenario sheets to go through.

Simply brilliant. Scratches that WW2 tactical itch that Squad Leader created many years ago, but that I can no longer satisfy due to having no opponents for ASL. I love the control issues of not having the cards that you need, and the chaos of the random events, and the scenario generator. Not so simple that you feel like you're playing a toy (I'm looking at you, Tide of Iron), but not so complex you need to study the rules regularly to play well.

Not as good as Squad Leader or ASL or others.  I am positive that my rating will go up with more play, but I need some impressing first.

Played the introductory scenario 1 so far FtF...What a blast!!! 9 is kinda high rating after ONE play, but I really believe my rating will keep going UP! Now a 10 after 3 plays, 2 FtF and 1 solo....!! This game just keeps getting better 'n better! After 10 plays it's still a 10! Now with the expansions, it's better!Played 15 times now, it should be an 11 !!!!

I've wanted a true "wargame" for a long time and this was the one that was on my "must have" list. I've been a big fan of GMT games in the past and love Dominant Species so this seemed like a no-brainer. It has gone on and off my wish list over the years but that was mainly due to me not thinking that I've be able to get it played. 

Having now played the game twice, I can tell that the system is sound and it's going to be something that I'm going to really enjoy exploring. At the moment... my rating is based off of two initial plays. I can see this rating increase as get into the more complex systems of the game.

This seems like a slightly lighter reworking of ASL by someone who was regularly destroyed by bad rolls in ASL.  I prefer ASL's regular set of options over the card driven options of this game, but it was fun to play.

Random events are a detractor.  Fires break out all over the battlefield without reason, every scenario has snipers that take shots at random hex locations, etc.

Combat Commander didn't do it for me and I generally love card-driven wargames. The pace of the game is sluggish at best and the lack of fog of war really detracted from my enjoyment. However, I can't really put my finger on exactly why Combat Commander fell so flat.

This is a fantastic game, but two things are keeping it out of the "10" range for the moment:

-after playing lock 'n load, I find the map and counter art for Combat Commander to be a little bland.  Sorry, but that's how it is.

-playing time.  All three games I've played have lasted at least 4 hours.  That may go down as we get more experienced, but it is just too long for this game.

The rules are great (GREAT!), and the gameplay is lots of fun.  My rating may go up with more play, and it will certainly see more play.

Nice mechanics, but limited hand size and unplayable cards (not applicable actions or orders) can lead to inefficient and frustrating playing.

RATING: 5
Not my cup of tea. Making tactical plans is mostly useless, because gameplay consists of reacting to the cards you happen to draw and all the randomness of every subsystem. From a tactical point of view, everything that happens is very counterintuitive. Both defensive and offensive fire is laughably ineffective compared to a melee rush. The card driven engine is a remarkably bad choice for this type of game.

Great game, my favorite tactical war game. I don't normally like tactical war games. I love the chaos and decisions this game creates. Changed my rating to a 10 to off set the "1" trolls and because this game is #10 on my Top 10 in my BGG Profile

For some reason I am still fighting the rules... un-intuitive for me... But obviously I am not made for tactical level wargaming, especially with so much luck involved... although I admire the action game provides - as one article in C3i remarked, very movie-resembling.

Ultimately traded away to a friend so maybe one day it will come back to the table.

Everything depends on the cards you get dealt. this makes that your luck can change within a few turns.

Only played the walk through and solo so far and I was surprisingly and worryingly underwhelmed. I think I've listened to too much hype and enthusiastic hyperbole.

Game play .. well I was expecting the randomness so that's fine. What I didn't expect was the lack of feel of real world tactics. I get much more of that from CoH. Maybe experience will prove me wrong there.

Components wise .. well many people told me it was a visual treat and for the most part everything works well together. I don't appreciate having to use a scalpel to get the chits from the board though; they rip too easily without it. And I hate paper maps. Sorry but I do although I can see how the cost and weight would make heavy ones impractical considering the number of them.

The chits that are used on the display track are too small and insubstantial, fiddly and get easily lost and overlooked. As are hex changing chits such as fire, which affects a whole hex and makes it impassable yet is just a little square of card that isn't immediately obvious. I've not come across a reason why that isn't hex sized and shaped other than financial.

While the 1 counter tray is a generous addition its useless as it doesn't hold all the chits in any useful organised manner. You need 3. 

edit: 8 April 2010. After another couple of play throughs I'm still totally underwhelmed. I can see why some people like the story side of it as you never do have any idea of what'll happen next. The randomness and unpredictability feel all consuming, that the enemy is the game itself rather than my opponent. I'm going to try one of the bigger Stalingrad scenarios to see if real world tactics have any say in it at all.

So far its a 5 because at least the components have a fairly consistent and interesting visual style if lower quality than I'd expect for the price.

edit: 9th May .. after a few more plays I think I'm getting it. It requires the same mind set as Mem 44 (despite the many objections people seem to have to this comparison). I hate the idea of just thinking of it as a card management game because I find breaking a game down to simple mechanics turns them into a series clinical abstract concepts and takes the fun and immersion out of them. But if I can imagine it as a leader desperately trying to rally his men, communicate under difficult circumstances, react to an ever changing environment while still meeting his objectives .. then I can rationalise it and feel the game rather than just executing it. I'm upping it to a 7.

edit: 16/12/2010 many solo and a number of head to head plays and its a great game. Questions of randomness don't even occur to now. Its just the chaos of battle and events outside your control and everything adds to the story and oozes theme. While it would be nice to have tanks, most WW2 engagements didn't involve them so its not a huge hardship and does keep it simple(r). I'm going to ramp this upto a 9.

Update: 02/2011 .. played almost all of the CC:E Scenarios F2F and it just keeps getting better.

For the longest time ASL has been my favorite game and that probably won't change. However, I don't see any reason to have only one favorite game. Combat Commander is just as exciting as ASL, it plays faster, and is way easier to learn. I play this much more frequently, and it really deserves a 10.

This game has provided for some of the most intense moments in my gaming experiences.  The card mechanic is just so great!  Where some may complain about the need to discard and, thus, lose your turn, my opponent and I have consistently found this to *increase* the tension and excitement in the game rather than diminish those aspects.

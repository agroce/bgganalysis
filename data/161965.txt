Played a 2 player game and a 3 player game.  I think I like it more with 2 players.  However, my 2 player partner (my son) is not the biggest fan so I would have to find another player if I want to keep playing as 2 player.

It's an interesting game. There's some nice tension in the card play and the gem set matching / economy. It's not incredibly deep, but it keeps me thinking every time. I like it.

A lot of game here in a small package, Johari features a surprising number of interesting decisions.   The purchasing and sale decisions, frequently involving turn order considerations, produced some very significant point swings, and were engaging to think about.  

I like the counterfeit jewels mechanic, as well as the mechanic which requires single jewel type sales to reference another player's collection in order to happen, and scrumming over turn order produced a lot of fun moments.

Fun and light little trading game that works great with 2 players. Playing valuable cards early means you'll have to pay a high price to use them. Saving them for later makes them cheaper but means that you may miss out on the cards you really wanted. Our two-player games usually has us second guessing each other and trying to out-maneuver the other person. Can't see this working as well with 3 or 4.

RATING: 6
Interesting role selection game, but the roles don't seem balanced.  Two roles, exchange and bribe were never used between 3 players even a single time during the entire game.

Positives: Fun set collection mechanism (cashing in lots of one stack versus one of each), player interaction to deny people a large "Collector" action, and you need to plan around people selling (which will get rid of your fakes). 

Negatives: Some roles just don't seem that great; Bribe and exchange in particular.  If you have a good you want to get, simply take the trade to protect it, or take multiple goods that are fake, so you can ditch the low value fakes.

Johari feels like a very 'compact' game. There are well-defined mechanisms interacting in clear ways; and that is basically all there is to the game too. There's no fluff, it's all business. I could recognise the hand of the author by drawing a few general parallels to his earlier release OddVille.

Unfortunately, Johari is merely about buying low and selling high, all the while specific adding abilities to one's actions so that the base rules can be circumvented to some extent. To me this doesn't have the same charm as, say, a tableau builder. Another problem I have with the game is the incredibly drab appearence. It is an exercise in brown hues, and influences my interest in playing the game to a noticable degree. It really shouldn't, but I cannot help myself in this case. A game about gem trade ought be bright and cheerful, so -1 point deduction. These criticisms are all cosmetic, hoewever; as the game itself felt pretty solid. So give it a go if you like the game's core concept: you might be surprised.

[b]Update[/b] Well, no, it's not about buying low and selling high; it's about timing one's purchases and sales before they lose their value, and wondering whether what remains after being forced to give up gems might not be better spent on action-bending nobles. This is more interactive than I gave it credit for, and so despite the drab colour scheme I'm contemplating a rate upgrade.

Players play action cards that are revealed simultaneously and resolved in order of wealth.  It's all about acquiring gems and selling them back for profit.  It works well, has a nice/nasty interactive streak, but is about 30 minutes too long for this sort of game.  Almost there - would be a good filler with more pruning and development.

Johari is one of those cases where the central mechanism shows some promise but the game it drives is somewhat lackluster. Having to secretly choose three actions a day from your deck works well and the decreasing costs often demand a choice between getting priority and paying a premium, or getting stuff for cheap but risking the competition snapping up what you wanted.

The set collection aspect (which is what eventually scores you points at the end of the game) is a very dry and often fairly repetitive affair, though. Collect sets from the market, sell them for points, rinse and repeat. Apart from grabbing gems that someone else might have wanted player interaction is very limited (and although having to discard counterfeit gems on sales can be quite significant, this happening is typically quite predictable).

This is a very underrated mid-light euro game. I like it a lot more than Jaipur, that has a very similiar theme. There is a lot of tension and many meaningful decisions need to be made. It is not that much luck dependent - after all players can impact order in which their actions are executed.  I like the theme and artwork - a lot. Counterfeit gem mechanic is neat.

Played Oct 2014

Easily the best medium-light weight game I played during Sasquatch 2014. The game has lots of tension and other player's decisions can impact you greatly. There is a simultaneous reveal of action cards which adds a great component of double-think to the game. There is also tension in when you play cards because played early they will cost you turn-order, but if you wait others might swop in. Excellent game in a small box, reminded me a bit of Basari, one of my all time favorites.

I thought this game was all right, when we checked it out at Essen 2014. A game of buying and selling via role selection cards. Not bad, nothing special either. The full game overstayed it's welcome a bit as it is repetitive. But by leaving round cards out, the game can easily be shortened. Some role cards are essential, while others seemed to be rather weak.

Based on one play: A nice filler with simple mechanics, but make sure the rules are clear as falling behind can be painful (although the game is short). Money is very important as it determines turn order. The main aspect is to gather jewel and then sell them either in sets or all of one kind. You have to watch what others are doing also as it has an effect on your actions may they can even block you at times.

Played once with 3P. Johari is a simultaneous role selection game about selling gems, a surprisingly common theme for the year's crop of games. The cleverest bit here is the dual purpose of gold, which is used to pay for actions as well as track turn order. The strongest actions cost more gold when used early, so you take them with the risk that you will fall behind in turn order and lose the priority in getting and selling gems.

Apart from that, there is nothing particularly new here that hasn't been covered before by other games.  The range of actions to choose from are somewhat limited as the Bribe and Exchange actions are clearly more situational than others, and this leads to somewhat predictable plays. A perfectly adequate, but unremarkable game.

Demo'd at GenCon 2014.  This was a fun game.  We left the demo table wanting to play again.  The nobles can be very helpful and should not be ignored!  I really liked the mechanic of choosing 3 different actions for the day to help strategize what you will do.  I plan on making a purchase for the game, but it is not a, "I MUST BUY THIS IMMEDIATELY."  It plays fairly fast, and to me it would seem that you could easily reduce the number of nobles you play with to play an even faster version of the game if you need just a quick filler.

RATING: 7
This is a game of gem trading.  You buy and sell gems to gain victory points.  There is a time vs. money management mechanic for the various actions you can perform.  Having more money allows you to perform your actions earlier.  Also, there are 3 times during each day where you can perform actions.  The earlier in the day you perform the actions, the more the actions cost.  There is quite a bit of player interaction in that your actions may affect other players and vice versa.  It is important to anticipate what other players may choose to do as it may affect your action if you go after them.

RATING: 6
In Essen someone told me this game had more depth than you would expect from looking at the components and box, which made me more interested than I first was. And there is something to that statement. Unfortunately the amount of luck and length of the game turned it into a disappointment. It surely becomes repetitive in the last third. And player order is sometimes so important because of the luck involved when the market gets replenished. Being first when a hole bunch of same colored cards come out, can almost win you the game when it comes at the right time. But you can't plan for that, it's down to dumb luck.

Initial rating: 6/10

I'm terrible at these simultaneous action games, but I did enjoy this one. I like the turn order management and the timing aspect of when it is best to play your cards.  Nice.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The gameplay system is good and has a similar feel to Glass Road: you have a set of cards you play to take different actions, but the timing of each action and the turn order are very important because of the way the cards interact.  You also get special abilities in the form of Nobles card, that can either enhance your actions or give you big immediately benefits.

However, the game seems to be underdeveloped. Some of the cards don't seem to be very balanced and someone can hold onto the first player position by playing smart, giving them a huge advantage and not allowing anyone else to take over as first player. Also, the luck of the draw can have a big impact on the game.

Given away.

RATING: 6
Johari doesn't exactly break any new ground. The game play is a combination of different mechanisms that are all too familiar  but the overall feel of the game is quite polished and distinct. That is not to say the game is without flaws. The game is long, far too long for a quick light game. There are 10 rounds to the game and each round is pretty much the same. Rinse and repeat. By the fifth round, it had already overstayed its welcome. The game dragged toward the finish line. 
     Players who despise pre-programmed movement like roborally should be wary. The central core of the game is action selection tightly coupled to turn order. So while you might want to buy that gem or sell your collection, the turn order will determine if you are successful in reaching those goals as other players may have swooped in to purchase what you need or you may have lost your fake gems.
  The game does have several strong qualities: as much as I hate pre-progammed moves, the application of this mechanism in the game make sense. Coupled with the money being tight and acting as a turn order marker, the game can be quite tense. You can certainly guess which players are going to make a sale and which players are going to purchase gems, but you may not know which of the three phases it will occur. This coupled with the declining cost of action selection makes for several delicious moments in game. The appearance of nobles also makes specialization a possibility. Rather than going for prestige points on the gem track, nobles allow you to get creative in accruing points. Though, I suspect advancing the gem track will still be the most dominant method for scoring.
      Overall, I wish the game could be shorter and sligthly less fiddly (especially with the money track turn order bookkeeping). I would gladly keep the game in the collection if that were the case. As it stands, Johari is propped right at the threshold of my "for trade" pile.

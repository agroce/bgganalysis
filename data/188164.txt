Great solo design.  Maybe my favorite DVG title.  Components outstanding, with only the rule book as published needing work--the designer provided an update very quickly.

10/2017, I traded my extra copy for Phantom Leader Deluxe.

Solid Solo game. Rules complete and well tested, and it's a miracle nowadays.
The organization of the rule book could have been better tho. This game succeed in being immersive and not boring at all, many choices and little different details though not overwhelming. Dice just enough.

My first experience with a Leader game and very much enjoyed playing through The Air War Begins using several of the included optional rules that I felt added more narrative.  Rated 8 for now with room to move up.  Doubtful it will move down.  I'm tempted to cob together a grand campaign out of the included campaign timelines, secondary missions, and special missions that would allow one to play straight though August 1942 to April 1945.

Recently acquired BFFL. Love the high production values. The high level of research and detail is immediately apparent as you read through the manual. Can't wait to fly my first mission. 

If you're looking for inspiration watch 'Target for Today' on DVD. Target for Today is a documentary film describing the preparation and mounting of a USAAF raid on "East Prussia". It contains combat footage of B-17 and B-24 bombers. Importantly, the documentary explains Operation Pointblank target selection and depicts planning, briefing, and preparation. Invaluable stuff.

I'll hopefully report back once I have a few missions under my belt!

From a HUGE WWII Aviation fan who has played hours upon hours of European Air War, Aces Over Europe, B-17 Flying Fortress, B-17 Flying Fortress the Mighty Eighth, every IL-2 Game known (Minus the console versions), Gary Grigsby's Eagle Day to Bombing the Reich, this game has hit every single point I could want in a board game covering the 8th AF in WWII. The resource management, the decisions of which targets to hit, the secondary missions, all the campaigns and the game flow is very good. I really don't have a negative for this game, it's just that good in fulfilling what I wanted in a WWII Aviation game covering the Mighty Eighth!

Marred by an awful 1st edition rulebook. If the extra stuff (full '42-'45 campaign) can be made by the company, then this would be great! Uses bits from the 'Leader' series of DVG games.

I love B-17s, always have, so I was extremely interested in this game. Ordered from CSI and read the rules (downloaded) a few times before I got the game, punched everything out (pieces were damaged), found out they only have you 1 die (asks you to roll 2), they tell you to print off your own sheets to keep track of the game, then tried to play.

Didn't go very well. Rules are crap, and there is a lot to this game, lots of little modifiers and little rules. 

Thanks to some of the files people created here on BGG I was able to learn the game and get a few plays in, but I have no clue if I played things correctly. 

I do enjoy the game, but I really have no clue if I've played things correctly.

August 17 - Really gripped by this game. Love loading up and going out to bomb the smithereens out of various targets. I've gotten rid of the paper recording by using counters on the aircraft cards for xp and marked poker chips for vps. Less tedious now. Dislike the recording sheets. With the Med Front and Eastern Front abstracted, you get a real sense of being involved in a grander scheme. If you're interested in the period then get this game.

[b]10: Outstanding game. One of my all-time personal favorites.[/b]
An amazing game, something you can see happening. I would grab the 2nd edition rules here in the files, they clear many things up. 

Well worth the slight effort to get into. More control than B-17 QOTS with that same narrative quality. Plenty of scenarios for you to tinker with. Optional rules are historical with very little overhead. 

Dean has really knocked it out of the park with this one.

First impression is really good. Probably the best game in the Leader series i have played so far. Rule-book in the original box is a bit crap, but fixed online. Also the designer has been actively answering questions, so kudos to him for that.

Lots of choice, lots of planning. Some luck, but not so much that it would strike you as random and unfair. More like "shit happens, suck it up, there is a war on". =)

For me this game hits the sweet spot between planning and executing. A fine balance between deciding enough, but no need to insanely min/max.

I think it's safe to say, that if you have enjoyed other "Leader" games, then this is going to go over well. More strategic, and better for it. You FEEL like you are planning missions and sending out bomber raids. Then watching, breath held, to see how the bombers did and how many made it back home.

This game is deep.  Lots of parts to content with which I love.  Lots of decisions to be made.  Rules are fine with lots of chrome.  

I love that it can be intermixed with Down in Flames and it comes with not only the game, but you can fly a single plane within your formation or just fly a single plane. 

So many choices to do and so much one can do.  A brilliant achievement.

I really like this game.  But sometimes it does seem like there is way too much.  If one likes that it can be a 10 if it irks you a lower score, hence the reason for my lower score.  Sometimes the game just tries to be too much which translates into confusion and silliness.  But I still like the game very much.

Just started playing "Air war Begins" and so far loving it!.....just completed  and it’s even better than I thought!This was a war of attrition and a few groups nearly got wiped out. I’m lucky enough to have it set up permanently in the loft so I can nip up and down as the mood takes me. Much to the annoyance of my beloved though! Can’t wait to crack on with the other missions. Brilliant game.

An "8" design rushed to print without enough testing, editing, and polish (-2) makes it, sadly, a 6. Use the revised rule book PDF and it moves up to a 7.

I wanted to like this a lot more, and maybe after additional plays I may.  The ETO air campaigns are one of my primary interests.

There is a lot to like in the game, but I find the bandits are quite weak. 

The fighter escorts ability to pick which bandits they will intercept is also off given the knowledge the player has.  For example, the German leader has a rocket tactic, so the bandits with this ability will be chosen to intercept.

Got it instead of High Frontier 3, which was sold out despite my dealer supposed to getting it. So this was kinda a surprise buy and so far I don't know wether this will really be fun for me, especially since it is a topic that is a bit sensitive to me (living in a city that was destroyed during the bombings).

B-17 Flying Fortress Leader is an all time classic game from the moment of take-off.

Features:
- Operational decisions that put you in the General's seat responsible for Squadrons of aircraft into the 100's with all the crews manning them.
- Diverse missions that span the grand scale of aerial conflict over Europe throughout the entire war.
- Airplane leveling system, including legendary crew choices without a requirement to grind up to progress.
- Optional rules, such as weather, to create multiple layers of strategy and diverse play experiences.
- Bonus material, including rules for solo airplane missions and other exiting adventures.
- Rules for integrating DVGs Down in Flames series to spice up dogfights.  This also makes DiF solo playable!
- The content is so dense that the box feels like it must have an actual bomb in it.

The familiar core mechanics from the Leader series are still here, but there are more moving parts and new considerations, and the scale is different (instead of individual aircraft, we have bomber groups and fighter groups). It all works together very nicely and nothing feels too much out of place. A nice collection of varying campaigns plus optional rules, variants and even a complete mini game should keep any player occupied for a while. Instead of an abstract combat map we have an actual map of Europe and minimaps for the other war fronts, adding that much authentic feel to the game. B-17 Flying Fortress strikes straight at the heart and immediately takes the lead of the whole Leader series.

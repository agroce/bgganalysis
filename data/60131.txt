By our third turn it was getting mildly interesting as we were getting better, and then it turned into anarchy with people throwing blocks and clubs. As I described this to other people at the convention we learned it at, this happens in every game. smh

A fun game of communication.  And you get to hit people over the head with an inflatable club.  Lots of fun *IF* your group is willing to have fun with it.  My first play at a local con -- friggin' awesome!  (There's a video of it in the forums.)  My second play at my local group -- totally bogus.  (They weren't into it.)

RATING: 4.5
I played this game just two times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Cool idea and outrageous components for this party game, sadly the curve of enjoyment of Ugg-Tect sinks pretty quickly. The main reason being the low amount of project cards in the box, which doesn't allow for a decent re-playability. After you saw the project cards once, it's pretty easy to just remember where all the stuff goes. Even if you don't want to break the game and wait for the instruction to place your piece, all the craziness and loudness is gone. At that point all that's left it's a pretty boring and repetitive game-play.

The idea was great, the components and the graphics are really nice, but the game is badly produced. It gets old way too fast...

This game looked like great silly fun and it is. Trying to build caveman structures under the watchful eye of an arrrghtect is stressful fun. I don't know that the game will have 20 pays in it but I am looking forward to introducing it to other groups. 

Watching one of the wives bop her husband over the head when he wouldn't obey her cave commands was priceless!

Fun party game of miming to your partner(s) who try to build a structure based on your commands.  Your commands must be in a made up cave-language, which is pretty funny the first time around, but may become pretty stale quickly. Repeated plays will tell.

*4-8 Players

The cardboard inside of the box is damaged when it is opened.  Publisher Heidelberger Spieleverlag is nice enough to send insert.

It's a fun game, but not as funny as I hope this will be.  Mainly because the "Architect" needs time to read the words and do the move before performing.  This slow down the game and have some quite time.

Un party que se juega por equipos. En cada equipo un arquitecto debe dar indicaciones a sus trabajadores para que lleven a cabo una construcción conforme a una tarjeta que sólo el arquitecto puede ver. La gracia es que las instrucciones se dan en "lenguaje troglodita". Además, el arquitecto dispone de un garrote con el que golpear a los trabajadores para indicar si han interpretado sus instrucciones correctamente o no. Es un juego divertido de jugar, e igual o más divertido de ver jugar.

Sin pretensiones y para pasar el rato. Eso sí, puede dar vergüenza jugarlo en lugares públicos. :)

I like the wackiness of the game, put for some reason found it way more fun just to watch others play it than actually playing it myself.

It is a ridiculous game, bordering on stupid.  Yet it intrigues me in a bizarre way.

My 9-year-old loved it, and I would certainly play it again.

HILLARIOUS PARTY GAME.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
The concept of Aargh!Text is hilarious, but the implementation falls pretty flat.  I think the big problem is that you have two teams competing against each other at the same time.  So you don't get to watch the hilarity.  Instead, you're focused on trying to get good as silly skills (which is not really that much fun).

Someone will take this concept and make a great game out of it.  Unfortunately, this is not that game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players play in two teams, each team trying to construct as many cave man structures as possible 30 minutes.  Goofy real time game where one player "instructs" and the other player "builds".  The catch is the instructor can only communicate in a six word caveman grunt language, or by pointing, or by a few limited gestures.  Given that restriction, it can get quite tricky to "connect" with your builder to get the structures finished.  The team with the highest total at the end of 30 minutes wins.  Basically a one idea gimmick game, way overproduced with inflatable clubs, etc.  Definitely fun, but only once or twice.

two teams of player try to assemble a small construction out of coloured blocks based on the directions of the Ugg-tect. The catch is communication can only be done in grunts and caveman language as described on a crib sheet. Not a serious game, it does what it says on the tin really and does it well. I do wonder if as players learn the construction cards it will wear out though. At the price point i'd have hoped they could have included more cards.

Hitting people over the head with a club is fun! However, it's more of a novelty game in that you won't be able to play this again and again. There are not too many building cards and I think that after a few plays you know some of the blueprints so you can take a guess after the first two stones are placed and just finish the building without further instructions from the ugg-tect.

Played a 3 rounds of this (30 minutes) and its really fun. Its also a lot harder than it sounds.

Restricting the 'ugg-tects' language and gestures (no pointing allowed) really puts everyone on an even footing so less eloquent wordsmiths are not at a significant disadvantage, such as in aye dark overlord.

Also accommodates a large number of people and therefore is ideal for game society meetings.

Suffers a little when one player has played more than others as it is quite easy to learn the sort of shapes you are attempting to make.

Impossible to rate this game properly. The BGG rating scale doesn't work at all for a game you only want to play once. (I likely wouldn't play this game again.. that makes it a 3)

In fact I think of this as an event more than a game. You play it once and then never again.

For me that's fine. Obviously it's not so fine if you're looking for a game to play over and over.

I recommend 2 players per team (not up to 4 as the box suggests). So if you want to accomodate more players, you'll need more copies.

Good icebreaker.  Lots of fun with plenty of grunting and laughter with both the Stone Age architect and construction workers.  I can see potential problem with cards recycling and people remembering the designs with repeated plays.  Likely limited replayability unless expanded by a future expansion.

A decidedly silly party game, but still fun. Because of the odd communication restrictions, it can actually be pretty challenging. However, I think more enjoyment can be had by watching others play than playing yourself.

RATING: 7
Unfortunately, this game did not live up to my expectations after our first attempt at it.  Now, I understand that the point of the game is enjoy the frustration of miscommunication, but in the end, the limited verbal directions and remarkably complex structures described on the cards can leave the Aarghtect feeling at a loss for words, even the caveman ones.
Admittedly, the large inflatable clubs are a nice touch, but we found ourselves not really using them.  Maybe once the players are more familiar with the vocabulary, it could make for a faster and more enthusiastic game, but with our first play, this was more than a little frustrating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not really typically my type of game, but it's been a load of laughs. It also helps that my 13 year old really likes it. When asked what I should say about the game, she wanted me to include this phrase "you learn fast" (when you head is repeatedly hit).

RATING: N/A
First impression : I never really played the game. I was only being demonstrated how it works. I can see that this could be a hit at some (party) situation when two teams compete against each other. 

Basically it is game where other player tells the other what he should build. The catch is that you must use 6 very similar "words" to describe what he should do. Faster team is better. In right situation this can be hilarious and fun game.

Oh yes, and the thing everyone will notice about this game is that it comes with two 40 centimeter clubs (okey, inflatable).

RATING: 6
The score is more due to the number of cards for the different shapes.  After a couple of plays one can already start guessing what is being described - more variety would be great.  That said, for new players / party play it is a fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Good party game! I have mixed feelings about this one. I'm not sure it is fun for everyone...some enjoy the simple humor and have a great time, but others don't and can even get insanely frustrated. The structures you have to create are wonderful, diverse, and can be challenging! I do think this game has great educational value.

When we first played this game my wife was recovering from a head injury and refused to play; which is really unlike her at all but justified. Since players are tapped on the head with the inflatable club, this was not appropriate at the time. 

Our next game was with family and one member really could not understand that communication was a big part of the game. The pressure and the beatings from the club really caused an uncomfortable level of anger to rise from him.

This is definitely a game not to play with the angry gamer!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Childish nonsense involving making stupid sounds, stamping and waving your arms about while hitting people with inflatable clubs. Plus the whole caveman lingo premise is redundant as players can bypass this by just selecting blocks and positions while the architect confirms the correct combination.

Not sure how to rate this one. Such a unique and quirky game. There's definitely a certain charm in whacking your friends with an inflatable caveman club while grunting some strange dialect.

[b]Unique Component[/b] - This game actually has two unique components.  First is the blow-up clubs.  Second is the caveman language you must use to instruct your builders.

[b]Quick Thoughts[/b] - Great fun but the hitting part can get a bit out of control.  I tend to play nice and tap my builders heads instead of slamming them with the club.

A hilarious party game.

Ugg-Tect (Oereka in Dutch) comes with 2 inflatable clubs, 2 sets of 5 sturdy wooden blocks in different shapes and colors, 2 equally sturdy cardboard roofs/floors, 2 reference screens and a deck of building cards.

Players divide themselves into 2 teams. In each team an Ugg-Tect instructs the builders (the other team members) how to construct the Stone Age building depicted on the building card he drew. Caveat is that he can only use sign language (like stomping on the ground with both feet) to denote the piece that needs to be manipulated and Cave Man Language to tell players what to do with the piece they just picked. The Ugg-Tect provides his builders with feedback through knocks on the head with the inflatable club: 1 knock means that the builder did things right, 2 knocks mean that a mistake was made. 3 knocks on the Ugg-Tect's own head, mean that he himself made a mistake in his explanation.
After a building is done, the Ugg-Tect knocks his club against the table. If the building didn't collapse and if the opposing team checks whether the building on the table corresponds to the one depicted on the card, points get scored and a new building card is drawn.

Depending on the game mode, the game ends after a set amount of points has been reached or after a set amount of time. The team who gets to the set amount of points first, or completes the most buildings in the set amount of time, wins.

Ugg-Tect is a great activity on a weekend away with friends, or on team-building with colleagues. In my experience the laughter far outweighed the frustration (even when we were failing miserably at completing building cards). I think the game might even be useful in courses about communication.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A silly party game with rubber clubs and funny acting team versus team action...

Each team choses an architect who takes an objective card showing the constructed monument in it's finished state. Now he tries to make his team pick up a wooden component and place it according to the card. The problem is, you are located in the stone age and you have to communicated accordingly! A silly gesture for the piece; a silly sound for what to do with it and the club for yes and no (or expressing your anger...)

Awesome and fast fun if you are in the right mood - has the potential to break the ice but try to keep everybody involved and mix the teams from time to time...

I had high hopes for this one.  Unfortunately the game sputters because of the different words and phrases that need to be learned and said quickly.  If these words were easy to remember it would be one thing, but you have to quickly check between the helper card and the situation in order to say the right thing, and then the builder has to check and figure it out.  It would seem to be a lot better just grunting.  I had high hopes!

Silly game where one player uses a funny, limited, grunt-ish caveman language to get his teammates to place several wooden shapes and one flat cardboard rectangle into a specific configuration.

Somewhat entertaining, but there are a lot better light party games available.

RATING: 5
A simpler party-style game where one person directs a team into building a structure using only hand gestures, "cave man speak", and bopping them on the head with an inflatable club.  Pretty interesting in concept, I really like it as an exercise and teaching tool.  This game would be great in a classroom or even a work team-building event to get people to work together.

I'm not at all enthusiastic about playing it again at my own leisure though.  The game went from fun, interesting concept to frustrating way too fast and even when it wasn't frustrating it got a little boring.

It got frustrating due to some of the more difficult (5-point) projects.  The jump in difficulty from 4 to 5 point projects is astounding and by about the third minute of the director and his team not connecting on how to place the same piece there is no more fun left to be had.

Also, the game suffers from a lack of content.  There are only 24 cards in the project deck and a team can go through 3+ of them in one game.  Between two teams you're looking at going through 25% or more of the deck in one play and if playing with the same people once you have to recycle the deck they may be able to easily remember how to put together some of the projects.  Even without recycling the deck, my team caught on that some of the projects followed certain patterns and symmetry and were able to place some pieces without any direction.

Overall not terrible but mostly a pass for me.

Uggtect is an excellent seeming premise that doesn't have enough going on to quite work. Even something as simple as more cards and some additional challenge modifiers could have made this game really sing. As it stands, its a great game to play exactly once.

A kind-of brilliant team game. I feel as though different words could have been used that would feel more 'authentic' but that's a pretty minor quibble. I'm also unsure exactly how long the inflatable clubs will last for...

As it is, it works remarkably well.

Update: Once people have played this once or twice, you start to learn the patterns, if not the actual positions of the pieces, making the game really far too easy and more about speed guessing than communication. It's still an excellent game, we've just played it out.

This is basically a partygamish dexterity co-op. The idea is fun but somehow fails to transform to fun gameplay - at least for me.

This can be very fun with the right people and with sufficient amount of alcohol. I would not say it is a *game* though.

With the right crowd (teenagers, non-gamers, drunk gamers), this game is a lot of fun. Learning a new language and trying to use the limited vocabulary to do specific things is a fun challenge. Great components, but there should probably be more cards as it will be easy to recognize certain structures if played often enough.

RATING: 5
As a spectacle game, Aargh!Tech is effective.  The concept of restricted vocabulary is straightforward, and although the theme could be virtually anything, caveman language is appropriate.  Something's not quite right with how the cards get doled out, however, because a discrepency in goals will heavily favor the team with the simple mission, leaving an awful lot to chance.  Replayability is low.

Hands down my absolute favorite game with an inflatable spiked caveman club. For a party game this is brilliant.

Good-ish.  Clunking heads is fun for all ages, and the wood blocks and word commands make for a game which becomes more fun the more people get frustrated.  So, it did what it advertised, but wears out its welcome and then goes back onto the shelf for awhile.  Rinse and repeat every 6 months.

After a couple of plays, I am a little disappointed. Not as fun as I thought it would be. I thought this would be a huge hit with my daughters. They like it, but don't love it.

Fun, loud party game. Having an excuse to grunt like a caveman is a definite plus.

Hilarious. Not focused on gamers as the target market, which is fine for games of this type.  The inflatable club adds to the fun.  It's really, really tough to get the idea across to your partner when you both have to keep looking at a sheet for translation.  Making a phrase mean the opposite when it's said twice in succession is an ingenious way of upping the difficulty level.  I'm not certain that this is extremely replayable, as I am guessing the communication will get easier and thus the game not as fun, but this is going to be a riot for several plays.

More of a team-building exercise than a game. Hitting people on the head with an inflatable club is not fun in my book.  Insufferable.

Clubbing your partner is theoretically awesome, but sometimes theory and practice don't mesh 100%.

Nitrous oxide ("sweet air") would improve gameplay quite a bit. No surprise there, since it improves everything.

Played twice. Actually a pretty funny game. But, come on, only 24 cards?!? Since this game is definitely gonna see repeated play, it is guaranteed that people are going to memorize those cards. Expansion, anyone?

Fun like all heck! Be sure to play with the Aargh!Tect standing behind his team of builders, this helps in directing them to place the pieces. It's kind of fun to look at your first couple of cards, and think, "how the heck will we build that?" However, after you complete your first card you will realize that it's indeed possible and the game kicks into gear.

I highly recommend this as a party game.

Amazing party game. The learning curve is very quick and helps with team building and great attitudes. My entire group loved this, and was cheering and tense at the end of every round. We probably played 20-30 rounds in one night, which is a testament to how fun it is. I highly recommend it.

Stupid silly fun - nothing wrong with that at all :-)
Sadly I can't see this game hitting the table to often - it's just a bit too over the top.
Oh and btw: some puzzles are not easy at all and you need a good team to solve them in a timely matter.

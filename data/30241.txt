RATING: 7.5
A super-filler.  It is light, easy to explain and plays in 25 mins.  What's more there are some nice mechanisms, which although very typical for Euro Games, somehow seem just fresh enough to make this interesting.  My group enjoyed it and found that there were just the right amount of decisions to be made in a quick 4 player game.  It's also attractive to look at.  I think it'll get a fair amount of play over the years.

RATING: 5
An overlooked, easy-playing tactical game that moves along nicely. Each turn, you essentially decide:
 
a) where you want to place a piece, 
b) battle for control of a valuable city, and 
c) in the process get the best card for your next turn.

The rub is that if you don't have the card to perform a), you'll have to look around the board to see where you can get it-- which might be in a less valuable city. So there's a short chain of steps to think about; essentially you'll always be looking ahead one turn.

RATING: 8
A nice little Schacht design. After a handful of games, I still get that nice, tingly feeling when it comes down to the end: have I planned well enough for the scoring, or has someone outsmarted me? Much like China, a filler-length game with some very interesting gameplay.

RATING: 7.2
Initial rating, based on a single 3-player game. Swift area-majority game, with lovely tactile pieces and interesting tradeoffs / decisions. Luck probably plays more of a role than I like (there frequently just was no route for me to get any of the cards I really wanted/needed), and I suspect the lack of control will weight more heavily with more players, making this initial rating go down a bit. Still, I'm initially positively surprised by this game, and would definitely like to play it a few more times.

I had a feeling I couldn't make any choice. You have 3 cards to play with, but if there's not a good opportunity, you just have to make a choice. That choice is good or bad (afterwards). So my strategy was to play my best card, but because there was no follow-up of my action, I scored no points. I had to build always in different Cities, so when I could score, the City was counted already.

[i]Posted: 7/17/17 Rated: 6[/i]

Mechanically speaking, [i]Patrician[/i] is a sound game.  I can feel the maths at play: each city can support an odd numbered amount of floors being placed within it, which guarantees one tower will be higher than the other.  The deck of cards represents all of the floors that can be built across the entire board, and no more.  Choosing to place a card in one city may be done simply to capture the building card it offers for use on a subsequent turn.

All of that clever design work is present.  In total, [i]Patrician[/i] feels like a very solvable puzzle.  You can plan ahead for when you are going to place a floor in a given city, knowing your current representation vs. your opponents', and how many opportunities are still left.  The whole idea of building "patrician towers" doesn't resonate, though; you're still battling known quantities and calculating the numbers for majorities.

The art on the cover is quite nice. I find the art of the board and cards to be very apropos of the "noughties:" bland earth tones with subdued color highlights.  It's not the gaudy, primary colorfest of games from the nineties, nor is it the overblown, highly artistic expressions we've come to expect form current games.  It's good and serviceable for its time, but it shows its age.

As an introduction to the "area control" mechanic, I find [i]Patrician[/i] to be perfectly serviceable.  Beyond that, I suppose it is relatively quick and the finite amount of information to be juggled makes it feel less random in its outcomes.  There's a definite hint of that "initiation angst" that I so dearly love in [i][thing=50][/thing][/i].  I doubt that [i]Patrician[/i] has the same kind of staying power.

RATING: 8
Maybe too balanced. My kids whipped me, but it is a clever area influence with a nice card drafting twist.
Upgraded after two plays with five players. It is tense, and a "filler with a board and wooden towers".
The somewhat predictable endgame forces you to plan ahead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The theme is similar to many other euro games, and the mechanics are as well, but it comes together fairly well. Nothing special, and for non gamers it will be better than for those of us jaded by more experience.

RATING: 7
Fast, fun game. Simple, but elegant design is easy to teach and fun to play. May not be deep enough for some, but it is a fun filler and can be played with kids. 

Update: Bumping to a 9. This is quickly turning into a family and game group favorite. Some say it plays like China, one of my favorite games, but, I think the gameplay is different enough to justify having, playing and loving both games. They are both great, and different enough, in their own way. Go buy this one!

I like this game a lot! Played once with 2 players, I won 63-54. Maybe that's why I liked it so much? :) Seriously, there is a lot going on here. You have to play your cards not only to get your pieces into the towers, but also to get the correct cards to help you later in the game. And don't overlook the faces on the cards. Those bonuses can add up! Ask my opponent! BWWAHAHAHA!!!

Light and easy-to-play abstract game that feels like it's designed by Schacht with all of the push and pull.  There is certainly some luck in where the cards fall.  I enjoyed my one play and I'd play again, but probably another game I won't be itching to play.

I tried it again and it was another good play, but I still don't think it's a great game.  I'd play it again a few times.

A simple game with a lot of nuance. Do you focus on towers for points or try to finish some sets?

Another elegant Schacht design.

Another great, light, but tense and challenging Schacht design. The rules can be explained in two minutes, but the game is very tricky and quite competitive as you bump up against each other, taking desired spots and claiming majorities. Knowing whether to go for nobles or doubles can also be a challenge. But since it only lasts for twenty minutes or so, it doesn't feel heavy at all. Great game!

Fun and quick.  I like it.  The randomness of the card placement can be a little frustrating when you can't "get" to the card you want, but that is a good reason to save the "?" cards until you really need to use them.

RATING: 6.5
Feels like a lighter Web of Power at times.  Plays quickly.  Good opener, but not a good closer due to it being a bit dry.  I like laughs to close a night.  The floor pieces are satisfying in heft and are my favorite part of the physical game design, and I like both the cards and the double-sided board as well.  Not sure what I paid for it, but worth $20-22 for a pretty lighter game for families, or an attractive opener.

I'm putting this in the "Medium" category, although it seems to waiver between the two.  Played twice so far (4 player both times0, not sure if it is just us players, but it seems to have some depth.  In first game I was going to "go collect faces", and ended up doing something completely different.  However, in the second game I actually had a plan to collect two of three portraits, get double tower build cards for the end of the game, and executed it wonderfully.

Overall, its a good game.  Seems to "need" something some point in the game, but then at other times it doesn't seem to need anything more.  Definitely interested in trying it again.

A quick game...so that is good I guess.  Seems like a weak version of Capitol to me.  I don't feel like I have any control when I play this game.

Its a decent area influence game where a hand of three cards determines where you can play (like china) but you are stacking your pieces into towers and you want to be on top.  Each area has a maximum number of pieces that can go there until it scores.  It works- but it is kind of forgettable.

A decent filler game, but I have a shelf full of much better fillers. The theme is paper thin; did patricians really build alternating floors of the same tower?  The game has little tension, few meaningful decisions, and leaves one with a feeling of "what's the point" crossed with "that's it?".  

I'd never choose to play it again.

Despite the dry theme and a box cover that wouldn't capture the interest of many, this is a great family/gateway game.  There are aspects of card drafting, hand management and area control wrapped up in a quick game with some interesting choices.  The abundance of wooden pieces (that actually build stuff!) should pique the interest of non-gamers and kids (it worked on my 9 y.o.).  Very happy with this one -- I think my 6 y.o. may even be able to handle it.

RATING: 4
What starts out as a nice-looking and simple majority game devolves quickly into a [i]nice-looking[/i] and [i]simple[/i] majority game. The players are requested to put cute interlocking roof tiles on top of each other in various city districts to tally their influence there. But they are not allowed to chose freely: they must play a card from their hand indicating a particular colour of the district, and must then refill their hand with the card laying at that district. [i]That[/i] space is then refilled by a card from the draw deck. Play continues until districts are full upon which they are tallied, and at the end of the game the player with the highest score wins.

The problem I have with this game is that the cards eventually dictate everything. You only have three in your hands, and in order to secure some influence somewhere you want to pick up the same colour card as you just played. That is a rare occasion, so what happens is that players place their roof tiles rather haphazardly, or at best in a series of hops from colour to colour hopefully ending up where they started out from. There is some vague relationship with the pigeonhole principle, which guarantees that every district is evaluated, and gives attentive players the guarantee that their majorities will not be threatened in a meaningful way. All in all, gameplay is disappointing if you expect too much from it, and it is unfortunate that 'too much' in this case appears to be, in face, 'little'.

I suppose that for families looking for a quick and fun game, Patrizier scratches a certain itch. But for experienced gamers it is a dull and boring affair, easily surpassed by the well-known majority games in existence. Yes, there is a place for simple games too, but I think that care must be taken to not make things [i]too[/i] simple as well, which happened here.

To be honest, the game would be improved, IMHO, if there were more cards than there were spaces, to create a higher level of uncertainty regarding the placement of towers.

Master builders trying to profit from these vanity-driven families. You build these towers floor by floor, ready to take credit for making them look good.

Area-influence type game where each region scores twice once its max capacity is reached.  Early on in the game, I'm not sure how much your decisions affect the board.  It's really about max/min'ing your piece placement later in the game so you can gain majorities.  You are constrained by what cards you pick up, so sometimes the best plans do not come to fruition.  It's fast though, so I can see this getting played even though the play isn't all that interesting.

I liked the puzzle-ish mechanism of trying to figure out what cards to play to get the cards you need to build the towers you really want.

SOLD IT! ($5)

You can't fault the simple ease to play the game. It kind of runs itself and no matter how badly you make decisions, you will never do that poorly. Graphically, I have a few gripes: the roman numerals for size limits are WAY too small and hard to refer to, the 6/9 score chips are a bit tricky to tell apart, and I had a hard time finding the color of the city quickly (as my eye kept being drawn to the color of the cards next to them).

The flow of the game takes you along, but by working the timing of your actions, there's a chance to improve your relative situation.

We like it;  it's quick (not that one is waiting for it to finish - more that it fits perhaps, at the end of the day) and requires minimal set up - yet engaging enough that it's fun to think through the options / turn.

Played as a 2player game today - really enjoyed it though I lost badly. The end scoring meant my opponent picked up the high value cities with only a few tokens. I was left playing on the yellow and blue cities, which only gave me more yellow and blue cards. The game is very very simple, but with enough simple tactics to make decisions important. I'd really like to play this with 4 or 5 players now.

A fast, attractive, light-weight game that has enough strategy to make it enjoyable.  No roll of the dice.  Winning points based on choices you make during the game.  A very good gateway game or family game, especially for  non-gamers.  Glad I have it in my collection--I always need a wide selection of the lighter games to keep my interest up in playing them.  ....now, if I could just get them to try new games.....

Well, I like the look of the game but I just don't get it so far. I'm a fan of the designer and  I like the fact that Schacht games usually have a map to link areas together.  This map element helps me visualize  what to do and I tend to think of them as chain building games.  However, Patrician gives me the feeling that things are just floating all over and I'm not sure how to play it best.   I will keep trying...

RATING: 7
Interesting and very simple game. Has a little bit of "china" for the ultra-simple card play, but it's something all its own where you try to plan ahead to get the card you really want. Tried with 3, suspect it's much more chaotic (and less interesting) with 5. Here is a variant I suggest: towards the end, when you play a region that doesn't have a card anymore, you -do not- get to pick the card of your choice unless you just played your last card. This has the advantage of rewarding careful planning, instead of giving an unfair advantage for playing on an "empty" region.

RATING: 6
A simple area majority game that puts severe constraints on what players are allowed to do but at the same time still offers some wriggle room and perhaps a couple more decision points than apparent at first glance, all in a very short time frame. Luck of the draw plays an important role but with a Schacht game that's really par for the course.

An easy-going "play a card, place a piece, take a card" sort of game.  I could begin to see little ways of manipulating the board in my favour, but something just felt off about this one.  Maybe I felt limited or that my decisions didn't ever really feel weighted enough. I felt too care free without any concern about scores until the very end. Perhaps a stronger game with less players? Hmm...

After two plays I'm having a hard time liking a game I was predisposed to like.  Card-driven, area majority, quick-playing, excellent components, Michael Schacht, but...

Far too luck driven.  This game is clearly inferior to Web of Power/China of which it resembles.  The portrait scoring mechanism is too strong and too much about luck of the draw. A reviewer has pointed out the problem with the card play eliminating much of the tension that a game like this should have.  I'm not "getting it" yet.

On one hand - very simple and intuitive (I like that) abstract game with some theme pasted on. 45 minutes of a pleasant gameplay. On the other hand there is in fact a problem mentioned in some reviews - from some point in the game the best tactics is to wait as long as possible and make no important move at all. It doesn't contribute to a good entertainment in any way.

Decent and quick game with a flaw (from my point of view) in the mechanics.

OK area control game.  Seemed to run out of tension at the end as the number of cards match the city towers exactly so people can 'close out' positions early, or are left in a game of chicken where the last to play will win. Maybe will see more in future plays, but there are so many games in the pile to play....

I am starting this one off pretty high, I know.  It has a lot of elements that I like, and it plays quickly.

Michael Schacht can chalk up yet another great game to his credit.

Q: I hear that this game is alot like China/Web of Power, is this true?

A: In short, yes, there are many similarities including the overall feel. However, this is most certainly its own game and should not be accused of being a "clone".

Q: OK, could you be a bit more specific?

A: Sure. I am frimly of the opinion that Patrician is the third evolutionary step of this "system" (Web of Power / China / Patrician). This is not to say that Patrician is a better game, in fact WoP and China are probably better gamer games while Patrician is more user friendly for new or non-gamers.

When compared to Web of Power and China, Patrician has a leg up on a few fronts. Rule clarity, more intuitive scoring, better bits, WAY MORE attractive presentation on the board and box.

Should you own WoP or China already I would suggest that you try this one before you commit to the purchase. Should you be in the market for Wop or China, I would highly recommend checking this one out before you buy any of them.

Like most of Michael Schacht's games this is a light abstract with attractive components and a historical theme. Majority tower building games are quite common though, Capitol is better, Marble Arch worse, leaving this firmly in 'Hmmm' territory. Tactically quite limited as it's essential to do well in the high scoring cities and if you don't you can't compensate by getting more of the low scoring ones. I'll stick to Web of Power.

RATING: 6
Quick, abstract area-control game.  At first appears quite similar to China, but the cards play quite differently and the cities are in play for longer.  There's more to keep track of here than one might initially expect. The rules about taking cards toward the end of the game significantly increase the randomness, though, doing some damage to the planning that is possible earlier. (5 plays)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First played on September 20th, 2007.  This takes about 10 minutes to go over the rules and 45  minutes to play for the four of us.  You are dealt 3 cards and place one in one of 9 (or 10 if 5 player) buildings.  Each building has two tower sections and gains you points for the most in each tower.  The tallest tower gets the higher score.  To win the tower points, you must have the most pieces in that tower.  In tie cases, the player on top wins.  You can win both tower points by the way.  You goal is to have the high points (duh).  After you place your token in a tower, you take and special action the card you played has and then take the card in that building's area.  Some cards let you play two tokens instead of one.  Special action are: 1) move a token in another building where you have at least one (doesn't have to be yours moved) 2) take any card from the board.  At the end of the game, you also get points for a set of 3 of the same person worth 6 points.  I'd strongly recommened giving this a game play if you know someone who has it.  I'd also recommend giving this consideration for purchase and including in your rotation of games played on a regular basis.

Was it actually good?  Or just okay?  Dang, it's just really hard to tell.  Quite like the "Tower of Babel" issue.  Only this one seemed faster yet more strategic.

I really liked the card counting aspect.  I realize that many other people wouldn't, but it appealed to me.

I like that the head collection was just enough other points to make a viable path.

And yet, your choices were so constrained.

Hrm hrm.  I did like it more than El Grande it seemed though.  Gah.

I am a huge Michael Schact fan, but when he misses the mark for me, he misses it widely.  This game, sadly, is an example of the later.  Part of the problem is that his designs are so minimalist, if you don't like one element of the game, it is likely to have a huge impact on your view of the game overall.  To some extent, that's the problem here.  But the pacing too, seems off.  Just when your decisions seem to be creshendoing into something meaningful, the cards run out, and suddenly you have cards that do not matter to you at all.  Additionally, the hidden information in the game is annoying.  Its knowable information that you could track to great effect, but the gaming experience hardly merits it.

I'm not a big fan of hidden/trackable information, so the bonus scoring isn't my favorite part of the game, but the placement and stuff is reasonably fun.  I suppose if I was able to keep track of what cards people picked up, I might do better, but I don't suppose I like this game enough to ever work at getting better at it.

Online and FTF play. Easy to grasp and quick-playing area majority game. It's not very remarkable but a solid effort. Area control-type games are not my favourite and Patrician has the usual marks of the genre. Lose a battle with high stakes and you'll have a hard time winning. Get lucky to sneak into a scoring with low stakes to play for the win. In the multiplayer game, there can be some unwanted kingmaking. The playing time of only 45 minutes is its main advantage in a crowded genre.

A surprisingly fun little game.  I initially ignored this because of the lackluster theme and the relatively high price for what seems like a filler game.  But due to Michael Schacht/Mabiweb's online implementation I was won over.  This is essentially an abstract, especially when played with 2 players, but I find the game to be easy to learn and pleasant to play.  It is pretty low stress, you can think as much as you care to, but it's not a brain burner.  For someone like me, who plays completely tactically without regard for long range success, it is relaxing and fun.  I should note that any downtime whatsoever would kill the game, but when played quickly it is a nice filler game with good components.

I liked some mechanics in the game but there is so much problems with this game that it does not make it fun. First, there is an information overflow which makes it hard to analyse.  Finding your best move is already hard, blocking other players is absolutely out of the question. Second, some cards special abilities are worthless after some point in the game. So if you end up drawing them near the end, the card is less valuable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very nice quick, light area influence/stacking game where there are just exactly enough cards to build all the towers pieces in all the cities.  There is a delicate but subtle mixture of "playing chicken" (to delay building cards to be last tower piece on the top) versus building early (especially with double build or lateral move cards) to gain/lock-in plurality.  The playing chicken quality reminds me of Medina, while the building of towers for plurality to lock/maximize points reminds me of Capitol (both games which I thoroughly enjoy).  But, Patrician plays much faster and lighter than either of those and therefore serves as an excellent comparable filler.

This is a relatively light area majority game.  You get cards  and try to get majorities in each city with ties being broken by whoever has a piece on top.  Cities are scored when you reach a the total pieces for that city.  As you complete cards you keep them and try to make sets.  Sets can garner a lot of points.  

Not a bad game and I liked it.  However, I can see this playing out the same way as the cards are always the same. They are shuffled but the game will feel the same.  Even though I initially would have give a 6, I am giving it a 5 as I don't think it has longer term replay-ability.

The idea of having your move decide what your future options are going to be sounds nice in theory and works very well as a game. From a placid beginning where we all tried to get acquainted with the flow of Patrizier, our first game turned surprisingly quick into a very tense battle to the finish.
We've snapped it up at Essen'08 for 5€, and I'd expect it to hit the table fairly regularly - short play time, works excellently with three to five players and provides a lot of tense decisions throughout.
Played 5+ times.

An abstract area-control with a similar "feel" to Web of Power.  You have a small hand of cards which determine where you can place influence.  Interestingly where you place influence determines the next card you'll receive.  Good game if you like taxing your brain.  Would like to try this with the Messenger variant/expansion.

Patrician reminds a bit about Schacht's masterpiece China. As in China, you play cards to place pieces to gain majority (only in city towers instead of regions). The city limit and the fact that top pieces win tie breaks makes timing critical - you want to place the pieces that give you the majority and close the city for further pieces.

Less elegant compared to China are the special cards that lets you build set or modify the towers but in return they add important decisions to the card management - you want to place in the cities where you can gain a majority and where you can pick up a useful card afterwards.

Overall, Patrician is a worthy representative of Schacht's clean game designs.

We tried a 3-player [b]Patrician[/b]. It was a simple little game. Okay, but nothing special. In the game you have a hand of 3 cards, and on a turn you play a card to your tableau, corresponding to one of nine colored locations, which allows you to add to the two towers in that location with one (or occasionally two) of your own tower pieces. You also get to take the face-up card located there, and then draw a new one to replace it. When a location fills up (5 to 9 pieces) you award points to the majority leader in each tower, with the higher tower giving the most points. The cards with one tower placement also have either leader faces - awarding you points for sets of 3 - or special actions which allow you to move the top tower piece in a region or take any card. Game ends when all cards are played. I usually dislike area majority games, but this one limited rearrangement of the placed towers such that there was little chaos, and the distribution of the cards exactly matched the numbers to fill them up, so you could actually plan ahead a little.

RATING: 7
Very good abstract with a thin dusting of theme. Great artwork on the boxlid. Plays quickly and is fast to learn. Only drawback is confusion about where to play cards - new players tend to get confused between the symbols on cards available for capture on the board and the symbols next to cities. Consequently they sometimes play a card on the wrong city. Not a huge issue.

As you can see, this is not a very good game. It has some nice aspects; you have to sacrifice some points in order to get others or in order to prevent an opponent from getting points, but overall, it seems that you just have to hope for the best. May be good to show new players how majority and fighting for spaces works, but even then, I can think of much better games. It is short, so it can be played quickly and can almost be a filler, in that aspect it is more worthwhile.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
On the surface it seems like a light area control game, but really there's a lot to keep track of.  While making tower placements to try to secure the tallest towers, you're also trying to place in cities where you can get double tower cards, plus keep track of how many heads you need to make sets and get those when you can.  And then, you can watch what cards other people are taking and make plans based on what they will do.  However, the large random element in what cards come up severely limits your choices, making planning difficult.

RATING: 4
UPDATE: After a second play, dropped from 6.5 to 4. All the effort analyzing the board state (which is much busier than your typical filler) is not worth the very limited number of decisions available to you, and the board state changes so much between turns that it's not worth the effort to plan ahead.

Worse, the second game felt the same as the first game. Like many of Schacht's designs, the game feels scripted. The game constrains player decisions so much, as well as how the game progresses, that games feel the same: For instance, in every game, all spaces will have the same number of blocks and all players will play the same amount of turns.

==================

Better than I expected, considering that many of Schacht's designs usually flat for me.

In contrast to many of his light board game designs, the tempo of the game isn't hampered by scoring throughout the game. All the scoring happens at the end, and there's no irritating scoring track surrounding the board. Just a few scoring chips, and some set collection to keep track of and that's it.

Unfortunately, the extreme busy-ness of the board almost nullifies the streamlined scoring. You have to deal with ten areas differentiated only by color, and ten cards to draft from. However, I think with repeated play, this shouldn't be much of a problem.

The card drafting mechanism (you get the card from the area in which you play) is clever and adds a bit more strategy to the mix -- do you solidify your position in a city now or play elsewhere because its card there is better?

The theme integration sucks, though. It's much less thematic than China or Web of Power since the cities depicted on the board have no significance at all in the game -- they are not even positioned as they would on a map of Italy.

I like how fast Patrician plays. It's quick moving and has an interesting scoring system.

I found the end game frustrating, the part where each player got to pick their cards from any sector.  If I had a plan which card I was going to play, someone would always take my card set without playing in that area and I found that frustrating.

Breezy, enjoyable Michael Schacht majority control game. It's a little difficult to discern what's going on, partly because of the slightly busy graphics. The roman numerals that indicate the floor limit for each city are way too small, and it is a minor nuisance to count the floors to determine which are close to scoring. Those annoyances lowered my rating by half a point, but I still recommend this light game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Typical Schacht - fast play with limited resources.  My only concern is how much control a player really has.  They play to a city to draw the card by that city which they eventually play.  If the flow of cards locks a player out of the larger cities - there is no way to get into it.  Just don't have enough experience with the game to know how prevalent this will be, but will be watching for it if this game gets repeated plays.

RATING: 3
According to card game maven, David Parlett, "Strategy is  not absense of luck but the presense of substantive choice."

Here is a game with minimal luck (Every card after the deal is drawn face up and all will be used), but whole lot of nothing when it comes to substantive choice.  You basically have 3 choices each turn and limited ways of knowing which is the best.  

Unlike most drafting games, the cards you can choose are usually limited by where you play--so you can't react to the player drafting ahead of you (He's taking my Greens, better start collecting Blues.) and you can't screw the player after you (He's collecting Greens, I'll take that.)  That means almost no interaction.  UGH!

China/Web of Power are MUCH better games.

I love it when you discover a gem in your collection. The ho-hum reviews of this title and the bland theming caused me to ignore it for too long. Finally brought this apparently lackluster game to the table for a couple two player matches against my wife. What a great game... Love the choices... every single turn matters, love the tower building mechanic... wonderful wood stacking components, love the set collection bonuses and the ability to swap your opponents tower sections with certain cards you can draft. It's the perfect length too, doesn't overstay its welcome. I've read it's much better at higher player counts and I can see how it would be really great with more opponents, but it's quite good head to head. That said, really looking forward to 3P and 4P. Patrician is one of those games that makes you want to play again immediately afterward to improve on your strategy. If you enjoy abstract strategies give this one a chance, I'll bet you enjoy it too!

This is a nice typical Euro.  As usual in the late oughts, game design is wrapped up with manipulating drafting.  Schacht usually plays around with types of actions being constrained by available cards or positioning, this is no exception.  Because it is light, it works well and doesn't overstay its welcome.  It is a quick filler and offers a number of little decisions.  Who can say what real effect you have on the outcome of the game, but it at least gives a nice illusion of control.

UPDATE: With 5 the game is dreadful.  The addition of another suit of cards and city means that it is much more difficult to control your positioning. The chaos level is extreme, and the drafting process even more frustrating as you have no chance of planning out your turn while other players are going.  Who knows what cards will be left for you?  With more players cities tend to be taken entirely (1st and 2nd) by players as they mix it up less and rely on doubles to close out cities.  With 5 players I give this a 3.

Like most Schacht creations, I always feel like I am coming along for the ride. Patrician is no exception. Its a simple area control game involving the placement of towers in Italian cities with a build limit. Play a card in the appropriate city, place your tower(s) and pick up the card in the city. Two majority VPs for each tower in each city plus a patrician match mechanic. It played so fast with four (less than a half hour) and was a great night cap.

UPDATE: This game plays badly with 5. Stick to 3 or 4 and you should have a blast.

This is sort-of an area control game, as you build towers in different areas and try to have the most pieces in the tallest towers.  At first glance, not particularly complex, but since the cards that you get for subsequent rounds are based on the cards you play, it definitely allows for some good strategy.  The player interaction is also quite good, since what others do definitely affects your plays.

UPDATE: Moving up to an 8, as it is a fun [i]and fast[/i] play!

This was a fun game.  I found it smooth and easy to explain. It had interesting choices about what to take and when to stay in the lead.  Having only two choices in each area reduces the decision space, so the game moved faster.  I'm not sure about the bonus heads and how much control you have for those.  It's also a good set of interesting decisions for the time.  Nice job.

Must play with the Messengers expansion (it's free) and with scoring cards open to make this an excellent game.  Very good with 2 to 4 players, but really not good at all with 5 players despite the special board and cards.  Can be frustrating at the end of the game when you realize someone has misplayed a card and now you have an extra you don't know what to do with (which is easy to do given the similar colors).  Interesting to note how the game is played online at michaelschacht.net: only 2 to 4 players, open scoring, and always with the Messengers expansion.

This is a light and faster game (about like Hansa for depth and length). I'll have to play a few more times to know for sure, but there feels like there is a good luck factor involved where a player can develop no synergy with the choices that are available depending on how the cards come out. Otherwise, this is a fairly simple and short area control game where the last person to max out an area breaks ties.

This game is like a room furnished with antiques - it's easy to admire but tough to warm up to. On the plus side, the design in Patrician is tight and streamlined - almost elegant - and despite the intracately interwoven mechanics where each move and decision affects the next, it moves along pretty quickly. Sadly, Patrician also lacks fun and flavor, and devolves into a card-counting waiting game at the end. Fans of abstracts will probably find this more enjoyable than I did ...

Demoed a copy at Origins 2008.  Felt like I had already played this card driven building a tower game before.  Not bad, just nothing special that will make me ever request it.

Opinions vary, I like this game and feel the rules work just fine without tweeking.  I will be happy to play this whenever the opportunity arises.

I suppose that Patrician is just another medieval-themed area control game. And, without the tower pieces, I might have a hard time getting it played. But, hooking people with the wooden floors, I can entice people into a very fun, quick game that simply has an unfortunate theme. Regardless, I think Patrician will be one of the my most played games of 2007. It's not simply because the game is simple to teach and quick to play. Instead, it's a mixture of tower building, area control, and getting the right card at the right time. A satisfying game is Patrician.  See my review for more details...

My rating is based on a 3-player game - I don't expect I would like it as much with more players, although I'm willing to try.

It is not just "random" but it is VERY oblique.  My most frequent opponents don't quite get it yet, and I win often (2- and 3-players). 

We are surprised to find that we are playing this at much shorter than the 50 minutes proclaimed on the box.

(After 2 3p games)  I think I'd rather play China if given a choice, but this is a good 30 minute filler type game.  I do like the card drafting mechanism.  It also has an interesting set collection vs. special power feature on some of the cards.   Pay attention to the ? mark special power - very useful at the end when cards become scarce.   Many would consider this a bit dry, but I'm OK with it.

Dry game. Build your tower higher than the other guys. Hand management. My opponents were more into it than I was. Not one I'd likely play again.

I mildly enjoyed playing this, but the randomness really does make the facade of control seem silly, especially with more players...

RATING: 5
OK, I can see why people are saying that this game is in the same family that make up Web of Power and China (you're playing one card of three, and trying to influence areas on the board), but beyond that, the game is very different.  Getting your head around the "take the card from the space you're playing to" and trying to navigate which card you want to take for future turns gives the game a very different feel than either WoP or China.  It's not bad, but I'm not sure that I like it any better.

Has those cool tower tiles in.
Light-medium weight (2 - timing, changing board state).
Low player interaction.
Low theme application.

This is a nice, easy game of playing a card and enacting an action. Seemingly simple, it does mask a bit of strategy and tactical opportunity. I love the tower pieces and it looks great for a swift, short game.

Don't let this game fool you. At first when I opened the box and saw it I figured it would be a simple, rather boring game. After multiple plays I am hooked. The game is simple enough to understand, yet there is strategy involed, if you want to win at least. It is especially great with 2 players. A game also can last as little as 20 minutes, so a casual gamer wont get bored. My only complaint is with a brown backround on the board and brown lettering it sometimes is hard to see, but overall a really great little game.

Someone mentioned it feels a little like Manhattan - now that I've played Manhattan, it does share a lot of similarities.  It's definitely important to know that there's "just enough" cards to finish building all the towers.  Seems to involve a lot of card counting though...

very nice simple subtle game with good interactions between players. maybe just three cards in your hand do not give enough choices.
nice and clean mechanism, just the way i like games.

After the second play i confirm the very nice sensation that this game gives me. It flows so easily, with many little battles for supremacies , tricks and gambits... I just like it very much !

RATING: 5
Rating 4 after one game with 2 players. My opponent told me it is much better with 4. 
Rating 6 as a 5 player game (after one game). 

2 player comment: Single moves at the end control the outcome of the whole game (a single late move can make a swing of a 9 point chip, so 18 points difference at the end, at a total of ~50 points per player).

One of the worst examples of themeless, unengaging, card-driven area control games.  The alternate reality where this game is fun is, I imagine, a bleak negative space lacking in all other forms of entertainment.

A small game with a not all that interesting theme, but many decisions to take. Fine game.

Purchased Essen 2007. This is a simple game of area majority with a little bit of set collection. There's actually more decision making involved than first impressions suggest. When is the best time to play a particular card? Are you better off holding on to the cards with special abilities until later in the game, or do you want to save space in your hand for the cards that allow you to play two tower pieces at once? Do you want to follow a chain that brings you the best sets of patricians, or go for cards of higher-scoring colours? 

The game plays quickly enough that you can try two or three rounds in a row.

Straight-forward and probably a good fit for those just grasping the mechanics of area majority games.  However, for me I'd much rather play Manhattan or El Grande.  There is just nothing really interesting taking place here.

After 1 Play: I really enjoyed my first game, but I have not had the chance to play it again.  It is a very clean design, and no doubt some people will find it too dry.  

After 5+ Plays: I still like this game each time.  It's true that most turns you must pick from one of only 6 possibilities, but it is really neat how you can see at the time what six possibilities that choice is likely to leave you with next turn.

RATING: 6
A very cool and fast game. Small player turns and limited options guarantee a fast flow but at the same time you can optimize your turns which allows for quite some tactics. Definitely a good game for a small time period with non-gamers or also as a filler for a long game night. Oh and btw: you can explain the rules only some minutes. Another big plus is that the game starts easy and only from the middle to the end game it gets deeper and deeper...

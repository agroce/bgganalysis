It's a very satisfying, and quite exciting, ride. I could not tell who the winner was until final coins were counted, so although I lost, I always felt in the game. The artwork is stunning and this, in itself, is enough to make me hang on to the game. The fact that the gameplay experience is so engaging, is a real bonus.

The game initially seems interesting but you soon realise it is very dry and deterministic and just centered around a single mechanic.

It also comes in a box that is twice as big as needs to be which put it on the "get rid of" pile for me.

I found Mercurius a little too calculable. The face up cards provide too much information about the likely movements of the shares, with none of the cards in players' hands having an effect that would radically alter your calculations.  So you buy the share that you predict will rise the most and you sell shares that are on the way down.  And that's almost all there is.

Production quality is reasonable and the artwork is evocative of the era.

A simple stock market game. Players on their turn can buy or sell up to 3 stocks and they must play a card that affects the value of 2 of the products. The cards stay in effect for 3 turns so everyone can see what will happen. Its a nice gateway economic game that allows players to read the market and perform some clever moves.

2012. stk hldg, commod spec, hand mgt. Resembles the game called Hab & Gut. Some people think it's an improvement (longer lasting market effects since market cards played stick around for 3 rounds and you'll know more about what is happening with a given stock) but others had negative comments relative to H&G.

Provisional rating - interesting stock game. The fact cards that give increase/decrease hang around for 3 turns means you have 'trends' which is a nice touch.

I bought this one because I love stock holding/market speculation games, and because I heard the designer saw this as an improvement on Hab & Gut, which I really enjoy.

While I think I still give a slight edge to Hab & Gut, the ideas here are also quite interesting, and the game dynamic is quite different.  The prices in this game are much more stable, and seem to be a bit more predictable than Hab & Gut.

The main mechanism in Mercurius is that when you play a price change card, it stays in play in front of you for three turns, so by playing a card that moves a company share up 1, and a commodity down 2 in price, you're actually going to make the company share go up 3, and the commodity go down by 6 over the course of three turns.  Thus, by looking at all the cards in play, you have a good idea of the price trends, but the cards in peoples' hands are still a mystery, which strikes a good balance.

There are also a few special cards.  Every player starts the game with the same special cards, and may use his special cards once per game.  They do things such as activating a dividend for a company, allowing you to sell commodities on the black market, and allowing you to flush your hand a bit.  Timing when to use these can net you some good profits in a game where your profit taking is often only a few bucks per transaction.

Overall, a pretty darn good stock game if stock games are your thing.  I'm a big fan of stock holding games in general, so this was right up my alley!

Good reimplementation of Hab & Gut, although you don't have the "you are out of the game" which I love in Hab & Gut, the rest is better. Deeper than Hab, and funnier... Playing the short run with your shares and comodities. Like it, nevertheless I'd like to give it more tries to define my final opinion

Gra bardzo losowa. Praktycznie ma się minimalny wpływ na przebieg rozgrywki. Nie przyjdą dobre karty to przegraliśmy grę. Po 15 min grania gra zaczyna się nudzić.
Wg mnie konieczny wydaje się alternatywny dobór kart na początku gry i skrócenie rozgrywki w grze dla 3 graczy.

Playing this reminds me of how promising a stock market game seems, but how no game has ever really made one that works for me.

It's hard to not compare Mercurius to Hab & Gut, and it is inferior in every way. Having more complicated resources to purchase (that can't be reduced to just a color) is problematic, but the biggest problem is that all of the information is open. I like the shared private information in Hab & Gut, but once you see a card go down in Mercurius, there is little risk unless everyone gangs up on you. It is possible (and probably recommended) to collude, but there is very little uncertainty. I also would prefer the game to be shorter than it is. We ended up passing for many of our turns.

Slooow and overly long game. Biggest fault though is the utterly uninteresting and overly stabile market, which leaves absolutely no room for clever playing or bold risky moves which are integral part of good stock market games like Black Friday, Speculation or Shark.

Dreadfully boring stock market game where commodities usually go down until the end and stocks go up.  Nickel and diming at its boring most. Play Hab n Gut instead...much more volatility and that game plays quickly.

As the wife of the author of Mercurius I feel fully qualified to express my opinion about the game: 
It is awesome! :)
It requires thinking - not blind luck, it is demanding but not too much, it is based on a unique mechanism, has an interesting topic and is simply fun to play:)

Terrific stock manipulation game.  It just clicks for me.  Good player interaction, nice balance, good play time.  If I want an economic game, this one is at the top of the list right now.  Edit: I have played Hab & Gut once now, and felt that Mercurius is superior.  H&G seemed like it had more randomness in it than I liked.  Mercurius is definitely deeper.

This is one of the very few "stock market" games I have ever wanted to play more than once.  While the rules are very simple, the gameplay they generate is deep.  I suspect the sweet spot is three players, but it plays in no more than 90 minutes with explanation regardless of player count.  The game lends itself to a shifting pattern of alliances.  Beautiful artwork tops off a fascinating package.

Mercurius by name, mercurial by nature; very volatile trading game, which would be OK if the game were around 30-45 minutes long, but it seems to be much longer than that; maybe 60-90 minutes.

With Hab & Gut out of print, the supposedly deeper Mercurius may be a better option. Use your limited market knowledge to buy, sell and influence market prices in a fierce competition with the other players. A game doesn't need much more than that.

A fast, nice and simple stock market game, in which no dice involved (unlike Dividends game), so the game is quite far from being totally random. Even though we can't really control the market, but we still be able influence the market in a clever way to gain profit, because the movement of prices is pretty predictable but to really take advantage from the market is difficult. We play this much more than playing any other stock holding game.

Gioco di speculazione finanziaria ambientato in Olanda molto simile a Hab & Gut. Rispetto a quest'ultimo il gioco raddoppia le merci acquistabili e prevede che ogni mossa influenzi contemporaneamente due risorse, si perde però la parte della beneficienza e della condivisione con i vicini delle carte. In sintesi nulla di nuovo, il gioco risulta anche un tantino stancante se lo si prende come strategico allungando troppo i tempi morti.

One of the Essen 12 crop that I enjoy the least, so far. It's a stock market game played with cards. Players can transact 3 comodities and then play a card changing the price (increasing or decreasing). Along the game, it's the usual for a stock market: you sell high and try to make money in order to invest on other better products that have a low price and try to get them up on the chart to sell later.
Each player has a board in which the cards are played. This board accomodates 3 cards meaning that at the end of a transaction phase, each player will change the prices 3 times (1 from the current round and 2 from previous). On a following turn, the most ancient card in this personal board is removed and a new one appears. 
Every player has a board with 3 cards affecting prices and this information is clear to all. Players know what's going to happen 2 turns ahead. And that's about all what's going on. Other than that, a small amount of minor decisions can be taken once during the game, such as selling in the black market or paying dividends, but these, although respectable actions, are not enough on spicing the game, in my opinion.
Mercurius results in a more than one hour game, tedious and dull, because players do the same over and over. It promotes analysis more than tension in the decision making, because every information on the future market for 2 turns is available. There's no surprise there, at all. Also, the cards that change the prices, are ridiculously uninteresting and repetitive. A ton of cards and changes during gameplay are needed and even that is fiddly and annoying.
For a simple stock market game, I prefer Hab and Gut. An older competitor but with so much more interest in gameplay.

A pretty dry game with very marginalized returns.  Everyone is doing a ton of work to make a single dollar.  Somewhat similar to Hab & Gut, but not nearly as entertaining or enjoyable as Hab & Gut.

RATING: 6
A fun activity.  Our variant (if someone accepts the given quirk) is to keep adding quirks until we find their limit.

RATING: 7
Possibly my favorite party game. It strays away from the sad meta of Cards Against Humanity style games that are entirely shock factor and allows you to actually learn things about your friends albeit often silly and strange. A much better choice for a party game than any of the word association games out there.

Combine this with Heartthrob, and they're much better together. There's a variant in the rulebook that's more like Hearththrob or "The Dating Game" tv show that I think works better than the main game.

This game would be more enjoyable playing the "Funemployed" style variant, but as is there are too many outrageous cards to play the standard mode just to see what combinations come up.

Best used as a funny ice-breaker for casual players who might also enjoy CAH. If you play a second game, I recommend leaving the discards intact, since the humor factor drops after the first read. Replayable at special occasions or with new groups. Happy to own, though!

A delightful part "Game" I use the word game very loosely there. It felt like more of a fun social experience than a game to me, but still extremely enjoyable.

Nice art and some funny cards, but not a lot of game.  Wanted to like it.  Probably works better with alcohol, and a bigger group.  Bigger laughs (and more freedom, not coincidentally) from Snake Oil, with the same sized group.

Demoed at Gen Con, not sure if I would buy this game (maybe if the price is right). Seemed like a fun party game I could get people to play instead of Cards Against Humanity.

Update: Picked up for $12.50 during MM sale.

I like this game so much it makes me angry. It's a fantastic party game that will have you and your friends laughing. Unless you don't like to laugh. Then you should stick to your other games.

Picked this one up at Pax South and had my copy signed by the creator. Really neat game, but the graphics and presentation are supreme. It's sort of a social voting game about who you think the person would date based on two possible actions. 8-Bit art is very cool!

The art on the cards is fantastic. It's a great game to get people talking and socializing. Played with a group of 4 initially, which expanded to a group of 6 as more people watched and wanted to play.

Replay value diminishes quickly.

Would be better without the failed "crossover" cards (e.g. Dr. Boom).

Fun a few times with good friends but it's not really a game, more of a social activity.

RATING: 6
A great social/party game for gamers or non gamers.  It is severely limited by the low number of cards though.  Without an expansion, this will likely get stale quickly.

RATING: 6
This is one of my favorite dirty party games at this point. I highly recommend separating out the deck types and letting people pick. We've also house rules that some perks are actually quirks and vice versa (like the virgin one).

wow. I guess I have no sense of humor, but despite the buzz surrounding this, I found it to be less a game than [gameid=50381]. if you like games where everybody votes and then nothing happens, you could be into this. This is one of those games where folks will tell you, "it's all about the people you play with." What they mean by that is [i]not me[/i].

Always a lot of fun. Great casual game to play and you learn a lot about your peers from it.

We had fun with BB even in a group of friends who don't like party games much. THAT'S saying something!

Friends love it. Great to play to introduce one or two strangers to a group that already knows each other. My enjoyment of this type of game is limited, and I prefer this type of game when it requires players to give answers. It's a little bit too easy to just say "date" or "deny" and move on from there.

7 Plays - This game is 100x more superior than Cards Against Humanity and other such games. It actually delves into people's personalities as people try to explain their pecular dating preferences. This would be a 10/10 except that some of the quirk cards are so confronting for people, that they outweigh any possible perk cards in the deck. 

Love the aussie expansion/ references. Thankyou to the designer for those!

Awesome party game that has a ton of unique and fun cards.  But I really wish this game got more love on Kickstarter because it needs those extra 100 or so cards it would've gotten from stretch goals.  We burned through about 24-30 perks and querks each and with roughly 100 cards in each deck, this game WILL get stale once anyone has seen all of the cards.

But this will remain in my collection purely to bring out to new groups even once it does get stale for myself.

As with most things like this, it isn't much of a game, but it still was an alright way to kill 15-20 minutes.  To keep any sort of replayability, I imagine you'd need to play with different groups.

This is my favorite party game! It is hilarious to see what your friends pick. One thing I like about the game is there are three distinct categories; Naughty, Sci-Fi, Fantasy cards. This is cool because if you were playing with family you can always omit the naughty cards and it is more family friendly. The artwork is funny little 8-bit pictures and the card combinations will have you laughing a lot. Easily can be turned into a drinking game which will just add to it's laughs.

Speed dating in card game form, will you date a Billionaire Banshee?

RATING: 8
I don't know that I can call this a "game" because the point system feels inconsequential. We play it as filler, but no one wins, we just have a fun time talking about these strange things that come up. One issue is that some of the Quirks are way too awful to ever be outweighed by any Perk, and I almost want to take them out because there's no fun discussion there, it's just either super gross or really awful, and it feels like a wasted of a turn. Maybe the "Dating Game" variant will change things up.

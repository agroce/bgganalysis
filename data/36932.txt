An adventure/dungeon crawl game that came out while I was sleeping.

RATING: 8
Very cool dungeon crawl. Have played as both the Heroes (if you could call them that), and as the demons.  Game flows smoothly.  It's a big game, and takes up quite a bit of space, but I don't consider that a downside as the pieces are all exceptionally well done.

RATING: 9.5
An interesting "dungeon-crawl/Ameritrash/dicefest/special abilities" game. Having played several times now, I recall the very first game where the humans (me) got their BUTTS KICKED in SPADES. At first, it was an easy go of it... the trogs were dying very easily. Then they managed to fight back. Misery ensued. All of the other games have been nail-biters or close to being so. Certainly some excitement.

It's certainly not a bad game... It's certainly better than Drakon -- a game this title reminds me of a great deal.

It will get back to the table, as it's an attractive game (heavy cardstock) and has an innovative combat/health mechanic that I think will see more action around here.

This title has superb production value for the price, is basically Space Hulk combined with a little Descent, but with a lot less setup time, a lot more to do, and great replay-ability. Each game is markedly different and exciting. Asmodee has really hit a home-run with this one.

Love this game. Love love love it. Plays very fast (~45 min), love the asymetrical nature of the human side -vs- the demon side, there's enough tactical decisions here to keep things interesting but it's not so deep to encourage Analysis Paralysis. The quality of the components are top-notch, and when you get tired of the scenarios in the game book there's a ton more available on the game's website.

Buen dungeon crawler asimétrico para 2 jugadores. 1h, 1h y poco de duración. Es de reglas y estilo de juego muy sencillo, ideal para introducir a alguien en este tipo de juegos.

This game really scratches my itch for a tactical combat minis game.  I ended up with this instead of Space Hulk, due to the price, and I'm very happy with it.

After many plays as both humans and demons, I'm moving my rating from 9 to 10.  I always want to play Claustrophobia.  It's always tense and engaging, with interesting decisions to be had on both sides.

Some people report that this game is unbalanced, but I can win perfectly well with both sides.  I think that the game -feels- unbalanced when you don't understand the strengths and weaknesses of your side, and don't play it properly.

This is my first 10 rating ever, and this game deserves it.

What is Ameritrash?
Well, you take cool looking plastic pieces and play on a board where you are fighting the hoards of hell in the tunnels underneath new Jerusalem.
Any questions?
Easy game to learn.  THEME! THEME! THEME!  Resource management, combat, great plastic, and ... oh, yeah, did I mention it has theme?

RATING: 7
+ Gorgeous game; Various scenarios give this game lots of potential replayability.
- I just don't have an affinity at all for dungeon-crawling games; No reason for it, by all accounts I should love the game, but after playing it through, it was just "meh" for me.


Why it's previously-owned:
Most of our game sessions are either with friends which means more than two players, or with my wife which means that this theme isn't very appealing.
I traded this for A Few Acres of Snow, a two player game my wife actually enjoys playing.  There isn't a real dungeon crawler game in the collection at the moment; I always think that I'll enjoy these types of game, but I never really do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
Best dungeon crawler for two players where both sides play differently. The game is very streamlined. 
No fiddly accounting or token management. Easy to learn.
I wished there would be more variety for the demon monster types.

This is a nicely done two-player dungeon crawler where the priests are against the satanic demons. It is scenario based, and unfortunatelly there are only a few of them but nevertheless each of them has a fair amount of replayability. It has a uniques mechanism where you each turn select the stats of your heroes based on the die you roll. The strategy for the demons is largely based on the fact that they can overwhelm you, the priests must evade. All-in-all it is an easy and relatively quick to learn game. The painted miniatures are awesome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Awesome 2-player dungeon-delve game. Characters and demons are balanced, although some missions are biased towards one of them. The unique but extremely dark theme and awesome mechanic makes this game a keeper.

RATING: 10
Why I think you should play this game: 

*The tactile experience-the aesthetic, the size, the development of the dungeon-is grand without being baroque. This is truly a visual feast. 

*The theme is darker and funnier than your usual Ameritrash traditions: the French production does absurdity and foreboding at the same time.

*The dynamics are very tense-the humans are replete with power but losing strength every turn; the Demon begins weak but grows more and more threatening. It feels cramped and desperate.

*The combat and movement metrics are elegant. Abilites and numbers are straightforward in application but offer varied application when infused with spatial and tempo concerns. 

*Scenarios play in one hour or less. People have complained one side is better than the other too often. Beyond Who Dares Wins (Scenario 6) I don't think this is true to any imbalanced extent. Each side has its strategic biases and situations it doesn't want to be in. Learn them and mitigate them. 

*The online content and the expansion vault this game into the stratosphere for me. I'd play with De Profundis every time once my opponent knew what was going on; it gives the Demon just enough more to do and makes the Humans more nuanced, too.

[With de Profundis, but haven't played the expansion yet]

I like it ok, but it seems a little over-loved, given that combat is (yes, streamlined is good but...) too dang simple.  Where did the tactics in my tactical dungeon crawl go?  I like it ok, and need to play more scenarios before I decide for sure, but I think that complaint will remain.

Great competitive asymmetric 2p dungeon crawler. Lots of tension, beautiful tile artwork, nice pre-painted minis.

Nevertheless this is a dice chucker, which saves it from becoming an AP prone chess variant.

Wonderful game.

RATING: 9.5
With a 3 year old and a busy work schedule, I don't get much time to play games. So I was very pleased to enjoy every minute of my very first Claustrophobia game.  The rules are straight forward but also allow for great deal of strategy as you crawl through the dungeon.

However one of the most exciting reasons to buy this game is the extensive set of additional scenarios that will keep you coming back again & again!


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Claustrophobia was a good game if you were the monsters. You had so many choices with your dice rolls and had an almost infinite amount of monsters of which you could bring into play. But playing the heroes in this game is the complete opposite. Everything is stacked against you and it seems like it is inevitable for you to lose. Which makes winning as the heroes all that more satisfying.

RATING: 9
ровно то, что я ожидал от "Аркхэма": атмосферное, увлекательное приключение без особых хлопот и поминутного заглядывания в правила. игра строго на двоих, так что с балансом тоже проблем нет. 

нет и гнетущего, кричащего, шипастого стиля Dungeon Twister, с его мозголомными поворотами тайлов (и унылостью небольшого шахматного поля). 

в плане комплектации всё прекрасно, разве что разукрашенные фигурки немного с косяками: судя по портретам роги должны быть с разноцветными банданами, а у фигурок только разный цвет волос. у телохранителей же и цвет волос почему-то одинаковый, пришлось одному повязать шарф из ниточки, чтобы хоть как-то их отличать. 

планируем отыграть все шесть сценариев и распечатать доп.

An easy-to-understand, solid design.  There are moments of tension and the mechanisms in the game are intuitive and don't get in the way of the theme.  The only knock would be that at points (early) the demon player is almost unengaged and at other points (late) the human player has little to do (exhaustion).  Survivors scenario.

RATING: 7
I am partial to the occasional dungeon crawl, but I like them short and snappy, otherwise I start to wonder why I'm not role-playing instead.  Claustrophobia is certainly quite short; you are plunged straight into fast and furious action and the scenarios are designed to reach a climax quickly.  

I am not so keen on the kind of dungeon crawl that is purely about tactical combat.  Claustrophobia is just that; yet I appreciate its very streamlined approach that eliminates all fiddliness and yet doesn't boil down to a mindless dice fest. On the contrary, Claustrophobia gives you plenty to think about. 

So, I have quite enjoyed my plays so far.  There are a couple of niggles.  First, the scenarios I have tried all  seem to favour the demons. Second, there is little variation in the dramatis personae; there are but three human characters and the troglodytes are always the same old hoard. 

Production quality is stunningly good, with painted minis and big, thick tiles.  I found the artwork a slightly mixed bag, the tiles are beautiful, but I found the card and box artwork rather uninspired.  The rules are reasonably good, though I'd still recommend downloading Universal Head's excellent condensed version.

Excellent Dungeon crawl with scenarios that can be played in 45 minutes or less.

Lovin' it.

This one gets ruined by one thing: there's one type of monsters, who swarm everywhere. And once in a while another one comes out, and that's it. Except for that, everything's fine, - the atmosphere, exploration, vicious battles. There's just not enough variety, sadly.

This game has some of the BEST production value when it comes to components - the prepainted minis are exquisite and the best I've seen so far.

The tiles are large and nicely designed, and the visual aspect of the whole game just helps to bring you into the theme. The rules are simple, and the wound system is really innovative. 

I enjoyed this game alot, and for what you pay you really do get every penny's worth back.

Played many a dungeon crawl, but his one is by far the best.  A sublime mixture of elegant mechanics and deep decisions.  Components are beautiful and theme is rich.  I also think it plays great solo, without any modifications.  The die roll activation system for the demon player allows for great solo play.  Playtime, set up and tear down are so much better than any other dungeon crawl.  This is a high fuel economy game, whereas so many others are hogs.

This is a very good 2-player dungeon crawl. This is one of the few dice-based dungeon crawls I have enjoyed. However, I didn't have anyone to play it with on a regular basis and the dice rolling really isn't for me, so I ultimately found that Gloomhaven was the only dungeon crawler I needed to own. I'm not really the target demographic for this game but enjoyed it anyway.

I'm not a dungeon crawl fan, but I did enjoy this one. Probably because it is two-players only, so it doesn't fall into the trap other of its kind fall into. The dice-allocation/action selection mechanism seems interesting and provides a nice balance of strategy and luck.

The biggest problem is there is just not enough variety, an absolute requirement for game of this type. The models are nice but are too few and the hero characters are often hard to tell apart from one another. Even if I were a dungeon-crawler, I still wouldn't buy it.

Labirintusban barangolni, szörnyekkel vagdalkozni, harci érték, sebzés - számomra idegen közeg.

A játék minősége - magért beszél. (festett figurák, szépen megrajzolt lapkák, stb.)
Játékidő - abszolút optimális.
Újrajátszhatóság - kizárt két azonos - még csak hasonló - parti is.
Szabályrendszer - könnyen előadható és értelmezhető.
Közönség - aki csak egy kicsit sem utasítja el ezt a környezetet, jól szórakozhat. Kezdőkkel is abszolút játszható.

This game is great because there are a variety of scenarios to choose from, and based on the scenario you choose the game will vary in: difficulty for the human player, time spent playing the game, weapons/characters used, the tiles you are likely to walk across, etc.

True, the two brutes are twins and the two blades for hire are twins and are difficult to tell apart, but at least their hair color is different. Who really cares what their names are, name them yourself!

RATING: 9
A thematic dungeon crawler with fast paced action and some beautiful painted miniatures. Some tactics and strategy are needed even though game is driven by the dice rolls. Human player is underdog here - he may win from time to time, but even best strategy could be killed by bad rolls. This game is heavy scenario-dependent, so keep in mind there are scenarios easier for one side or another. Still, the first scenario is probably the best one; it gives you full freedom in exploration and is essential to the core of the game mechanisms. Claustrophobia is for people who like thematic games, dungeon crawlers and asymmetric gameplay. And for those who can accept some randomness and unpredictability in exchange for pure fun of exploring and killing. Too bad that while playing as humans is full of tension (they are outnumbered and quickly become weaker as game progresses), playing as demons resembles walk in the park rather (unlike human player, demon player grows stronger and his main forces are usually unlimited). But again, it is thematic-wise. Feel the cold of dark tunnels, smell the stench of abominous foe. Then play this unique game :) 
Highly recommended.

RATING: 8
The Art and miniatures are outstanding, the game is well-designed. Game session lasts about 45-60 minutes, game mechanic enables battle to resolve quickly without bothering with a lot of rules. However, the game seems broken to me as The Demon Faction has more options to make its moves and in a way controls and lead the game. Human player have limited sources. As long as the Demons focus on killing Redeemer, the Human side mostly loses the game.

Pretty good dungeon crawler for 2.  Most games seem to be suspenseful right down to the end.  Game does do some swinging due to dice rolls, but they are rolled often enough that it seems to even out in the end.  Interesting dice system.

RATING: 8
Initial Impressions: This is a tactical game where substance clearly takes a back seat to style. And that's not a bad thing. The card and tile artwork and prepainted minis carry the theme well and the rules are kept simple in order to not detract from the immersion. The missions promise to introduce additional innovative mechanisms that can be discarded after the adventure is done. Simple rules and mechanisms, however, don't mean that the overall game is light. The main decisions in this game are not where to move and who to target, as is in most tactical games. Instead, the toughest decisions are where to allocate your dice and which order to activate your warriors. I admit that this game surprised me with more tension and decisions than I was expecting and I'll gladly play it some more to see if the rest of the missions are as innovative as the one that I played.

One of my favorites at the moment.  This is a great two-player game with high replayability.  The support for the game is excellent, with additional scenarios coming out regularly.  The game is fast, but full of tension.  If you are looking for a quick playing two-player dungeon crawler, with a different "feel" and play style for the two sides, you have your game here.

Update - Have not played in some time, lowered rating slightly but this remains a great two player dungeon romp

RATING: 8
Very good dungeon crawl. I especially like the wound allocation for the humans. Both sides play differently than the other and have their own strategies and tactics. Claustrophobia plays fast, is easy to learn, and has a good rule book. Highly recommended for 2 players looking for a competitive dungeon crawl.

One of my favorite games right now. Easier setup than Space Hulk and Heroscape. Nicer components than Summoner Wars. Not as much stuff to remember as Monsterpocalypse. (And those are all games that I really like!) The changing maps keep it fresh. I like how the good guys take wounds which restricts your choices. Interesting event cards. All it needs is a little more variety (although by itself, it has plenty of value). If they make an expansion for this, I will buy it instantly.

Also, just wanted to add that I almost didn't buy this after watching Tom Vasel's review. But I ended up getting it and I'm really glad I did!

Great 2 player asymmetric dungeon crawl. The sides are SOOOO different in how they play, even though they both use a dice allocation mechanic. Also, the scenarios are varied enough to want to keep playing through them. This would work well as a gateway dungeon crawl.

This game really hit me like a hammer. When we first played it, me and my son both shouted AGAIN! This is a great tactical one on one dungeon crawler game. The reason it's so enjoyable is that it's light enough to learn it in 15 minutes, quick enough to play it within an hour, but still deep enough to offer a real challenge. The clever exploring mechanics make even playing the same scenario a different experience everytime. The use of dice to decide what you can do with your characters is different for both sides but still seems very balanced. The way they ensured replayability with limited components is also worth a big compliment. In the end it comes down to the fact that this game is just very much fun to play. Lastly the components are great. Nice thick tiles and cards. The painted miniatures are also well above par.

Claustrophobia is a scenario based dungeon crawl type of game with asymmetrical player powers, simple rules and entertaining gameplay. 

The excellent production values include thick tiles with very good artwork and painted minis which serve to set the mood and transport you to the scene. The minis are pre-painted and although they are not the best paint jobs, it's pleasing to see that they included them.

The gameplay is thematic, engaging, enjoyable and there is room for tactical and strategical choices. The various scenarios seem to be balanced and there are a plethora of them in the game's website. Here is the link for the scenarios:

http://www.claustrophobia-theboardgame.com/en/?cat=8

Although these type of games are not usually my cup of tea, I found this game to be entertaining with tough choices all in under an hour. Yes, there is randomness and a theme that might put you off, but taken for what it is, it is a fun romp.

Have professionally printed and bound scenario and campaign books.

Ugh. Dice fest that felt heavily unbalanced towards the non-human side.

The trays for tracking dice are fiddly and can be a pain to get the dice from to reroll. All-in-all, it's not fun and poorly realized with the design and paint colors to differentiate the different figures of the same sculpts.

This is one of the best games I have played.  It has great balance and tense moments.  The compenents are very good.  So far the scenarios have been very balanced, maybe slightly favoring the side of evil (which makes winning for the side of good feel like a great accomplishment).  It can really feel like all hell is breaking loose, which is exactly what it is trying to portray.  There is just enough of everything to make you feel like you have a lot of choices without them being overwhelming.  The special abilities, random tiles, gifts and events add to the variety.  I can't believe someone invented a dungeon crawl this good that can be played in around an hour.  You can actually play the same scenario over and over again and it can feel different every single time. This is truly an excellent game.

I like it, but also feel I would like to have more control. This is intended to be a light and quick dungeon crawl, and succeeds at all levels with that. However, I like my dungeon crawls a but meatier and would prefer more complexity even at the cost of a longer playing time. It will get played though, and I am keeping it.

No: It wasn't played, quickly sold it. Too shallow, and I want more tactical options like in Descent.

Probably my favorite that I own, I love the number of possibilities for different scenarios, the number of Demon's allow for a variety of game play options, and overall a very enjoyable game in my mind.  One thing that I've noticed, the demon's seem to have an advantage in a lot of the scenarios and just general game play, it's not a bad thing, but be aware that the game does seem to cater a little to the demon player.

RATING: 5
I am not entirely sure what slowly drove away my enjoyment of this game.  I feel that I should like it, it has a lot of clever new ideas (the use of dice mostly) and I really want a good dungeon crawly game.  Despite this I just find myself bored by the game.  I think that it may just be that the scenarios don't really do a good job of mixing up the play.  Most of the time the humans are just trying to escape which is fun a few times but the stalling tactics become pretty obvious after that.

Another flaw is just how much random events decide your fate.  The demons choices are far too constrained by the dice and the cards vary wildly in power.  By far the worst offender is the board layout and in fact in most scenarios this usually decides the game for us.  A devastating dead end or a convenient choke point often spells the end for the humans.

Lastly, I can't help but feel that demons are less enjoyable.  You are mostly sending weak troggs that get slaughtered the next round to slowly chip away at health.  There are a few tricks, but the way movement works doesn't give you a whole lot of interesting decisions.  Contrast this with the humans who get special cards, items and different redeemer powers each scenario.  Furthermore there dice rolls aren't as constricting and instead allow them to specialize their characters each round.  Finally movement is a lot more tactical with the bodyguard's abilities or Elusive Blades'.  Needless to say, I find the game a lot more enjoyable as the humans.

So in conclusion, I am not sure this really dethrones Doom as my adversarial dungeon crawl game.  The amount of randomness and the disparity between the two sides leads to an unsatisfying game (for at least one person).

I am very impressed with how many "problems" this game solves. It's strategic and tactical but with an easy rules set. It involves some of the thoughtful choices of Euro games in the context of a fantasy theme. It's a two player competitive dungeon crawl that plays in less than an hour (really). Finally, it is tight and well balanced despite all the choices available to both players. It has beautifully produced components for a reasonable price. There isn't a tremendous amount of variety in the components and substance of the game but this is more than made up for in the simplicity of the ruleset and chits involved. Pound for pound, it's the best dungeon crawl game I've played because its elegance just sets it in another gameplay league than Ravenloft, Descent and company.

RATING: 6
A couple of things on this title.  I want to love it, I really do.  It's great looking, and the components are top notch.  I don't believe that I've seen a set of prepainted minis up to these standards before.  The artwork on the tiles is fantastic!  The art on the cards is ok, the manual is full color and nicely illustrated.  The method of tracking wounds on the humans and this simulating the effects of the wounds is great.

My issues are with the gameplay itself.  The game seems quite random and too light.  We don't feel that we have much control over the humans, while the demon player excersises almost complete control over his forces.  Since everything is totally dice-driven, it's quite difficult to plan ahead with any reasonable amount of certainty, and this adds to the overall feeling of randomness.  While playing this I can't help but feel like I'd much rather be playing Descent for a satisfying dungeon crawling experience, or something else if I did not have that kind of time.

Hmm, early days so I need to play it a bit more to get a final rating. Was expecting to love it, but was a bit disappointed. It's too tactical for me, in that there is little planning you can really do from turn to turn, rather maximise what you can do NOW. It's too random - but also quite fiddly and complicated. Random tiles, random movement (you might be moving 0,1, or 2 depending ...) random combat ... 

Plus side over space hulk and DOOM is the fast setup - but I prefer the scifi theme. The random setup theoretically is more replayable as you can 'solve' the space hulk scenarios with repeat playings.

Overall felt I'd rather play Lost Patrol for a quick random tactical survival game. For a longer game - Space Hulk wins hands down.

*** Update, more plays and I'm liking this more - the pin rule makes the game really, but is rather dependant on the tiles drawn. It fills a niche, I still prefer space hulk, but the random tiles mean you can't 'solve' each scenario.

We used 'dice decks' instead of just rolling die for combat: rolling and 'hits' bug me now as I can't get past a string of bad luck ruining a game.

The one bad note was I think I enjoyed this more than my gaming buddy, so hopefully we still get it to hit the table when it is just a 2-player day.

Played scenario 1. Great game. Simple and a lot of fun without the bloat that seems to vacuously pad out games of this style. This is a game that should give FFG some cause to blush in my view - Asmodee have arrived in a big way - great components matched with simple yet elegent game-play that match nice game time with just the right level of thought for the style of game.  Prodigious support on the game page through a bunch of scenarios is also a huge bonus.

I can only see my rating for this going up.  I may eat my own words as I play more, but this is a game that is very flexible - much can be changed or expanded, players themselves can add and mod easily, all in all a very solid game.  I am impressed.

A 2 player dungeon crawler? Is there any possibility that this works well?

Yes and it is called Claustrophobia.

It has a pretty simple and elegant but still really rich system. One player plays a dungeon crawler the other one plays Kingsburg. Yes, Kingsburg, yes, I'm serious.

While the one is exploring the caverns under New-Jerusalem the other one is collection points to summon the demons trying to devour the poor lunatics that try to clear the caverns.

The components are really good. Thick sturdy cardboard, the player tableaus are well made (Formula D-style), good cardstock and the shiny highlight: prepainted miniatures.
I also have to mention the dice. Normally I don't care about my dice but the ones in this game are, I would say, more rounded than normal ones. They feel pretty nice.

The only negative are the two special monster token. They are to small (compared to the mini) to use them on the board, but still too big to put them on the base under the mini.

For everyone who thinks that the scenarios in the rulebook aren't enough there are some on the Asmodee-Homepage.

Sadly this great game doesn't get reprinted.

Lots of scenarios included with the game, lots more available online to download. And finally, we love the awesome painted minis that come with this game.

Nice! This fills a good niche for when you've only got two players and can't be bothered to setup Descent and devote 2-3 hours to a game.

The dice system both for the humans and demons is pretty nifty and makes the game really feel different for each side. The humans especially have a cool choice point - I love that when you take damage, you have to decide how you want to limit your future stat options.

It might be a weird complaint, but did the tiles have to be SO big? They could easily fit the max number of characters per tile and been a lot smaller... just seems like a lot of wasted space for those of us without huge tables.

It's not the kind of game you can sit down and play several games of in a night, though. I always have fun when I play... it's just... a little bit too shallow for that.

My husband and I really enjoyed this game.  I love the fantasy them and that it is strictly a two player game.  I liked playing the demons and rolling the dice to determine my actions.  I do enjoy a good dungeon crawling game.  The components are really nice for this game too.

RATING: 7.5
As you can probably tell by my ~700 ratings, I’m a hardcore Eurogamer. However, this doesn’t mean that I cannot appreciate and even enjoy other types of games. I generally don’t like many Ameritrash games, but Claustrophobia is actually quite a good game!

First of all, Claustrophobia is an Ameritrash game, yes. You’re trying to kill each other (one player is playing as the heroes and the other players is controlling the evil forces), and it has tons of dice rolling which means that the luck factor is quite big (add to this the random tile and card draws). Still, I find it enjoyable. I think the major reason is that I don’t own any other games like this, and I really like the fact that there are several scenarios to play. The random tile draws ensure that the dungeon is going to be different each time, and sometime you get screwed by bad tiles and other times it’s a little too easy. The listed play time of just 45 minutes is pretty spot on, I think all of my games have lasted between a half and one hour, and when you consider this, Claustrophobia is a great game! It’s so easy and fast to play!

I haven’t tried all of the scenarios, but those I have have been very enjoyable and a little different from another (as they should be). Now, you can play as the good guys or the bad guys, but because I’m winning regularly in most of my games, I almost always play the heroes as they have a harder time winning in Claustrophobia. This has resulted in a lot of defeats and only one win and a couple of ties, but I don’t mind. I would like to play the bad guys a little more, though, because they are by far the most interesting side – the dice mechanism (deciding where to put your dice on your board) is just plain awesome!

Having played Claustrophobia 9 times now, which is a lot for me, I’m not sure if I’m going to keep it. The reason for this is not because it’s a bad game, because it isn’t (just look at my rating, which is very high for a game like this!), but because I seldom play 2 player games, and when I do, I often play TS, 1960, Agricola ACBAS, Summoner Wars, Mage Wars and a bunch of other 2 player games – or even some good multiplayer eurogames which support 2 players well like Caylus, Le Havre etc. But Claustrophobia is certainly a good game which is very easy to learn and play!

This has grown on me after more plays. I'm not too keen on dungeon crawlers but this I like. The game play is quite simple with good decision making. The dice rolling is random and can swing the game but it doesn't bother me in this one, it fits the theme. I really, really like the allocation of dice to trigger character stats. Also, the components look amazing. Looking forward to more plays and scenarios.

RATING: 8
Rated 8 after two back-to-back plays of the first scenario. I'm not normally a dungeon crawler type of player, but I was very excited about this game based on reviews and the promise that it offered a thoughtful but light assymmetrical game.

For the first two plays, this game really delivered. Turns are quick, but there's fun choices to make. Each side feels very different. It's surprisingly thematic, and at least the first scenario creates a good sense of drama and tension. If want to own a dungeon crawl, this is it.

The only possible drawbacks are the fact that it plays only two, and I'm not sure about replayability given the limited scenarios out of the box. There's a lot of love for this game and various scenarios out there. Along with an expansion, and I might play this with some regularity if I can find another opponent.

Time to beg the wife to play it.

Claustrophobia is a dungeon crawl system with simple one-time powers and action cards. The heroes' objective is to use  their actions and special abilities to protect one another.  The game does not have the depth of strategic planning and calculation.  It is a light game that good for causal players.  The replayability stems from scenarios.  The designer supports this game very well.  I can find many scenarios from web.  
It’s easy to learn and can play quickly.  The quality of production is pretty good as well.

As of June 2013, my favorite game.  Scenario-based tactical miniatures game which plays fast, has an amazingly well-integrated theme, and just looks (and feels) great.  Very streamlined game with a modular setup.  Plays quickly, and the pressure on the Human player is just so awesome with Wounds taking up his stat blocks, it really feels like your dudes are limping through Hell and falling by the wayside (if you are the Human player).

After second session it's obvious that this is a "10" for me.  It accomplishes so much with such a tiny ruleset.  Everything makes sense right away, it looks great, and it only takes an hour (90 mins if I'm slow).  Looking forward to trying out the expansion after I play through all six base game scenarios.

Aug 2012 - still solid, but going with an "8".  Pretty light.

September 2015 - Played all base set scenarios at least once. Ready for the first expansion.

Only played 5-6 times, but it's a great 2 player game.  The human side seems a little less fun then the troglodyte / demon side simply because there are less choices to be made.  The condemned human side especially gets fewer and fewer choices as the game goes on and you start taking damage.

Really enjoyed it myself, but my wife couldn't get in to it. Hope to get it again someday. Quite a bit of fun with one person playing as the heroes set out in a dungeon on one of several possible quests. The other player plays as the "DM" if you want to think of him that way... that player unleashes the monsters, traps, minions, etc to do his bidding.

Well, the main reason I bought this was to spuport the idea of pre-painted minis. But in that regard it did not impress. There are two sides, and the monster side only has [b]two[/b] different minis!!! One demon, and nine little troglodytes. Boring! Humans are only slightly better. There's one main guy, two semi main guys that LOOK about exactly the same, but actually have different abilities. And then another pair of guys that are about exactly the same. 

The mini situation would be easily overlookable if there was a solid game there. But I have no right to be surprised that it's not that different from similar games that I haven't liked. There's too much randomness from dice. The (somewhat) randomly expanding dungeon is great in theory for replayability, but random in practice, so you're just running around basically aimlessless. 

The most annoying thing is trying to keep track of what a dude on the board is, what his stats are (that can and do change every turn!!!), what his abilities, objects are, etc.

I regret buying this.

I've played this twice so far, once on each side, and am eager to try it again. The asymmetry is delightful, the mechanics are streamlined but interesting, the game is simple to teach and hard to master. I've seen others complain that the rules are too simplistic, but to increase the realism would significantly impact the play time and complexity of the game, both of which are selling points.

This is a great game, extremely pretty, and it plays quick. The only miniatures game where I've spent more time strategically assigning wounds than I have taking my turn!  The theme is a bit too hellish for my tastes, so I don't spend lots of time thinking about it like I would with other miniatures games (Descent... Twilight Imperium), but the game is fun to play. I have to be careful when I play the demons that I don't overwhelm the human player.  A good friend of mine suggested that I treat it almost as if I'm playing the dungeon master of a roleplaying game... and it works well.

Great two player game. It's usually a challenge for one of the players (the Human player). Fast deployment, easy rules with some glitches, but you can easily work them out.

Fabulous miniatures and lots of dices. Its modular design allow to play many scenerios and develop your own ones. Also, its dice system for both sides push the players to have a good balance between offensive or defensive playgame for each turn.

If your partner loves fantasy games, this is a perfect choice for a medium length and medium complexity game with monsters, blades and demons.

If I only ever play the first scenario in the rulebook from now on to the exclusion of the others, I'd still rate this game very high. I like it best when the scales seem to weigh in your favor after your turn, only to see it all dashed away after your opponent takes their turn...and then find it's back in your favor again when you've finished the next turn. The back and forth is great.

Tremendous asymmetric, cut-throat and asphyxiating game for 2 players where experience generally beats luck (despite many dice rolls). The only drawback (9.5 instead of 10) is that both players must have similar levels. A noob can't barely win.

Mazmorrero ambientat en l'univers de Hell Dorado (Segle XVII en les catacumbes de Nova Jerusalem, França). Un jugador porta els anti-herois Humans, guerrers condemnats que purguen els seus pecats eradicant el Mal, evitant bèsties infernals envaeixin la superfície. El segon jugador controla els Dimonis, els quals hauran de matar els humans que han gosat endinsar-se en els seus territoris.
Un i altre bàndol es controla gestionant daus.
A priori sembla que tingui molt d'atzar (es tiren molts daus i s'aixequen losetes), però realment està molt controlat i l'experiència se sol imposar a l'atzar.

Love this game.  I have to laugh when someone calls this a dice fest and poorly realized then gives Elder Sign an 8, a game that many players and myself had to modify to make it worthwhile.  Only reason this is not a 10 is my fiance doesn't like it.  You can bet I get it on the table with my friends.

Impressive and innovative.  A new take on dungeon crawling.  Comparisons to Space Hulk seem obvious but Claustrophobia is faster, more fluid, and more exciting.  I'm very glad I took a chance on this title.  UPDATE.  Great great game.  Exciting.  1 Hero Win, 1 Draw.  UPDATE.  This dungeon crawl actually works.  Everything I want in the experience with strong decision impact and a short playing time.

RATING: 5
Players represent the demons under New Jerusalem, or the Redeemer forces combating the demons.  Two player battle game where the demons take on the Redeemer player to try and accomplish a scenario's goals.  Simple rules - basically activate, then move and fire, yet full of neat little ideas.  The Redeemer rolls dice and allocates them to their forces, setting their move/combat/defense stats for the turn - it varies.  The demon player rolls three (or four) dice and allocates them to a battle board, which dictates their options for the turn ... recruit, toughen up, tunnel, draw reinforcements or events, etc.  Lovely looking package, huge tiles (almost too big), simple rules, and the game play is fast and a lot of fun.  Both sides play differently, and it does create some nice tactical dilemmas.  Impressive.

This is a very solid, interesting, unique, challenging, and attractive game.

While this has great components, the game itself is a bit shallow. Less tactical than it appears. It's pretty much Space Hulk for those late to the party. It is wonderfully quick to set up and fast to play, so that's a leg up over a lot of similar games.

RATING: 9
Have to give this one a high rating. I was kind of hoping that I wouldn't like it and I could debulk my collection of dungeon crawl games - which always feels baggy comparable to how often they get played - but this is definitely a keeper until I play all the scenarios a few times - which will take ages as there are loads of freely available ones online.

This is an excellent euro-fied dungeon crawl game. With a shortish set up, low rules overhead, quick play time. Generally all good things.

The human player, who I hesitate to call the goodies, use rolled dice to selected rows of abilities, basically combat, defence and movement. Some dice will boast one stat while decreasing another for that turn. As you accumulate wounds you lose the ability to attribute a 3 - say - to a certain character so your options are continually narrowed.

The demon player is playing in a similar way, with an dice allocation board. Some actions you can take need two dice to do, with both even numbers or odd - that sort of thing. This provides quite a few difficult decisions during gameplay and also some really easy ones so turns are quick and the gameplay zips along nicely. If I was introducing the game to someone I would make them the demon player as I think they have the slightly easier roll in terms of rules overhead and additional fiddle. I feel they are also more fun to play as.

There are a few things conspicuously absent from this game that are found in perhaps all the other dungeon crawls that I have played. The most obvious is line of sight rules. In claustrophobia if you on the same tile as an enemy you can attack them. I didn't miss line of sight at all and found it just sped up the game which can only be a good thing.

The game plays only two player and lasts about an hour, maybe slightly more.

I think the tiles though nice are far too large and the tablespace needed for this game ends up being quite large. The models are quite nice - not CMON or GW quality - but come painted which is a nice touch. The price point for this game - when it is freely available - is quite low. The criticism is that for the demon player there is little variation in your units - you have the basic troglodytes and a larger demon whose abilities change depending on scenarios is valid. Though I wasn't fussed by it. This narrowing simplifies the game, but makes all the 'baddies' - with few exceptions - the same. Though, I would love to see this system adapted to another game with a greater variety of models as I think the game system is superb (If you know of one don't hesitate to get in touch!)

I still prefer space hulk to this, but this will get played a lot more while space hulk will gather dust there on the top shelf, bowing the wood under it's colossal bulk.

Addendum: recent replay with SO, this game is ace, it will appeal to euro players, it scratches the dungeon crawl itch, it's not long, it's boss.

Nem baj, ha az ember rendelkezik valamilyen jellegű szerepjátékos múlttal. 1 játék alapján azt kell, hogy mondjam a játék szórakoztató. Habár az első küldetés nekünk egy kicsit elhúzódott, megfontoltuk a lépéseinket, illetve pontosítottunk menet közben egy-két szabályt. A szabályok egyébként nem túl bonyolultak, s a játékmenet is elég egyértelmű. A kockák felhasználási lehetősége az emberek előkészítési fázisában ötletes. Az első küldetés alapján a démon játékos lehetőségei gyengébbnek tűnnek, de az is lehet csak én voltam túl béna :). Az újrajátszhatóságot az előre elkészített szkenáriók biztosítják, s ki tudja még hány 'fan' által készített küldetés létezik. Az angolja annyira nem egyszerű, alapvetően érthető, mégis néha bele-bele pillantgattam a magyar leírásba. A játék összességében egy egymás ellen vívott "dungeon crawler", ahol a démon játékos szerepe nem csak asszisztálásból áll (remélhetőleg :)). (2015.04.05.)

RATING: 9
This has that French style design where it does what it does very well and very fun. There is a lot of theme and flavor to make it very interesting, but also enough decisions and choices to make ti feel meaningful. The problem is those decisions and choices come at the cost of some gamey elements, ones that feel like mechanics added on for decision points and not mechanics that fade to the background and foster a compelling narrative. Great game, won't get rid of but a strong second place to Space Hulk.

RATING: 7
The rating is provisional as we work through the scenarios.

I like this game - the theme, the dice-chucking idiocy of it all, and the ultimate simplicity of the ruleset.  The scenarios can be interesting and it is a great 2p game.

That being said, this will not appeal to puzzlers or eurogamers - this game can't be solved or "mathed".  There is a huge luck factor here and so far it seems that the game is unbalanced in favor of the demon player.  If you have strongly-competitive people playing this, that might be a problem.

On the plus side, the minis are pre-painted!  On the downside, the variety in them is quite small (2 types for the demon player, 3 types for the human player), but that likely accounts for why these can be pre-painted to begin with.  Minor complaint.  It would be nice to have a demon mini for each type of demon (what the demon mini actually is depends on what demon card you have in play for that scenario), but that would drive the price up.

Anyways, one of the things that attracted me to Claustrophobia was that it was 2p, but also that there's a sort of trade-off mechanism that plays - at least on paper - well against itself.  For example, when the humans explore, the demons decide the orientation of the tile.  This is awesome... until you realize that orientation doesn't really factor too much into the game for the most part.  Humans can occupy tiles to prevent demons from spawning.  This is awesome... until you realize the demon player can simply spend dice to break this rule.

Take a step back and the game works.  Its strengths are in the adventure and the embedded story if not its overall design, which isn't to say that it's weak, but more to say that it has its flaws.  The artwork is fantastic, especially the unique tiles (exit, pentacle) and the rulebook is functional - for those of us who are inclined to analyze every rule, however, it is lacking in details and allows for a lot of ambiguity.  Buyer beware.

What I really enjoy about Claustrophobia however is that despite its flaws, it is fun and the two different sides absolutely play differently.  The human player must concentrate on achieving their goals while mitigating risk; exploring can be dangerous and both splitting up and sticking together has its own fair share of danger - it's all a balancing act for the human player (and a lot of luck).  The demon player is just downright a jerk, and needs to be.  Feelings might get hurt here, that's how much of a harassment the demon player must be to succeed.  I like that dynamic.  It is just unfortunate that the game leans towards the jerk instead of the heroes.

Hopefully the expansions, once we get to them, resolve some of the issues, but it's still a fun way to spend a night.

RATING: 5
The components for this game are amazing.  As good or better than FFG quality, if you're looking for comparisons.  This game really puts Dungeon Twister Prison's components to shame.  It bears saying since they are made by the same company, they have similar components and they are similarly priced.  Beyond the components, I hear this has been compared to Space Hulk.  As I've never played Space Hulk I can't really comment on this but if it is a worthwhile comparison, these are my thoughts: I like the theme better in Claustrophobia.  The game is cheaper but still gorgeous.  The mini's are pre-painted and do not require removing from plastic.  As for my overall opinion, it's a decent dungeon-crawling game for two with the 'lovely' randomness of dice.  I like that it has various scenarios and that it plays relatively quickly, but it's not something I feel the need to own.  I could definitely see some people going ga-ga over this game though.

He did manage to get the blunderbuss-wielding Blade within sight of the exit, but the other Blade had every single trog and a demon to run through to get there...

This is a streamlined 2P skirmish game whose greatest selling point IMO is its simplicity. That's either a feature or a flaw depending on what you're looking for. At first it hit the spot, but I must say my tastes gravitate towards heavier fare such as Earth Reborn (one of my all-time faves) and Space Hulk, so I ended up selling the game. Now, learning those games and setting them up is much, much more of an investment than what we have here so I see this as an apple vs orange consideration. 

As far as this game per se, the abstractions make for a simple game as follows. Each tile can hold (in general) up to three figures of each side and each figure can swing at any other figure on that tile. To leave the tile, you must have at least as many figures as the enemy or else your figure is pinned.  Battle is a matter of rolling dice to hit a target on the same tile (there are no "spaces"). 

The de-emphasis on LOS and positioning is made up for -- in theory anyway -- with decisions on how to spend one’s dice and use cards.  The demon player gets to go shopping with the Dice of Destiny each turn for bonuses and has cards to use. The human player has equipment and blessings (bonus powers).  The cards in the game are simple to read and apply. No heavy learning curve here for how to use them or adjudicate which cards take precedence, etc.  

I was initially taken with the game (the pre-painted minis are a nice touch) but quickly grew bored of it. The scenarios felt a bit too samey which I think is not because of how they're written but because of how limited the tactical options for moving and attacking are. Since spacing is not a big consideration, a lot of decisions are just to move guys onto a tile, roll the dice, and hope for the best. I'd rather have specific spaces and have to deal with LOS so as to have a tactical angle in the game. As it is, there aren't a lot of tactical exigencies. 

I think the demon player should be nerfed just a bit by limiting how many cards they can play on one turn, otherwise the strategy is to collect cards until you have some killer combos and then go about wreaking havoc on one monster turn with devastating results. It's a beer and pretzels game with a bit more chrome. Not enough to ultimately hold my attention.

RATING: 6.5
I really like the innovative and unique (at least as far as I know) stat lines for the 'good' guys. Having 6 different stat lines and rolling a die to see what you do that turn is really really interesting and means that you actually have to think when assigning damage to your characters after all if you put the damage in number 3 for example then never again will you get that two movement which might allow you to run away... but if you put it in 6 then your defense is going to be 3-or 4 for the rest of the game thus you will get beaten up more.

Spells and special abilities also have a die number that they trigger on which adds a little to the decision making process.. unless like me you continually roll anything but what triggers your spells :(

Spawning rules for the demon player are very restrictive but the demons can hit quire hard so I suppose this balances out in the end. 

Again I like the die pool for the demon player where you roll 3(plus any bonus dice you my have) and place them either according to the values or whether they are odd or even to trigger certain abilities. 

Really quick for a dungeon crawl game and although the scenarios are heavily in favour of one faction or the other it is quick enough that you can play twice, once as each faction.

The artwork upon the dungeon tiles is superb.

RATING: 10
Impressive how this game can be played INCLUDING SETUP in 30-45 minutes.

In that time I could have set up a Descent quest, chosen characters, equipment, skills, feats, treachery and be completely set for the first turn. But I wouldn't have killed any monsters yet.

Claustrophobia takes the opposite approach and lets players roll dice 3 minutes after the lid comes off the box. And the best thing is, that with games being so short, it doesn't feel as bad when a good/bad luck streak happens.

Update: After several more plays, and even having my GF suggest we play it, I have to raise my rating. This game is the perfect dungeon crawl for me.

Never thought I'd care for a dungeon crawler until I played this.  The good:  plays very fast, few rules to weigh you down, very satisfying and tense gameplay.  The bad:  maybe it's me but I have a hard time telling "blondie" and "brownie" apart.  So, minor complaints.  For $40 at an OLGS it's a great deal.

It's not as tense or as thought provoking as Space Hulk, but it's a great time.  For a dice roller that combines fun factor, approachability, quick play time, and variety all in one package, it doesn't get much better.

One of my personal all-time favorite games. Best 2-Player Dungeon Crawler that plays in 30-90 minutes. Awesome! Light to Medium.

Human players are very limited and every decision counts - but thats exactly how it should be at the mercy of hells demons! But recommend playing both sides for each scenario to decide overall winner of the match.

Descent light két személyre. 
Gyönyörű komponensek, aránylag egyszerű szabályok, és egy teljesen magával ragadó dungeon crawl. A descenttel a fő bajom mindig is a túl hosszúra nyúló játékmenet volt, na ez ezt orvosolja.
Hatalmas ötlet a játékban, hogy ahogy a hősök sebződnek, úgy szűkül a mozgásterük és nő az esély arra, hogy félkábultan kóvályogjanak csak egy-egy körben.
Egy próbajáték után nagyon várom az éles bevetést.

Sajnos talán valamivel nagyobb benne a szerencse szerepe, mint amennyi kicsit is gémer szemmel tolerálható, de ettől függetlenül nagyon jó játék, ha az ember egy kétszemélyes, gyors dungeon crawler-t keres.

I love the asymmetry and the flavour of Claustrophobia, and have always been a fan of scenario-based 2-player games. It can be a little dice-heavy, but it's about what you do with the crappy rolls you get, and you can't win without good strategy and tactics. Between the tense feel of each scenario, the severity of the consequences for bad decisions, and the beautiful components, this has fast become a favorite of mine.

Can't beat this one when you have two people and are itching for a dungeon crawl. You know a game is good when both sides are simultaneously complaining that their opponent is too powerful. This game echoes Space Hulk, but with much better spawn, movement, and combat mechanics.

RATING: 9
A dungeon crawl with only a meager 45 minute time requirement. Gorgeous bits and streamlined rules allow the game to flow at a nice swift pace while easily drawing you into the story. This is a beautifully produced, engaging game that does not require a mountain of knowledge to play. It is the dungeon crawl for the casual gamer and the dungeon crawl for the obsessive gamer that has too many games to be able to get the most out of a more complex dungeon crael (that would be me).

First play and, WOW!  The production is amazing with thick tiles and pre-painted minis.  I wish there were more sculpts for both sides (doubles for the human player seems silly), but I imagine this will be solved by an expansion.  The game plays lean and quick - a definite rarity for this genre.  The amazing part is that is does this without sacrificing any tactical depth.  The dice assignment stat system is really neat and the decisions get tough once the human player starts taking wounds.  I really like this game and I hope it continues to receive support.

This has been my greatest gaming surprise. I usually don't like this 'type' of games, but Claustrophobia does everything well in a very efficient and elegant way. And it is the game I think the most about when I'm not playing games, the demons have hooked me!

I like it so much that I didn't mind going through the internet to spend in alternate demons and humans almost as much as I did in the game. And I immediately bought De Profundis, of course!

The production on this is FANTASTIC.  Awesome bits, thick tiles...prepainted minis...lots of scenarios. 

I really like this game a lot.  If I can play it even more, it's possible there's a "10" in here.

RATING: 7
A good dungeon-crawler romp! Yes, lots of it is controlled by dice but it's done in a cool way and there are enough opportunities to get quite tactical and plan out your turn. With games like this it's all about how well the theme shines through. I can't say the story line really interests me but when you get right down to it: Humans vs. Demons, the artwork, miniatures, and mechanisms all work well together.  Because the luck of the dice play such an integral part it is hard for me to rate this an '8', which I would largely reserve for games like this that have a bit more options in terms of strategy, but otherwise Claustrophobia lives up to its expectation as a fun, tense dungeon crawler for 2!  The mechanics never get in the way of theme: a mark of a good Ameritrash dungeon crawler.

This is the first game I've purchased that has really nice miniatures, and they're even painted. Very good quality parts. The first game I ever played of this was a solo variant created by "Reverendunclebastard" which replaces the second player with some Threat and Demon dice for the AI. When you play Claustrophobia it really feels like a story happening. You can imagine monsters closing in on you and running down the halls of water and tentacles, and you find ways to hold them back. How you play your dice on your player cards is pretty neat, and you'll love the miniatures that come with this game. There are a few different scenarios you can play in this game that makes it great for a lot of gaming sessions.

Although the character tracking mechanism is cool and unique this game suffers from the same weaknesses as most in the genre: the tiles are all similar and boring, the bad guys lack variety and are therefore boring and the dice rolling is too lucky (and therefore, for me, boring).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This distills most of the action I want from Descent into a shorter and more tense experience.

Available actions for players on the human side are bound to hit points. Lose a hit point, cancel an action slot. Rolled a die that would let you use that action slot? That character is exhausted (only able to sit and defend his exhausted self). As can be guessed, very little damage needs to be dealt in the game before the tension ramps up and choices start to get difficult. Since the opponent (demon) can never be substantially crippled beyond the span of one turn, time is definitely on the demon player's side.  The only action boundary for the demons is the luck of the dice and how many threat points they've stockpiled during their mini game of demonic Kingsburg.

The combination of these two dynamics makes the game play very quickly and viciously. The decisions, while tense, are often very clear, so down time is minimal unless the demon player starts to get some AP over dice allocation (this goes away with more practice).

A negative: after playing several scenarios repeatedly, I'm starting to see just how much luck is involved in their unfolding. Each team has some ways of mitigating luck, but even some of those methods are themselves greatly affected by the item/action cards that are received at random before the game begins (another layer of luck). It comes down to making the best with what you have, but I can't help but think that some scenarios are sometimes just screwed from the start for one of the players.

I've downgraded my rating to a 9, which is still great on my scale but doesn't meet the "always want to play and this will never change" criterion. It may very well change if someone designs something along these lines with just a little less randomness.

This game is so awesome. It looks great, is easy to play/teach, plays quick for a dungeon romp and both sides are not only fun, but pretty closely balanced, though I'd lean towards the evil side of having a little better of a chance in most scenarios, that I've played so far. No worries though. Just play a game and then switch sides and play again.

I really had no interest in this game till recently, I bid on a sealed copy, at my FLGS auction and won. I had no idea what I was missing out on all this time and am so happy that I won that copy. I love it.

I'd probably give the game a 10 if it didn't have so many duplicate minis, but then the price would've been a hell of a lot higher, so I really can't complain to much and it's not that probematic anyhow.

If you like dungeon type games. This is the one to get. Especially for two players.

Man, this game is great. Each time I play it makes me want to play again more.
The 2 roles play quite differently. My fiancee prefers the demons, and I prefer the humans, so it all works out.
I can't tell if the scenarios we've played are a little unbalanced against the humans. And I don't care much. The whole experience is too much fun, and every game comes down to the wire.

The kind of Dungeon crawler that is just ENJOYABLE to play! It's fast (You can play 4 games in an hour!). A surprising amount of depth to this, there are some clever tactics like bottle-necking your opponents with blocking rules and special abilities and as the humans take more and more damage, choosing lines of ability to negate becomes tense. The components are gorgeous. There are additional scenarios online and I can't wait for some expansions.

There just isn't enough variety in this game as compared with like games (Space Hulk immediately comes to mind). My rating could climb with expansions that add variety to the rooms, antagonists, and protagonists, but until then I'll play other, better games that I own.

Also, the 'gamey' dice selection for the hero side and the 'gamey' craps table for the demon side just rub me the wrong way. It takes too long for that dice placement crap to play out for a game like this.

RATING: 10
Claustrophobia is my highest-rated game:
- The innovative use of dice gives players an acceptable level of control over their own destinies while evening the odds of success between players who have different levels of skill.
- The components are perfect. I love the pre-painted minis because I don't get that nagging feeling that I should be painting instead of playing. It was easy to get my husband interested in playing just by showing him the awesome stuff in the box.
- We can set it up, play it, and put it away in 45 minutes. That's short enough to play during a lunch break or in the evening after work. As a person who owns several epic games and never has time to play them, I love how easy it is to work this one into my day.
- It is designed as a gaming system, with potential over time to have scores of pre-developed scenarios to play and the possibility of developing my own scenarios. I am drooling over the idea of expansions, but the base game contains enough variety to hold my interest for a long time. 
- The designer (CROC) and several experienced players are active on BGG and respond readily to questions. It's incredibly cool to talk to the guy who thought up such an amazing game. 
- It has outstanding tension, excitement, engagement, and immersion. It is fun, Fun, FUN!

Very well (and balanced while asymmetric) designed dungeon crawler. As the human player has a lot more to think about, the demon player has some downtime. Sometimes the dice screw you but sometimes it's a blast. All in all great tension. I only fear that there is not enough variety, as there aro only two types of demons (granted there are different stats). Even the expansion adds only one type of demon minis but seems a must buy. Great production with love for details. Innovative action selection and wound management (human player).

Love the game.
Topic is nice. Mechanics are very interesting and simple enough. There are plenty different scenarios and many different types of tiles.
Unfortunately it's this kind of game where rules can be tricky and often not so obvious. Searching through BGG forum helps a lot.
Playing Demon player is much easier than Human. Human player should have much better understanding of tactics, options and general situation. It's easy to get it wrong.
However, quality of pieces could be slightly better. Most of tiles and tokens are from cardboard which I expect to wear down. Some miniatures are difficult to distinguish, so I put letters on them.

We never took to this game. Some games, in an admirable attempt to reduce rules overhead, miss the forest for the trees. In short, I find the "dice management" aspect of this game combines the worst aspects of reducing choices with the worst aspect of still having to puzzle through those choices carefully. 

I really like how exploration works, though. and movement and line of sight issues are sensible and invisible.

Definitely a fun game and the theme/feeling works very well for me as an old Aliens fan. I haven't played Space Hulk, so I can't make the obvious comparison between these two contenders.

This is an excellent choice if you love fast-playing 2-player tactical minis games. Now that's a crowded field to be sure. But there are some unique aspects that make Claustrophobia well worth looking into. 

First of all, the prepainted minis are an excellent touch and this combined with the quality of the other components really make this a beautiful experience right out of the box. 

Secondly, the dice system is fantastic fun. It provides just enough randomness that you can't get locked into an "I always do this" strategy, but yet provides you with myriad tactical options once the dice are rolled. 

Thirdly, the asymmetric sides feel wonderfully different to play. In many ways, this game is like streamlined Space Hulk. 

I'd give this a very strong recommendation if any of the above is appealing to you. There is very little here not to like.

Plenty going on in this game, but not as difficult as it looks. The two sides, demon and human, are played very differently, which is always an interesting challenge for gamer and designer both. Some very elegant mechanics, like the way human units take damage. My only complaint is that this game didn't really need to be so big and expensive. It's gorgeous, but unconstrained size and bit growth is making it harder and harder to buy and store games: especially hard to justify in a two-player game.

RATING: 8
A shorter game that manages to capture all the things that make dungeon crawlers awesome in a neat, portable, handy package. It doesn't have character progress within the scenario, but that's made up for with unique mechanics and a very thematic feel.

What I really like is the fast-paced combat system, and generally how quickly a round plays. Over-analyzation is barely possible, but the game presents you with tons of short-term tactical choices nevertheless.

Also a very neat feature is the way the stats are distributed after a dice roll for the human player. This makes play both a bit unpredictable for both players, and deciding which character has which stats for the round a bit of an RPG thing to do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The luck of the tiles draw can lead to dead end games, when one player is completely hoosed but even when that does not happen, Claustrophobia is Spacehulk for dummies...  even though Spacehulk was already a straightforward game.
The redeeming feature is that the figures come prepainted; the bulk painting has been done, and if you give these figs a wash and a 5 minutes detail job you've got a very nice game to look at for a reasonnable price.

edit: I am improving my rating of this game because what happens outside the dungeon with the dice is fun.  STill, from a pure tactical perspective, I'd rather play SH.

RATING: 8
Two player game where one player is the "heroes" and the other is the "demons".  Scenarios are defined in the back of the rule book.  Beware!  This game is not balanced and it is not supposed to be.  The humans are traipsing around near the gates of Hell, so the demons have home field advantage.  Know that it is hard to win as humans and the game will make more sense.  Great production values and overall a good game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In short, Claustrophobia is a dungeon crawler game with high production values and a high depth-to-rule ratio. Where many dungeon crawler games have beautiful minis, boards, cards, etc., Claustro (for short) meets the standard and perhaps brings another level by providing pre-painted minis. However, what Claustro does incredibly well is that it strips away many layers of unnecessary mechanical complexity to get right down to the nitty-gritty while still having an incredibly rich game. Playing within this bare-bones space, Croc (the designer) also creates a rich play space for the demon player. Wherein many 'crawlers the dungeon lord is a malevolent presence (played by the 'good friend' who wants to provide a fun romp for the dungeon-faring folk at their own expense), here, it is both devilish AND fun (e.g., the humans get to pick what corridors they choose to explore [i.e., new tile] but the demon player gets to choose how it is placed, leading to dead ends and closed loops!). By this, I mean that the demon player has rich decisions to make in terms of how it goes about making life difficult for the human player. The asymmetry is also delicious -- while the human player starts off respectively stronger than the demon player, the demon player has the advantage of endurance and tenacity. The little cuts accrew and suddenly the demon player has the upper hand; but it might not be enough to prevent the human player from achieving their goal (to which they should be pretty close to at that point in time!).

Narratively, this asymmetry all comes together in the world of Hell Dorado -- the humans are not the "good guys" but rather complex and flawed creatures who happen to be colonizing hell (to the demons' protest!). Not that the demons are the "good guys" either!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A terrific game.  The production value is great.  I like the fact that the human side has it rough and feels like the underdog.  While it doesn't have the constant tension of Space Hulk it certainly is a good game that has a quicker play time, very nice pieces and interesting mechanics (human warriors boards to determine stats and how damage is handled and the demon players board that grants special powers based on dice allocation).

Oh, this game. It has skyrocketed to competing for my favourite game. I played it once a few years ago at a board game café, and it fell flat. I thought it was too shallow, too random, and didn't have very interesting decisions. However, I had a hard time getting it out of my head, and knew I needed to try it again. So, just this year, I bought it, played with my husband, and fell in love. The game isn't shallow...it has a very simple rule set, and it's certainly not incredibly deep, but the choices in the game are really interesting and the gameplay can be quite tense and exciting. My first game against my husband, I had a grin on my face the whole time. The theme and the components are amazing. Fantastic game.

RATING: 8.75
An amazing asymmetric two player, dungeon crawl. Quite probably one of the most unique games of its kind. Not only is it a dungeon crawl for two, it plays in 45-60 minutes.

The game has a really cool dice allocation system, where the human player's character's stats can change turn by turn. However as they take damage, different lines are canceled out meaning the humans have to be careful which die they give to each of their heroes. This game is definitely more strategy over "gung-ho-kill-everything-in-sight" and blends great Euro-puzzlyness and Ameritrash mechanics into a nice package.

One side controls the condemned survivors and the other the demon hordes. The base game gives a nice chunk of content and variable scenarios which challenge both sides greatly. However, the expansion, De Profundis, really opens up this game with all the extra content, new characters and scenarios that I highly recommend purchasing with the base game sight unseen. 

However there are a few things that hold this game back from being truly great, one of which is that this game is BIG. The box is an awkwardly long and skinny box, and It will take quite a bit of real estate on a table. I wish the exploration tiles were a tad smaller. Also wish there were more enemy types than what is available currently. It isn't game-breaking at all but it would be welcomed for sure. But the my main beef is that some scenarios aren't fully asymmetric and feel they favor one side over the other. Not a 100% feeling, and one which can be easily mitigated by given the more experienced player the side with the disadvantage. It's something that has been mentioned for a few of the base game's scenarios on BGG which I think were mostly remedied with the expansion, De Profundis. Speaking of which, De Profundis is a must-have expansion to Claustrophobia and I would highly recommend.

Wow!  It's like Space Hulk but simpler (e.g. abstracted movement and line-of-sight), a dungeon crawler but faster, and is definitely more tactical (and strategic) than a simple luck-based dice-fest.  Can't wait to play more scenarios.  This one has the potential to be our go-to weeknight game.  So glad I picked this one up!

Was a change for us. Enjoyed our first game despite suffering from "rules exhaustion". Looking forward to our next go.

Update: Next go turned out to be 10 months later. Played twice in one evening. Lot of searching for rules again. Second round was easier. We're both hoping to get it back on the table much sooner next time. There's a great game in here, but we're not playing it optimally enough to enjoy it much yet. Need more practice.

After a few more plays we're getting the hang of it. Wife only wants to play the demon and slaughter me as the humans... :devil:

[b]2 Player Review:[/b] 

The theme of demons vs the condemned is very strong as you roll your way through the depths of Hell. However, unlike most dice games that have me cursing my luck every time I roll a one, even the ones are of use here. As you assign the dice to either the demons or condemned boards, the strategy is already more prevalent than most combat-heavy games. Of course it does ultimately come down to a dice roll as to whether a hit connects of not, but there are so many ways to increase your chances and position yourself for victory that it makes [i]Claustrophobia[/i] feel more like a puzzle game than anything else. And that`s why I absolutely love it more and more the more I play.

The tile draws can be quite brutal to the condemned as they are often forced back into the pursuing hordes. But it is still a very run dungeon-crawling romp that is over in under an hour. So even if your luck is horrible, the whole adventure is over quickly and you'll only be left with a great story to tell. 

[b]Expansion Review:[/b] 

It's a very welcome addition to the base game. The new tiles, heroes and dogs add a lot more replay value to every scenario. We never play the base game without them. It adds a lot of depth without adds ton of new rules to learn. Two thumbs up!!

[b]Pros:[/b]

- A fast and furious dungeon-crawler that doesn`t outstay it`s welcome after a few bad die rolls.
- The theme is immaculate.
- The game almost feels more like a puzzle with many ways of weighing die rolls in your favor as opposed to more traditional dungeon-crawlers.
- Massive amounts of replay because of the huge number of scenarios and the randomness of the each dungeon layout. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Tile draws often hurt the condemned far more than the demons.
- Requires a huge amount of table space.
- Limited demon variety in any one scenario.
- The dogs from the expansion seem a little over-powered after several plays.

Initial rating one full play 

Judging from some of the comments I think I [i]might[/i] be missing something and that is kind of how I felt through my whole first game, though the point of the game is to just be a simple fast dungeon crawl which it very much succeeds at.  A shame most of the monster figures are all the same.  I really like how the monsters have an order board and even with rolling they have options (maybe more than the good guys, which I played), but overall I just found the game lacked decisions like so many of these types of games do.  

For the good guys it was where to allocate the dice and where to move.  Now we did play the very first scenario, so I am hoping it is really simplified and that some later ones add more the game somehow but lately it seems designers are listening to the many complaints about games being too bloating and going to the other extreme.   Note that games are meant to be played in an hour so only so much can fit in that timeframe much like CR.  Definitely mostly tactical and mostly non-strategic which isn't surprising, luck did not bother me as much as I initially thought it would, its fairly high but it’s a light fast game so not out of place really and it was the lack of decisions that bothered me more. Would like to play a different scenario next time to re-evaluate but overall I think games like Prophecy, Runebound, Castle Ravenloft, Spacehulk etc just aren't really my thing, they leave me wanting more. If you want a good short rules light adventure type game, you can hardly do better than this one.

My first thought when I opened the box was, "Is this it?" I saw the limited variety of demon and trog pieces and thought I may have been ripped off. But now that I've played it almost a dozen times I realize that it doesn't matter. The game is tough and it doesn't need anything more that what it came with!  Though I'd love to see individual figures for the demons at some point. 

It took 4 tries to beats Scenario 1 and two tries to beat scenario 2, one try for scenario 3, two tries for scenario 4 and I completely screwed up my attempt at scenario 5 since it didn't mention in the scenario to use the demon cards for the possessed ones.  I just assumed they were immobile and had a defense of 3 since it wasn't mentioned in the scenario what to do or that the demon player controlled them!

Fun, but I'm not finding myself drawn to it.  This game should have been a gimme for me, but I don't feel that it's as fun as other dungeon crawlers like Descent.

Add to all that the BIG mistakes in the rulebook, and I'm just not sold on this one.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (January 2011)

I think Claustrophobia is a good game. LOVE THE THEME. It has a resemblance to Okko (in the dice mechanic), but Claustrophobia is the superior game. I would play it again but if we are playing 2 player games with great theme, Dungeon Twister and its kin are the masters IMO :D, so I don’t think I will be playing this very much in the coming days. The only exception would be if the heaviness of the game is a consideration as this game is much lighter than Dungeon Twister and therefore much less prone to analysis paralysis.

This game has a fair amount of luck.

I still haven’t been able to play Claustrophobia again. Love the name of the game and also love that it comes with painted miniatures. I wish more games did this as I won’t ever paint a single miniature in my life. Still I’m downgrading its rating to one that currently matches my feelings for the game with the BGG recommendation system. 

I want to play again to properly gauge the game as it has been years since I last played it.

I finally played Claustrophobia again :D, it took me awhile but I did it and I enjoyed it a lot. 

I’m unfamiliar with the source material, but I really like its theme. The art is amazing!

I also like that each player plays a very different game, I think I prefer to play as the demon player, but I would play as the condemned as well.

I recently read the rulebook and it has some mistakes, the most important being that the demon player can play the red actions ONCE PER TURN, not per game. Make sure you read the FAQ before you play the game.

Before this last play, I thought I was going to sell the game, but my desire to play the game again is high. I want to explore all the scenarios and I also bought all its expansions. It isn’t the best two player game I have, but, for now, it has a permanent place in my game collection. It plays relatively fast, and you have fun when you play it.  With more plays, the rating could increase or decrease, time will tell, but as it stands, Claustrophobia is very near to become a good game for me.

Played it at ORIGINS 2010. Dungeon crawl game with great parts and painted minis (you can add your D&D minis to add a variety to the mix as 1 monster mini represents quite a few different others used in different scenarios). It just wasn't as exciting as I wish it could be as the humans easily won.
UPDATE: The Game Guide running this at ORIGINS got several rules screwed up (some were Errata included in the box) that ruined our game. Chris gave me money to buy this game for him because he couldn't make the Con and I wasn't impressed by his purchase but wanted to play his new game with him. This time I was the Humans and he was the dungeon master. Differences: He had THREE dice to roll every turn, not 2. You can bring monsters in right next to humans, not 2 spaces away. The RED abilities can be used once a ROUND, not once an ENTIRE GAME!!! With all these differences it made the same boring scenario one that was VERY exciting to the last minute where I needed a 4-6 to escape with my 2nd (and only one left alive) human and got it. Had I failed the monsters would have devoured me on their next turn. I upped my rating from a 5 to a 7.

A light dungeon crawler featuring scenario based play. Although some of the game's mechanics feel reminiscent of Hybrid and Space Hulk; the methods which the human player activates his units is quite unique. Overall, Claustrophobia is a very soild game.

RATING: 7
I'm not a huge fan of the dice game, but this one is short enough and enjoyable enough that the dice don't bother me.  Good dungeon crawl pitting player against player instead of players against a DM.  Reminds me ever so slightly of Space Hulk.

I love the underlying gameplay in this as well as how the heroes take damage.  However, for a dungeon-crawl style game it does feel seriously lacking in variety.

RATING: 7
I've wanted to play this game for a long time, and finally got to give it a try recently. I only played one time, so this is a very early impression. I really like this game. It is a good 2 player dungeon crawl that plays quickly and has some really tough decisions. The dice placement is always interesting, on either side of the board. Because the tiles don't have discrete areas, it loses some of the tactical element of many minis games. A little more variety on the demon player might be nice, too.

Simple, Space Hulk-style dungeon crawler. Very straight-forward but effective. Reducing the character options when they get injured works very well. My main gripe would be the lack of variety out the (gargantuan) box. Expansions will make this exceptional, I'm sure.

When this game first came out my impression was that it wasn't my kind of game.  This game uses dice in interesting ways - kind of seems something like Stefan Feld might design if he was designing a dungeon crawler and it kind of reminded me a little of Feld's Roma.  I like how the two factions use and manage dice in very different ways.  The components are top notch.  Very solid game with a streamlined rules set that can be taught quickly.

Claustrophobia upstages the entire FFG catalog, and it's about time.

The premise here is dark: a warrior-priest leads some condemned men on a demon-hunting expedition deep underground. These are desperate, brutal men pitted against hordes of troglodytes. In some scenarios they are trying to escape; in others they have specific objectives, like closing off a portal to hell.

For the humans, the game is always a race against time. They need to explore the surrounding tunnels quickly to find their objective, but if they spread out quickly to cover a lot of ground, they become more vulnerable to attack. At the start of the turn, the human player rolls four dice (one for each character) and allocates them. Each character has six combinations of attack/defense/movement, each pegged to a die-face. This gives the human player some great decisions about battle-formation: who's hunkering down, who's running point, etc. The troglodyte player rolls three dice at the start of the round, and these can be used to obtain "threat points" (used to summon more demons), draw cards, or trigger one-time abilities (making demons faster, stronger, more mobile, etc). The dice-allocation is set up so that the easy baseline is 4 threat points and one card, which is enough to apply continuous pressure. The longer the humans dither, the more troglodytes gather to swarm them, and the more cards can be played to force panics, trigger crazy suicide attacks, etc.

My favorite part of Claustrophobia is the way wounds work for the humans. When a human takes a hit in battle, they must block off one of their die-faces. One or two wounds begin to severely limit their flexibility in battle. It's the best new mechanic I've seen in a fantasy game in years - in a way it reminds me of Magic Realm, which usually puts contemporary fantasy junk to shame.

A breath-takingly produced, fast-paced, tightly constructed game. Highly recommended.

This is one of the best 2-player dungeon games I've ever played. It has many Euro mechanics that work extremely well and the asymmetric play gives each side a very distinct feel. Not all the scenarios, especially in the base game, are perfectly balanced but playing twice while switching sides is a good way to overcome this.

Interesting, if somewhat baroque, game of exploration and monsters.  A lot of interesting tools in this package for design - swappable demons, the different human items/equipment, etc. - and it's nice to see the range of possibilities in the scenarios published to date.  Extra credit for delivering on the promised web support - many companies say they'll put a lot of scenarios on the web, but few actually come through.  

I think it's more forgiving than Space Hulk, with the typical emphasis of the genre on positioning diverted here to managing the action dice and assorted other limited resources.  Movement and combat are fairly abstract since they are done on a tile basis and are not where the interesting decisions tend to be made.  Because of this, it's easier to play Claustrophobia casually, which will probably help keep it coming back to the table in the future.

Some important errata is out there for this title (changing the invocation of certain demon abilities from 1/game to 1/turn has an enormous impact on play) and you absolutely cannot & do not want to overlook it before playing.  Missing the errata will almost wreck the game for the demon player.

I really know nothing about these types of games, but Claustrophobia attracted my interest due to its low complexity and quick play time.  I don't think I'd be interested in anything that more complex, at least not for 2 players.  I like the system and would like to play it some more.  My main problem is lack of a person with whom to play this.

The gameplay is great, the production value (art on tiles, quality of tiles, and what you get for your $$) is outstanding.  The rule book is in error in a number of places, and as a result an errata sheet will have to be consulted in the files here on bgg.  It's disappointing many of these mistakes were not found by a proofreader before hand.  Otherwise, great game.

Mechanically, this is a strange beast indeed, compared to most other games I´ve played in the same genre. While many a dungeon crawl or their sci-fi equivalents strive for simulation-like game mechanics on a micro-management scale, Claustrophobia is more of an abstract, painting it´s vivid strokes with a broader brush... But it makes it work absolutely fantastic without the colorfull theme feeling tagged on, and the game is full of hard choices, exciting action, and nerve wracking moments of tension!

I am floored by the presentation...just *awesome*.

The quality of the materials, the use of the "Formula D" boxes to organize, the colors used, the minis, the artwork overall...

All quality.

The game play itself, is also quite good.  It seems to offer a lot of replayaibility.  And although I have only a couple of games under my belt, I can foresee this one lasting quite a bit of time.

It won't or can't, rather, "fire" Descent, but it's a good, fast alternative and I am quite happy to own both.

Rating will be updated as more scenarios get played and my overall impression of the game changes...

I've only played one or two other dungeoncrawl-type games, and this one's blown them out of the water. The rules are simple and well-executed; while it's tough on the humans, every scenario seems winnable, and the margins are always tight. 

The real star here is the production values. It's an utterly gorgeous game, it's not horrifically overpriced, it comes with pieces that manage to outshine the ones that come with the deluxe War of the Rings, and not only that, but they have character! The tiles are pretty, the cards are nice...

My only complaint here is that not enough people are buying it to make it a lock for expansions. Seriously, please buy this game. It's money well spent.

[Edit 4/15: Don't enjoy this much anymore - I've played all the scenarios half a dozen times, and for some reason, the thrill is just gone. SAD FACE.]

2016-12-17 - 5 - I played the good guys and I can see that the other side might be slightly interesting. The game is rather slow, repetitive and lacks excitement of exploring a mysterious dungeon. As I got more wounds the game became more difficult, but at the same time my choices were limited more and more every time I got another hit, which led to no choices at all as I had to assign my dice the only way it was possible. Good it wasn't too long.

* Rules:
- The rules are quite simple, which makes the game easier to put on the table after a few months without playing it, which is a big plus.

* Components:
- The rulebook is very clear.
- The art (box, rulebook, material) is very good.
- The miniatures are not as well painted as those of Lord of the Rings: Combat Hex, or not as precisely sculpted as those of Space Hulk 3rd ed., but they are of good quality.
- The tiles are really thick.
- The cards are a little bit prone to damage.  They don't feel too bad, though.
- Idea: I wish that the numerical characteristics had some color code scheme (a shade of red, green, blue, for instance).  This would make them more obvious at a glance.  One probably gets used to the lists, though, but I did not fully succeed after 3 games.

* Game feel:

- The rules are simple and streamlined, which makes getting into the game a real pleasure, as it can be picked and played any time.
- The titles given to the various rule and scenario points really give flavor to the game, and help remember the contents of each point.
- The minis give a really useful and nice visual depiction of the game situation.
- I find myself thinking more about strategy, after a game, than with Space Hulk.  In fact, in Space Hulk, the lessons I get from a defeat are more strategical, and quite simple (like "I should have sent more Genestealers down that hallway").  In Claustrophobia, the lessons are more subtle: "In order to handle the Spadassins, I should have get prepared for the Troglodyte lair tiles, etc.  As for the brute, I should haveâ€¦ etc.".
- The names given to the Demon options and to the cards really give some nice flavor to the game.  They help picture what is going on.
- After ten games, half of them with the demon, its options are quite clear.

** Comparison to Space Hulk
*** Better than Space Hulk
- Painted mini.  They do add a pleasant touch.  They also make the game more attractive to players whom I may want to introduce the game to.  Furthermore, they really draw me more to the game than SH's unpainted pure-red marines.
- Almost no setup time.  SH sees the table less often, because of its longer setup time.
- The scenarios feel more varied, and richer in theme.
- The Demon is more interesting than the Genestealers.
*** Not as good as Space Hulk
- You might sometimes want to put a tile outside of the table space, for strategic reasons (like allowing a character left behind to find a shortcut).
- Figures in Space Hulk die upon a single successful hit: this makes for some great "hurrah" (sp?) moments.  In Claustrophobia, successfully hitting a creature is not as rewarding, as the Humans and Demons take many hits before being killed.  However, this is partially offset by the fact that placing the wound markers requires some interesting choices to be made.
- While the Genestealers plays, the overwatch lets the Marines player roll dice, or take extra actions, if he witnesses a Genestealer movement.  This helps limit the downtime.  The Genestealer player can somewhat study the movements of the Marines while they move: finding the weaknesses in the Marines is important (that's a weaker point).  In any case, there is action, while the Genestealer is waiting, with all the Marines moving.  There is thus less downtime in Space Hulk, for me.  However, maybe this will change: (1) As long as I don't picture all the options of the Demon/Human more clearly, I can spend time thinking about them; (2) When I have a better command of these things, I may use them in order to build strategies (like getting ready in case I get unlucky, etc.).
$ However, after about 4 games, we had learn the options of the Demon and the various cards better, to a point where the game flows clearly better.  As a consequence, I do not get bored anymore, as the Humans.  Plus, I still find it nice to think about whether the Demon player could have chosen better moves.
- Space Hulk feels more "cinematic" and tense to me: SH's narrow passages really make for many griping moments; one has to carefully think about which corridor each Marine should go through, because the guy in first line takes a higher risk, etc.  I guess that the sense of frontal confrontation that you get from SH (with the GS and the Marines basically clashing after a long run in a corridor) is emotionally more gripping than the "pile on them" feeling of Claustrophobia; in SH, it's break or win (?), which is more emotional than Claustrophobia's "let's weaken them a little bit more".
*** Neutral
- The positions of the figures on the board evolve in a more complex way that in Space Hulk, where the squad members tend to remained grouped together, and where strings of Genestealers are likely to form along the narrow passages.  The result is that the "story" told by Claustrophobia is not as clear and powerful as the story in Space Hulk, which is more like a movie in slow motion, where all figures seem to spend the game moving towards simple goals.  However, Claustrophobia's story can thus be more complex and varied.
**  # End of Comparison to Space Hulk

* Miscellaneous:
- Having almost 20 scenarios feels good.  I like having scenarios: they can give a different feel to each session.  The official bidding mechanism is a great addition, for more seasoned players; I love having play-tested rules to guide me, instead of having to devise house rules that may be flawed.
- Having only 3 different human characters, and 2 demon characters is really not an issue for me: Space Hulk works well with even fewer different types!

A moody, satisfying, and fairly quick dungeon crawl game for two players. My only complaints are the lack of visual variety with the same monsters and characters coming out game after game, and the lack of being able to include more players. But both sides are fun to play, so no one wants to always play one side or the other. A very different take on the dungeon crawl genre.

This is the title that made me decide I don't much care for dungeon crawl games that pit one player against other players. I was unsure exactly what its older cousin Descent made me uneasy but now I see. The components in this game are beautiful if not in much variety.

This game seems to be trying to offer a lighter Descent style experience which is fine but if I'm going to slog through Descent I'll just do it the right way.

it delivers what it's supposed to, a simple, accessible and fast dungeon crawler

Gameplay:
+ simple, but very solid, clever and even unique mechanics
+ even though dice decide what options you have each turn, you do have options and those options require a decent amount of tactical thinking and planing ahead
+ fast-paced game with almost no down-time
+ very well balanced
+ very thematic

Components:
+ very high quality components
+ nicely sculpted and well pre-painted! miniatures 
+ very nice artwork on cards and floor tiles
+ a nice and useful box insert

- the box insert does not account for the expansions

When I opened the box for the first time, I was very impressed with the quality of (most) of the game.  The cards are very smooth feeling and easy to shuffle and grab. The dice are a nice mat finish makes then easy to grab out of the Human's Stat "Caddy". 

Only really 2 complaints on the quality of components of the game. I expected the "caddies" to be a little sturdier, but I guess it makes sense since you need to remove the stat cards for easier storage. And the painting on the figures could be a little more distinct (as I've seen several people say here) One of the condemned blades has a black sash in the picture on the card, but both have red on their figures.  The only difference is their hair color. Just something more distinctive would make easier to glance at and know which is which.  

After 1 play, I think this game is very easy to learn.  Reading thru the book, some elements are confusing, but once you are in a game, it all becomes clear. 

Had a blast playing this, and can't wait to go the first scenario a few more times then going on to a new adventure.

RATING: 3.2
Not remotely impressed with this game, despite being a big fan of Helldorado. Pretty simple, straightforward and not a whole lot of meat to the game. Wound application is kind of neat, but feels a little disjointed from the game.
I mean, the game is hardly a dungeon crawler as you just don't feel like  you're in a confined threatening place, nor is there any real tension of exploration. It's just linear. I would rank it as a B&P level game, but not really worth the space and cost. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Gloriously technocoloured dungeon tiles, cuddly little demons and musclebound hulks wielding giant waffle irons (or hammers, perhaps) ... Claustrophobia certainly hits all the right spots in appealing to my inner ten-year-old. In a pleasant and unexpected turnaround, the game is fresh and clever enough to entice my outer adult, too. Apart from the totally brilliant action/wound system for the human side - one of those ingenious ideas that seems obvious and simple, but only in retrospect - the resource allocation for the depth-dwelling demons is also well done and not just a rehash of what has gone before.

The only criticism I could think of is that the inclusion of the apparently inevitable action/event cards detracts a bit from the outstandingly good core engine of the game. It probably helps regarding variety, however, and since I will play this one more often and possibly even buy it, I might change my mind on this small nitpick, too.

This is a fantastic 2 player dungeon crawler. While it is a simplistic game (in terms of rules), the decisions on both sides are weighty.

Claustrophobia is a really fun PVP game.  It can be one sided in my experience, towards the "evil" side.  However, with more experienced players I can see the "light" side being just as competetive.  I'd suggest playing with people who are not easily angered by competetive play.  You will actively be "fighting" your opponent.

This is a gorgeous box of awesome wrapped around a simple, engaging, enjoyable game. I have no idea how they can sell this for the price point it's at -- I paid something like $50 for it on Amazon, and the components are top-notch and then some.

Reading the rules, I found myself nodding; things worked the way they seemed like they should work. There aren't a lot of rules, and all of the exceptions are pretty much contained to cards and tiles and may or may not arise. Great presentation.

The game itself is a blast. It perfectly models the tension each side is supposed to feel: The humans weaken over time, can't spread out or clump up too much, and need to squeeze out every advantage they can; the demons have endless numbers, but fewer choices on most turns, and the humans can be tricksy.

Based on two games -- same scenario from both sides -- it's both easier and more enjoyable to play the demon. The demon's cards are excellent, and the Destiny board is a great mechanic. The humans have both more and fewer options, and their choices seem to drive the pace of the game. With handicap variants provided, even if the demon=easier problem persists over the course of a few more games, it looks eminently fixable.

One minor niggle with the otherwise stellar components is that the tiles tend to curl a bit, becoming slightly convex. They don't seem too hard to press back flat, though, and it doesn't really impact the game.

This is one hell of a lot of enjoyment for the price, accessible, easy to teach, and tons of fun.

My first foray into a true dungeon crawl world. I love the asymmetry between the players, and the feeling of exploring it tile by tile, developing the dungeon as we go. I found this game to be Highly thematic, perhaps my favorite thematic game, as it is so unique and different from anything else i've played. I particularly love the dice in this one and how each character's stat sheet is based on the number on the dice assigned to him that round. Claustrophobia is large and in charge!

First impressions are that this is walks a very impressive line between gibbering chaos and strategic choice, although for new players there's a bit too much information to easily digest at a glance.

Space Hulk gets medieval! Simple, smart rules and a clever use of dice to manage stats make this a very Euro feeling 'corridor creeper'.

RATING: 8.5
Claustrophobia, to my surprise at least, is a very good game, and quite rich in theme.  As I have stated in my other reviews, theme is very important to me.  From what I initially read about the game I was worried the mechanics were a bit too abstract \ random to capture the theme.

Depending on the dice a player rolled, the player had different abilities and stats to use for that turn.  I found it odd when compared to other skirmish games and tabletop war games.  However, I am happy to say it works.  Dark magic can be fickle, and warriors respond differently to stress \ fear and become less predictable.

The game is easy to learn and play, and doesn't take too long to play.  The missions are varied and fun.  Another feature I enjoy is asymmetrical sides which makes the game more interesting for both players.  Not to mention the components are fantastic, and the miniatures are all pre-painted (not many games have that).

Some say the theme is dark, but to me that is a selling point!  Highly recommended.

It is rare to see an incredibly thematic game like a dungeon crawl have such tight balance and mechanics as this.  The dice rolling is there, but somehow the game feels liberated from the slavish devotion to the same process of dice-chunking-conflict-resolution that makes other game of the like slow and frustrating.  Decisions in the face of luck, unbelievably tight balance, and controlled play time show the games wonderful eurobased design despite being so crawl-like.  And what is more, is that despite all of this mechanical polish, the game somehow manages to tell wonderful stories centered around the Condemned. Some times the feeling of "I cant believe hat just happened" makes a lost game incandescent as an experience, a rarity for something so mechanically tight. Face it, Claustrophobia is a unicorn.

Yes, it is similar to like Space Hulk. And yes it scratches that itch better. I think there is way more 'game' in this than in Space Hulk.

A priest leads a bunch of convicts into Hell.  A very interesting dynamic in which the monsters start off weak and the players strong, but quickly start losing strength while the monsters grow stronger.  If you don't get in and out fast, you're doomed and it feels like it as you play.  Very neat mechanic.  I need more people to play this with.  Have not been able to plumb its depth as of yet, but will!

At first glance this game is intelligent, tactical, and fun.  For the first several playthroughs it might be, I certainly got what I paid for and don't regret buying it.  That said, it eventually becomes apparent that you can lose through no fault of your own.  The tile draw in many scenarios can completely lose you the game.  A good tactical game should always have a brilliant play that can save you, this game you can have perfect rolls and still lose.  It really throws me off and makes it so I can't recomend it.

RATING: 9
Great little game that's easy to learn, teach and play. It has a great theme, simple but effective mechanics and an entertaining mix of skill and luck. The components are top notch, and the rules are relatively clear and well organized.

The limited number of scenarios and monster types is a minor negative, but one that is more than made up for by the quality of game play.

Individual games can be lopsided, but overall game balance seems good. That is, if you played it 10 times, you'd see a relatively equal win distribution and a number of close games between players of similar experience.

I understand there is errata: the red-lettered options can be used once per turn by the baddies, rather than once per game. I actually think it works as well with the "incorrect" rules.

This is a highly recommended game for people looking for a quick, two-player dungeon crawl

Great one-on-one dungeon crawl.  Plays quickly, and features a good deal of tension and strategy throughout.  The mechanic of using dice to assign stats/powers each round works really well, especially the way that the humans start losing options as they become more and more wounded.

The game is really well produced, with a lot of nice components, especially the very nice pre-painted miniatures.

Starting bid. May go up may go down. A hybrid that offers elegance and theme. 

Five games in and the humans have had their first win after drawing 9 tiles with only one exit. This said they still managed to lose 2 characters after the demons caughtened on to their limited options - using terror and a taste of blood to good effect.

Eight games in and it's 7/2 to the Demons. Figured out the core human strategy. 

Really enjoying it. Still playing the first scenario and I feel no need to try any of the others. Fantastic!

Quick, easy to learn, beautiful, rather random and very deadly. I've played it too few times to say much about the balance in different missions, but the bidding system for experienced players should help fix problems with unbalanced missions.

The board tiles are huge, though. They could easily have been a lot smaller, which would have made it possible to play on a smaller table.

What a great thematic game. Components are fantastic, the best I have seen, with painted miniatures looking really nice. This is a game you can play for ages, with a lot of scenarios available online, or make your own.
What makes this game great is the tense play, biting till the end. I find some of the scenarios extremely difficult for the Human player, example the MISLED scenario. Rules are simple - though some of the scenarios have some ambiguous wording requiring some interpretation.

RATING: 6
Consider me impressed. I've shunned miniatures games and might continue to do so, but not this one. Rules were straightforward, but you felt like you had a lot of options on your turn. The variability built into the game was impressive: assymetric sides that seem to play very differently, different scenarios, different characters, different boards, different cards. It just seems like every game would feel fresh.

Furthermore, this captured the best parts of dungeon-crawling in a condensed, quick-playing format. As a former D&Der, I've always enjoyed the exploratory aspects of the dungeon delve and the suspense of a fight. However, I'm the first to admit that "old school" D&D (without minatures) was sometimes hard to visualize and its combat frequently boring, but more recent versions seemed far too bogged down in tactical detail, becoming boring in a completely different way. In Claustrophobia, you don't know what's coming around the next corner, combat is quick and to the point, and everything is there right in front of you, in spectacular visual detail. It never bogs down or feels like too much.

The components are superior.

All in all, while I'm not sure this is a genre of game I'll ever love, I definitely found this example of miniatures gaming to be quite solid. Worth exploring more.

This game turned out to be much better than I had expected. Yes, it's very simple and quite random (the dice play an important role), but You can nevertheless feel that every decision really shapes the way things unfold and in the long run the game proves to be quite tactical. The production value is very high for the price, and it's easy to get people to play it - the rules are well written and quite straightforward. All in all, not as tactical as Space Hulk, but surely a lot of fun!

RATING: 7.9
It's a classic adversarial dungeon crawl as one player takes the part of the adventurers and the other is the monsters. In the fluff, apparently the gates to hell are opening so naturally the forces of good respond by sending down a few expendable convicts supervised by a religious fanatic of some sort - the sculpt is more than a little reminiscent of a priest of Sigmar from the world of Warhammer.

Anyway, the next twist here in gameplay is that each of the characters have six statlines with differing abilities (move/attack/defence); at the start of each round a die is rolled for each character and is then assigned (player's choice) to each character's stat line.

Wounds are also taken on statlines so that when a character incurs an injury that statline is lost to them so if, say, a guy has taken a wound on line three if his (and they are all he - no female convicts or lady priests in these caverns) assigned die is a three then he is immobilised for the turn.

The warrior priest guy also has a number of abilities that can be activated on certain die rolls. As the game progresses difficult choices have to be made around assigning dice which is a lot of fun.

The player controlling the monsters has activation tokens to spend and the key to their game is controlling how they expend these tokens; knowing when to husband their resources and when to go for the smackdown.

The miniatures that come with the game are quite good and ripe for repainitng (though the off-the-shelf paint job from Asmodee is perfectly serviceable) and the components are of good quality.

So, all-in-all this is a winner. Highly recommended if you're after a tactical dungeon crawl with interesting mechanics. Will consider purchasing.

This is a fairly light dungeon crawler. You lead a team of convicts against a pack of demons. This requires a DM.

You roll dice and assign them to the different players. Instead of HPs, you remove the ability of the player to use rolls and they miss their turn.

Sounds kind of interesting. Opposition is somewhat monotonous sounding, though.

One of the most interesting 2 players (1v1) dungeoncrawlers out there, thanks to Croc's twisted vision and a truly solid dice placement system.

Incredibly atmospheric 2-player game.  Simple to learn, fun while it lasts and the components are outstanding! 

However, it's simplicity is also it's downfall.  There is limited scope to try out new strategies because it's usually quite obvious what step you should take next and the humans become more and more frustrating to play as the game goes on as your actions become limited. I know there are some that like this aspect of the game. 

The different scenarious help to keep the game fresh to some extent.  Ultimately though, due to the lack of variable powers/characters there isn't much to keep you coming back.  The expansions may help remedy this.

RATING: 8
To me it feels like a cross between Euro and Ameritrash style games.  The initiative phase, where you roll dice and then assign them to gain specific abilities, feels like a euro game style mechanic - in that it is somewhat strategic.  The remaining phases (ie movement, attack, events), where you throw dice to determine outcomes are more luck-based and tactical.

The game play perfectly compliments the beautiful components and the game's lush theme. If you’re the humans, you really feel like you’re in a dungeon struggling to survive amongst the hordes of demons. You'll be lucky if you make it out alive! If you’re the demons, it's great fun trying to kill off the humans one-by-one. 

Claustrophobia is a tonne of fun!

This game rocks hard. 

It's a dungeon crawl-esque game that plays in 40-60 minutes. It is for 2 Players but more can play if the hero characters are divided up - but it works best with 2.

What sets it apart is that the evil player has some real decision making to make in this game rather than just spawn, move and attack. This is done by rolling dice each turn and then allocating these to a Threat Board that can grant him powers and special abilities for the turn.

The heroes also have to roll dice each turn and 1D6 is allocated to each hero. Each number used then sets the stats for each hero. The trick here is that if a hero is given a dice value that matches the location of a wound, then they are exhausted and can do nothing but defend (poorly) for the coming round. So careful decision making is required of the hero player(s).

If all this wasn't enough, each scenario uses large tiles and these are randomly drawn, meaning the heroes must explore and never know what is around the next corner. Various tiles also have special rules associated with them, which requires both sides to adapt quickly to the changing landscape.

The game looks fantastic with production values through the roof. Pre-painted minis, gorgeous artwork on the tiles and good components (think Formula D trays) for the heroes.

Claustrophobia is a tense, gritty, edge-of your seat kind of game. It has stripped out most of the fiddly rules of other Dungeon Crawls and left the players with a streamlined rule0set that lets them play and enjoy the experience. This is the best game I have found in a long time.

I bought this game due to the hype. While I love the art and really enjoy the clever mechanics, especially the relatively novel way that dice are used and the innovative wounding system, I think the game is way too limited with the small number of human and demons. If this mechanic existed, but with the number of baddies you get in Descent or Wrath of Ashardalon, then you'd be on to something.

RATING: 3
This is not a cheaper and better Space Hulk; the little I've played has left me really dumb-founded regarding the lots and lots of praise it got - especially since most its rare detractors on BGG simply only seem to dislike it because they don't like the genre (and more specifically, its dice-driven combat) to begin with.

Sure the peg mechanic and the dice board feel kind of innovative, but I have not seen really interesting decisions related to them so far. The strategy is not found there at all, but rather in the human player to plan around the spawning rules by blocking the rear of their boringly-moving-forward bus with their tankiest character and enough additional damage to clear the threat. For almost every single scenario on almost every turn. No saving grace is found in fights; the problem with tile-driven (no tactical grid) skirmish games (especially with almost 100% melee units) being that their combat system has to get depth somewhere else than positioning - which Claustrophobia simply doesn't care about. It's not the occasional hard-to-play-around event card that will change much.

Got this in a trade for my spare copies of Aliens and The Thing.
This is an excellent minis skirmish game for two players, dripping with theme and beautiful components, tiles, and minis.  The game play is pretty basic, sort of on a heroquest level, but there are so many scenarios (especially when you download the official extra scenarios from here) and the gameplay gets mixed up nicely with each one that there is a ton of replayability in this game.
Plays fast and furious too.

I love the mechanism in this game for giving your adventurers their stats every turn.  It felt unique to me for an adventure style game.  Where the game lacks for me is the shortage of unique enemy types.  This game would rise quite a bit if I had more than 2 types of enemies in the base game.

RATING: 6
Dicey-dungeon crawl.  Love the miniatures and game board graphic designs.  I freakin hate dice though.

Played 2 scenarios.  I feel the good side is slightly favored.  I have no luck with dice, so this may be a coincidence.  The trogs were always easily eliminated.  Allowing only a max of three trogs in a room seems a little too limiting.  5 would be better in my opinion.  It is bad enough that the evil player has to gain tp which takes up a turn to purchase trogs.  It is horrible to see trogs vanish on the account of my opponent's 'good' rolls and whatever insignificant damage I inflict only healed  easily by the redeemer.  Some of the board pieces did allow for some strategic elements, but even they were too constricting.  Narrow passageways, for instance, let the evil player have one trog in the hall along with one good player piece.  The trog is nothing but a speed bump easily run over.  

Some of the cards that you roll for were useless.  The threat portion is so crucial for the evil player.  Giving up a dice for a card is a stretch when it may not amount to anything.  It is worse when you get two of the same card back to back.

Can't hate on it too much...  Theme is really cool.  The bits and the board add to it.  I like the multiple scenarios.  replayability was thought out carefully by the designers.

After starting up my first game I wasn't in to it very much.  Assigning dice to the humans wasn't very interesting, I hated the same sculpt figures for the brutes and blades.  As the game progressed it became more and more exciting climaxing at the end.  It played out like a story and took on a life of it's own.  And assigning the dice became interesting.  The board looks more beautiful than I'd have thought it would once the game is near completion Looking back on each tile it's easy to renvision the events that unfolded along the heroes way and how it progressed to the current situation.

I still hate that the brutes and blades have the same sculpt/similar paint jobs.  It would have made the game so much better to do them differently, as I understand the expansions' Sicaria have been done.

There is a lot of strategy going on here, so you don't feel completely at the mercy of the  dice.  Best part of this is that you get the rich feeling of a full dungeon crawl or RPG/adventure game in about 45 minutes of playtime start to finish.

The ONLY downside to this game is the amount of table space that is needed at times.  But I wouldn't want smaller tiles.  I love the big tiles.

That's excellent two-player dungeon-crawl. Game drips with theme and tension. Scenarios play quick and so the unlucky dice-streaks don't get you down. Everything can turn upside down in a heartbeat. Most scenarios end with mad dash for the objective for heroes and desperate struggle to stop them for demons. Very tense and excellent game.

I was initially concerned about what seemed like overly light weight rules and simplistic game mechanics. But I was gladly proved wrong! Clautrophobia seems to get better the more you play, revealing a surprisingly high level of tactical depth once you learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the two opposing sides.  

Overall a very enjoyable and satisfying experience.

it has beautiful presentation, and i want very much to like it. the reality is that it is far to based on 6 sided dice; they dictate everything you do. not only does it suck to have the dice dictate your strategy, but when you start rolling like shit in combat? that's when it gets really annoying. 

any great game will have some randomness. even the good euros have some random elements. to have an entire game based around the dice however, in action dictation and combat, is just too random for me. even though it is an interesting way to do it.

RATING: 9
Ahhh, a dungeon crawl bash-em-up that plays in an hour and has meaningful and agonising choices for both players each turn. There's minimal text driven ability manipulators, so movement and combat are uberfast to execute. The first hard decision each turn is with the human player who must roll 1 dice for each of his warriors (4 or so dependent on scenario) and allocate a result to each warrior. In a cunning process, each warrior has 6 sets of [movement, # of attack dice, defence value], usually offsetting each other, and the die result you allocate to the warrior dictates what set of values it has this turn. Each time a warrior takes a hit, one of those sets disappears from use. Hit all 6 and they're dead, baby, dead. On the demon side the hard decision is again dice based, where the 3 dice you roll can get used in any of a dozen ways - gain Threat Points to bring on bad guys, get event cards, etc. It’s hard because you want everything now. Combat is simply roll however many attack dice you're allowed and hit each time you're >= the target’s defence value making turns quick once the hard decision’s been made. Scenarios seem to be generally based around explore / escape or explore / kill the boss, each with a twist, where success for either player seems to continually hang by a thread. Fast paced turns, the right level of chrome (event cards, etc) to mix things up without slowing things down, easy rules, lovely components. Lots to like if you're looking for a thematic fun ride without having to kill a whole night.

Excellent stuff!! Easy and fast to set-up and fairly quick game-play once you got the rules down (not many rules). The game is fun and a good mix of controllable randomness and good tactics.

The different scenarios are great and varied, there are more scenarios to be downloaded from the Clasutrophobia website and with the expansion there come 12 more! An excellent addition to the gaming collection with outstanding components.

Rules - amazingly short for such a game. Easy to explain and easy to play!

First try: Played the first two scenarios in the book. I got to play the demons and I won quite easily. don't know if the game is unbalanced to the demons favour, or if it's a matter of skill :-) Need to play some more to decide. 

Otherwise its a good two player game. I like the art and size! of the tiles (even if it takes a lot of space). All in all its a very good looking game.  

Played a few more times. Even with the different scenarios it gets old if you play it often. But two-player games often do. 

It's obvious that it's designed to be more difficult for the humans, but that's ok as long as you get to switch sides between games :-) It's always fees good to win as human!

The more I play the more I feel that the human player really need a way to vary his actions. The demon player have his cards, the human will only have a few cards each game.

Based on one play: A quick and simple dungeon crawler. Following one of the scenarios, make your way through the dungeon, while another player, playing as the demons, tries to kill you. Roll dice at the start of your turn to assign stats to your player and then move and attack. Then the demon player does the same with his own stats. Worth a try.

RATING: 7
A 2 player dungeon crawler with an incredibly dark theme and it has all pre-painted minis. Count me in! While the game is rather light on rules, it makes up for it with the variety of scenarios to keep each game fresh. Both sides play asymmetrically which allows for more replayabilty as it's different depending on the side you're on. The humans have stats depending on the die used and as they take more damage, they have to block those stats. It becomes more and more tense as the game goes on. The demon player has weak creatures, but an unlimited supply.

The game is  favored more towards the demon player, but nothing that a handicap suggestion in the back of the rulebook doesn't fix. The biggest complaint I have of the game is the sprawling nature of the tiles. It's completely unpredictable in how the dungeon unfolds and as the tiles are quite large, halfway through the game, you're needing to shift the map one way or the other to prevent it from running off the table. Overall, it's a solid game that fills in the 2 player dungeon crawl nicely.

Do note that the rules are incorrect about the red text for the demon player. It's once per TURN and not per GAME! That's quite the oversight in the rules.

I thought a light 2p dungeon duel would be exactly what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately, I found out that this game suffers from the same problem that a lot of these modular games with different scenarios suffer from: scenarios are unbalanced and wildly erratic in their playability and fun factor. I played probably 6 or 7 different scenarios and I only thought one or two of them were fun. Now, I could play just those scenarios over and over again, but I don't think the limited unit types and actions can really support that. There's a fun game in there somewhere, it's just not easy enough to find.

Fast and fun dungeon crawler with gorgeous components. 

Asymmetrical play, with one player controlling the condemned humans fighting to survive, and the other the troglodyte hordes.A lot of clever mechanisms, very fast playing time (one hour per scenario) and a very nice and well implemented theme make this a real winner and one of this year's good surprises.

Scenario based play and randomly drawn tiles make for great replayability, but the game is just so much fun that I can't help thinking about expansions even though I'm still to play all the scenarios in the base game! 

That's a good sign, right?

It is definitely a heavily, heavily competitive game.  If you can't take the heat, then stay away from Claustrophobia.  My son refuses to play this game the interaction is too direct and the competition so strong.

Super fantastic components here! And, unique game play (the way dice are used for unit activation, and wounds limit those options, works really well here). Not since Heroquest when I was a kid has there been such a good dungeon crawler board game. It's an asymmetric 2 player game, but gameplay seems quite well balanced. 

It's quite light. I worry there aren't enough interesting decisions for the Humans. This is, at least, true for a number of the scenarios.

This one rated on the experience alone. I love the atmosphere created by wandering through these treacherous caves. The mechanics are perfect for creating a smooth yet interesting decision space and a platform for evoking the darkness of the confined spaces. The fact that you can play it over endless scenarios make it also a kind of narrative putty, able to bend into any shape. 

I actually feel my poor brute slowing as his progressive wounds weigh on his ability to swing at the never ending horde of troglodytes. A lovely creation.

Figures are painted Extremely nice,wish they were all different at least for the human side instead of two pairs and a leader.
The rules were pretty easy to grasp after a play or two,if I have to say anything negative,I think they could have written the rule book a bit better. Its not horrible but somethings don't have enough explanation and they refer to both sides as warriors from time to time and confused me. It demon,Trogs,and humans!

a seriously fun Diablo-like dungeon crawler. One player gets a band of characters, the other gets to spawn tons of Rakanishu and eventually a boss monster and tries to wear the characters down through attrition. I wish this game wasn't restricted to 2 players.

Nothing is more fun for the hero player than squashing the heads of the tiny 1 health monsters like they were made of peanut butter, and nothing is more fun for the monster player than respawning a horde of them and attacking again and again, turn after turn.

Edit 2015:  Pretty brilliant stuff, really.  Perhaps the best fast-playing, 2-player dungeon crawl I've played.  I used three versions of the word "play-" in that last sentence.  That's kind of awkward.  
Regardless, cool game.  Very interesting theme.  I think certain scenarios favor one faction over the other, but that's part of the point of asymmetrical games, isn't it?  
Worthy of its high rating, in my opinion.

This game fills a niche in my heart carved out by Hero Quest.

Similar in feel to Descent, with rooms instead of grids (so, if you're okay with doing away with range, square-by-square movement,  line of sights requirements, etc... you're in for a treat).  Combat is more Final Fantasy and less Chess.

The mood and theme of the game has to do with a group of humans delving into a dungeon inhabited by evil creatures. Tunnels are tight and enemies are dangerous. As the humans explore, they are being worn down. Someone dies, and the rest of the party presses on. The more and more people are hurt, dying, or dead, the bleaker things look for the survivors. If the light at the end of the tunnel is not reached, soon there is no hope left for the sole survivor. 

It's horror zombie movie meets D&D.

This kind of feeling translates beautifully to the mechanics of the die-roll initiative. As humans are injured, you have less and less spaces to place your die roll without the humans being "Exhausted." When a hero dies, that's one less die you get to roll, period. Exhausted heroes are basically punching bags if there are any baddies around. So, it only goes downhill faster. Morale is dropping. People are spending time tending the wounded. The mechanic faithfully recreates the feeling of tension one gets from watching survival horror.

RATING: 8.5
A great dungeon crawler for two, that won't eat your whole Sunday. Beautifully done and the core mechanics are easy to grasp. Asymmetrical design, makes the human and evil forces game quite different. The tile artwork is gorgeous, the figures itself are ok (not mindblowing, but the paintjob is just ok), the card artwork is just generic fantasy - nothing outstanding, but still within the theme. The dice assignment mechanics are exceptionally well designed and fit the game quite well, realistically - remember all those other games you won while having 1 health? Not here. There's a good chance you'll just faint and be seriously weakened by your wounds, making an easy prey. Preserving all human heroes is crucial. 

Be careful, though. It is what it is. It's a streamlined game that you can finish in 1h. There's no army here, no huge sheets with tons of stats, no 100 kinds of modifiers and items and spells. If you get through this mindset and understand that it was created for a different kind of gameplay, you'll learn to love it. There's a lot of tough choices and each your move can spell your doom. Obviously dice add randomness to this, but as always, it's game of calculating chances and increasing positive dice result. Strike, when it makes sense to strike, hold back, when the odds are against you. But maybe you just want to go berserk and try some wacky lucky attacks. And it may succeed. Which is fun.

See, this game, tells a great story. Whatever scenario you will pick, you can really feel the action. You can even name all those human fellas, and add some backstory while playing the game. Evil player can make squeaky noises, horrible screams or shady laughter. You can immerse in the game, because it doesn't require you to melt your brain in constant calculation and analysis paralysis. It's an action game. After finished session, I always think (and hear) - "gee, I really could have go there, or avoid this".

Be aware that it's not a game that is meant to be always "fair". Some scenarios make it quite hard for humans, which means, it's a bigger challenge. Then again, they are in the heart of hell, and just a bunch of them, so, yeah, what would you expect? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles facerolling the place? You should be scared and constantly threatened! And if you win/lose, you can always switch places and see "how it is on the other side". Evil player can choose different methods, from direct attack, to event playing or simple "bite here, bite there" harassment. Those trogs just lurk in the dark and if you won't be careful...

RATING: 9.25
The game is definitely more flexible than it first looks with only two types of monster miniatures and three types of heroes, not a lot of cards etc. The scenarios make it interesting and it is definitely more interesting both in theme and in execution than the similar Castle Ravenloft but I still think it is a shame this was not produced by FFG who could have beefed it up with content and just more of the same instead of this careful 'light' approach which needs more expansions to be the milestone it could be. A bit more flavouring (in the bits and tiles) as well as in the rules and on the cards would have been nice too.

RATING: 8.5
My first experience with dungeon crawlers. This is an excellent 2-player game with very easy rules, yet deep gameplay. Very smart use (in two ways) of dice and due to random tile draw and various quests this one has a great replay value. I have yet to go beyond the 1st quest actually, because I like it so much.
On top of that, the artwork on this game is stunning. beautiful tiles, wonderfully prepainted figurines, etc. Top notch production quality!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Hands down one of the best mini board games available.

This has over the top production values, especially for the price. Everything inside this box is stunning from the prepainted minis to the thick non warping textured modular board tiles.

This game is also challenging (no matter which side you play) and full of strategy options. Doesn't hurt that it's dripping with theme either!


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Perfect dungeon crawler, with Euro sensibilities and French taste. Love a bit of Claustrophobia! ( Good suggestion from an opponent was for there to be blue pins (included) for the line of action you choose, which would make identifying the line of action easier than cross referencing the dice. That would also work well nicely as that pin space will not be available if there is already a damage pin there.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Claustrophobia is a fantastic asymmetrical dungeon crawl that pits two players against one another. It's always my first choice for 2 player games. The only downside is that it takes a while to play and only supports 2, so it's not always a good option if you and a friend are waiting for the rest of your group.

Nice dungeon (catacomb, tunnel actually) crawl in the vein of space hulk, but in a pre-assembled set with a variety of scenarios combined with balancing mechanisms (as well as a bidding for the human player option - low bid building a human team with the points bid.)  Nice wounding mechanism for the humans (exhausting possible stats).  Interesting options for the Troglodyte player making the dice nicely add randomness, but not overwhelming the game.  Scenarios play quickly with nice decisions and atmosphere. A game that sets up quickly, then seems to encourage "just one more play" before being packed away.

Excellent game for 2 players, with very simple rules, ideal for newcomers to start in tactical and dungeon games. It´s asymmetric, and with interesting mechanics using dice. In addition, I think this game is awesome, its artistic and production quality is amazingly high for the price (finally, I was able to get it recently, and I am very happy because I had been looking for it for a long time). Miniatures are prepainted and I like them. Many people compare it to "Space Hulk" but, except that both are asymmetric, tactical games for 2 players and both occupy a lot of space on the table, the feeling I´ve when playing "Claustrophobia" is very different. For me, it´s a great game: not better, not worse than "SH". It´s different and lighter. It would be great if it were reprinted by Asmodee, including its expansions. Anyway, only with the base game, you´ve game over here for a long time!  :-)

09-09-2014. I think I like this better than Space Hulk, which I've downrated accordingly.

07-09-2014. Rated after 1 play. Asymmetric 2 player dungeon crawler in which one player plays 'heroes', while the other player plays an overlord-like character. Both sides try to achieve their objectives, which range from escaping, killing or obtaining some other objective.

Mechanisms for actions is innovative. The heroes roll dice and assign it to action-lines on their board that represent the combat, movement and defense values the character will have during the round. The overlord can use dice to activate several of his abilities, gain threat or action cards.

Fun!

I liked this less than I thought I would. The game is very interesting, and has one of the more interesting uses of dice to promote randomness but not luck. The support given by the designer is also fairly amazing.

Unfortunately, the game does seem to have relatively few tactical choices on each side, and after a few plays each scenario does seem slightly same-y. 

Well worth playing, but I doubt I'll become one of my personal greats.

Great looking minis and board, although the card was a little warped.  The first scenario seemed to benefit the demons.  The game seemed like a stream lined space hulk with interesting decisions and a fun tactical battles.

RATING: 9
Splendid game, scoring extremely highly for playability, ease of set-up, variety, production, and value for money. Other games are going to be judged by the standards of this one for years to come. I think if it had passed the Vasel test this would be in the BGG top ten already. The sheer tactile pleasure of holding the solidly constructed, weighty box is almost disturbing... Thematic Game of the Year and 2 player Game of the Year 2010, without hesitation. The one minor quibble is problems distinguishing the Condemned minis and having to use a generic demon - Asmodee must rectify this by producing a booster pack of alternate figures, including the other demons and figures armed with the blundebus, shield etc, or I will be forced to downgrade this to a 1 out of spite. [Edit:] That's a joke about the spite-rating, but I am a bit surprised that alternative miniature packs weren't marketed for this game seeing as the game is based on a line of miniatures. I'm too lazy to find proxies.

Sleeved. Picked up second hand in like new condition with custom insert from gamer on BGG in the local area.  Played this really late in the night, so not sure I grasped everything.  Setup is quick once you know what you're doing.  Gameplay moves fast and each player rolls dice, selects actions movement and combat, and then on to the next player.  We played the Survivors beginner scenario, so I feel like we didn't experience all the game has to offer yet, plus I have both expansions to add in eventually.  This is a decent dungeon crawl for two players and sparks the competitive spirit if you like combat and confrontation.

RATING: 8
7.7.10 - I need to play this one some more before I can really pass judgement on it. 
Pros: Like the tiles (instead of spaces). Very nice artwork and components. Like the theme. 
Cons: Didn't really like the dice mechanic. Felt like it just slowed down the action as you had a bit of worker placement in the middle of each round. 

7.7.12 - (13 plays) After 10 plays I rated this an 8. Game play is quick. Though the dice mechanic doesn't bother me as much as it did on my first couple of plays, I think I'll ultimately enjoy playing Space Hulk more than this. I want to say once again how much I prefer Claustrophobia's tile system to the grid based movement that other games use. 

7.7.17 - (17 plays) Got nostalgic for this one and re-acquired it with both expansions for $100 total. Don't think it will see a lot of play but I'm happy to have a copy in my collection.

This is the first game in a long time where I just had to shake my head and proclaim ingenuity in the design. It breathes such a fresh air of originality not just into the genre but to board games in general, yet the rules are so simple and elegant.

It's fun allocating dice (and in such different ways for the Humans and Demons), it's fun how the damage system works for Humans, it's fun to build the board up from a single chunky tile, and it's fun how the theme works with little minions flooding the tunnels from unguarded openings.

And I can't rave enough about the components. Before I bought this game, I kept looking for pictures of the minis unpainted (BGG is super misleading with games that come with miniatures; pictures are often tagged incorrectly as "Game" when they should be "Creative") and couldn't find any. Then I looked in the rulebook online, saw the painted minis and laughed that I wasn't going to get hoodwinked by another rulebook that advertised things it provided separately.

And then I opened the box.

All the minis are painted and done very well, with the detail especially evident in the Demon. Strangers would keep stopping by my open box to pick up and admire the figurines, and they would look as surprised as I did when I told them they were pre-painted. At $40 online, and boasting PAINTED MINIS, huge chunky tiles, awesome innovative mechanisms, online designer support, an excellent insert and a satisfyingly huge game box that houses everything securely, Claustrophobia is undoubtedly the best value in board gaming.

5+4

Fantastic game of exploration and combat for two players.
Lots of dice, but with interesting aplications.
My girl looks like a Witch throwing dice in that board of destiny. 
Somehow the game goes in a opposite direction from others in the category, like Descent or Earth Reborn. It has a simplistic approach that grants it with a focused narrative and a great immersion. Simplicity is a virtue here, as it doesn't boils down the deepness of the experience. 
I would love  to see some solo game, more monsters and items also would be great. Bad font choice with small size on the cards and status stands are the only cons I can tell.

RATING: 8
Probably the best way for me to review Claustrophobia (C) is to compare it to Space Hulk (SH):

1.  Theme:  both SH and C rate highly on this.  I like the world of Claustrophobia, but I wouldn't say the Condemned are as fun to play as Space Marines.
2.  Components.  SH only wins this because I bought the recent 3rd edition set which is phenomenal.  But C components are great, and I love the painted minis.  I just wish you could tell the condemned Blades/Brutes apart from their twins (using something other than hair color).
3.  Map Design/Layout:  slight advantage to SH.  I enjoy the exploration of C, and it does it right - with lots of dead ends and interesting tile types (man, those lairs are rough).  But I prefer having the map of a space hulk laid out before me, and a goal to accomplish.  It really allows for some intense tactical thinking.
4.  Time:  advantage C.  The set-up and play time for a scenario in C is very fast - under 1 hour.  This means my friend and I can play 2-3 scenarios per evening.  A SH scenario (incl set-up) takes much longer.  
5.  Gameplay:  close, but I give the advantage to SH.  I think the mechanics of SH are perfectly meshed with its theme.  Just think Overwatch and having your gun be Jammed; the ranged vs. melee combat of SH provides more high-tension gaming moments.  The one big advantage to C is that the Demon side is much more fun to play than the Genestealers in SH due to the random-die action mechanic.  Very neat, very clever.  You still treat Trogs like cannon fodder, but you have more tactical options to beat down the opponent.

Overall, I give SH an edge in overall rating but Claustrophobia just might see more table time because of its quick setup and play.  You definitely need both in your collection.

a beautiful, rich game. picked up as a brainier, competitive alternative to D&D's Adventure Series co-op games.

i need to play this more; while i like the mechanics and the deep decision making, the game-play feels a level of abstraction out from a down-and-dirty dungeon crawl.

the braininess doesn't seem to fit thematically. ie, if i'm trying to escape a horde of monsters & demons; i don't want to feel like i'm doing advanced math. i want the "game-over, man" tension and helplessness of the Aliens movie. i want to hack-and-slash while i high-tail it out.

That said, I just don't find it all that "fun". Mechanically, I think it's cool how damage works, but it does make playing the humans really unenjoyable for me. It's not difficult to find yourself in a position where the human player has very little chance of winning, but isn't going to lose for another half hour or so. That is kind of tedious, but due to the luck of the dice, it's not right for the humans to just throw in the towel (or to ask them to do that). So for me, it's more like a 6 or 5.

Наконец, после долгий исканий (Мистер Джек, Дракула, Несколько акров снега и т. д.), попалась в руки вполне адекватная и самодостаточная игра на двоих, хотя опять же не без недостатков. Различия сценариев делают игру достаточно разнообразной. При этом реиграбельность каждого сценария также высока. Используемые механики для меня новы - наконец можно поиграть в игру, где один человек осуществляет полноценное (а не как в Скотленд Ярде и т. п.) управление группой Персонажей, при этом игра настоящая бродилка по подземельям. Из механики вызвала знакомую ассоциацию - механика раскладывания кубиков - наподобие Кингсбурга.

Gyönyörűen kivitelezett játék. Nem sok társasjáték esetében látni festett figurákat. Minden eleme nagyon szép. Ezen túl egy nagyon jó kétszemélyes játékról van szó. Az egyik fél a szörnyeket, a másik a menekülő csapatot hivatott vezetni. A pálya minden játék során változik, mert külön darabokból épül a menekülők haladása szerint. Igaz, hogy kockadobásos a játék, mégis nagyon jól tudják a játékosok ezen dobásaikat a számukra legjobb módon rendezni. Viszont a barlangi járatok véletlenszerű felhúzását már nagyobb szerencsefaktornak éreztem.

Ridiculously short setup time (pretty much box and play), awesome components and clear, easy-to-learn rules make this a keeper.

[i]Unique Head-to-Head Game. Completely Asymmetric, Tense, and Exciting! All in Less than an Hour...[/i]

Awesome game. A dungeon crawl that goes against type (best with 2, short play time, streamlined rules...). Super efficient game here, it provides enough fun, strategy, and atmosphere to compete with the best dungeon crawlers out there even without the variety and complexity that these games usually rely on... instead it just has a really solid core.

Only played the introductory scenario twice and we flipped sides in each game, so it was hard to really gauge how the game really felt since we were just learning the rules. 

I liked what I saw, and want to play more. There are a *ton* of scenarios available so it's almost infinitely re-playable.

I wasn't such a fan of the game's idea to use dice for action selection, and switching up our character strengths from turn to turn--it slowed things down a bit too much as we tried to sort through our options, and felt like a clunky insertion of Eurogame strategy into a traditional monster skirmish. The action selection, a slightly simpler rules set than usual for this type of game, and impressively large and thick tiles differentiate it a little from the herd, but not enough for me to give it much of a second thought.

This is a good dungeon crawler for two. The asymmetrical game play is nice and the way dice are used keeps it interesting. Setup isn't to long and there are a lot of scenarios. However, the scenarios feel far more samey than those of Descent 2ed. The limited creature types add to the samey feeling. There are also no female characters for my girls to play. Most of these issues are said to be fixed with the expansion.

Claustrophobia has outstanding components at a great price, but that's just the beginning. It has a ton of play value, too. It's very fast - you can set up, play a game, and have it back in the box again in a single hour. Chances are you'll want to play more than once, though - it's definitely one of those "let's do it again" games. In most scenarios, the human player is exploring tunnels by drawing tiles, and the demon player is trying to kill the humans. It's a slugfest, with lots of tough little decisions to keep it interesting. Switching sides gives you an entirely different experience, because the game is quite asymmetrical.

Not recommended for those who can't deal with random elements, or anyone who is bothered by a theme featuring monsters from Hell. For the rest of you, this is a terrific game - just buy it, you won't be disappointed. My review, which walks you through a solo game step by step, is [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/515679/the-dirty-14-dozen]here[/url].

Yay!  Descent and Spacehulk had a fantasy themed baby for two players!  This is a great game, and I've really enjoyed my 'self vs self' solo plays (which I don't record on the Geek) and my single play against a 'live' opponent.  It's only draw back is that it has a huge foot print.

LOVE IT! it works so great, excellent ratio [trivial rules/tactic depth], superb atmosphere and appearance. Exquisite expansion is out..
I only wish scenarios in general were a bit longer and less streamlined.. (yet haven't played Campaign, can't wait to) 

E:..few dozens of plays later the rating of my own is still rising.. Even if the re/playability of each individual scenario is great, I find it being kinda open gaming platform, rather than strict game made for/by rules and tightened by components, texted cards including! So cool. 
Now I know I'll never get rid of this uniqueness.. 
and it still looks soo nice to me.. tiptop visual appeal!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Comparisons to Space Hulk are inevitable, but I prefer Claustrophobia for several reasons.

It's much less atmospheric, in part because Space Hulk's mechanics are, comparatively, very true to its theme: it tries, if you like, to be a simulation. (The timer is particularly vicious -- you can't take five minutes from your frantic life-or-death struggle to consider the options.) The comparative lack of atmosphere is just because Claustrophobia is more gamey.

Where the Genestealer player in Space Hulk has less interesting decisions to make, the demon player in Claustrophobia actually has more choices than the human does. The game's biggest flaw is actually that it's so much more fun to be the bad guys because the choices are so much more interesting. (Its second biggest flaw is that two of the base game scenarios are unplayably biased.)

There is a fair amount of dice rolling, but it's mitigated to some extent by a set of clever dice allocation mechanisms. Random drawing of cards and rooms provides major replayability. 

It does all feel a bit samey after a while, though; I'll never love it enough to want to play it al the time. But I keep it because it feels a hole in my collection. 

The best thing about it is that it can play fast. I can't imagine pulling Space Hulk out on a whim; it just takes too much time and too much energy. Claustrophobia isn't quite as deep an experience, but it's a perfect go-to dungeon crawl.

I really love the art/components in this game and the fact that it plays pretty quickly.  The scenarios are interesting and I like that the rules are streamlined. 

We finished all of the base game scenarios so it is time to try our De Profundis.

As noted in the expansion section we ended up selling this game as my daughter lost interest.

I have always played the human side (my daughter liked playing the Demon side) and I was not a fan of the dice dictating your actions.  I have had several occasion where one of my characters had half their live left but because I didn't roll enough different numbers they had no actions and were quickly devoured.  I much prefer an action point allowance system.

A very well designed and produced tile-laying survival game for two players. The quality of the playing pieces is excellent and the gameplay is pretty even for both sides despite the fact that they vary quite a lot in the way that they play. The randomness of the tiles means that there's a lot of variety on offer and there's a good selection of different scenarios to play in the rulebook. All this in turn results in a lot of re-playability on offer. The suggested game length of 45 minutes seems to be way off the mark though and you can regularly expect to be playing for twice that length of time.

Really, it's a better game that I've expected. Yes, it is a dice rolling game with a strong luck element involved.  But still there is large number of decisions to be taken: how to block your opponent in the dungeons, how to manage your dice, how to plan your moves on the tactical level having in mind the general plan for the whole scenario. 
Very delicious and engrossing.

What more? (1) wonderful game elements, (2) perfectly painted minis and (3) an extremely good support from the publisher - new campaigns available at the Asmodee website. Chapeau bas!

Great fast paced dungeon crawler! 

As human player, you roll and allocate stats and take your turn. The mechanism to simulate the wounding of your men is very nicely done.

As demon player, you roll dice that give you abilities to either spawn or modify your existing creatures, draw event cards or metagame. 

These elegant mechanisms, coupled with really nice art, pre-painted miniatures, scenario variations and equipment, event and advantage cards make for a fast-paced dungeon crawler with lots of variation and an engaging gameplay.

This will probably obsolete both Doom as Gears of War for me.

This is a game that is totally not my thing, but works wonderfully! Asymmetrical, nicely varied and with some decent tactical choices.

This is one of a kind, a dungeon crawler thats not entirely luck based, plays two players, has next to no set up time, isn't fiddly and plays in 45 minutes.  This is an amazing feat with there being so many slow bit driven slogs of games in this genre.  The minis are great and the box design works well.  The over all components are very good quality.  Gameplay wise, it's a pleasure to play, it's fairly light, but that actually helps it shine.  Theres some tension to be had and tough choices around each corner.  While dice driven the asymmetrical mechanics on both sides are extremely strategic and well done, that says something, I wouldn't call this a dicefest even though it uses dice. It's over all highly tactical with some really interesting spawn/line of sight mechanics that make for some very cool choices.  My only beef is that there's not enough variety of demons/heroes in the main box, but, that leaves for what I hope will be many expansions to come.  Still the scenarios are all very similar and there, in the base game is a distinct lack of variety.  But if you want a nice quick dungeon crawl that's an easy teach but interesting play for 2, this is ideal to have in your collection, it fills a spot no other game will in that regard.  I hope we see more from this title in the future.

Good game.

I have two problems with it, first it is two-player-only.
Second. I doubt that the replayability is good.

But both problems could be solved by a good expansion.

Update: Some more games. Overall, all that I showed the ,game liked it. Imo this is now the best light dungeon crawler out there. Replayability is still an issue for me, but there are already 4 official free-for-download scenarios. I still rate it a 7 since my basic problems still remain, 2 player and lack of variety if Croc is able to solve those two issues with an expansion my rating will easily go up to 9 or even ten.

My review from the game in finnish: http://www.lautapeliopas.fi/peliarvostelut/claustrophobia/
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Dice allocation mechanic creates interesting decisions for both sides. The game is close and exciting until the end.

Although there is luck involved in tile draws and combat, I never felt that the outcome of the game was determined by luck.

=Not for you if = 

You don't like sways in your game. Some tile draws (like a dead end) can sway the flow of the game from one side to the other. I think it creates more excitement and balances the game, however, some people might find it frustrating.  

You are looking for a completely balanced game. Some scenarios are not well-balanced, and a few of them are broken. Especially the scenarios with a predetermined layout takes away an exciting mechanic of the game (tile drawing and placement), and they are more likely to be the ones that are not well-balanced. Several of them are good, and can be replayed.

RATING: 8
Claustrophobia is simple, short, tense and balanced, excelling in these tricky areas where most dungeon-crawl games falter. Components are very much a mixed bag. The tiles are sturdy and nicely illustrated and the painted miniatures are OK but lacking in variety. The various markers are nothing special but are serviceable. The theme really could have been far more appealing as generic humans versus monsters, and I find the whole Hell Dorado mythos detracts as a backdrop - it is unfamiliar and opaque to most of us and I find players just ignore rather than embrace it. A worse decision, however, is having two pairs of human characters use identical sculpts and be differentiated only by one member in each pair having blonde hair. Truly is a bad decision for the ages. The game itself is good enough that it overcomes its absurd theme and other poor choices on the part of the publisher. Again, a dungeon-crawl game with relatively few rules, a short play time and tense, balanced action is a rare bird, and Claustrophobia gets high marks in all those areas.

RATING: 8
Extremely fun, quick and easy dungeon crawler.  It's the right kind of dice-chucker.  And the tiles and pre-painted minis are top notch.  It could use a lot more variation on the demon side.  Turns and decisions can be pretty samey from turn to turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Strikingly good dungeon crawl game which is heavy on theme and that shines due to its ingenious use of dice. Human players roll dice and assign one of them to each of their active players. Each number on the character sheet has different figures in terms of movement, combat and defense value of the character. Whenever you receice damage, the human player has to choose one of these lines to be blocked. So later in the game you will have hardly no choice concerning what row to occupy. Sometimes at least one character being stunned is just inevitable. Awesome, next time I want to try our gameplay with the demons. 

A minor criticism: Production value is already way beyond awesome in this game, but when you have two warriors of the same type - why not make them distinguishable. They look the same, they have the same base ---> ok, I was now pointed to the fact that the guys have different hair-colour. So after all you can distinguish it. It wouldn't have hurt to make the difference a little more obvious.

UPDATE #2:  Get it.  The best game I have played so far in 2010.  Tight, thrilling, quick, and immersive.  Don't miss the train simply because one high profile passenger said the ride is a little bumpy.  The scenery is scarily beautiful.

-----

Realize that my comments are following on the heels of two initial plays.  As always, my thoughts and rating on the game could go up or down.  Let me elaborate why I think it will be up....

First off, right now, I like it better than Space Hulk.  SH can be such a beast to set up (I know, that is a terrible excuse), and it has to be handled with kit gloves (man, is it expensive).  But I really feel that Claustrophobia has it beat in more than just those two areas.  Claustrophobia has a ridiculous potential for some very good and very interesting expansions.  And it also seems to have a much better flow.  

Space Hulk is a much more tense game--and it is surprising to me that, for whatever reason, I am OK with a lesser level of tension in Claustrophobia.  The tension in Space Hulk is unparalleled--it stands head and shoulders above any other game in that area.

But the choices that are present in Claustrophobia, small as they might appear, are what really make the game work for me.  Make no mistake--they are the clear and present Euro element in this otherwise purely American game.  And it cannot be stated that these choices make the game run, in the way that the choices in a pure Euro do (say, Goa or Agricola).  However, these choices exist to give the player a certain feeling of control over what happens in the game--even if that feeling is just that--a feeling.  Far from arbitrary, and far from dominating, these choices are what make the game stick together, even in instances when pure chaos threatens to blow the holy doors off the whole thing, and send it crashing into the ranks of the ridiculous.  One game, the game was down to the wire, and I won merely because I had to roll a one--and I did.  

I love Claustrophobia.  Yeah, I think the theme is stupid, almost childish in its attempt to gain credibility with the Warhammer and FF crowd.  Seriously, why demons?  Nevertheless, the game does not seem to be so evil and devious as to be avoided.  And I like it better than Space Hulk.  For now.

UPDATE:  After a third play, I have thought of some more reasons why I like this game so much.  Because there are no hexes/squares--you are simply on a large tile--there are zero line-of-sight issues.  Add this to the fact that with one minor exception, all combat is done hand-to-hand, and you are left with a streamlined design where battle is vicious, quick, and ever-present--with no LOS questions, no range questions.  Nothing but battle, which leaves players to simply play the game and weigh the aforementioned choices.

This was OK. I'd play it again, but there are plenty of others I'd rather break out. I guess it's not what I'm looking for in a 2 player game.

RATING: 8.5
This is the game I wanted Space Hulk to be.  Quicker setup, quicker playtime, and a bit more forgiving.  I can actually win this one!

The tiles are beautiful and the cards on the good side of serviceable.  I wish there were more demon sculpts, or trogs in different poses.

Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised at how much adventure and drama this game can cram into under an hour of playtime.  It generates some very cool stories, which is what games like this are all about for me.  And the board of destiny/die assignment mechanisms really hit the luck sweet spot for me.  One of my current favorite under-an-hour games.

fun game, but the asymmetrical nature of the games, makes it a little unbalanced at times, where you feel you can only win with a lot of luck.

This is probably my favorite 2-player thematic game in terms of game play. I own Space Hulk (Third Edition), so that's my favorite components wise, but for sweet game play, I think Claustrophobia might trump SH.

I believe this was my first experience with a proper dungeon crawl board game. We played a quick scenario that I won pretty easily. My initial impression was that this was pretty fun for a roll-and-move. The selection of action dice during the initiative phase, and how they affect movement, combat and defense, is pretty clever. The game is extremely well-produced both aesthetically and functionally.

A quick paced unique game with a fantasy theme portrayed in a convincing manner. Some innovative mechanics and some basic tactics give both antagonising players choices, or more often a mere illusion of.

A super cool 2 player game of this sort. I can't afford Space Hulk, but this game delivers on so many levels I have to say I enjoy it more than Space Hulk. The variable human levels each turn is very interesting. The variable demon player powers is even more interesting. Cards with items, events, blessings and more. All packed in a box that makes this so very affordable with 16 pre-painted figs...how can you go wrong? This game is awesome.

I enjoyed this one a bit better than Space Hulk because the map is random, so the same mission can be played many times without be the same.

Excellent dungeon crawler with one of the best hero modification mechanics we've used. It's innovative and solid. Often criticised for un-named heroes leading to a lack of immersion but we disagree, we just named our own! Actually means we're MORE invested in it than characters with names we don't like. Excellent, just a shame Asmodee are dragging their heels with supporting it and getting De Profundis reprinted.

I was really excited when this game was released, but after one play I have no desire to purchase it. It is quite a good game, it is just that it is too random to be a gamers' game and too elaborate to be a family game. So, depending on my mood, I am afraid that I would always choose either Space Hulk or HeroScape over this game.
Still it has quality components, great artwork, a nice tile system and some interesting movement rules. It really is too bad that the dice rolls, cards, abilities and tile properties hardly let you plan ahead. The designer should have replaced the character dice rolls with fixed statistics and command points. And the wound markers with markers that can be assigned to different body parts (to lower the statistics of your choice when you get hit). I really do not like it that the models have 2 movement points during one turn, and zero during the next (because I rolled badly). And that the monster player may receive actions cards each turn that make exceptions to the rules and contain quite a bit of text. Also, the translation of cards and rulebook from French is mediocre at best.

A light dungeon crawl with very basic combat/movement mechanism. A few positive things: the minis are really well sculpted; the tiles and components are top notch; game play is simple and easily taught.
The negative aspect of this game is repetition and luck of the draw. There is a huge dose for both those things. Luck is quite hefty in this game and can determined the outcome of the game early during game play. I like it buy not love it.

The artwork on the various cards is deliciously gruesome (especially some of the troglodyte cards), and I love being able to roll scads of dice in order to assign abilities to the human players and to resolve combat. However, I'm not a huge fan of the random drawing of tiles in certain scenarios, as it makes it nearly impossible in some places for one player to recover. I may reconsider my rating after exploring the game further.

Great dungeon crawler. Very, very simple and luck dependant, but it doesn't matter. After few games it seems it miight be a little easier for the demons to win, but I find it very thematic end fun - it's about going ageins the odds like in a true surviver horror. The score might change after I get tired of the scenerios (but I played the first one like 5 times with a friend today, they don't seem to get old very quickly).

UPDATE: Rebought in July 2014 and rating upped from 3.5 to 9. I'm not expecting Descent: First Edition but shorter, which was what I wanted/expected when I got it first time around. I'm also more open to competitive games than when I owned it last. As such, it's a nice light dungeon crawl that competes in the slot of the D&D Adventure Games (coop). It's not a tactical combat game - in fact, it's more like a cross between Kingsburg and a dungeon crawl. It's a dice placement game with a dungeon crawl attached. Taken as what it is, and not what I wanted it to be a few years ago, I like this one.

UPDATE: Very, very boring... Claustrophobia is beautiful, but a limited range of monsters and special actions make it a bit of a snoozeathon for the demon player. Jon, who plays the good guys, didn't find it especially exciting either. All in all, a bit meh.

A light combat/dungeon crawl game with beautiful tiles. It feels lighter than the D&D series of cooperative games. There's less variety of monster, and the demon player's options for actions are controlled by dice rolls and a board.

There's not much room for tactics either. The aim of the game for the demon player is to throw monsters at the opponent until they die or get out. The non-demon player has a small number of different units and needs to get out.

Good for a light combat game taking under an hour. Simple to set up too.

This is a really mixed bag. It has some pros - the tiles look great, the core rules are streamlined, elegant and easy to understand. I really like the dice allocation mechanism, it's very unique for this type of game.

Unfortunately, Claustrophobia just falls flat to me. Playing as an overlord is pretty cool due to a varied action board, but playing as heroes is simply boring - you don't really have that many choices to make. I wish the heroes had more cards with special abilities in play, this would really spice up the game. It's a shame that one side of the conflict clearly has more fun than the other. 

Another downside of the base game is the lack of variety of the monsters, you only get one type of minions and one "level boss" (yes, the cards can modify their abilities, but the miniatures remain the same, which can get boring).

I gotta say that after all the hype I heard about this game I was really disappointed.

I really wish that my wife enjoyed this game more - might actually get to play it!

I think the problem here is if I have a group over I don't want to pair down into a 2 player game and that's sad, as this game is just great if you get two people who enjoy it. Perhaps someday I'll find someone I can do a marathon session of this with but today ain't it.

Ahhhhh, when it will get to Russia?

Edit: At last! It is in Russia!!! Wait! ... ????
I don't want it that much now :) As always hype goes down. But I'll keep the rating.

Edit: I DO want it THAT much :) I'll try to get it in few months (than I finally find a job)

This is one of those games that won't leave my collection because of how good everyone else says it is, which is a weird position. Every time I've played it, I've enjoyed it, but being a two player game that my wife doesn't ask for, it doesn't come out much. That means each time I play it is like playing it for the very first time and I have to relearn the rules and strategy. Worse, I think I've only ever played the first scenario.

Great 2 player action with little setup time.  The injury / dice mechanic is WAY underutilized in games.... more of this please?!?!   

Needs more factions / heroes.

Two player action-movement dungeon crawl through pre-made scenarios. The players run either the heroes or the monsters. Great combat and movement system. Great miniatures and production art.  I would be all over this game if I wasn't a regular paper and pencil RPG guy.

A great two-player game -- rare to find one this Ameritrashy. Plenty of replayability right out of the box, despite being a "scenario" game.

RATING: 9
A 2 person dungeon crawl done right. Tense, tough, asymmetrical, and tons of scenarios (and more found online). The theme may be off-putting for some but for a game that only lasts about 45-60  minutes it scratches the itch.

RATING: 6
The movement pinning rules (characters can't leave a room if there are more monsters than good guys) do an admirable job of promoting group interdependence and cohesion.  There are other things to like, too: tile exploration, dice assignments that affect character traits, turn-to-turn variable overlord powers, etc.

Since it's a two-player game, it won't be played often - but that's just fine for the sake of replayability and freshness.

[i]Update:[/i]

Rating lowered after playing through the six-scenario "campaign".  Probably deserves a 5 rating, but I saw a rainbow today and am in a good mood.

The game's repetitive and samey, and lopsided in favor of an evil player who loves events and spawning tricks.  The tentacle rooms are the worst.

Interesting dungeon crawl game. Each scenario has a specific objective so with the many playing tiles, it should have good replay value. The bad guy seems to have the advantage in my experience but that is ok.

Hard to get people to play this game for some reason. Maybe the setting or the set-up is intimidating. But once you start playing, it's great fun. Simple combat mechanics with just enough depth and I'm a sucker for modular boards and asymmetrical teams that remind me of space-hulk.

Fun little tactical strategy game...with some exploration...but not an adventure game as some describe.  It's a one-on-one, kill or be killed (or flee quickly), scenario-based game of strategy.  I need to play it more...but it seems a bit more shallow than I first suspected.  I still enjoy it though...don't get me wrong.

**First play rating**

As much as I love miniatures games, there was something specific about this one that didn't set well with me.  Perhaps it brought me back to hours upon hours grinding out Baal runs in DiabloII which I in some ways regret.

Wonderful two player game. Great components and cool mechanics. Fight your way through the dungeons if you are the good guys. If not, kill them as the demon! Tactical warfare for two players in a pretty short time.

Handicaps might be necessary when playing as the demons since both my wife and I always lose when playing as the demons. The scenarios provide some decent difference in strategy and gameplay, but the humans always seem to have an advantage. Some of the demon moves seem a bit focused to particular scenarios, so maybe some alterations of the rules for specific scenarios is necessary.

Unique and enjoyable. A lighter dungeon crawl that combines dice allocation, exploration, and dicey combat. The two sides are asymmetrical, and play completely different from each other which leads to some pretty interesting/unique tactics depending on the player. Games are flowing much better now that we play exploring correctly.

Traded for Le Havre. Great game but the person I play 2-player games with also had it and has more incentive to keep it (son).

I am terrible at this game. Absolutely and utter crap. However, despite that, it's really grown on me, and I've found myself playing more. Also, CROC's support for this gaming has been nothing short of outstanding - the constant free updates are what pushes it from "great" to "one of the best board games ever."

Fantastic! Gorgeous-looking and the implementation of the theme is a joy. I know there are a lot of dungeon crawlers around at the moment but this ticks all the boxes for me. Playing as the humans is TOUGH, but considering that they are battling the actual forces of darkness that seems reasonable enough! Wonderfully asymmetrical - I find playing as both sides equally interesting. Only wish there were minis for each of the main demons.

I’ve read a lot lately about this game. In almost every article, review or video about this game, everybody mentions the high quality of components. Well, to be short on this. They are right. Even the dice are high quality dice. And the pre-painted miniatures are just fantastic. Another thing that I read everywhere is how tactical this game is. Again, everybody is right. The Formula-D style boards for the hero player are very nice, and when a die is disabled for a hero, that really is a handicap for that player. The way the monsterboard works, is very nice. Also the balance between good and evil is very good. I don’t have the feeling that there is a big advantage for 1 or the other party. But….

All of the great aspects of the gameplay in the game, is destroyed (well, that is a very big word, but I don’t know a lighter one for it), by the luck that comes with the dice. Everything in this game is controlled by dice. If the hero player has bad luck, and he throws 4x a 4, and all 4′s are blocked, all he can do is. Nothing. This happened at our 1st play of this game. M. suffered from a lot of bad luck. She didn’t manage to throw a 3 or higher when she attacked me, while I had all the luck in the world. If I needed a 5 or higher, I threw a 5 or higher to hit the hero. Also M. suffered from bad luck with drawing the cards. While all the event-cards I draw, where very useful. To be short on this one, it was a flawless victory for the monsters.

At this moment, we have mixed feelings about this game. Perhaps we have to re-read the rules, but I’m pretty sure, we didn’t do anything wrong according to the Dutch rules (of course it’s possible, that it’s not a great translation, so I’ll read the English rules). We enjoyed playing, even while the theme is not our ‘thing’, in basic the mechanics are very nice, but at our play, they were ruined by bad / good luck. Maybe we have more leveled luck with our next game. It sure tastes like more.

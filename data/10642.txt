Great game. A superb Leningrad inset.

RATING: 9
Worth the time spent to learn the system. It is a great game which is very tight for both sides. The situation around Leningrad is tense. 

I like the system of having the opposite side react to an attack in drawing other troops into the fight. The artillery system is great and the supply - handling is good. The idea of having units in attack - supply and shipping the supply along the railroads to the front gives the game a special tension. Where to ship the sparse supply for the (hopefully) successful attack is something that keeps you thinking between the turns.

Highly recommended especially in conjunction with the other linked modules in the series. Beautiful maps and rules that model the difficulties of both the Germans and Russians in 1941.

Being reprinted by GMT to included updates the rules, and counters since it's first issue. Now on pre-order on the GMT site.

Great expectations, great disappointment!
Maps are really good and I like the air system, but unfortunately ZOCs an strongpoints rules limit movement to a crawl that makes the game look like a WWI campaign. The Luga line was actually a strong nut to crack, but in the end the Germans got through: I played the game 3 time and the Germans did never come within rach of Leningrad. I think the weather table is also biased towards mud.
I own also AGS and AGC, but I have never played them... maybe there is more room for manouvre.

It would be interesting to see the GDW/GRD efforts merged with GMT's.  Wonderful realism.  Will we ever see a complete set of games covering the entire Russian Campaign?

V.V.B.'s Barbarossa Army Group series are perhaps the best divisional level games on the Eastern Front. Yes, I do have some rule questions; there are either holes in the rules or in my head; I'm not sure which. 

There is a lot to learn, me bucko, so ye who are fearful of "fiddly" rules take notice. If you do not have the stomach for it, then go play your WWII:BtB and EE games; but that's all you will be doing is "playing a game." If you want to experience a fantastic historical simulation of the opening weeks of the Barbarossa Campaign, then gird your loins, sharpen your brains and quit your griping. 

"You get what you pay for" is true, not only in what you buy, but in what you invest, and if you are willing to invest the mental energy (along with some generous table space!), you will get a great return on your efforts.

Best game series on the Eastern Front!  Excellent game from rules to maps to counters.

RATING: 9
The "other" big operational WWII game (the other being OCS). This scores over OCS in a number of ways - the airpower system is a huge win in playability and general effectiveness over OCS, and the larger granularity of the supply rules achieves a lot of the same results without the fiddlyness. The replacement rules also work much better, with a more sensible step-loss and replacement rates; attrition and recovery feels more realistic. Trades off some tactical interest (artillery is covered much less well here than in OCS) for others (infiltration tactics are more interesting and accurately represented, and combined arms are more effectively portrayed). Also, the command and control difficulties the Soviets worked with are much more reasonably represented here. The ground movement/combat system is just slightly clunkier than OCS, but the overall game is of comparable complexity, with Barbarossa: AGN being overall slightly cleaner. This also is a huge win when talking about playable scenarios.

This system is awesome. It is deceptively playable, and the weather, supply, and especially command and air systems strike a terrific balance between realism and playability. The learning curve is shorter than the rules may make it appear to be. Highly recommended as a simulation of the East Front.

RATING: 8
8 scenarios, four of which use only one map, so if you don't want a monster ... don't play the monsters.

You've got the Axis amphibious assault on the Moonsund islands.

The first five days of Barbarossa in the North - unbelievably difficult for the Axis to win - you must play it to appreciate the insane risks they took to advance.

You've got a scenario that zooms the action in on Leningrad itself.

And my personal favorite (right now) Tikhvin.  The Soviets counterattack to relieve Leningrad.  A fantastic scenario that pits the exhausted Axis forces, trying to cut the city's lifeline from an exposed salient all while resisting the Soviets' probes elsewhere.  When the snow comes, and it will, will the Soviets be ready to get supply into the City of Lenin across frozen Lake Ladoga?  Supply that is need to continue there attack just as desperately as the starving city needs it.  

Both sides get to attack, while at the same time defending elsewhere.  A great contest, and a big weather change from the summer on the steppes.

Preorder the reprint, you will not regret it.

My comments on the series in general:

You have played plenty of East Front games. When was the last time you played an EF game and bought a book because of it? When was the last time you played an EF game and said, "I didn't know that happened!" ? When was the last time you felt you gained a real appreciation for what the commanders faced 65 years ago? The risks they took, the creativity, the tenacity they displayed.

When was the last time you learned something from an EF game?

I searched and searched for a game that would satisfy my fascination with this immense struggle, and I found Vance von Burries' East Front Series.

What EFS does very well is present a ruleset that can be used to play 5 games about Barbarossa, each with 5-8 scenarios. Where it out does it's rivals, like OCS, is that the scenarios need not be monsters. At least half are 1 or 2 map affairs with 100-400 counters. I'm going to call these "vignettes".

It is in these vignettes, these snapshots of the historic struggle that EFS shines. True, if you have access to a warehouse and months of free time you could play the whole of Barbarossa, but you don't have to be living that dream to experience the beauty that EFS has to offer.

Have you ever launched an amphibious invasion as the Axis in Barbarossa? In B:AGN you try to take the Moonsund islands in the Baltic Sea. And it's not a die roll, or a rule, or a unit picked up in Gdansk and placed on a hex on the Baltic coast ... it's an 11x17 map dominated by two islands with the scenario specific rules in a side bar.

Have you launched Barbarossa, encircled and eliminated all the Soviets on the map and lost the scenario all because you needed to pull off a very precise attack, run your panzer spearheads cross the map in the first three turns, totally out of supply, without any real hope of getting back into supply, and win a couple battles on the other map edge ... out of supply ... because that's what the Germans managed to do historically?

Have you experienced the qualitative difference between the Soviets defending in the North and the South, where the integration of armor and mobile infantry into cohesive mechanized divisions had already begun?

Have you tried to take Kiev without help from AGC? Have you tried to take Moscow in September '41? Have you tried to destroy AGC two month later? Have you tried to take Rostov with exhausted panzers and supply entering the map in wagons? Have you struggled to keep moving supply into besieged Leningrad across the frozen lake while managing a supply starved offensive, had the snows turn to mud, the ice thaw, losing a convoy to the lake, while watching your opponent's brilliant but desperate counterstroke sink into that same mud?

Have you seen B:AGC sell for $262 on eBay and understood why?


EFS has obviously touched a cord with me. And I have to believe it would with you as well. I've played a lot of EF games. For my money, the venerable Russian Campaign is difficult to beat as a simple strategic treatment of the war. And I would like to play Russian Front a few more times. But my quest led me to EFS and it would be a crime if you didn't try it for yourself.

Kiev to Rostov is in print, costs a reasonable price, and is a good introduction to the series. Personally, I'd prefer B:AGN as an entry point, but you'll have to preorder the reprint or get lucky on eBay. It is a loss to our hobby that so many titles in this series are out of print.

EFS isn't perfect, but to me the greatest weaknesses are its out of print status and that it has not yet grown to encompass scenarios from later in the struggle. But it's good thing to want more of a good thing right?

--------------------

I have docked the rating of all EFS titles a point due to their cumbersome, "old school" style rules.  I love the series, but the rules make it unnecessarily difficult to take the game off the shelf and convince my usual opponents or introduce newcomers to play.

In-depth operational study on the eastern front.  German Army Group North drives towards Russian capital in the north -- Lennigrad, a city next to Stalingrad that Hitler wanted badly.  Lenningrad is situated next to Lake Lagoda, a very diffcult terrain for the attackers (mostly marshlands) surrounding the city.  The simulation system is sound, with lots of counters and huge maps.  For all those WW2 eastern front fanatics.

Simply awesome. Yes, the maps layout for the campaign is awkward, but the scenarios are many, varied and very interesting. What I really like is the different treatment of the two armies, with a sequance of play that clearly show the dfference between them inleadership and command and control while still avoiding to fall in the myths and stereotypes of the genres.

This series is my favorite detailed operational treatment of Eastern Front.

Although the mechanisms seem daunting at first, they become ingrained pretty quickly. The only part I think doesn't work as smoothly is the supply, which can't make up its mind if it's trying to model actual supply or transport capacity. The earlier games in the series look quite dated compared to the most recent ones. Interesting to compare to OCS, which is at exactly the same scale. Very different games, and it's interesting where they place their focus.

Easily the best produced, most playable  and most accessable EFS game.  One of the most impressive game productions I have ever seen - 7 maps, 2 of which are half sized and backprinted.   New rules cover naval operations and a blow-up of Leningrad.  7 of the 9 scenarios use only one map, and most of these can be completed in an evening. 

Comparisons between this system and OCS and Europa require a much deeper treatment than space allows here, but the short version is that the Von Borries' games emphasize differences between the Russian and German command capabilities and have quick and simplified combat and supplies.  OCS emphasizes supplies and differences in troop quality.  Europa is all about engineers and building/destroying things, has an obsolete and unwieldy combat resolution and very little on supplies.  All are worth looking at but this system is by far the most accessable and best looking.

See my AGS comments. One of the best operational level games on WW2 battles. Also, a sterling example of great counters -- perfect use of color coding in the name of clarity. Maps are stunningly detailed.

Edit: Have been playing this quite a bit recently. Just so impressed on how battles play out. AGN and AGS are my favorites so far in the series, mainly because I find the situations depicted in those two the most interesting. It will be interesting to see how well the system handles situations where the Russians have the initiative, but I see no reason why it wouldn't do a good job. Kudos again, Mr. von Borries.

EFS system is most playable  of the larger Eastern Front simulation options. I like this over OCS, but both are great and carry a different feel in play but simulate operations  very well in distintive way. This one has slightly smaller table space and prep time demands than most in series, but is on less interesting (for me) topic than any other EFS system game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
EFS is THE system for old school wargaming of the Eastern front. Old school cause its a big monster with a lot of counter pushing, odd calculations and complicated supply rules. But, it is the best you can find out here, because this is a truly playable monster, and if you try one of many little to medium scenarios included it isn't a monster anymore too. Army Group North has a lot of rules added to deal with "water" units, a lower scale map on Leningrad where you fight almost block after block, and in general it is the most coloured game of the series, even if it is the most complicated too.

My favourite system on WW2 East front. Shows the relative capabilities of the opposing forces very well. AGN sees the Axis have huge initial gains, but can they make good progress once they reach the Luga Line?

Played a campaign. Good game, but this series suffers from minor, but frustrating, development problems. For example, having Estonian partisans is a bad thing for the Germans as it gives easy Mandated Attacks to the Soviets. Better refuse them. And why are there Dummy aircraft counters for both sides when only the Germans need them ??? I find defending the Dvina a bit too easy (in particular defending Riga), but I could be wrong. The naval rules are impossible to understand : even after reading the clarifications you're left wondering.

I'm one of those who just loves big huge games with lots of maps.  And I crave feeling immersed in the situation, the moreso the better.  I'm not a fan of extreme complexity though.  So I love this game!I can not fit all the maps for this one game on the table I play on, a large antique dining room table.  But I will eventually try to work it out some time so I can play the big scenario from this game.  Plus this combines with the other games in the series to create a unbelievably gargantuan game.  So far I just have North and South, but do plan on buying all the others as they come out.  And Vance does plan on not just doing the beginning of the war against the Soviets, but the entire war on the eastern front all the way through!The graphics of the maps are great too.  And it is terribly interesting seeing the eastern front at this scale.  The counter graphics are great too.The rules are not that complex, there is just a lot of them, but it is by no means overwhelming.  And once you have the basics down, it flows quite smoothlyPlaying it is a real joy, and I feel deeply immersed in it.  It really makes you feel the role of army group commander, forcing you to choreograph your forces, keeping your divisions together and planning well ahead.

GAME: Statis Pro Baseball
RANK: 2715
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a baseball simulation game - without dice though there is dice probability worked into the FAC (Fast Action Cards). It's an interesting idea but it didn't really grab me for a full season replay game. But it's very fun as a one off game or series play. Also, let's face it, it's a rather cheap implementation by the old Avalon Hill and not particularly attractive (like say PtP, APBA or even Strat). The Statis-Pro torch has been picked up by home brew gamers (using available AH card formulas) and they've created some better looking cards than the originals. I ended up selling my one season package ('89 or '90?) and picking up the Great Teams edition to replace it. Maybe I shouldn't have sold it as it now feels like a mini hole in my baseball game collection.

Ultimately these sports simulations are more of a spectator sport than a board game proper, but I still seem to thoroughly enjoy getting my hands in the clay more than I can watching the game on TV; picking the line-up and rolling some dice, or in the case of Statis Pro Baseball, flipping some cards ("fast action cards" generate random results and do most of the heavy lifting for the game). It can't offer the high level of interaction that a video game can, but sitting down at the table with your favorite team and the big green game board, charting the game on the scorecard, and rooting for a clutch play from your chosen hero of yesteryear just feels fantastic! When you want an analog baseball experience that doesn't involve getting grass stains on your jersey, you can't go wrong with Statis Pro.

RATING: 10
I know that this is not the most realistic simulation baseball game out there, but for me, it is the most fun simulation baseball game there is.  Of course, I am probably biased because I have played literally hundreds of games over the last 30 years.  I have every season that AH ever produced (1978-2002), as well as the Greatest Teams edition, inserts from the 1915 & 1955 World Series (and 1978 Japanese Series) from All-Star Replay.  In addition, I have the 1975 per-Avalon Hill version from Midwest Research Inc.

RATING: 8
I've found Statis Pro baseball to be a fast playing, engaging game that makes me interested in baseball from a statistical standpoint (which as I understand it _is_ what being interested in baseball is all about). My copy has the teams of 1983 (cue Flock of Seagulls) and I've been playing games with the Montreal Expos (which I figured were good but not dominant).

The game tells a decent narrative and produces plausible results. No small achievement when you realize it's not much more than a bunch of numbers on paper with two pages of rules. I am especially impressed in how easy the player cards are to understand. One quickly learns to be able to judge players. How likely they are to hit doubles, strike out, commit errors ... and the designer gives us the formulas right in the rules so that one can make cards for any player, in any season. I like the game enough that I'm considering acquiring cards for the 2014 teams so I can talk baseball with buddies who are fans.

It also plays well solitaire with the usual caveat that one makes the best decisions possible for each side. Given my limited understanding of the nuances of baseball strategy ... I play both sides equally poorly. Besides, much of the game is "turning the crank" once the positions are filled and the pitcher chosen. Much, but not all. Just as in the real game, the manager/player has important tactical decisions to make during the game and that makes the game much more engrossing than solitaire, 'storytelling' type games in my experience. 

Readers may recall that I frequently play wargames solitaire to 'study' a historic confrontation, to learn more than books can easily illustrate.  I'm finding this game does the same for baseball, and I will look for other members of the Statis Pro franchise for that same reason.

The cards are very easy to read, and read much like a scouting report of the player's season. When I was a kid, a player didn't have a good/bad season until I created the player's card with Statis-Pro so you could analyze the card and get an official answer.

My experience has been the BD ratings make doubles occur way too frequently. But get rid of the BD ratings and you have yourself an accurate game which has a lot of strategy decisions.

Pitchers dictate the game probably more than any other game on the market.

Growing up, I had Statis Pro Baseball, Basketball, and Football, but this one was by far the best of the three.  I loved updating the season statistics for my 1984 Tigers after each series.  I can probably still name almost everyone on that roster.  My buddy had Strat-o-Matic and I thought both games were absolutely thrilling at the time.  I preferred how pitchers were handled in Statis Pro, but Strat-o-Matic was a little more sophisticated in some other areas.

Great baseball game.  Spent many hours playing this game.  I still break it out every once in a while.  The one thing I love about this game over Strat is that the pitcher controls the game.  50% system Strat employs just doesn't get it for me.  

Played hundreds of games over 20 years.  I really like the new super advanced splits sets that you can buy online.  This is definitely the 3rd of 3 games I would have if stranded on an island and could only have 3 games.

I give this game the full '10' out of nostalgia.  I never kept a full season of stats, so I don't really now how accurate it is statisically, but the 'feel' was right.  It introduced me to sabermetrics.  When I later read Bill James, I could buy his arguments on the value of OBP partly because through statis pro, I found out how low OBP high SLG hitters weren't as effective as I would have thought.  Like early sabermetrics, the game bombs on defensive evaluation, though.

FACking awesome.

I think this game wins the award as the first game I actually purchased with my own money.  I suppose this makes it my first AH game as well. During my junior high years I was pretty baseball obsessed.  Being able to play any match up was pretty amazing.  Hours upon hours of games and 'fantasy' world series games played out.  I think I had the '87 teams. 

Update: I found my long lost box of '87 teams but the rest of the game is awol.

currently have 1978 (complete boxed game, less rules) and a set of 1987 season cards.

I would like to find more 80's seasons if anyone is trading.

RATING: 6.5
The basic design of this game--pitcher vs. batter--is really good, especially given the variable effectiveness ratings of pitchers and the fast-action card system. Where it comes up short for me is in the overly simple baserunning and defensive outcome charts. On the whole then, I don't rate this in the top flight of baseball games, like APBA, Replay, or Strat-O-Matic (of those that have a long history and are still being produced). I'd play it if I had extra time to do so, but prefer the above-mentioned games.

A fine baseball game for quick, yet realistic play. It needs some house rules for resting of pitchers to play a season or series correctly.

I have played nearly every table-top baseball game out there, and this one remains my favorite.  Not as in depth as Dynasty League (though well enough) and not as popular as Strat-O-Matic, this one has one edge over all others for me.  Statis Pro baseball is the only one that gives credence to the fact that pitchers control the game.  It is hard to hit off a good pitcher (especially if they are having a good day) and easy to hit off a bad one.  All the other games make it a 50-50 chance for control, which baseball certainly is not.  No other game has quite captured this important fact, and for me makes it the most realistic.  I&#039;ve loved this game for a long time now and plan on playing it into my golden years.

I have been playing wargames, but before that I was a statis pro fanatic.  Hundreds and hundreds of games.  I even replayed entire seasons for the national league, just compressed into 54 games instead of 162, with each player limited to 1/3 of his historical games played.  I also replayed an entire Pittsburgh Pirate season 3 times.  1980, 1987, 1992.  1992 was a division winner - but the team had already begun disassembling before that year (92 was Bonds last year in Pittsburgh).  In my replay things did not go as well as historically.  It made me appreciate the job Leyland did with that team more.

I agree whole heartedly with Eric Smith comments on the PB system.  Just like in real life when facing a dominating starter the offenses strategy would change.  The comment on pitcher fatigue needed - there is one.  I forget what it is called now, but each pitcher has a starter and reliever rating.  Each hit, walk, run reduces him.  When he is off the track you skip the PB and go right to the batters card.  I think this is realistic than some gradual lessening of skill.  In a real game the pitcher generally has his stuff till he hits a wall and then gets pummpled if he isn't pulled.

One of the better baseball board games, with explicit instructions on how to create your own player cards. Armed with the previous season's stats, you could conceivably create the entire American and National League rosters. Haven't played it in years, but a solid design nonetheless.

I played this game for years and loved it.  It tops all of the baseball sims
I have played for ease of play.  Also,
cards for fringe players were easy to
make accurately.  I feel that the stat-

The second-best of the Statis-Pro games (basketball!) is a quick play at about 20-minutes for a pitching duel. Offers plenty of decision-making and some great stats. Enjoy

This is the best board game of baseball I have played over the years----I have all the players for all the teams from 1901 to 2008(with a few exceptions);just think of it baseball fans playing any playoff(or season) that ever happen or any fantasy one that didn't;that spells baseball heaven to me.

Actually, I just had the first two Midwest Research versions of the game, which is quite different, actually, as the format was evolving. Sold on eBay. Have played the newer version. Think the pitching is too dominant.

My favorite game of all-time. Played this to death as a teenager with my best friends, drafting our own custom-built teams and playing out mini-seasons. Smooth-flowing game mechanics, enough strategy to suit my tastes, the ability to mix & match player cards to build your own fantasy teams, and relatively quick playing times (40-60 mins) make this a stellar game for the serious baseball fan.

Agree with all the comments here, especially the 50/50 criticisms. A game I played hundreds of times, for almost two years, with very little else featuring. I appreciate that it may not be the last word in accuracy, and it really, really needs a better pitcher fatigue system, but it suits me better than all the others. Apart from the niggles, a game of classic elegance that can create visions of the real thing. Notes: One perfect game: Len Barker of the '80 or '81 Indians (a 2-6 I think!?). One three homer game: Mike Schmidt, '80 Phillies.

Picked up at a local con auction for $1. Appears to be complete, but I need to inventory the cards to know for sure.

Update: After reading the rules, I decided to stick with Strat-o-matic. I gave it away to a friend who's a baseball fan and a gamer, but who doesn't like Strat.

I loved this game so much as a kid. It has too many shortcomings to make it a really good baseball simulator, but before computers it was a the best thing going.

Great game.  Played a lot of games of this in High School.  Somehow flipping a card with numbers made out for a great game and realistic results.  Helped a friend out with his made up league of fantasy players.  We played 1/2 of a regular season one summer.  Kept stats on paper (no PCs in the 70s).  He still has the stats and has played 3 more seasons.  I played best of series with my favorite teams against others.  I showed my kids the game one day and they noticed a  B. Bonds in the player cards.  They said look Barry Bonds.  Nope, Bobby Bonds.  MLB Showdown by Wizards is a similar type of game, except a 20 sided dice is used.

This is it. This was the bomb. We played this every day during the summer for years. We started with the 1978 season and kept playing up until 1986 (when we finally replaced it with Pursue the Pennant - the best baseball simulation ever!). But this was the game responsible for getting my brother and several friends completely hooked into baseball and statistics (and sports in general). Those were the good old days!

Looks to be complete and only played a couple times.  The score pad is practically complete and unused, the out charts are still attached to one another.  The board, rules and pawns are like-new too.  The player cards are for 1982.  Unfortunately, they were rubber banded and several of them have staining on them where the rubber disintegrated.  There do not appear to be any creased or damaged beyond what the rubber bands did.  The box is really in very good condition, with minor whitening and no rips, crushing or tears.

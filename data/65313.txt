[thing=35342][/thing] with plastic pieces and broken rules.

It does have enhancements over HtL, such as infantry squares & cavalry charges.  I love plastic, but the plastic in this game is cheap looking, looking more like [thing=23950][/thing] than [thing=88827][/thing].  I would rather have had Hold the Line counters, along with a mounted board.  This is just cheap quality at too much price, making it trade fodder.

The plastic also means you have to attach annoying counters to your stack of plastic to differentiate them -- like medals in Memoir 44, but more annoying.

The worst part is that it only has 4 scenarios, with a custom paper map for each.  They could have done so much more by taking the other games and combining them into one premium game.  A few rules tweaks and this could have been great.

Instead, Worthington went for the money grab and threw their reputation out the window, which is an acceptable trade-off for them: good for the immediate and bad for the long run.

Now, about those broken rules: my buddy and I played Ligny and each time, the Prussians won in a rout.  It wasn't hot dice rolling that won the day.  It was just a broken system.  The results are nothing close to historical.  The base AP does not reflect leadership discrepancy, and base 3 infantry are too few and now prone to a lucky roll.  Big disappointment.

There is an amount of fan-love for this game, as players have devised house rules to fix it.  I just didn't care to try them out.

I own a lot (and I mean [i]a lot[/i]) of Napoleonic games. This is the one that hits the table the most.

Up there with Columbia Games [i]Napoleon[/i]. And that's no small praise.

RATING: 4
Another mediocre and opportunistic game design in line with Memoir '44 style of games that doesn't portray anything and suffers from what it should be ... a proper game.

Nothing new here and a strange mix with plastic miniatures and counters.

Spend 2 CAPs to move your infantry next to your opponents. Then he shock attacks against you for the same 2 CAPs. Bye, bye, infantry.

A wargame that can be played in 60 minutes does not mean a good wargame!!

On the quest to find the "perfect" tactical Napoleonics game, this one is worth a visit. Perhaps a bit light for what I am looking for, and comparable to C&C Napoleonics, but the set up time and effort is HUGELY better in this one.

Played Ligny scenario; alot of fun.

Update (4/2012) - Played Waterloo with update rules (from The Gates of Moscow) and included Intermediate and Advanced rules.  New rules improve the game.  This scenario is very tactical.

Excellent condition, paid $35 for it new and it’s a very heavy game to ship, therefore hoping to trade it at WBC’s no-ship math trade.

This is a move & roll game. Very basic and old-fashioned. What period of warfare is this? The only nuance is that cavalry could charge (and limited infantry square reaction), but the system could easily be WW2 or Ancients.  The game is expensive and minis aren't my thing, therefore sold.

Napoleon's War is a simple game, but much more involved than I was expecting. This is not a problem, as it still plays swiftly and is nail-biting throughout. I confess I prefer Hold the Line, but I plan to buy every battle pack and expansion for Napoleon's War. I chose this game over Battles of Napoleon: The Eagle and the Lion and Commands & Colors: Napoleonics because Napoleon's War came from a proven system that I admire. It also helps that it is cheaper than Battles of Napoleon: The Eagle and the Lion, and has hit the shelves months before Commands & Colors: Napoleonics will. I'll certainly give Battles of Napoleon: The Eagle and the Lion and Commands & Colors: Napoleonics a chance, but Napoleon's War is something I bought on faith, and that faith has been affirmed. 

UPDATE: Worthington has seemingly abandoned this series so I sold it off.

I really like this series. I have all the battle packs and the Gates Of Moscow. This is a must have if you like the Sharpe's films. The system is based on the Hold The Line system with a few differences. This is a great way to teach Napoleonic history over a game board.

Excellent as is, but WG will be changing/adding just a bit in Vol. II so they say.  Surely the rating will go UP.
'Sphere' created a variant-great if you're looking for that kind of detail, but most owners of this game probably are not.  Do people actually think that WG didn't consider all these different variations before deciding upon this 'Clean' version.

Basic game is a quick, fun game. This could easily fill the role that the old SPI game Napoleon at Waterloo once did... an nice introductory game on the light side but not too much (Strike Force One was an awful idea -NAW was much better as an introductory game).

Simple and yet detailed enough to provide some good opportunities to try different tactics. I will be adding the intermidiate rules next game. After reading them over they appear to add a couple layers of depth without much complication.

Entry level game with miniature counters. Shipping cost hurts much! Very nice mapboards.  Miniatures on hexgrid...some break from the traditional wargames might be good.  Plus, it is about Waterloo.  But wait, I still have CC:Napoleonic not yet played.

07/06/13 Played the Ligny scenario.
I own Hold the Line, so most of this game was familiar. I am of two minds on the plastic figurines. They look nice (though the infantry's small bases mean they fall over easily), but when you have to then add a bunch of counters to them, why not just go all counters like Hold the Line? From glancing at the rules they look better than the Hold the Line rules (which are chock full of holes). The mapsheet was merely OK. The art work was good/clear, but physically its had some drawbacks (glare due to its shininess). I found it bizarre that the date of the battles appear nowhere on the set-up charts, in the rules, or on the box back, much less any description of the battles. I guess if you aren't already intimately familiar with Napoleon's 1815 campaign don't expect to learn any history from this game! I took a point off for that; to me that's an important aspect of any wargame. It's surprising as this comes from a company that put historical notes for each battle in Hold the Line. The play of the game is much like Hold the Line. I like it, so I was inclined to like this game. And... I did. My overall opinion could change when I play the other three scenarios. But I kinda doubt it.

Fun, simple Napoleonic battles system with plastic minis.  Lacks the added meta-game interest of the Commands & Colors system, because no cards, and is a little fussy with tracking action points instead, but moves along briskly.  Could use a bit more in the rules to add a stronger feel of Napoleonic tactics - BGG user Sphere has created a variant that adds this pretty successfully.  Looking forward to Vol. II.

A lighter weighted game in complexity. Some of the tactical options are thinly modeled (e.g. there is just not enough incentive to form square, adjacent targets may be ignored while distant targets are fired on instead, etc.) but this is easily modified and the game is well supported by the community with many excellent variant rules.

Fairly simple wargame. I'm not a fan of miniatures, which are somewhat cumbersome to manipulate and require the map hexes to be larger than they'd be with counters.

There are also too many annoying minor vague points in the rules, although overall the important points are mostly clear.

Not sure about this one so I'm  waiting for some reviews to come in.  One thing though, the plastic soldiers do nothing for me, makes the game look like a toy rather than a board-game.  Lastly, Napoleon's Triumph is so unbelievably good, that any other Napoleonic games will be judged by that standard.  Here's hoping there is something in this game.

RATING: 8
Same old system as Clash for a Continent and Hold the Line, with a couple of new bells and whistles (cavalry charges and skirmishers). Is it a better game than its earlier brethren? Not really, but it does have plastic figures (same as in Viktory II), and I'm a sucker for those. I've written my own [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/584081/spheres-rules-for-nappys-war]a set of variant rules[/url] which I think improve the game considerably.

Note: My rating is for play with my variant, which I won't play without in future. For the game as published, I'd drop the rating a point or two.

RATING: 7
Calvary rules and terrain reduction of NUMBER of dice (rather than "to hit" roll as in Hold the Line) increases number of possibilities, giving the game more depth and making it more fun.  Preliminary rating after 1 solo play.

Reasonably fast paced and simple Napoleonic wargame. Quality of components is excellent although the cardboard counters look a little out of place among the plastic pieces.  Rules could have done with a little more polish.  Overall a very decent game.

RATING: 7
Nice easy system to play. Maps are good with setup shown on them. The different unit types are different enough to create interesting battles.

Could include more battles and perhaps a little pricey. and is missing the perfect intro scenario.

Wavre and Waterloo are really fun battles to play.

Juego de la serie "Napoleón’s War", donde el Ejército Francés de Napoleón se enfrentará a sus enemigos entre los años 1976 y 1815. Este primer juego incluye 4 batallas: Quatre Bras, Ligny, Wavre y Waterloo. Las fichas son miniaturas de plástico de infantería, caballería y artillería.Buena impresión tras las primeras partidas. Reglas fáciles de aprender. Juego dinámico y vistoso.

Very good for a simple end war game. The Action Point system verses the cards for left right & middle in Battle Cry is a nice change when you get tired of a front drying up on you. Also, the Cavalry Charge can be devastating to infantry not in square or artillery left alone.

Simple and entertaining Napoleonics with game mechanics similar to their Hold the Line series.  Rules dispense with zones of control, facing, and other minutia to give an entry level wargame.  Fans of the Battle Cry and Vive L'Emperor will like the system.  Command point and dice driven.  Grognards wanting more detail should look to Eagle and the Lion or other GMT hex & chit games.

RATING: 5
Similar to Hold the Line and suffers from the same issues.  I don't mind light wargames, but I don't like the Worthington Games system.  Movement is so slow that maneuvering is not interesting.  Since you usually can only move or fire, if you move your infantry next to somebody, you are just letting them attack you first.  It usually just makes more sense to wait for somebody to move closer to you or just fire away with your artillery.  All of this leads to a dull game.

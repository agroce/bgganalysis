RATING: 8
This is a great little deck building game.  It plays fast with little down time and has a lot of ways to pull off interesting combos, which is a must-have feature of any good deck building game.  The pyramid is an interesting mechanism that helps blunt some of the luck of the draw that other deck builders that use a changing market can have because you won't usually be able to buy a card when it first appears.  It fits into a small box and has a fairly small table footprint, making it a highly transportable game.  My only concern is on how replayable it is since you go through the whole deck each game, but you can combine it with the original game, Valley of the Kings, to have a variable experience each time, so that option is there.  And it's an inexpensive game, so picking up both will not break the bank.

Bottom line, this is an excellent filler game.

Interesting deckbuilder with a "crumbling" pyramidal market and set-collection based scoring around an "entombment" mechanic: the biggest dilemma is to figure when to bury your cards for points, which damages your deck engine.

The game is simple and plays under one hour at 2-p, did not try at higher counts. A simple deckbuilder, but a great execution, with a very nice Egyptian theme (card art, flavor text, and the market and entombment mechanics).

This was a hit with the wife and is often requested at workday game nights.

Preliminary rating after two plays. This is a game that ports some tried and true mechanisms into a deckbuilder rather than throwing the baby out with he bathwater. 

I really like that the VP and currency are on every card since it gives you some decision space every turn instead of your hand dictating how you play it. I also really like the necessity of entombing cards to score them, as you are managing the flow of cards through your deck rather than simply shooting for some optimal setup that the available cards dictate. There also seems to be a decent amount of interaction, and not the "I put useless cards in your deck" nonsense. The set collection for scoring is very clever and you need to balance what cards you allow your opponents to access. Dividing the cards into tiers and the structure of the pyramid is an excellent way to curb the issues of a market row. 

After my miserable experience with Dominion (which is just atrociously bad) I thought I wouldn't like any deckbuilder ever, but this is playable. I don't think I'll ever love the genre but this is the only one I've looked at that holds any interest for me. 

Update: I don't like the scoring. Two player is "who got more blues?" and it's not particularly interesting.

RATING: 7
A deck-building game with a refreshing theme. The mechanic for the card pool is unique as well. The solitaire game does not disappoint and the end game can be tense. A great portable game that stands up against the competition in larger boxes.

Specific review of the "Afterlife" differences to other VotK games:

Let's start with the good. Afterlife is probably the best VotK iteration. If you're looking for just one version, buy this one. Having more sets (and not a Max-8 set) means more diversity in strategy. There are less "Gotcha!" mechanics, which I find to be abhorrent. Most of the effects are much more straightforward than other editions and the colors are brighter and more vibrant. The starter cards let you get away with a lot more interesting plays (at least the Urns and Shabtis). We keep them even when mixing sets. It's also draw-heavy and much faster in my experience.

Part of the review that's generic for all Valley of the Kings games:
While this is probably the best VotK game, all of these games share some serious problems (sans the Pink set problem for Last Rites). Firstly, the good of VotK games:
-Easy to teach
-Bright, pretty colors to keep non-gamers and stoners interested
-Satisfying to collect sets
-Great art
-Cool pyramid conveyor idea that makes your buys affect the opponent even more
-Neat scoring system (which has some problems)
-Egyptian history is (mostly) accurate
-Box has great linen feel

Bad things
-Greycore card stock that's thin and floppy. The linen and coating is nice but I'm so tired of card games getting a pass on shit-core cards just because you sleeve them.

-Inanely luck-driven. Moreso than other deckbuilders like Star Realms and Dominion. Mostly this is because many of the card effects work off of specific configuration (of the Pyramid/Hand/Tomb/Discard/Deck/Stock/Boneyard/Opponent) and if those configurations change even a tiny bit, you can easily be screwed out of a LOT of points (see: scoring problems). Something as simple as one bottomdeck in one turn can cost you 10% or more of your ending points.

-Scoring doesn't work like you want it to. It feels innovative until you realize that half-assing a Max-7 set is strictly better than completing a Max-4 set. Obviously, you want to max that 7, then work down the list (6, 5, etc) but you probably will never leave double digit scoring in a 4 player game. In a 2 player game, it's nearly impossible to stop you unless the opponent blocking your set also doesn't block their own set (which is both rare and luck based). Having scoring be based on squares means that the gap between each set color is +2 the GAP of the previous color: 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, (64 in Last Rites). So starting the Max-5 set is strictly better than the Max-4 set even if you never get the last card, since you can generally achieve it just as easily (or easier, See: Set problems)

-Set problem logic. Pink set is worthless. As the above criticism points out, there's no real case when Pink (Max-3) is better to attempt to start than Brown (Max-4). In fact, I typically get more points just scoring my Uniques which have static VP values. They can work in a 4 player game if there's heavy denial going around but completely fail in a 2P game. Also there's a huge problem with the LOGIC of the squared scoring on sets that have lower counts. It seems to make sense until you realize something...

...Low-numbered sets are HARDER to complete than middle sets such as Orange (Max-5) and Green (Max-6). This is because they are less frequently available. That means you're more likely to be able to buy and score 4 Blue (Max-7) or White (Max-8, last rites) than all four Browns. Having less of them means you have less room for failure, either due to the opponent(s) meddling or you simply failing to make numbers. Granted, the larger sets also have higher costs on the back half, you also tend to automatically ramp economy as you play though. In my extensive testing, it's equally hard to complete the Pink set (Max 3) as the Blue set (Max 7). The Green (Max 6) set seems to be the easiest difficulty-to-score value, being worth at most 36 points but having 1 card of wiggle room to miss. Again though, your job is just to pinpoint the highest max color and always buy uniques of it as much as possible, only denying an opponent when it would also benefit you. That strategy has led to a win every single game. Sometimes by only 2 points and sometimes by 36!

-VotK games are games of extreme calculation. It's actually incredibly annoying if you weren't looking for a Euro game in such a small package. I'm not sure who that's for: Euro gamers don't like the off-the-charts amount of randomness that totally fucks your gameplan and Ameritrash players don't enjoy re-calculating multiple stack levels of cause and effect chains as well as scoring implications every single time an opponent changes any aspect of the game ever. It also means there's a huge amount of analysis paralysis, especially as the game goes on even if you're a veteran, since no pyramid is universally solved. If you play this game without considering every possibility as soon as your turn starts (for something will always change, forcing recalculation) or you just "go with your gut" you will lose every game, by a considerable amount of VP.

-Like all VP games, has backwards winner determination where the winner is just whomever has the most points. In this game, winning by 1-2 VP feels like absolutely nothing. These sorts of games should make a tiered scoring system similar to Roll Player which helps players understand how well they're doing from game to game, fostering mastery and good sportsmanship.

OVERALL: I would say VotK: Afterlife is worth owning in your collection if you don't hate deckbuilders, like new and unique mechanics, and want something compact and cheap. It's not going to be a showstopper but it will continue to hit our table over time.

RATING: 9
A great follow up to the base game. Mr. Cleaver is a professor emeritus of electrical engineering, and that intelligence shines through in both of his designs. These games are small box (+), have a small footprint (+), scale very well from 2-4 players (+), and provide lots of interesting decisions (++). The game can easily be played at a bar, in fact I almost always have a copy on me because its so portable and people almost universally enjoy it. VOTK (and :A) are a sort of distillation of the deckbuilding genre. Because you are able to freely remove a card from your deck every turn, the decks stay small and very tight. Because you NEED to remove cards from your deck in order to score, you face a difficult decision of when to remove your useful cards to score them at the end of the game versus leaving them in your deck to drive your engine forward.

The changes from the base game involve cards with much more player interaction. The green set are weapons that have reactions (e.g. you can discard the sling to entomb a card when your opponent entombs a card) and offense actions. The purple non-set cards are much more powerful in this set, allowing you to entomb the top card of the set, take any card in exchange for one, and more. 

Just again, a great design and for $20 you really can't beat it. One of the games of gencon 2015 for me.

High 7.  A deckbuilder with an actually-compelling starter deck moves up several places in my book, and the only thing keeping this from being an 8 is the fact that I had no desire to add a copy to my collection due to the form factor - for some reason, I highly dislike tiny-box games on my shelves.

A deck builder that requires lots of thinking. If you've played Star Realms and think it's too streamlined, this one might be for you.

Cards are played normally to trigger their effects or else buried in your tomb until the end of the game. When the end of the game arrives, the winner is the player with the most points in their tomb.

I chose Afterlife instead of the original version of the game or Last Rites, the third version, based on the opinions of lots of other bgg users who say this is the best of the three.

RATING: 5
Generic deck building game.  If it wasn't in such a small box, I'd get rid of it.  As it is, the set collection, deck thinning to score aspect is interesting enough that I'd carry it with me and pull it out once in a while.

Probably still not a keeper, but I'll hold onto it for a little while.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Nice compact deck-building game, that have players interaction and that have an interesting twist in thinning the deck to score the cards (entombing).
++ The theme is well integrated with the mechanisms and the the setup.
++ There is a really nice sense of escalation, the first few rounds doing not much and only buying one card at a time, but, by the end of the game, we can completely take out almost every cards from the pyramid doing awesome combos, and entombing a lot of cards for a lot of points.
++ Just different enough from the original: same mechanisms so you don't have to learn a new game rules, but cards ability are surprisingly different and thus you must play differently. This version is more about taking or entombing cards out of the boneyard, and with targeted "attack" cards, though this one is a bit less confrontational (there are more positive interaction cards), but still very interactive. The game flow of this version is a bit more constant and fast.
++ Easy to teach, ultra-fast to set-up and fast to play.
++ A second game from the Valley of the Kings series that I love which will add more variability when combining sets.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- The first few games are rather long (60-75 min.) to get used to the card abilities (reading the cards), and this can make some new player back off from this game.
-- The replayability of a single VotK game is lower when played at the 2 players count and always against the same opponent (as it is my case) as part of the variability is how the players play the game and what strategy they try.

This was a fun drafting deckbuilder/set collection of a game.  You want to have more of certain types of cards to get more points, but they don't give you any points until you place them in your tomb (out of commission).  Once that happens you no longer have access to their special abilities, so there's a time mechanism involved to get the most cards/highest valued cards into your tomb by the end of the game.

RATING: 7
Less variety than Dominion, but smoother gameplay, and the Entombing mechanism for scoring feels wonderfully different. It seems all too easy to wait too long to start entombing things, which is a nice tension.

4p seems somewhat chaotic - like in Ascension, the vagaries of what's available when become almost pure chance, and the game ends after fewer turns/player, meaning rapid entombing seems to trump thoughtful deck construction. Enjoyed 3p, and suspect 2p would be excellent. Hoping to combine this with the original and try 4p team.

RATING: 8.5
Awesome deckbuilder with a lot of meat to its strategy, the Entomb mechanic has you constantly balanced on a knife blade of keeping cards around for their powerful effects or getting rid of them to thin your deck and gain VP. Small footprint and easy setup a plus.

Less engine-oriented than most Dominion-likes, Valley of the Kings retains the important aspects of the genre but adds its own unique twists (entombing, set scoring, and pyramid structure). The last turn comes quicker than you might expect, so getting set cards into your tomb consistently really matters. 

The portability of the game makes it much more viable than most of the alternatives, but the aesthetics could use some work.

RATING: 8
Valley of the Kings was my unsuspecting deck builder champion of 2014.  'Afterlife' could really be called a stand-alone expansion set.  The only thing keeping me from readily mixing the two sets is that it's a bit of a setup to integrate the two sets.  'Afterlife' feels heavily pushed towards having more multiplayer effects going on.  A lot of the cards have bonuses or considerations for your opponents.  It's nice to add that, but I almost felt it was too much at times!  As such, I think the two sets would be best integrated, and I'll put up with the separating and shuffling time to make this game the best of both worlds.  VotK continues to be one of the better deck builders and completely unassuming considering its small size.

Enjoyable deckbuilding, interesting mechanics and scoring, and good balancing make this game a hit for me. Lots of interesting decisions to be made and nothing ever seems quite clear-cut. This game overall is very unique, and a big game in a small box.

We've had issues playing it quickly, partly because of how unintuitive some of the cards are to use. However this lack of obvious use for most of the cards is also a big part of why I like it so much.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (February 2016)

Valley of the Kings is an ok game. I liked it enough for me to buy the next game in the series! Afterlife is also an ok game, because they are the same game :D, only with different cards. 

The rules are pretty easy to understand, you can teach it under 8 minutes. 

The art of the cards is very good and the theme is ok.

The problem with the previous game was that it took to long for what the game offered. I feel this edition solved the issue with many cards that allow you to take cards from the pyramid. In fact this game was so quick (compared to the previous edition) that I lost miserably (I didn’t entomb enough cards), and that is a huge plus for me, perhaps 2 players is the best configuration.

The decision to when to entomb your cards is what makes the game shine, it remains a tense question that players need to answer and it is also the best feature of the game.

The game has its fair share of luck and some effects allow you to take cards from the deck, adding to the luck factor. 

I really like you can combine both sets, enabling new combos. I would never play with 6 players.

Bottom line, Afterlife is an ok deck builder game, but in my last couple of games I realized I prefer to play Dominion over it so I’m getting rid of it. It is a better game than its parent game because it plays a lot faster but my desire to continue playing these Valley of the Kings games took a hard plunge.

RATING: 7.8
I really enjoyed this deckbuilder. It's a nice alternative to Dominion. It's less take-that than Dominion, for one thing. (This is a standalone-functional expansion, and I've read the base set is more aggressive.) It's got an interesting "collapsing pyramid" mechanism where you can manipulate certain cards to be accessible or inaccessible. It's also got an "entombing" mechanism, kind of like Vaulting in Glory to Rome, which is the (only, IIRC?) way you get victory points. BUT, the tricky strategy angle here is that the cards also have powers, and once you entomb them, you can't use them anymore. Really nice strategic tension. How long do you keep them in your deck, and when do you start entombing them?

For Egyptian history buffs, the art is really nice and there are little historical notes on the cards. 

We played 4-player, 2 newbies and 2 old-hands. Downtime was a bit much. I'd probably see this more as a 2-player game. Unless everyone knows the game and the cards really well.

I'm glad I tried this, and we've already bought a copy of this for my in-laws.

Beyond the theme (which I love - anything Egyptian is ok with me!) there is a LOT to consider with every play - not just a deck builder but a deck DE-constructor! "I want to buy a card, but if I do I'll have to get rid of it in order to score, but I want to use it in the future, but if I hold on to it too long I won't be able to score it..."!!!


Played with 2 and 4 - 2 preferred as there are more options.

Upon playing this, I realized that I probably have not played the base game enough to have an informed opinion on this set. It was fine, but I did not really understand what many of the cards meant in terms of overall strategy. I will revisit my rating if/when I gain that expertise.

Got it as a gift.  Thanks Yuki and Harris.  Generally I don't like deck building games.  But this game is actually pretty fun.  You try to add cards into your tomb that score you points based on set collection.  You can only tomb one card per turn, unless you have some special power on another card.  Some cards are just worth straight up points.  The cards all have a special power, so you have to decide if you want to tomb the card or use it for it's special power.

I was really afraid that the very strong incentive to entomb would make this feel more like a set collection game with you only keeping a couple cards to drive your engine, but while that is still the case in order to complete your sets you need to sometimes have clever card play with your hand due to e.g. the card being located in different parts of the pyramid, having different cost, etc, since you generally want to get pretty specific cards as only maybe a coupe will be of the colors you have a lot of. Speaking of clever card play I like that you can play cards either for their money or ability but not both. It makes for some actual decisions rather than immediately dumping everything onto the table for X currency.

I dislike that you use up the whole deck each game and I think that will really hurt replayability, although you may go for different cards simply because you have more of a certain color.

The game initially had only one card being removed from the pyramid/turn and that combined with the board state changing each turn causing reevaluation of plans and the large amount of card text made me worry that the game would long overstay its welcome. By mid game however multiple cards were being removed from the pyramid each turn. I do wish they had color coded the reaction cards though. There's enough text that if you meticulously make sure you don't miss something you'll slow down the game quite a bit, at least until you've played this game many times.

Interaction card interaction wise in this one is pretty similar to most deckbuilders I feel, except there are cards that can target specific people. There is also added interaction in hate drafting cards your opponents need for their sets. 

This is definitely not your most well designed deck builder (e.g. you can e.g. top deck some really synergistic cards from the supply from some card effects) but the urgent need to entomb cards preventing you from utilizing your strongest cards to your fullest while also not being such a stranglehold that you can't engine build at all makes this game I believe have a niche in the deckbuilding market.

This game has the worst solo variant I have ever played. A quarter of the card powers no longer work, and you can easily entomb your deck down to 5 cards, which allows you to spam one of several cards that allow you to entomb from the pyramid to win. Why even put it on the box if you're going to make it this bad?

EDIT: The new solo version by Vikhagen in the files section (edited by the designer Tom Cleaver) is much better, as while many of the interaction cards still no longer interact the dummy player is really easy to control and you have to worry about leaving cards you want exposed in a way that lets the dummy player have a good chance of taking it.

Played twice, 3-pl. I won a crushing victory in my first game by entombing a lot right from the start. There were a lot of cards with effects on them that I used one or even zero times before entombing them, and I understand that this is a key decision to make in the game, but it would have been fun to use the effects a little more.

This takes everything that was good about the original Valley of the Kings and turns it up to 11. This version is a little more free-form, meaning that you aren't as constricted by having to buy cards from the Pyramid. Here it's much more common to be grabbing cards and making combos out of the cards you have than be stuck trying to save up for that high cost card. For that, I think this improves over the original in a big way. The game is much more chaotic because of this, but the game's duration goes down noticeably as a result.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Unique deck builder. Relies more on the card's special ability combinations that just thier gold value used to purchase cards. It's more about combing specials at the right time to gain new cards for free. Also the idea of entombing cards from your deck for scoring at the end of the game by removing that card and it's ability for the rest of the game. Thought provoking, great art and theme, fun game mechanics. Easily worth the $15 I paid on Amazon!

Update 5/29/16: Best score yet! 106 points.

I like deck builders. Dominion is alright. Not only do I adore the theme with this game, but it really fits in that you need to decide when and what to entomb in order to score points, adding a really great dynamic to choosing when to keep using cards or when to "discard" them for points.
Compared to the 2 other versions, this features a lot of card manipulation and entomb effects.

Wicked-fast engine building in this one. Whereas the original game sometimes came to the end of the deck with both players struggling to complete their strategies, this deck finds players banging-out more and longer runs. A little more card-combo interaction than the original, but still a fast engine builder in the spirit of the original game. After half a dozen plays, it's my favorite of the three.

Such a smart, compact little deck builder. It helps to grab cards with great powers, yes, but if you don't entomb those cards in time, you won't get to score them.

A neat game with some interesting card flow strategic choices.  I find that the balance of the cards isn't quite good enough and the preview offered by the pyramid isn't quite big enough.  There is enough board control that you can easily luck into our out of an underpriced early game card with no chance for your opponent(s) to stop you, while you are (randomly) faced with a pyramid of underpowered cards.

The game starts to break down in 4 player games, although 4-player team games can be quite awesome!  A thicker deck for larger games would likely help.

I might rate this higher if 2-3 player games prove better, or if mixing with the base game carefully allows for better balance.

If I could have only one deck builder, any one of this series of games would be it by a long shot.  I love each installment equally and would highly recommend them to any fan of the genre.  The entomb mechanic in these games allows one to "evolve" one's deck constantly, in order to adapt to the changing game state.  Brilliant.  Could be considered "mean" in terms of types of player interactions involved but, in my opinion, any "mean-ness" in the game is not just pasted on in order to create some form of interaction between players.  Instead, it is carefully considered and implemented, serving to enhance the depth of the game.  Gets better as one learns the cards and becomes familiar with the interactions/combos.  Hard to believe how much "good" is packed in such a small box.

The original Valley of the Kings is [b]great[/b]. It really stands out from all of the other deckbuilders out there. But I think I like this one even better. The main improvement for me: there are fewer "attack the player of your choice" attack cards. Those cards were problematic and felt a little out of place, but this game has very few (if any at all) of those. The cards themselves are interesting, the gameplay is still smooth and straightforward. Right now I'm not even planning to mix this into the base game because it works so well on its own.

Really good game.

Absolutely love this game! It’s like a think-y version of Dominion. So far I’d say it’s our favourite deck builder.

The component quality was fantastic. We got some good chuckles out of the history written on every card.

About [thing=175223][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
A deck building game in which trashing (entombing) happens often, is free each turn, and is the whole gist of the game: it isn't a matter of if to trash, but how often, when to start and which cards to put on the tomb.

Timming about when to stop focusing on buying and using cards and shift strongly towards entombing is the key to winning.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
[thing=175223][/thing] uses a pyramid of cards, that works almost like a row of cards ([thing=69789][/thing]), but only the cards in the base of the pyramid are available for purchase, and the cards above "colapse" down once a card in the base is taken.

Cards can be used per its value, to purchase cards, or per its action. There is no limit to the number of actions to be used nor purchases, but values can't be combined to take more cards - value is completely paid for one card (without leftover remaining), before another can be taken.

 Each turn the player is allowed to entomb one card - but several others allow for extra entombing.

Once the game ends, unique cards will give their printed victory points value. Set cards (separated by color) give points accordingly to the number of different cards of them inside the set - the more cards, higher will be the value. Repeated cards in a set have no value and don't form new sets.

The player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- Which cards to buy;
- Which cards to use as action instead of value;
- Which cards to entomb and when to do it.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Smart and dynamic game;
- Good level of interaction (for a deck builder);
- Nice tidbits of historic information in each card;
- Varied effects in the cards, strong tree of interactions between them, and also allowing for a fine amount of replay value, even for a game that always use all the cards in the deck;
- Small, portable and the cards return to the box when sleeved.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Can have downtime issues when playing with 4 (but the historic bits help on this);
- Keeping the cards open in the tomb is a hassle when playing 2p and/or in small tables;
- Copious amounts of shuffling are required.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Learning that dying in a proper manner in Old Egypt is very competitive, more agressive then is good for the health (probably not an issue considering the situation) and sure have some weird needs to match items.

Overall, [thing=175223][/thing] delivers a fine experience, likely a tad too long (it would work better as a 30 minute game, but usually stays around 45-50), but the timming considerations and the shift from buying/using cards to entombing requires a lengthier game to delivers its full experience. Still, it can run into the problem of boring some players.

In the end, it works well as intended and [thing=175223][/thing] gets a recommendation.

My favorite deck construction game so far. Not as complex as some, but plenty of room for varying strategy. I love that I can play this in 30-45 minutes with 2-4 and it always works well.

At this time I can only comment on the solo play:

After playing the Master level of this game twice my view of it as a solo experience is that it plays like a puzzle solver, in the range of a medium-light sudoku.  As long as the player is willing to take their time and not do anything that would irrevocably burry a needed card there is no way to lose the game.  Valley of the Kings is not bad, and it will stretch your mind muscles at the level of an afternoon walk so playing it on a plane or at the park would even work (if that is your speed).  

I want to try Valley of the Kings with multiple players because it seems like having some competition for resources would add greatly to the variables and tension.  I like that it is a small footprint game that has elements of deck-building and set-building (much like 7 Wonders Science).  There are also a few elements made to grief opponent's but they are not numerous.  Over-all it has the qualities of a good game but I cannot recommend it to someone whose focus is primarily on a solo experience.

Valley of the Kings: Afterlife continues to build on everything that was great about Valley of the Kings. In fact I think this one is better. I can't wait to combine both together and try a 5-6 player game.

After first play: impressed. Gave more to think about than Dominion. 
Cool theme, but during the game that’s not very important.

After second play: appreciation grows. Really encourages to keep deck small with cards that amplify each other. That also means that we think quite a lot and the time to play reflects that, almost an hour.

Although this game only contains 96 cards, it strikes just the right chord for me in terms of depth. I relish the challenge of determining when the right time is to buy a card and, later on, calculating the benefits of keeping cards in your hand/discard pile versus entombing them. The crumbling of the pyramid at the end of each turn only adds to this excellent tension. At first, I was concerned that the duration of the game might be too long, but our first play took around 45 minutes, and it was quite enjoyable the entire time. I am pleased to have this game among our options for weeknight games.

Difficult to know which cards are best to buy. The deck building seems completely random with no way to build a deck synergy.  Having to then entomb (trash to score) cards from your deck in order to get points for them makes it even harder to build a good deck.

Best strategy seems to be to only buy cards in one or two colors regardless of their usefulness and then entomb those at every opportunity without ever using them.  Players who have a single color of card in their tomb at the end of the game seem to score more than double the points of players who have two or three colors.  With that strategy in mind, the entire game becomes pointless.

There is essentially zero player interaction in this set, but I would hate to see any "take-that" type interaction added to the game.  Having only 5 cards in hand already makes it difficult enough to buy good cards and entomb enough points.  Being forced to discard cards or add garbage to the deck would just make the game even less fun.

This is the perfect game for me. Small, Easy to explain, play, travel with and it is quite escalable. It has some good combos and it is engaging. The topic and the art is appealing for me, I love ancient history. It feels quite similar to 7 wonders and other card and tableau building games such as Port Royal and Dominion; or the more recent 7 wonders duel, so I am doubting to keep it. The problem is that is not language independent. For me even when it is in my native language, text in the cards slows down the pace of the game and commonly there are misunderstandings.

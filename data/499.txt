Okay as a dexterity game - got it for my kids, but they were underwhelmed at best :(Not the sort of game my usual adult gaming friends would play, so I don't see it getting played much. Shame really, should work quite well as a filler - and you can ramp the difficulty by how far you push the stem through the base.

** Update, now traded, so doubt I'll play this again

RATING: 6
I kind of like this one.   It's your typical "add something to the pile and try not to knock anything off" game, and it does the job fairly well.

The tricky part is setting up the base appropriately so that the game is neither too easy nor too hard.  We failed in both our attempts (one game was way too easy and the other one resulted in the tree falling over entirely).

Initial rating a 6.  Probably fun to bring out every now and then.

RATING: 5
Neatly themed dexterity game.  It's pretty cool seeing the tree grow as you play, but there's not much here to make it all that exciting.  The cards add enough structure to make an enjoyable game but overall, more of an activity than a game, as is the case with most dexterity games of this kind.

The main bummer is that the structure is just far too fragile, and falls apart at the slightest breath. It would be more interested if things held together better.

For something similar, but far more fun, check out Catch the Moon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An incredibly bizarre theme, but a neat game. Players put "branches" and leaves onto a wooden tree which seems to have a very unstable base. One piece often leads to the tree making a lazy lurch in one direction or another, and then dropping a branch, or two with all of the accompanying leaves clattering to the table. One nice thing is that the difficulty of the game can be augmented by having the tree set to "gentle spin" or cranking it up to "possessed by the vengeful spirit of Samuel Adams" by making it more top heavy.

I don't think this is anything special in the realm of dexterity games, but it does look fairly nice...at least the leaves do, and I would never object to playing it because it's so short.

RATING: 6.5
This is a really beautiful game that has amazing components.  Game-wise though, this isn't much different than other stacking or building dexterity games.  It's certainly not bad by any means, but it just seems like the game is form over function.  I like it, but I wish I could like it more.

RATING: 6
I have a bad history with balancing dexterity games. I dismissed Penguin Pile-Up without realizing that I had left the cardboard stabilizer under the iceberg that comes for shipping.  In Arbos I could not figure out how to adjust the difficulty and the first game was a piece of cake, just putting all of the pieces on.  

Only after a friend noticed how the game looks on the front cover of the box did I finally realize what they meant by adjusting the difficulty.  Now I can see the fun in the game and I like the challenge.  I like how the tree looks as it grows.

Still, the classic stacking game problem also exists here.  The best strategy is to come after the person that caused stuff to fall, as they will clear it up for you and you can go on to win.  Arbos is quick enough that it doesn't really matter, but I wish there was some way to combat this perennial problem.

LIKE:

* Entertaining Jenga-ish game which contains two shapes (branches and leaves).
* Base can be manipulate to cause the trunk/tree to roll around like crazy or be fairly firm standing straight up.  Your choice!
* Variety in game play as a deck of cards is included as well that can assign what you do on your turn.  More luck and randomness involved in this variant however.

DISLIKE:

* There are times where you can feel turn order will hurt you, particularly if people of different dexterity skills are mixed around the table.

Arbos is a variation on dexterity "tumbling" games. It's pretty to look at, immediately understandable and fun. The most thrilling part is when the tree rotates on its base (because of a simple added leave) but does not fall.

RATING: 5
This is a dexterity game in which players add pieces (branches and leaves) to a tree, whose base is designed to roll around when unbalanced.  I'm not a big fan of dexterity games, and this was a little frustrating for me, particularly because pieces seemed to fall off more often than stay on (perhaps an uneven playing surface was to blame here, though).  The cards completely removed all strategy from the game, as they sometimes skipped your turn entirely, sometimes made you sacrifice all your hard work and exchange your remaining pieces with others, and sometimes allowed you to force someone else to do something impossible.

Finally found a place in France that had a copy - www.ludibay.net .  So glad to have this.

Played it a few times..

It's either rediculously easy or frustratingly hard.

The 'trunk' and 'base' don't fit together well and slide around, making it necessary for me to find a fix that will correct this.  If I don't correct this, then the game's difficulty can't be increased b/c you can't set to play the tree on an angle.

Oh well, I'll have to fix it but I don't want to get rid of the game.  I think it's cool.

this is a beautiful looking dex game. the look of this game really helps to draw people into playing, even those who ordinarily don't care for games. the "lose your turn card" is lame and should be removed from the deck. the "pass trade your leaves with the player to your right" is borderline--it just depends on the number of players. removing it from the deck before hand really wouldn't hurt much.

Interesting idea in theory, but rather poor in execution.  (It should be noted that I have the original version without the additional cards).  Difficulty adjustment of the base is too finicky to be useful.  Bits are a bit too fragile, have broken a few leaves when branches fell.

RATING: 6
Beautiful, elegant dexterity game where players take it in turn to add either a branch or a leaf to the growing tree. If any fall off, that player picks them up. Difficulty scales with a clever two-part weighted base that can set the trunk at at an angle anywhere from 90 to about 45 degrees; the lower the angle, the more the tree is likely to spin or tumble.

In practice, it seems to usually be too easy or too hard. The most successful of these balancing games, like Animal Upon Animal, tend to hover more firmly in the zone of the possible but difficult.

Still, a fun diversion, and utterly gorgeous.

Not sure how much of a game there is with the cards. The cards can be very negative or very positive or somewhere in between.

After playing the first couple of times with the base flat, I decided there were too many ties.  Too bad I didn't notice that the base of the trunk is supposed to stick out the bottom.

Also, I made my own "cherries/apples" expansion to go with it.

RATING: 8
You build a tree with branches and leaves, but the level of difficulty is adjustable - the lower you stick the stem into the base, the more unstable the tree is. This is a winner, mostly because it's so esthetically pleasant. The rating is for my self-made expansion with apples (red painted wooden balls with a stick in). No, it's not bragging, but the tree looks so much better with some red in it, and the game's more taxing, too, as you have limited number of holes in which to place all the leaves and apples.

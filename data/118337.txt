RATING: 6.9
Juego muy euro, con interación escasa, y con 0 de azar. Tiene toques curiosos como mover las losetas de precio para especular y encarecer/abaratar terrenos. Muchas opciones al poder elegir entre muchas acciones, las cartas de profesiones le dan un toque diferente a cada turno, y las cartas de inventos complementan un buen juego para los amantes del no-azar, si bien intuyo que a la larga el juego tendrá una rejugabilidad escasa. Jugado a dos, ganará bastante con 3 o 4 jugadores. Buenos materiales y acabados, si bien podrían haber diferenciado algunos edificios más.

After all the bad things I had heard about Urbanization, and the horrible state of the rulebook, I wasn't expecting much; and was actually pleasantly surprised!

Great art and fairly well-themed for a Euro. A standard euro engine-building game, but with a few nice innovations. Contrary to what a lot of people have claimed, I don't think the inventions expansion breaks the game, or that there is anything in the game that you have no way of winning without.

I have a couple of minor complaints, though. The supply of buildings is way too low, and the VP gains that one makes are in such tiny increments (apart from those gained through population) that it's exceedingly difficult to determine one's overall strategy.

Urbanization has several drawbacks that make the game only a mild fun (being optimistic).  The game is quite unbalanced,  Inventions are too strong, so you really have to go for it or else you are out of the game. You can also play without it but I think the game will be even more boring since this game offers little to none random replay-ability and there aren't that many strategies to follow (although you can choose from 9 actions!). 
Summing up the best aspects and the negative ones: 
Negative: 
- game is unbalanced
- Technologies are too strong
- One clear strategie to win the game
- no random elements
- some character cards are too strong
- player with less points is too protected (even receives one point every turn!) 

Positive: 
- I liked the buy land concept. 

I played this game with 3 players, maybe it is better with 4 but... you try it because I won't!

We played the "Receive Work Orders" and "Attract Industry" rules incorrectly. After looking at the rule book, I'm not sure how an intelligent person could actually understand what was intended by reading the rules. It is so poorly written and graphically designed that it's almost unbelievable. I'm sure that was part of the problem for us, but it's hard to know if the game would have been more interesting with the right rules.  With 4 players, they may be real estate issues on the map for the 4th player.  Unless I have something else wrong (that I haven't already read about), I believe that this game is meant to be played by 3 people.

Terrible rules, as many have noted.

Seems like nothing but a point salad game which
goes as far as it can to obfuscate HOW to play
and what your goals are. The presumption with such
designs is that they don't have too much depth beyond
that early learning curve. Once the rules are learned
though, if you don't take trying to win seriously, it's
not too painful. Maybe just how much of a point salad
this is actually helps with that - I felt absolutely
no desire to try and figure out how to win because of
it - just tried to follow what makes 'sense' realistically
in a game with no basis in reality (I mean, what the hell
is that production system actually representing?).


I'm becoming more impressed with this, after soloing it.
An initial 'positive' reaction based upon playability
(due to too much memorization really :P) has moved to
seeing that the underlying model of the economy, being
so counter-intuitive, is actually providing for a (to me)
unique gaming experience. 

Not at ALL what I expected to come of a solo play - but 
that's why I do them, after all. Opposed playing takes
way more iterations to get any real grasp.

Update: rating fading fast. I might be done with it already. The graphic design is terrible. The game scales poorly (inventions that refer to specific factories, when many of them don't even exist in a 2p game). Lame catch up mechanic (players with fewest points each round gets a point!). Zero variation in setup. Decisions just aren't that interesting. I keep hoping that each new Queen big box game will be another Lancaster, but sadly that does not appear to be the case.

---

Couple plays in. Seems ok. The board isn't quite as interesting in practice as you might as expect from looking at a picture. There's not much relationship between locations, so it doesn't quite have the tension that maps typically do. It's basically a cube pusher, which is fine for me. It's got Puerto Rico style role selection each turn, but it doesn't create an action for all players. So I guess it's more like Vanuatu or Carson City. Interestingly, you can keep the role until used, meaning beyond the current round (I think -- need to confirm). The game both needs and suffers from the advanced rules. The game is just a little plain without the advanced rules (inventions), but at the same time the inventions require players to read all the cards and make a plan. This is exacerbated by the fact that there is zero randomness in the game, and zero variability in setup. Which ultimately I think is a problem for me. I've enjoyed my couple plays, and will probably get a couple more, but then I think it's the end of the line for this one.

 The game is a beautiful thing as are all of these newer Queen titles. The rules are well written and well organized. The game consists of microturns so you won't become bored waiting for your turn. Player interaction isn't prominent,  but that isn't always a bad feature in a game.

Urbanization is a typical average game for me. I don't mind playing it and kind of enjoy it to make the most of the few actions that I do have, but it just misses that makes it special. There's nothing here that makes me want to come back and I feel like I've seen all that the game has to offer. 
On a little side note: In one game, I was the only one going for the inventions. Let me put it this way: It was an easy win.

There were elements of Urbanization that I enjoyed, like selecting a role for the coming round, and the tech ups.  But the base activity was fairly boring, and the locations for cycling cubes were extremely samey.  Even the roles, after a while, became a simple math exercise - this guy saves me x and that one saves me y.  I also hated the light attacking of the moving coins.  It was just painful enough to ruin a plan, and just arbitrary enough to be spiteful.  Ugh.  I'd play again, but won't seek it out.

RATING: 5
Players are industrialists, developing land and earning victory points.  Players have 24 actions to buy land, farm and build upon it, acquire factories, attract and tax citizens.   Money is tight, and quickly reinvested.  Solid game from Queen, very tight and difficult to play well. It is not helped by the slightly opaque rules and unfriendly production choices.  Under the hood it's a solid, but rather dry and not-very-fun game.

I've played this game twice with two players.  I've been hoping to play with four before commenting, but it  hasn't gotten too much interest from my gaming group.  This was my first Kickstarter experience, and, to be transparent, wasn't especially positive, which made issues with the game even more vexing.

Pros
- game origins are way cool (Dire Straits song)
- fairly unique artwork
- Queen Games sent me some painted buildings even after I forgot they were supposed to
- game designer is active on the forums and seems cool

Cons
- rulebook is atrocious - not only is the rulebook confusing in spots (read the Forums on this site), but there are numerous spelling errors.  With the amount of time that I waited for this game, they could have at least taken the time to spell things correctly.    

- since anyone can attract industry (with an open spot), no one wants to place in the penultimate spot on the industry cards.  This may be more of a problem in the 2 player game.  This makes the industry boss card too powerful.  Each time I played this game, this really seemed like a drag.  I wonder if requiring a few $s to buy the 'attract industry' spot might improve this?  I've seen others discuss this issue on the Forums, but it doesn't come up that regularly, so maybe it would not be as much of an sticking point for you.

- Queen Games jacked Kickstarter buyers around by constantly moving out the ship date and acting rude to people who asked why.  

- the game just wasn't as fun as other worker placement games that I've played.  When deciding what to play, I would rarely choose this over related games in my collection.  It may end up being my first trade ever.

I played this one about 2 years ago and forgot to comment on it, so my memory is very hazy on it. The thing that sticks out in my mind the most is how ugly the board was compared to the cards. I just don't have time for games anymore if I actively dislike their graphic design. Beyond that, I don't remember anything about the gameplay being particularly interesting. I apologize that I don't have better comments for this game!

Urbanization is a fairly solid medium-complexity economic optimization game. I say "fairly" because, rather unexpectedly in something developed by Queen games, there are a couple of rough edges, starting with the much-lamented rules and not ending with the odd starting setup that punishes the last player from the get-go.

In fact, I'd go so far as to say the boardplay as a whole felt rather tacked-on and largely unnecessary. For a game called "Urbanization" it's somewhat disappointing if the city-building aspects are, let's say, underrepresented. You do need to build houses to increase your population but it never feels like you're actually developing a city, in part because the options presented are far too narrow for it to be meaningful, and in part because the stuff you do build doesn't actually interact with anything in the grand scheme of things. It just sits there and it doesn't even matter where "there" is.

Now, if the obvious kinks were worked out (and it looks like some of that may be happening with some post-release rules-massaging going on) this may be something I'd not be actively opposed to playing, but there is not much to be found here that you cannot find somewhere else, and with less of a feeling of being rushed out the door.

Die Rädchen im Spielgetriebe sind nicht neu und bedienen nicht die Erwartung, die man an die planerische Bandbreite eines Entwickluns- oder Zivilisationsspiel hat.

I found it interesting, but the other 3 players didn't at all. While talking about what happened in the game, I could see what they mean and I agree, it's bad design to me (and them).

We had one player not able to build a house, as all had been built already and noone had the intention or time to upgrade them.

Another player couldn't get any orange order, as all have been collected and since the building will reset and one will leave, it can (and did) happen, that those ppl couldn't even get rid of their orange orders.

Short: interesting, but some mechanics feel strange and not fitting the theme. All in all, feels heavily underdeveloped like "Lost Legends" which is from Queen Games, too.

JEM 19. szám: http://jemmagazin.hu/magazin/
A játékban a játékosok olyan gazdasági vezetőket alakítanak, akik saját városukat próbálják
felvirágoztatni, ehhez pedig az ipari forradalom kezdetétől a mai napig terjedő időszak találmányait (a gőzgéptől a dinamiton át a mikrochipig)is  felhasználhatják. Van egy nagyméretű játéktábla, ahol a központi részt az építési terület foglalja el. A
tábla többi részén a búzák tárolására szolgáló csűrök és mezők, valamint a gyártott termékeket szimbolizáló kockák és a gyárak helyezkednek el. A játéktábla fölé helyezzük el a találmánykártyákat. Minden játékos kap egy, a városát jelképező kisebb táblát, ahol a polgárok számát, a nyersanyagokat, a búzát és a megépített épületeket jelezzük. A játék 6 körig tart, és egy kör 3 fázisból áll, vagyis minden játékosnak 18 akciója
van a játék során. Az akciók végrehajtása előtt mindenki választ egy személykártyát, amely mind egy-egy akció végrehajtásához ad segítséget. 
»» Mérnök: Az építkezéseket olcsóbban lehet végrehajtani.
»» Ingatlanügynök: Építkezési területet lehet olcsóbban vásárolni.
»» Farmer: Nem csak építési területen, hanem a farmer kártyájára is lehet búzát vetni.
»» Művezető: ipari megrendelés esetén több terméket kapunk.
»» Iparmágnás: Az egyik legfontosabb karakter, mert a segítségével olyan gyárat is magunk elé rakhatunk, amelyeknél még van szabad megrendelés.
»» Molnár: Aki ezt választja, kap 2 búzát ingyen.
»» Tudós: Szintén fontos karakter, mert nem csak 1, hanem 2 találmánykártyát is meg lehet vele szerezni.
»» Adóbehajtó: Két adószedésre ad lehetőséget.
»» Vezérigazgató: A termékjelzőket fel lehet cserélni, azaz a megrendeléseket egyszerűbb teljesíteni.
»» Polgármester: Speciális eset, mert ezt nem választja senki. Minden körben az kapja meg, akinek éppen a legkevesebb győzelmi pontja van. Akié a polgármester,
kap 1 pontot, ő lesz a kezdőjátékos, és választhat egy másik személykártyát is.
Minden fázisnál 1 kártyát választunk, és amíg fel nem használjuk azt, nálunk marad, azaz akárhány személykártya
lehet nálunk. Használat után vissza kell rakni őket, és a következő kör elején újból választhatóak lesznek.
A személykártya választása után jön az akciók végrehajtása. Mindenki egy akciót választhat az alábbiak közül:
»» Területvásárlás: Mindenki kap egy kezdőterületet, majd ennél az akciónál az ezzel szomszédos területekből lehet egyet megvásárolni kifizetve a területen lévő árjelzők összegét. 
»» Épület építése: A házépítés 2 pénzbe kerül, és 1 pontot ér, de aztán fel lehet fejleszteni felhőkarcolóvá 3 pénzért, amely már 2 pontot ér. De építhetünk 3 pénzért irodaházat, amely 2 pontot ér, és ráadásul nem is kell külön építési terület hozzá. »» Gabonakereskedelem: Búzát vehetünk vagy adhatunk el a csűrökben jelzett árnak megfelelően..
»» Vetés: A megvásárolt búzát üres építési területre lehet elvetni, amely a kör végi aratásnál megduplázódik.Ha már búza van, akkor egyből gondolhatjuk, hogy ezek kellenek majd a polgáraink etetésénél.
»» Ipari megrendelés: A táblán lévő 3 gyár egyikére felhelyezett akciójelzőnk segítségével lényegében a megadott számú és színű nyersanyagot kapjuk meg, amit a termeléshez használhatunk. 
»» Iparág telepítése: Ha az összes megrendelés teljesítve van egy gyárkártyán, akkor azt az a játékos, aki akciójelzőjét ráteszi az utolsó, dollárral jelölt mezőre, elviheti. 
»» Termelés: Az előttünk lévő gyárakhoz tudjuk a szükséges termékeket leszállítani, amelyekért pénzt és győzelmi pontokat kapunk. 
»» Adószedés: Ezzel a játékos 1 dollárt kap.
»» Találmányok: Lehet játszani a találmányok nélkül is, de igazából ezekkel teljes a játék. Ilyenkor a játékosok egy akciójelzőjüket a találmánykártyákon mozgatják, és ahol megállnak, elvehetik az egyik találmányt. A találmányok különböző előnyöket adnak, például drágábban adhatjuk el termékeinket, többet termelnek gyáraink, több búzát vehetünk el, plusz nyersanyagokat kapunk stb. Ráadásul, ha a kártyához tartozó gyárat sikerül megszereznünk, akkor plusz pontokat kapunk a játék végén.
Minden fázis végén aratunk, azaz mindenki az elvetett búza után kap egy újabbat, majd a gyárak közül a legkisebb számú kikerül a játékból. Ezt követően mindenki beállítja a saját tábláján a polgárai számát. Ez a megépített házak, a meglévő búza és a megrendelések száma közül a legalacsonyabb értékkel egyenlő; majd mindenki ennyi győzelmi pontot kap. Ezt követően mindenki megeteti polgárait, ami nem okoz problémát, hiszen nem lehet kevesebb búzánk, mint ahány polgárunk van. Ha nem szeretnénk, hogy a következő körben a polgáraink száma (így a kapható győzelmi pontjaink száma) visszaessen, akkor a következő fázisban újra búzát kell szereznünk.

A játékban oda kell figyelni az egyenletes fejlődésre, mivel mindig a legkisebb teljesítményünk után kapunk győzelmi pontot,ugyanakkor az épületek száma korlátozott, ami ösztönöz a minél korábbi építkezésre. A gyárkártyák leépítése nagyon fontos, ezért mindenki árgus szemmel nézi, ki teljesíti az utolsó megrendelést, vagy kinek jut az iparmágnás segítsége.
Urbanization nem egy korszakalkotó játék. Sok mindent belezsúfoltak: vannak benne karakterkártyák, fejlesztéskártyák, épületek, termelés, vetés, aratás, etetés, adózás, de nincs benne semmi új mechanizmus. Egy korrektül összerakott darab azok részére, akik az európai típusú játékokat kedvelik.

It was a solid business decision by Queen Games to launch this via Kickstarter. Otherwise, Urbanization would have gotten stuck in the usual distribution chain as an average game in search for a target group. It's a no-luck medium complexity economical optimization game with rough edges that given Queen's normally competent development must have been caused by the Kickstarter-introduced urgency of getting it ready for delivery.
While I enjoyed my one play and would play it again, I wouldn't seek it out actively. I liked the variable player powers and the tight economy, but there are too many odd parts. The spatial play on the board introduces imbalances in player position from the get-go and is more annoying than interesting. The limited supply of buildings feels plugged-on as a mean to force players in differing strategies while in the end winning boils down to doing a little bit of everything. This by itself wouldn't be too bad as Agricola forces the players in the same direction but Urbanization doesn't offer much interplay variety as there are no randomizing factors at all that could increase replayablity to warrant a purchase.

I might play again but this is NOT a game I need to own.  This is about min/maxing and to some degree building an engine - especially when using inventions.  When you use inventions, be sure not to let one person dominate with the professor role over and over again as that person will have way too much of an advantage.  Money is fairly tight in this one which is something I usually like.  There might be some role advantages in the early game in this one - but having only one play under my belt I hesitate to say this with much gusto.  However, this isn't a game I plan to look for in order to play again as it left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth as I waited for other people to ponder their moves knowing I was toast for the last hour of the game.

This game just doesn't work. Perhaps like most other Euros, you are presented with multiple choices to achieve the things you want, but the decisions you make just aren't interesting. Buildings grant only point? selling and buying grains to gain a dollar or two? Mechanically and even thematically, the game has no appeal. 

This is the lowest rating I've given for a Euro game, despite my love for games of this genre.

I VERY MUCH wanted to like this game...  The concept and even some of the mechanics were good.... on the verge of great..... but just fell short....  Sure it's a typical worker placement game, but the game added the factories!!!  Except...  They rarely were captured or taken by any players because nobody wanted to bid on them for fear of not being able to actually obtain one....  And w/ the game only being 24 turns...  you could spend 6 or 8 turns trying to get a factory to no avail....

So, I'll play this one again, maybe, but I've played it twice and it just fell short for me.....

One of those games with extremely limited actions to do everything you want. This is not helped by the rulebook being a nightmare, missing many important clarifications and exemplars - it is by far the worst I've seen from Queen, who usually present rules very neatly. The theme is also somewhat thin - what exactly are these 'work orders' that all the industry revolves around?

However, if you can look past all that, there is a passable and luck free resource-conversion-and-balancing exercise here; the citizenship growth mechanic being the pick of the bunch.

I don't mind Queen using Kickstarter - but I damn well object to them gouging on the shipping price. $59 to the US or Germany, [u]an additional $40 shipping[/u] anywhere else?

It usually costs $30 to mail one of their games to Australia from the USA. So why an additional [b]$40 on top of the domestic shipping cost?[/b] Does [i]Urbanisation[/i] weigh 10kg? Are they wrapping it in vellum sealed with virgin's tears? 

Or are they ripping us off?

Quite interesting, has many different action choices per turn, but doesn't seem too fiddly. The biggest thing is to remember to collect VPs for each action. The inventions add interesting combo abilities with the factories and different strategies. Also the role drafting at the beginning of each round spices things up.

I can't believe the average rating of this game is only 6.6 (rating on 12/01/2013). Maybe people are expecting a civilization game, which it is not, it's a typical euro-game. But as always: if you're someone who plays regulary, please immediately add all the expansion modules, they really spice up the game!

Queen Games builded up some credit with games as Lancaster, Kingdom Builder and Edo and for me this game can be perfectly in that row. It has the same level of complexity as Lancaster. Clearly different paths to score points (which I always like). The rulebook could be a bit more clearer and the artwork won't blow your socks off (but does it ever with Queen Games?), but this is a more then decent game!

Takes longer than needed to explain the rules and the included player aides lack enough information, but the actual game you play is pretty good. Tight, interesting, maybe not ground breaking but a solid mid shelf euro.

Note: we play with the power grid style turn order rules played by most people, which is more satisfying than the included option.

This is a tough game to start.  One that needs some plays to get used to all the cards and the synergy between them.  There is absolutely no luck or randomness in the game so it is a real chess match.  The rules are a little confusing as i think there are some translation problems.  Kind of a city expanding, area control, resource management type game that is so open with the cards.  The theme might not translate completely but it's a true euro victory point compiler that is very slow and steady with points even though you'd think it would be fast with only 6 rounds.

I have still only ever played this once - my impression was that this was OK, but nothing special. We played without inventions - I imagine that the game will be much more interesting with them in, but I was told that apparently it is claimed that they break the game in some way. If so (and I have no way of knowing whether or not it is), it is definitely a worry for the game.

But we're never going to see if it gets any better, because we have sold the game since that one and only play. Neither my wife or I was interested in giving it another go.

Seems a bit complicated for what it ultimately is. Quite dry. Didn't play with the inventions expansion though (which comes with it) so maybe that will help. I did enjoy all the tough decisions, but when you're learning 9 different action types to choose from (some of which have 3 variants) was a lot to try to keep track of.. nevermind trying to figure out a strategy on the first play. Definitely want to play again though now that I have wrapped my head around it.

The game is fine, but seems to be missing something to make it more enjoyable.

The invention cards make for more interesting strategies.

Rated a 2 because it is a game, and 1 is reserved for completely broken games. Definitely longer than the 75 minute listed time, truly atrocious graphical presentation, bad rule book, an FAQ that doesn't include questions or answers, and it kept going downhill from there.

Downloading the BGG player aid and the official Queen rules elaboration/FAQ is a must.

Some really poor graphic design choices here. You have to assume their was some disconnect between the rules as intended and the way the graphics team set about to implement them. But once you understand what was intended, it's fine.

There are issues with remembering to score points correctly thanks to an awful player aid. I mean, you can figure it out, but how there isn't a big, bold graphic on the board telling you what exactly you get when you build a house, skyscraper or administration builing, or reminding you to score a point for an invention, or reminding you to score 2 points when you attract industry, I will never know.

After 2 plays, professor/inventor does seem overpowered, per the discussions in the forums. The most commonly suggested fix (always charge $1 to move even 1 [mandatory] space to the right on the invention track so long as there is a card in that space, but any space without cards are FREE) seems like a good one inasmuch as it makes inventions more costly for the track leader ($1 per space, period) AND allows people to catch up cheaply if the leader is "professoring". The designer's suggestion that the professor not allow 2 inventions but instead allow 3 free moves to the right might be worth looking at, too.

I'm concerned with limited replayability and very confused as to why all factories are in the stack for every game, rather than there being more than you need and some being randomly omitted. Ditto the inventions.

Curious to try a 2-player variant we thought of wherein both players can pick two roles (ABBA style, presumably). This would eliminate tightness, for sure, but perhaps increase the fun/feeling of building an empire.

It works, but it's a repetitive grind, with no real building going on - the only way you get anything new to do or improve the existing actions during the game is via inventions, which are very limited, factories, which you can only have 1-2 of at a time and which you can't always use, and one-shot characters. Very dull.

Hell, yeah!!  I love this game.  I'm not sure exactly why either, but it's great.  I guess it has elements of other games that I enjoy.  It's definitely a euro, but one that can also be enjoyed by casual gamers.

RATING: 8
After one play with the "inventions" included:  Tight but fun action allocation game with some minor role selection mechanics included similar to the way that Carson City includes them.  Doubt that the game could withstand repeated plays sans the inventions which add a good deal of strategy to an otherwise relatively simple mechanic.  Possible that the inventions are overly powerful in some situations.

On the negative side, rules are somewhat obtuse and the components omit critical gameplay information as referenced by some of the reviews.  It is almost required to have a FAQ here and to keep both (yes, for some reason there are two) rules manuals handy during play.

Definitely worth a play or two to see if it's up your alley in spite of its flaws.

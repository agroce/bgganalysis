Surprised to find a game here. Games made of popular cartoon characters are rarely even playable. But Batman is of a different breed. It works, which was a pleasant surprise. But is it fun? That is a completely different story. 

You'd expect to be sneaking around Gotham City fighting Batman in a fast paced and tense game. But no, that is not the case. Instead, you find yourself trying to fulfill all these intermediate goals of having X money, controlling X areas of the city. And the way you achieve those goals is not with ruthless use of gun and fist but by moving your henchmen to the area you happen to have a card for in your hand. 

In short, the game just does not do justice to its theme. There is very little action, and for an area control game of the cunning, it is not cunning enough. Playable though.

RATING: 4
Note: I am generally not a fan of area control games, but even so, this one does not seem like a good game.

+Unique take on the Batman theme and the different villains seem a little bit different thanks to their ability cards.
+Good production quality.

=Highly tactical game without much long-term strategy.

-Awful rulebook.  Perhaps the worst I've seen.  Completely disorganized and missing lots of key points.
-DO NOT play this with 2 players.
-Far overstays its welcome.  With 4 players, one game took us 3 hours.

I see why people say that there might have been something more to this game, which unfortunatly isnt. But its dripping with theme and wow this just has to be played more. If you roleplay your character and play this game fast, its for sure to recommend. Area control mixed with Ameritrash theme. Nice hybrid, though not for everyone.

An average family friendly game. Area control at its average, supported by a theme that is at least reasonably interesting.

Components are average, minis are slightly above average.

Gameplay is weak. With cards that both drive and limit the game system. Batman is an annoyance that adds to the flavor but actually extends the gaming time with minimal effect.

The limited way to win and the end game uselessness of Batman does make the game feel less thematic.

Overall, an average area control game with minis.

PROS:
Light game.  Captures the theme of the Batman comics from the villain's perspective a la area control.  Great box insert.

CONS:
Why is Killer Croc one of the 4 bosses?  Best with 3-4 players.  End game is lvl 10, so that can take a long time to reach.  To alleviate this, start game with everyone at lvl 3 or 4.

Nice production values, and a nicely themed game. It's also good that you can use the four character pieces and Batman in Heroclix, which is the main reason I shelled out for the game. The gameplay is simple and quite easy to pick up, which is a plus.

However, there are significant problems with the game mechanics. It's very easy to level up early game, and then very, very tough to do so at the end, which leads to the game dragging well beyond it's stated play time. Often, there's not very much you can actually do on your turn, and the tendency is to just sit where you are and harvest information tokens or money until you can attain that next level. Also, the characters you can play lack a little balance, with Joker being vicious, Killer Croc being okay, and Two-Face and Penguin lagging behind a little. 

All in all, a solid but uninspiring game that I only play very rarely. You can get fun out of it, but you need to be able to look past some significant shortcomings.

Originally I did not like this game at all, but recently I picked it off the shelf again and really enjoyed it!  There is a lot more strategy than I originally thought and each character really plays out differently.  There is still a tendency for the game to grind sometimes if everyone is blocking, but if people are actually trying to win rather than just not lose then it's great!

This is oozing with theme as you try and advance you villain with Batman foiling your plans. Batman is activated when you play a card with a Bat Signal on which feels like your villain is trying to divert Batman to the other enemies also trying to cause havoc in Gotham. I would love to see more characters in the game but for now it is a nice area control and resource management game in the Batman universe. 3 Plays

Area control game which has a lot in common with discworld - ankh morpork. You each have a distinct identity (in this case a villain). You are trying to control certain areas with your minions which give you benefits, and at the same time there are random events occurring to mess up your plans (in the form of Batman). I really enjoyed this game and would happily play again.

RATING: 7
First "learning game" took longer than expected - threat token rules had us a bit confused and consulting the rulebook quite a bit.  Can see the potential here, though.  Luck of the card draw certainly plays a factor - the first 3 Batman cards drawn all sent him to the Bat Cave (since the discard pile is shuffled back in when that card is drawn)!  My kids got a kick out of that, though, since Batman seemed to keep running away from a fight.
Edit:  Second game ran much more smoothly.  Finally cleared up confusion about the Penguin's bird token - it is NOT counted as one of the henchmen during a tiebreaker (confirmed by the game's designer in one of the threads).  This situation factored in to both of our games.
Fun game that integrates the theme very well!

Surprisingly involved given the theme. On first glance seems to be an area control game, but also has elements of economics, character development, and direct combat between players. However, takes WAY too long for what it is (4 players), can get repetitive, and the Batman doesn't seem to play a major role in a game named for the character. Victory condition of getting 10 levels seems a distant possibility with four players. Just ending the game after cards run out is a disappointment after hours of playing.

This game feels like it was made just for me.  It's a rich, heavily thematic area control game in which you get to play as a Batman villain.  And it caters to small groups of players, playing perfectly well with only two!  Being a huge fan of Batman villains, as well as not having a large gaming group to fall back on, Batman: Gotham City Strategy Game might as well be manna from heaven, so far as I'm concerned.  The more I play it, the more I dig it, and the villains can each be upgraded in such a way so as to play completely different from game to game.

Got as a gift. Tried playing it twice, but between the lengthy set up and convoluted rules, we never made it past the first turn either time.  Also, my vision is not good enough to easily read the numbers on the HeroClix figures, which is a bit of an annoyance considering the player characters and the Batman character were all those types of figures. Traded away.

Very slow to get going, especially if playing as Two-face or Penguin, but overall really nice game.

Batman is scary throughout the game and gets almost impossible to beat very quickly. 
Joker is very random as you would expect from his character. 
Penguin is very money resource orientated
Killer Croc is a beefcake and lots of his upgrades make him stronger when he is alone. 
Two-face is a little tweaky with lots of bit and pieces that subtly manipulate decks.

The area control mechanic is a bit strange as you can share areas, no offense but theme wise joker and penguin sharing doesn't seem quite right!

Rule book is awful and really needs a FAQ to come out quickly as I have so many questions especially regarding timings of various abilities.

RATING: 4
This is a very fun area control game with a great theme that really comes through... for 90% of the playing time. 

However once one player is near winning it usually comes to a screeching halt. Then the leader will stretch to achieve his win conditions and the others will use their turn to smack him back down. Which means standstill until all the cards are drawn at which point the leader wins anyway.

RATING: 2.5
Let me start saying that I'm not fond of the theme, as I really don't see the appeal in playing the villains in a Batman game. And I don't understand why they chose Killer Croc to be one of the villains, leaving out Cat Woman and the Riddler. But the gameplay didn't sound too bad and I gave it a try.

The simple rules should warrant a fast and dynamic game, but unfortunately the pace is ruined by the need to constantly read the cards. Every card has special power text - which could have been easily converted to icons, in most cases. The ultimate goal is to level up your villain to level 10, but this is irritatingly slow, and the game is more likely to end by running out of cards. My first (and hopefully last) game ended with no villain above level 6 and I can't see how anyone could attain level 10 with four players at the table.

The core mechanic is area control, which I generally enjoy. But here it's just too chaotic with the ease to place influence anywhere and to gain control by simply moving your villain into an area, not to mention the randomness of dice and take-that effects. The game is repetitive and quickly becomes a bore fest with the constant shifting of majorities and general lack of control.

The components are not very functional. The painted miniatures of villains and Batman are nice, but we also get minuscule henchmen figures, influence tokens that take too much space and the always annoying "Clix" bases that WizKids insists on including in every game they publish. At least this time there is a reference table on the players' screens - which emphasizes how unnecessary the "Clix" system is.

I enjoy everything about this game except the length.  I've seen a couple of suggestions to speed it up, but none of them have really clicked with me.  If the game were naturally shorter, this would get much more play time with my friends and family.  I really like that they spun the Batman theme on its head by making him an antagonist.  I would love to see expansions that add other villains to play.

RATING: 6
Quite Euro for a licensed game.  I really liked the concept--players are villains fighting with each other for control of Gotham. Sometimes Batman shows up and smacks you around a little bit, but most of the time he sulks in the Bat Cave, which I found quite amusing.  You are trying to accumulate various things which allow you to level up, so it's kind of like a series of quests.  Cards add variety.  Not bad. (2 plays)

Heroclix system is combined with area control mechnism. Because of Heroclix mechanic, the game is composed of nice looking figures. Those hero figures look pretty cool indeed. Besides the game components, the game mechanics are mainly based on area control. In my opinion, this area control game Gotham City is not smoothly working. The game has quite a lot of complicated rules and details. Because the game is full of rule details, players confront game downtime too much. For this reason, the rule details make the game so long that players easily spend on couple of hours for single game. I guess the game takes 2 hours for expert or about 3 hours for newbies. Sometimes, it is painful in spending couple of hours for playing the mediocre area control game. I am pretty sure a game which is decorated with complicated rules and heavy details is not always regarded as a good game at all. Of course, this game is good for Batman fans. However, the game has certain obstacles and limits to the others. Except the game theme, Batman Gotham City is just nothing but a strengthened complex rules details mass.

This is a mediocre area control game. Even with all the nice minis, the game has otherwise unremarkable bits. The game is really quite shallow, with only a single path to victory.

RATING: 4
This game should have been an easy hit. Bring up Batman's foes and let them loose on Gotham. What we get is a dry Euro-styled game that never feels anything like a Batman story or story-arc. With some small amount of luck, it's entirely possible for Batman to never leave his Batcave. All of the villains have the exact same goal. In a four player game, this will be nigh impossible to accomplish in any reasonable amount of game time. Instead of committing crimes, it feels like the villains are sitting around the city waiting for something to happen. This game does have good mechanics, for a politically themed game. Batman and his foes are not politicians so this feels like another mis-themed Euro that could have been so much better. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Don't be fooled by the photos of the figurines. They look nowhere as good. They're typical Heroclix fare: poorly sculpted and very poorly painted. So that's an immediate letdown upon opening the box.

The game itself is ok. The rules aren't very well organized, so it takes a while to actually understand how to play the game. When you do, you realize that it's just a pretty uninspired area control title. It is a sign of bad design when using cards in the game for a generic action which grants you two resources is a batter choice to make than actually using that card most of the time.

A really original take on the Batman universe that tasks players with taking on the role of one of the Dark Knight's iconic villains and fighting it out for control of Gotham.

Included is a set of Heroclix bases and cards so you can transfer the minis to that game too, a nice touch.

A two-player game of this is essentially a stalemate, a little too even to win. Of course, the 9-10 level transition is difficult to obtain regardless. Most likely, this one will come down to the last card. There's some neat stuff going on here.

Looks great as a 3+ player game, lots of interaction vying for power and control of the board, with a splattering of light strategy. Wasn't so great with 2 players so we had to let it go.

Some things about the rules were unclear, and the game outstayed its welcome a bit. Still, I love the theme, I enjoyed the game play, and would not say no to future games.

A stinker. 

The components (even the left handed flat cap midget henchman guy) and production values are very good but it in no way makes up for tedious gameplay.

Only one play I won that game and all I did in each turn was:

1. See if I could advance a level (usually no, but sometimes yes)
2. Play a card to try to get some sort of resource on the top bit and then, usually, take two of the tokens I needed for my next level up.
3. Consider moving my villain, but usually it wasn't worth the cost or effort.
4. Conclude my turn and watch the hours slip away.

My victory was due to me just sitting around most of the time collecting money or information tokens with occasional forays into the city to control areas.

And it was l-o-n-g. It took a very long time to do not much, time that could have been better spent playing something enjoyable.

Will not purchase under any conceivable circumstances and will avoid playing again.

A great theme, but somehow feels like a worse version of Risk with Euro mechanics. I've seen some consider this game broken, and it doesn't surprise me. This should have been developed a lot further. The fact that each villain is 95% the same is unforgivable. One of the most disappointing games I've ever come across.

The jury isn't in on this game yet. The general sentiment of my game group is that this is a fun game, but it did seem to have some problems with stalling out on player's ability to level and then feeling like it had overstayed it's welcome. Look forward to trying again and hoping there will be an expansion with new Villains that will offer more choices.

Running a criminal empire is hard when you have to compete not only against other criminal entrepreneurs but also The Batman. Each player controls a Batman villain with the goal of spreading their evil influence through out Gotham. The area control aspect of Gotham City Strategy Game is enjoyable and engaging, the leveling up of your villain helps the game ramp up, the game was fun. Where Gotham City lost me was at the end game. The game ends when a villain reaches level ten or the influence deck runs out. Both conditions are anti climatic with the first to 10 running into the stop the leader problem. While the deck running out just stales the game. A fun game with a bad ending.

A very simple 2-4 player area control game with a decently integrated Batman theme, except that you play as the villains!

Although the gameplay is straightforward and the rules are easy to learn, the game itself suffers from poor pacing (especially towards the end) and is far too long with more than 2 players.

Game has been sold.

This game had a lot of potential with possible expansions etc however I don't think the game was a financial success which leaves us with the current status quo. Enjoyable game better suited for 2-3 players [the board tends to become crowded when played with 4 players].

RATING: 7
In this game, players take on the role of competing supervillains trying to take control of Gotham City and "leveling up", while trying to fend off a largely game-controlled Batman.  Players rarely directly interact, but there is a ton of indirect interaction through area majority, and influencing where Batman will show up.  Each villain has his own special powers that helps with the thematic feel--different villains will play pretty differently.  The leveling system keeps the game ramping up over time, but the goals feel a little contrived.  This game is fairly straightforward, and is nice for people who wish their Eurogames had a little more Batman.

Play with a reduced deck to shorten game duration, we add cards later depending on how players feel.
Initial theme is light until players gain some additional abilities then the game takes flight and becomes grittier and more DC in feel. Four players is definitely a magic number from my experience

The take on the theme is fun, playing more like El Grande than like Heroclix. Individual turns are short, and the option to discard for two resources means you'll always be able to do something - it's just that clever use of cards will usually be better. Unfortunately, the flow of play is pretty much determined by the level structure, and that's always the same.

This game isn't terrible, but it has a lot of problems. Lots of rules, cards and tokens are unclear. We had to look up a lot on BGG. I feels like the game had never been blind playtested. The miniatures have those terrible click bases, which means there's information you need that's really hard for any player to see as it's in that tiny window on the click base. The game works out to sort of be this area majority game, where you do your best to line yourself up to "level up" by collecting however much of the thing you need, or by controlling a certain number of areas at the start of your turn. Every so often a batman card will come along and hinder your progress in a somewhat frustrating way. This mostly just serves to extend the game a little too long.

Surprisingly good. Primarily an area control game with multiple types of units and currency. Also has a bit of dicey combat. Characters can level and choose unique special powers. Very thematic. Batman does not have a huge direct impact but he is an ever present threat and does influence decisions. Always fun to watch him smack down an opponent. Play time is much longer than the box indicates.

5.23.17 - (2 plays, 4p) This had some similarities to Sons of Anarchy, but I thought this was more enjoyable. I like the components and artwork, like the leveling up and the Batman mechanisms, and the way the cards work each turn. I'd be happy to play this some more but I'm not sure if ultimately this will get enough plays to make it worth keeping. 
Also I would add that though the game is relatively thematic, it lacks a focused narrative and isn't particularly immersive. 9.10 - (4plays, 3-4p) The more I play this the more I like it. I'm really starting to enjoy this one.

 I want to like the game a bit more than I do. There is some really good stuff in this game. I love the theme, and how well the theme is extremely well implemented into the game.   I also really like how each of the villains feel differently and to best use their abilities need to play differently. I also really like how the different levels require different things. This means that players will have different focuses throughout the game. This game did have a couple of issues though that I think hold it back. First, it is really a four player game. Playing with less can be problematic. The deck controls the length of the game, and it does not change. This means in a 2 player game for example, each player has twice as many turns as in a four player game. Without modification, a two player game really runs the risk of becoming a stalemate when there are still 20+ cards left in the deck and both players are pointlessly trying to control seven territories. As a four player game it is much more balanced and a lot of fun, but the game can get stuck if to many players reach the control five territories level marker at the same time. I think I would have preferred it, if each player had the different conditions in a slightly different order (or slightly different level up conditions) so that players had a bit more breathing room. With four players this is a good game, it is a fun game, and it is an excellent Batman game. However, it falls short of being a great game.

The leveling system as the only mechanic for victory seems weak. It often seems like the strongest person doesn't win. Also, achieving the max level in a 4 player game is nigh on impossible. I spent one game ignoring everything that did not contribute to my advancing a level and I only got to 7. No one in my group has gotten past lvl 7 in a four player game. Haven't done two player. As far as area control games go, I much prefer Chaos in the Old World. The flavor of gods there is much more varied than the villains here, whose only differences are in level up powers, and some of those seem exceptionally weak. On the whole, fun with the right people, but would rather play other games.

It sits somewhere between Chaos in he old World and Ankh Morpork on the area majority complexity scale and closer to Ankh in its camp/caped knock about game play. And it solves the problem of who gets to play Batman.

However, in both 4 player games the game bogged down towards the end with players unable to get to 5 areas. Maybe better/easier with 3 or 2? (longer game/more cards per player, a little more space)

A lot of fun...and it felt very thematic.  It almost calls for role-playing the villains. I have only two complaints. 

1) We kept knocking over the tall screens. Screens half the size would have been fine, honestly.  

2) I think it's a bit long.  I'm tempted to play it next time with a reduced deck, so the game is about 2/3 the length. (2 hours instead of 3)

Holy playtesting, Batman! This game is another one of Wizkids' "sooooo close" products. The game system is solid and being a Batman villain a neat twist, but like Mr. Feeze this game will stop being fun before the game is done. It really needed some extra polish, a few more villains, and some endgame tweaks to make it something you want to play more than once or twice.

RATING: 5
Played with two, and it seems a bit "broken", since it's about impossible to reach level 10, so after a while it's just a lot of "take that" and hindering the opponent and waiting for the deck to run out. Possibly (hopefully) better with more players.

Edit: better with more, but still not really good. And way too long.

I like this one probably more than the game merits, probably due to the theme and slightly-retro quality of the art.

I like the system, but it can make for a chaotic experience, which is good, except the endgame can really drag b/c it's hard to satisfy the final winning condition.

Any future plays will include a couple designer approved variants: upgrade your villain at the end of the round and the ability to trade money for information at a 2:1 ratio (and vice versa). This should ensure the length of the game stays reasonable.

RATING: 6
I was on the fence about this game after the first play, but after the second play I think I'm firmly in the camp of, "I like it, but it has problems."

What I like: 

- THE THEME. Good gravy, does this game do a good job of marrying theme to gameplay. It's not just Batman pasted onto a game.

- The take-that mechanics between the villains fighting and forcing the Batman to attack one of your rivals.

- The leveling up to victory approach, as opposed to a generic point tracker.

What I don't like:

- The length. This game is WAY too long for what it is. Our second play took us three hours, even though I was intimately familiar with the rules. Just ignore that 60-90 minutes play time on the box. Ridiculous.

- It seems impossible to level up to 10 before the criminal plot deck runs out in a 4-player games. You will always attack your strongest rival and set them back one or two turns.

- Unbalanced villains. Penguin is clearly the worst, while Killer Croc is clearly the best.

- The rich get richer, the poor get poorer. It is very easy for one or two players to gain insurmountable leads on the other players, and very easy for someone to get totally screwed on their level objectives and get stuck spinning their wheels.

Overall, a great thematic game, but it needs some errata to make it more balanced and fast.

RATING: 6.7
Interesting game of area control.  Simple rules and fast play with a lot of "take that" and a good smattering of luck in the cards that come up.  Either reaching a "level up" of 10 or running out the card deck and having the highest level of villain wins you the game.  I found it hard to mitigate some of the luck of bad events but you do need to strike a fine balance of what cards to play, when to invoke Batman (through certain cards) and what to take in trying to level up.  The game favors attacking if you're equal or even slightly stronger as the attacker wins ties.

The game starts off great and then really drags by the time your villains hit level 4 or so.  I'm not sure I've seen anything quite like it.  There are a number of parts of a very good game here.  Too bad they couldn't make it work - tough break for DC.  First the DC deck builder than this - ouch.

I would like to qualify that I found this game immensely enjoyable.  Well, the first two hours were enjoyable.  As was the last 15 minutes.  But the hour and half between those times was a bit tedious to say the least.  This is the type of game that you quit early just to get it over with.

I do love playing villains, though.  The game has the potential to draw a lot of blood, some of it accidental, so make sure you know your gaming party!

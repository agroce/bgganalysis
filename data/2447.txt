The cool thing about this game is it has all the bad drugs: land, air, and naval combat.  I really like that!  I don&#039;t know how well it all works together.

Love this game.  The rules aren't terribly complex, but the game is LOOONG.  Probably 4-5 hours of play, minimum, just to get you to the Axis high water mark.  

Love the naval combat rules, which allow for fast, intense play and a lot of fun.

RATING: N/A
played the heck out of this in the '90s (along with A3R). The HQ activation system is a nice touch. Air and naval rules seemed a bit overly detailed, though, (air interception in mid-flight during weeks-long turns?) for what should be more of a "ground" game. The map sometimes gives the impression that somebody left a pile of Skittles on a hot sidewalk.
Moved on to Totaler Krieg!.....

(2007-10-31) This is NOT the same as the SPI game of the same name.  TSR got the rights to the name and designed a totally different and FAR better game on this topic.  They had two editions, the second edition being somewhat better than the first.  I used to own both TSR editions, though I've sold the 1st edition.

With the possible exception of the strategic warfare rules, the mechanics for land, sea and air warfare are well written and fast playing despite the size of the rulebook -- I find it's the time players take to figure out what to do that takes the time as there is a LOT to consider with each turn.  The examples of play in the second edition are very good.

The best feature of the game is the tie in between economic potential and the need to prepare for offensives.  You don't just build tanks and send them to the front, but instead must plan ahead as to your level of effort and expend points to supply this effort.  The greater the investment, the greater your activity level during the turn.  The land combat is sequenced not by "you move and shoot then I move and shoot", but by activation of those offensives you pre-purchased, with each offensive localized to a area determined by your leadership potential in that area.  A very nice touch.

A relatively manageable corps-level WWII grand strategy game. Although naval units are included the main thrust of strategy revolves around land combat.

All chits punched but only played once. The two poster maps have clear packing tape at the corners and pinholes from pinning them to a big sheet of cardboard to keep them flat for play. All components are present including the plastic tray. Box top is a bit curved and corners are worn but not bad for being over 25 years old.

I played this (2nd ed) a lot, especially during summer holidays, about 15 years ago. Too bad I neither have time or geeky friends to put it on the table again.
Land, air, naval combat and economic aspects of the war. Includes scenarios of all sizes and a detailed example of play. Map and counters might be a little spartan compared with todays standards. May be combined with the WWII PTO for the full war. A remake is made by Decision games (Advanced European Theater of Operations). Highly recommended playing the campaign with at least three players.

RATING: 9
My favourite game throughout the 1990s.  Lots of rules, but simple and effective mechanics - plays smoothly with plenty of player interaction and little down time.  The naval and air systems are brilliantly done, with no CRTs, realistic results and loads of flavour.  Knocks WiF into a cocked hat.

Best strategic game on WWII in the european theatre. Rules were a bit confusing, so we went through a lot of arguments during our 3-4 games played too many years ago. I have also played twice WIF and believe WWII ETO to be much better overall. i wonder if advanced ETO is a real improvement over this gem

Nice grand strategic game on the europen portion of WWII.

I like how Air and Naval forces are portrayed and the offensive mechanichs. The game reward advanced planning and combined arms approach at stretegic level.
Yet I think that in some situation the game turn are too slow to recreate actual operations (especially France 1940 campaing and Barbarossa). In addition the lack of a diplomatic system allow the Axis to ignore Balkans (no coup in Jugosalvia forcing the opening of that front). 

But in the end it's a nice and well thougt game.

My favorite of all the WWII ETO Strategic level games that I own (7 total).  It has the detail, economic choices, and ease of play that I desire.  Components are excellent and a major step up from the first SPI edition.

I own and have tried to get interested in the latest version (AETO) but there's too much chrome, errata, and though I appreciate the effort, the counters are just too busy and hard on the eyes for my taste.  I do like the maps though.

I've played this once (with its Pacific twin). Even though we won big time (Italians raced to capture Astrahan before the Japanese) I found the came inferior to "World in Flames". Even though it has more detail than WiF (less land per hex) its gameplay is not as fun and the naval system in WiF is much better at simulating the uncertainty of naval forces in large sea areas.

My ALL TIME FAVORITE game.  Best game out there for a balance of playability (rules not overwhelming) and realistic recast of the war.  Far, far better than Advance Third Reich.

After many unsuccessful attempts, I was able to finish this game during my college years so it holds a special place in my heart. :)

I thought this was a very good game. A few points: lots of decisions to make, many of opportunities to get different outcomes, rules that are not too difficult to grasp, etc.

A few downs for me was the game time. Yes, I knew it would be long but... Also, the counters are plain and ugly, effective, yes, but ugly nonetheless.

I would recommend for a medium complexity WWII - Europe Grand Strategy game. Thank you for listening. :D

Strategic corps/army level game of WWII in Europe. It's all here; land, air, and sea, production, a dash of politics. Rules are moderately complex - far from overwhelming. The maps look very good, the counters are okay, nothing special. Turns are seasonal and it seems like a hour is about right for a full turn. Playable in a weekend, and can mate up with WWII: PTO for real masochists.

This was a huge game for us when it was released. Loved it. Bought Advanced ETO and the Pacific version too. 1992 we were lucky enough to start a campaign game in 1939 and we decided then that we would stop playing at the historical point of May 1945. Berlin surrounded, my Russian opponent had to roll high on a d6 to win the game; which he did. A game we have never forgotten.

One of the Best WWII ETO games out there.  Solid mechanics.  Air, naval and land all fit together well without overly complicated rules.  Much more realistic (and cost effective) than WiF.

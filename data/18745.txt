Fast 2 player game, you have to keep track of cards that are getting discarded in order to anticipate wht the opponet might have left. I like the idea of turning the situation upside down even in the last turn...that's if you kept just the right cards :). I rate it 8 even if i got beaten on both my 2 first games.

Guess and out guess each other to victory.

Not a bad 2 player game. Done in less than an hour even for AP prone gamers.

The balance in cards are somewhat randomized in the beginning to provide possible variations to each gameplay. But to play leader cards successfully proves to be difficult. 

Nevertheless, it plays simple with only minor rules lack, that is easily house ruled. (The +1, +2 thingi)

Good intro to newbies wanting to try confrontational games.

I have the old Dynasties version. Great 2-player, card-based area control game! Simple mechanics, very straightforward! Some of the bits placement spots are a bit odd (where do I put the marker that indicates if I had placed a 6 bid in the region already?). The base cards (for bids 1-6) have a mixture of thematic quotes or special abilities - I'd prefer a clearer distinction between the two, as they are hard to tell apart at a glance (maybe make quotes italics?). 

The rulebook could have been more clearly written as there were several points that were vague and poorly organized - it wasn't into half-way through the first game that I realized that +2 and +3 cards were for the expert version.

The large and small markers are strange - since they seem to be the same size. Also, the fact that they are the same color as the player colors threw us off, since they really belong to a player. 

My copy is also a tiny bit sticky (like the glues and waxes or something melted). But I did get a fantastic trade for it and it's a hard-to-find game, so that's got to count for something in my books. If they ever reissued this game with improvements, I'd be all over it!

2015 UPDATE: Not needed and flawed components. And I now have my eye on the reprint!

Beautiful, beautiful game, both in game-play and in the art of the cards and minis. Much, much strategic depth!

Although it has similarities to games like Battle Line and Twilight Struggle, the best way I can describe it is as a weird cross-pollination of Chess and Poker...Poker where most of your cards can be reused! One of the few area-control games I've played where all the areas are contested every turn. And so short that you can easily get a couple of games in over the course of an hour!

Pretty good for what it is, a Works game :) The card choices make it interesting as you need to plan ahead for each province, when to let it go and when to use the marginal +1 cards.

RATING: 6
Give both players essentially the same set of cards, each card having a different numerical value which determines strength in battle, and some, with special effects.  Give them a board with a number of provinces to battle over, and ask them to secretly place one card from their hand in front of them for each province.  Depending upon the numerical values of the cards, and the effects of certain cards, the results of the battle are determined. Try to guess what the opposing player is going to play before you choose your card. 

This game should be more fun than I found it.  For me, it was meh.  Predicting which cards your opponent is going to play is, I guess, only moderately fun for me.  Oh look, I guessed correctly...or wrong!  Yes! Darn!  Next round.

RATING: 6
{3 plays} A very interesting 2-player El Grande (though it wasn't designed to be).  I'd rate it higher, but it's kinda all double, triple think (with some luck thrown in) and not enough "strategy" for me... though there certainly is some there.  Hmm... I guess what I mean is, and this is a little odd, but I wanted it to either be a bit heavier or more fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice "small" two-player game.  Some of your plays will be educated guesses, some of them will be deduced, but they all will matter. You'll need to manage your cards wisely, and try to keep the right ones until the bitter end -- or, you can try for a nearly insurmountable lead at either of the first two scoring rounds.

RATING: 6
fairly low production values including cheap and oddly-sized cards, a warped board, and not-so-hot rules.  it looks like they'll replace warped boards from what i've read.  anyway, i read a bit about the basic mechanics and i figured i'd like it.  i did.  it's nice to have a quick-playing majority game.  it seems that the random scoring tiles are unnecessary, i'd just make it static.  doesn't feel like lotr:tc.  if you've played twilight struggle, elements of it actually feel like that.  don't read too much into that statement though!  i'm a big fan of variable player powers, and i was bummed out that the white deck seems to have clearly worse shoguns.  it's still fun without them.  it does seem too easy to take a lead and hold it with special cards though.  update: all but eclipsed by aton.

RATING: 6
Area control games are rarely 2-player games and so when one comes around - it deserves a look.  This is one such title and it actually delivers on its promise.  The shifting values of the regions serves to bring the variation into the game that usually comes from multiple players.  This results in a tight game where players will shift positions up until the end.  Nice 2 player game.

RATING: 7
Sun Tzu is a quite straightforward design for two players: it features a scoring based on the controlling of the five regions, with a timing similar to El Grande (points are scored after 3rd, 6th and 9th round).

The core mechanic is simultaneous selection of cards, with the number of pieces added (or removed) from a region depending on the difference between the cards played by the players.

What adds a great deal of depth to the game is the "one shot" cards: as soon as the players start to understand what is at stake, the guessing and outguessing begins to shine.

A very enjoyable filler for two.

Plays well, good strategy.  After several plays, it's starting to be fun.  An area majority game that works quite well for two.

Both the original board and the replacement that the publisher kindly sent are quite warped.  The cards are relatively thin, and they're an unusual size.  Artwork is uninspiring.

RATING: 7
Sun Tzu is a simple yet deep (and, what’s more important, fun) game: strategy is preeminent but luckily the game isn’t all about strategy, as it rewards those players as well who dare to take some risks and choose the right time to do it.

The short time it needs to be played makes it the perfect two-player light game, just above a filler.

So much fun in this game! I really like it. Can be very, very frustrating tough :) rules are not very difficult but strategy is. If You're playing with strong opponent it can be very tough to win this battle. If You like negative interaction and a lot decisions to make this game is MUST HAVE! 

Game is for 2 players only ;)

After three games, I think this is quite a wonderful little game. For a simultaneous action selection game, there is a lot of depth, but it still has enough luck to appeal to many non-gamers. The changing values of the provinces (and the variable set-up) make for very interesting strategic options over the course of the nine dynasties. The fact that you work through your deck through the course of the game means that the sides are balanced over the long-term, just differently capable over any short period. It was interesting to note that the designer declared the discards to be open. My kind of rule.

Dynasties is a simple game of bluffing and cunning, with some true strategy mixed in. The rules and gameplay are very simple. The components are pleasant. The theme of the game works, at least for me. It plays quickly. A fun 2p filler. Its not in the same class as LOTR:tC, but its in that general genre. I doubt I would go out of my way to buy it, but I wouldn't turn down a game if an opponent suggested it.

RATING: 4
Dynasties feels a lot like an area influence based reworking of LotR:TC without the theme, balance, and turn to turn excitement. Both players have identical decks of cards which they use to contest regions on the board, which are varied in value from game to game, and scoring round to scoring round. The game is played in 9 rounds, and the players each simultaneously select one card from their hand for each of the 5 regions on the board. The cards are then compared and the person with the higher number card puts that many armies down in the province or removes that many of the opponent's pieces from that area if that opponent was already established there. 

The cardplay is good on some levels and bad on others. The bad is that players always have access to a simple yellow set of cards ranging from 1 to 6 in value. These are obviously not that exciting, so the designer threw in the white cards, which each player has a limited supply of, and which are much more powerful than the yellows. The thing is that the white cards are only played once and then gone, while the yellows keep coming back to one's hand. The play stays somewhat fresh and unpredictable from turn to turn because of these constantly rotating "white" cards which feature such things as plagues and "+1" cards which will beat any number that an opponent plays by 1, but the quintuple region select and reveal process makes the game feel pretty random in comparison to LotR:TC's more dramatic single character duels.

So why does this game score a 4? Simply put, I didn't find myself overly impressed by the sum effect of it, and I think it has a potential balance issue. Firstly, as I said, this game feels derivative of LotR:TC due to the importance of the card play, but it doesn't add anything interesting on top of that game which I already have gotten a lot of mileage out of. The multiple region blind selection adds more randomness to an already dangerously random 2 player filler IMO. 

Secondly, and much worse IMO, Dynasties also seems to reward a strong initial push followed by a nasty defence a little too much, as it is much, much easier to hold onto an area than to break into it because of the way the special cards work and interact with each other.

I will say that the victory point mechanism idea in this (no set points, the players just volley back and forth on a track, and if one scores enough a sudden victory can occur) is neat, but the rest of the game felt like it was lacking something.

It's not bad, but it lacks coherency and some x-factor that makes me want to play it more than a few times.  It's a fairly interesting abstract wargame with hand management, second-guessing, and some suprising tricks.  There's definitely nothing else quite like this for only two players.  It almost seems like a mini-Wallenstein at best but it seems like it could have been better.  Questionable rules and crude artwork further detract from the package but in sum it's a respectable, worthwhile game.

Can a game be too balanced? Since you can only play cards in 5 spots, you are usually losing in one to gain armies in another spot. The trick is guessing what your opponent will do so you can play the powerful one time use cards to gain the upper hand. The problem is, I think you can place cards randomly and have about the same chance of winning as when you think long and hard about whether to use a 1-6 card. You have to be lucky to put down the board wipe cards or the +/- cards at the right spot.

This is a pretty tight little area control game with plenty of positional strategy, bluff, hand management and tactical cardplay.  Gauging when to cut your losses or make an overwhelming push to claim a region is key.  With good cardplay it is possible to hold a region against several rounds of vicious attack or to tie your opponent's armies up in a region, so your strategy must be swift and decisive.  Scores can swing to either side, so forward-thinking is a must.  This is among my favorite 2 player games.  Lunch Hour Game of the Week 03/13-03/18

Gameplay involves both players secretly deploying cards to each of 5 map areas, then simultaneously revealing them, area by area.  A comparison of the cards, mostly showing simple army strength numbers but some with special abilities, decides the result in each area.  There are plenty of opportunities for tricky moves and gotcha moments.  The game runs 9 turns, with scoring rounds after turns 3, 6, and 9.  Point values for each area, which vary with each scoring round, are randomly determined at the start of the game, which helps replay value.

The components are of decent quality and rather small (not a bad thing at all -- minimal table space is required for play, and the box is wonderfully tiny), although the board tends to warp a bit. The artwork is very nice and adds to the thematic flavor.

Don't let the reputation of many other titles from this publisher fool you.  This one is well worth checking out.

Game Box Monthly sent this game my way at the end of November 2015.  The games artwork was remarkable which made me fell like I should be more delicate than usual.  I didn't understand all the rules at first, but after bringing the game to play at a friend's place, we immediately fell in love with the game.  He's probably already subscribed to Game Box by now.

Thanks!  My only negative comment is the point turners won't fit properly.  I may glue it together but other than that the game is great.

Excellent two player area control game - basically, this is streamlined El Grande for two players.  And it really works, combining hand management with area control plus trying to outwit your opponent by deploying armies in the areas she least expects it.  The simultaneous card selection is sometimes a bit unpredictable, though.

Area control game where players try to place units in areas by playing cards with various abilities/strength levels simultaneously...the card playing mechanism reminded me of Caesar and Cleopatra. I'm lukewarm on Caesar and Cleopatra. I love this game... must be the different card types and the more tangible map/area control theme. 

Have not tried the expert version... only quibble with the game so far is that the board when unfolded is not quite flat.

Well its not complex nor indepth. Its not really much of anything to be honest, we didn't even finish the game.:shake:

Area control aspect is present but you dont have much control, however adding armies is a very simple, (very very very simple) difference between two cards played, and honestly doing that 5 times a round is more than enough let alone 5 times per round over 9 rounds. 
Its uninspired and frankly deathly boring.:snore:

Blind bidding/ bluffing is not really there, random card placement would probably work just as well, indeed both players felt the game really played itself.

The score indicator triangle things are pretty novel but frankly they do not hold together and tend to fall apart during play and thus would probably have been better served being simple stackable tokens

ESSENTIAL game. One of the best 2 player games I've played.

Dynasties appears to be a game that will only shine once the opponents gain some familiarity.  Although the game is simple to learn, it may take a couple plays to understand what's at stake, and begin to approach the outguessing element more intelligently.  If the game earns enough table time to reach that point, then my rating should rise by a point or two.  But I suspect that won't happen, so I'm rating Dynasties according to my current enjoyment of the game after one-and-a-half plays.

Decent tug-of-war area control for two players, but it's another of those games where they play cards face-down to various areas and reveal them simultaneously.

Finally broke this out and played 10 or so games this weekend (10 March, 2013) and really enjoyed it- it's a fairly simplistic math game ultimately, which means that I was already pretty good at it out of the box- definitely a game that highly favors intelligence, probably even more than the ability to guess what your opponent is going to do.

A solid 2 player game- haven't played with the warlord cards yet, but they look like they would throw off the balance in ways that I'm not particularly happy with.

Edited rating- Not a ton of replayability- an okay filler to bring out and play with new people.

This is an interesting one. At first, it looks strange (not bad, only strange). Cheap looking miniatures and other components. But then I grew to like the art style of the game. And the actual game is a really good 2-player area control game with simple yet working mechanics. Gameplay is brisk and things are constantly changing. If you're looking war-themed area control game for two players that doesn't take too much of your time and is really easy to learn and teach, this is probably for you. Perhaps not for true hobbyists because it's too casual for that.

RATING: 7
Dynasties is an interesting little hand management game, with area-control, verging towards an abstract game.

Two players with similar decks, and only minor variation of powers even in the 'advanced' game, try to control 5 areas of ancient China, at the end of three scoring rounds, with each scoring round having two preceding rounds.

Limited units, limited cards, only minor variation between hands, but the thing that makes this more interesting is the tug of war score, like that of Twilight Struggle.

Over the course of the game, given equal opportunities, players should be roughly equal, but if the rope gets to one end of the scoring, then the game ends, so it's critical not to give up big scoring ops, but also not to let the other player get too far in front.

It's Sun Tzu vs. King Shao in a battle to dominate China in 9 dynasties! (The low mein must be *really* good if these guys can go at it for that long.

This game is really just about blind bidding and I think that's just a mechanic I'm not overly fond of. Blind bid, blind bid, blind bid, score. Repeat three times. That's it.

The wide variation between card strengths (1 to 10) and number of provinces feels like it makes it too easy to create a decisive force in a "surprise attack" and then just milk until it scoring happens.

I much prefer Aton, another 2-player game that makes blind bidding more interesting by having the bids mean different things.

I do the web design for JRG and I got to play the first printed copy. This is a great 2 player game, with minimal amount of luck. Both players have the same deck of cards. What makes this game interesting is that you can attempt to win before the end game. If you fail, you will be in a very dangerous position next turn as the opposing player will have a great chance to overcome what you tried to accomplish.

Excellent 2p area control game. Mechanically simple (only four small pages of rules) but a lot of fun as you try to outguess your opponent's moves.

The varying victory points for each area works well, as does the mix of relatively weak reusable cards and powerful single-use cards. 

Very attractive presentation in the Sun Tzu edition although the score pieces benefit from a drop of superglue in assembly to stop them coming apart again.

Sun Tzu is an engaging game with a variety of decisions to make. The framework of the game blends planning, execution, and timing together elegantly. A clever opponent will provide misdirection and surprises along the way, adding to the tension and enjoyment. Quality art and components make for an impressive visual presentation. Of the many area control games I have played, Sun Tzu ranks among the best.

I remember Dynasties drawing a lot of comparisons to another two-player majority game, Aton. I enjoy Aton quite a bit, so I was hoping to enjoy Dynasties similarly. In Dynasties, you have a basic set of cards valued 1-6 and a deck of cards with more powerful values or special actions. You blind bid cards to five regions on the board, compare the cards to what your opponent played in those regions, and add or remove cubes. Repeat 9 times, scoring every 3 turns, and try to have the majority of the points by game's end. The most interesting aspect is manipulating your opponent's cube count. By getting them to over-commit to a region, they can be left with fewer cubes to put elsewhere. Otherwise, the game is very basic. A little too basic for my tastes. "Variant" and "Expert" cards simply add another layer of uncertainty and don't improve the game in my opinion. The variety in the game is contained in the cards, which puts a heavy weight on the importance of the blind bid.

In Aton, the variation rests not with the cards, but with the possible actions and the various ways of gaining majorities and points. This reduces the focus on the blind bid and makes the game a much better strategic exercise. There's really no comparison in my book.

In the 'light medium' game play category, this area of control game is a 2 player favorite in my household.  I prefer to play this game with my spouse or someone I know very well.  Since players choose and reveal their army deployments simultaneously, the game is most enjoyable when you understand how your opponent thinks and can predict his deployments.  The person who can do that more often wins.  In the instances where I predict incorrectly, I use the information to inform the next prediction.  In this way, game plays encourage more game plays.  Due to the game's dependence on understanding your opponent, I find playing against a casual acquaintance or stranger unsatisfying.  In my opinion, this is a great game for spouses and/or best friends.

A decent enough 2-player with a little of Condottiere and Schotten-Totten in the process followed by el Grande-ish scoring. Better with the advanced rules and cards than without.

I know it has nought-all effect on play, but I wish the map provinces were those actually in play during some period of Chinese dynastic history rather than the whole vast thing, endless deserts, untoppable mountains and all.

After a video review: Simple abstract game. Combat feels like Dune Express, Card play like LOTR confrontation. 

It's a game where you need to guess the moves of your opponents by placing cards in 5 different regions of the board before they are resolved. Player with the most troops there will score points. Play for 9 round, or until you score a certain number of points. Scoring goes back and forth like 7 wonders Duel Warfare track.

Very simple, very abstract, interesting mechanic wise, but not sure I actually like this.

A solid two player area control game (lackluster art aside) with wonderful opportunities for bluffing and outguessing one's opponent. Compared with other two player games I really enjoy, I’d rank this one right up there with 2 de Mayo, The Duke and Omen as it seems to hit similar high points for creative play, tension and pure enjoyment.

Tries to be a 2-player El Grande but fails. I liked the black/white bits as they look cool on the mostly yellow board. Other components, however, didn't fair as well. The board was very warped, which the forums indicate is a common problem. (UPDATE: new board received from publisher!)

As for the game itself, score after every third round... markers on the board indicate how much each each region is worth after the 1st-3rd rounds... etc. Sounds very El Grande like. My problems are two-fold. First, the rules do not clearly identify which cards to use for beginner, advanced, and expert games. The beginner game doesn't use leader cards or  2,  3 cards. This is only stated in the expert/advanced rules, which makes setup more difficult. My second issue is the repetition get a bit old. The game is basically blind-bidding on areas. Players simultaneous choose values (which is good as this speeds things up), then revel cards. So we have this basic sequence, play cards (five times), reveal and subtract (five times), repeat both of these for 9 turns. This gives a grand total of 45 blind bids with 45 subtractions. Needless to say, it gets a bit old.

If the game had moved away from El Grande, it might have been better. Six turns with scoring after every even turn would have sped things up nicely and reduced the repetition, at least somewhat.

Traded.

RATING: 6
This game just didn't have enough spice or meat to it.  For some reason, the reveal of the cards didn't feel that exciting to us---it was more, oh, okay, you played a 5 there and I put a 3.  The first round feels a little random since there's nothing on the board.  However, once you have armies on the board, it feels a little too easy to play defensively and keep control of the provinces through judicious use of the +/- or plague cards.  Perhaps we just know each other very well, but there weren't really that many cards or provinces so we could predict what the other person was going to play.  There also weren't enough "special action" cards to keep things more interesting---it was purely a numbers game.  I guess we just don't really like bluffing games, especially with just two players.  The shortness of the game was also another factor that worked against it, as we didn't feel like it lasted long enough to develop a long term strategy.

This is a simple area majority/control game where you play cards face down in each province.  The card with the higher strength gets that different in terms of armies in a province.  You repeat this process three times and score.  Whoever has control gets points for that province.  There are three scoring rounds so that 9 turns in the game.  The value of each province changes through the game.  Some of your cards disappear after use.  

I really like the game. It is a light almost filler type game.  The Matagot version has nice components however some of the miniatures have long spears and axes and will bend.

A solid game.

A game that I got second handed together with Golden Ages and its expansion, at a ridiculously cheap price. This is the first game I played among these buy.
A very fun and quick cardgame, which is very suitable for casual players (like my wife). We played 4 games in a row and still not tired of it. The strategy may not be deep as it mainly resolves around double guessing you opponents, but it is a nice addition to my collection (which mainly consists of heavy games).
1 point to note is that the map is wrong. Sun Tzu exists during the Spring-Autumn period and the location names are incorrect. And did Sun Tzu fight against the Emperor of Chu? Why I can't find it in my Chinese history textbook?

A little gem! Small box, but with a quality board inside and some decent cards & wooden components. A game of bluffing & doublethink, plus good area-majority scoring (rare in a 2-player game, right?). Coming from Jolly Roger, there are the regrettable uncertainties in the rules, so be sure to get the designer's own answers thread printed out  from BGG and put it in the box, too. The basic game works great, the expert rules add just a tiny bit more (good), but I haven't cared for the special character powers. You can pick & choose which elements you'd like in your game. I'm going to have to cover this one in a podcast--more people should know about it.

I like the idea of the bluffing design of this and the game looks quite pretty, but it felt "off" when I played; like there's too many guys and special cards available so you don't need to really conserve them, which defeats the point of the game. I can see how this might improve if you play the same opponent repeatedly, but that's not a situation that fits me.

FUN: if you read the rules, you might think this game is very abstract or only about doublethink, but it's not. There are many opportunities for clever plays and I cannot see myself tiring of this game as quickly as I usually do with microgames.

UNIQUE: usually, the rule is: "Concise, deep, thematic. Pick two", but this game manages an almost perfect balance between all three aspects.

NEGATIVES: because it manages an almost perfect balance between being concise, deep and thematic, it excels at none of these elements and this will turn some people off.

Sun Tzu is a fun, two player, area control game that uses cards in a fashion similar to the card game "War".  Players simultaneously select cards with various point totals, or special abilities.  They place them face down on five areas along the board designated to represent the five provinces of China being fought over.  Cards are then revealed and compared to each other.  Like "War", whomever played the highest numbered card wins.  They then place armies numbering the difference between the two cards in the corresponding province.  Special ability cards trump number cards.

There are a maximum of nine rounds of play, and scoring takes place after every third round.  If a player manages to bring the scoring marker all the way over to their side after round 3, or 6 they immediately win the game.

I really enjoy the out-guessing your opponent aspect of the game.  You have a hand of cards, and you're constantly trying to best guess which cards to play, to what provinces, and when.

There are a few mechanisms built into the game to keep it different from one play to the next.  For example, there are five warlord cards per player.  They provide a special action.  At the start of the game players choose one each, which can be played once during the game.

It's a really interesting, fun, and easy to play game.  I give it a big recommendation.

Video Review - https://youtu.be/3oxezBjSwQI

Sun Tzu is an excellent two player area control game. Players have a deck of identical cards each and one unique power card (chosen from a choice of 5). The board is a map of 5 areas. Each round you will play one of your cards to each area. Once both players have done this each area is revealed. Your cards are number 1-10 and the difference between each card is how many armies the winner gets to place on that region. So if I play a 5 and you play a three I add two of my armies to that region or take two of yours away should you have control. There are special cards that can let you play a +1/+2/+3 or -1 a plague which has special effects. The wrinkle is that you can only play special cards or cards about the number 6 once over the whole game (up to nine rounds) It's a clever game that works very well. My only complaint is with the score tiles which are unnecessarily fiddly and tend to fall apart! Other than that it's excellent.

Really impressed with this one! Seems to take lessons from other well-established 2-player area control games like Twilight Struggle and 1960, though this distills the mechanism in a much cleaner way. The game can be very swingy, but half of the fun is guessing what your opponent is going to play in each province. If I had one negative about this game, it would be the components. The score trackers are horrendous. That aside, I see this as being one of my new favorite 2-player fillers that packs a big punch in a fairly small box.

UPDATE: Still a quality game, but I prefer other games of this genre nowadays.

Liked this a lot, an area control game with a simple card-based mechanism and a push-pull scoring tracker that adds up to more than the sum of its parts.  Bluffing plays a strong role and different levels mean that it has some longevity.  The components are interesting, though - the scoreboards are a pain, while the soldiers, though lovely, are totally unnecessary.  Still, it's available at a rock-bottom price pretty much everywhere, so it seems churlish to grumble.

2P tug-of-war area control with a little variety thanks to the warlord and event cards. Ironically, therefore, perhaps a little more skillful when played without them. There is probably a shortfall on the ability to second-guess with any sort of accuracy, but the asymmetry is a neat idea.

If you're purchasing, buy also some decent glue for the useless scoreboards.

[b]Dynasties (now Sun Tzu)[/b] was sold via auction 11/5/15.

[i]I can see the merits of this game, but it was very dry. I've been looking for a good 2p area control game, but unfortunately the search continues. I enjoyed it more than my son, in large part because he didn't engage in any kind of bluffing and just tried to bulldoze his way to victory. That lead to him receiving a very through beating. While I think the game offers some decent tactical depth, we were both bored while playing it. In the past we probably would give it a few more plays, but we have too many excellent 2p games that we enjoy playing much more. 

If you are looking for a 2p tactical game that offers a lot of back and forth and bluffing I can't recommend Battle Line enough. While technically not area control there is a push pull element to this game and you can go all out for a quick victory via a break through or take your time and win by capturing the majority of flags (5 of 9).[/i]

A nice 2 player that features simultaneous reveal acrss the 5 different regions you're competing for. The difference between the two cards is the swing in position on the board, but it's the one-use special cards that elevate the mechanism (the +1's, -1's, plagues, etc) which allow you to protect leads. And raise the guess / bluff element - will they play a special or not? The rounds are El Grande style - 3 rounds then score, do three times. All over in 15 minutes or so. Enjoyable.

Nice light area control game for two players. Feels pretty tame compared to the new 2 de Mayo, which is roughly the same weight and also has hidden action selection, but (I think) is much more interesting. I'd really like there to be more significance to the map. We've considered making up some cards that let you move units between adjacent provinces - I'd have to see whether the increased spatial aspect would outweigh the decrease in resource limitations.

A fairly short, fun 2-player game. To do well in this game you need to put yourself in your opponent's position and think about what his logical plays are, then play to neutralize them. But if your opp plays deeper than that and tries reverse psychology, then you will need to adapt to that in your plays!

RATING: 8.6
Involves a lot of reading your opponent and getting a feel for what makes most sense for them to do in the moment, then adjusting that based on their general decision patterns. It's very cleverly designed in that it feels a lot weightier as a game than the mechanics might initially suggest.

Interessante jogo de guerra para dois jogadores, com componentes bestiais (edição deluxe Matagot) e uma jogabilidade rápida, que convida a várias partidas consecutivas. Permite uma pitada de bluff, o que lhe confere um carisma "Stratego", muito apetecível. Aprovado!

RATING: N/A
A very enjoyable two-player game but the publisher seems to have dropped the ball on a variety of bizarre production issues. The board warps horribly, the rules refer to large and small markers when the actual markers are the same size but black and white, cards with different text rely on the same image, the numbers on the cards are displayed twice (once large, once small) for no apparent reason, province names are listed along the scoring track for no reason, etc. Downright wierd. I'd love to see this one picked up by another publisher someday so we can have a more authoritative version.

(+) Terse, clean exercise in fundamental area control.  
(+) Asymmetry in Generals' special abilities and the various 'Art of War' excerpts and seemingly classical illustrations of warfare add a welcome flavor to the gameplay. 
(+) Bluffing elements are engaging, and rewarding.  

(-) Limited in depth.  
(-) Difficult to seize an area back in that is firmly in opponent's control.  
(-) On more than one occasion, players on the same wavelength can double-think their way into a turn where game state does not change. Endgames can play out in a similar fashion, as a result.

Who can say whether this game is good or not.  I'm really not sure if the game has any real control.  I enjoy simultaneous action, and I think that it is implemented well in this system, but it seems like the point swing is a bit too extreme I'm fine with the 1-6 cards but I'm not sure why you'd ever play the 2's and 3's when there are 7-10 cards out there.  I'm also not so sure about the value of the 6 card, yes it gives you one more cube, but it also costs you position on the board and then ties up your cubes for the rest of the game.  It seems like the 5 is better.

Perhaps this will go up with more plays.  I'm certain to give this another go at some point.  All I know is that I wiped out my opponent way too easily, and won in the first round.  I'm not sure I deserved it.

UPDATE: Honestly, I don't really have a desire to play this again.  There just isn't anything special here.

RATING: 7.5
1 play, Jolly Roger version; expert version, wrong rules (left out 7-10!)

A fun area-control, bluffing, hand-management game ... packs a lot of fun decisions in a small package. Feels a bit like Condotierre (similarly long thin cards, similar card powers) crossed with El Grande (scoring every 3 rounds, area control) and Twilight Struggle (push-pull scoring, cube play reminiscent of coups). The production quality is good except for the board, which is warped right out of the box! 

--- Summary ---
The board shows
- a map of china divided into 5 provinces; at start, randomly allocate one of the 9 scoring tiles (which show point values for each of the 3 scorings) to each province.
- a round track is on one side of the board: 9 rounds; score at end of rounds 3, 6, 9.
- a score track is on the other: 19 spaces; Twilight Struggle style tug of war, with marker starting in middle.
- each player's side has a space for each region where a card will be played

Each players gets 21 cubes (18 in expert game) and their own deck of cards. The cards are:
- numbers 1-6 (start out in your hand each round)
- special cards, shuffled into a draw deck. At the start of the game, draw 4 each. (In expert game, may remove one of these from the game to retrieve one of the 3 cubes set aside.)
... 7 8 9 10
... +1 +2 or +3 (+1 only in basic; all in expert version)
... -1
... Plague x 2

With the optional Warlord Variant, players also choose a leader card (Sun Tzu or Shao) to add to their hand; it gives you a one-time-use special power (assymetric powers).

Each round, players draw 2 from their decks, add 1 to your hand and put the other at the bottom of your deck. Then, they allocate a card to each region. The player with fewer cubes on the board at the start of the round (if tied, whoever decided last round) decides the order to resolve the regions. For round 1, go left to right. To resolve, reveal both cards; if you played a 6, mark that region's card space with a cube -- you may not play the 6 there again for the rest of the game! Calculate the difference in values between the cards for that region. The player with the higher value removes the other player's cubes (returning to their supply) then adds their own cubes to that region, up to the difference. When adding cubes, if you run out of cubes in your supply take them from neighboring regions; if not enough available, take from any of your regions on the board (which is why the order you resolve regions can be important!).

After they are resolved, the special cards are removed from the game:
- +1 +2 +3 are worth 1/2/3 more than the other card (but the latter two force you to remove 1 or 2 of your cubes in supply from the game; if none in supply, remove from any region on the board); if played against another + card, higher card wins by the difference in card values
- -1 is worth 1 less (you lose the battle this round, but only remove 1 of your cubes from the board) unless played against a '+' or '-' card, in which case treat it as a 0
- Plague cancels the battle entirely; remove half the cubes (round down) from the board

At the ends of rounds 3/6/9, each region earns the player with any cubes there the indicated values. The player who scores the highest total moves the score marker towards them as many spaces as the difference in scores this round. If you get the marker all the way to your side, you win immediately. Otherwise, the player with the marker closer to them at the end of round 9 wins. If it's in the exact middle, the player with more cubes in supply wins.

[JRG 05 edition] {China, war, couple; blind-bidding, area-majority, utility cards} {basic game 6.5, expert variant 6.5, warlord variant 6.5} I often look for good games with China theme. When I read the description of Dynasties, it sounds interesting. Therefore, I got a copy. Then, I found that it's a really nice game. It is easy to understand the rules and system. However, it's bad that there are errors in the rule! :angry:

It's an area majority game with blind bidding. There are plenty of interactions between players. It supports both tactical moves and strategic planning. It requires skills of hand management, bluffing and double guessing.

The theme is weak except there is a China map on the board and quotations from "Art of War, Sun Tsz" on the cards. The board is wrapped when it arrives :(. 

Recommended as a couple game. It's a bargain.

It's very odd; it's too abstract to be anything like a wargame. The retreats and re direction of armies happens in odd ways; sometimes it's the enemy that creates it sometimes you create by over attacking. But as an abstract it's imperfect. For instance there's no -2 or -3 card which one can argue is as important as +2/+3. It makes you wonder. However, it's a very interesting mix of the Col.Blotto problem meeting the GOPS game. I want to get to know this odd guy better; but I think he's too far distant to let anyone get to know him....

A decent, fairly simple 2 player area majority game.  One of the neat things is that there are 3 rounds of scoring, but the value of each region varies for each round.

What an addictive area control game. The gameplay is very quick and because each player takes their turn simultaneously, there is never any downtime. The variable scoring is a neat twist. I can see how the strategy might become stale with many plays, but right now I'm still having fun developing mine. I really love the psychological tension of trying to guess your opponent's next move in order to play the most effective card. One HUGE negative, though, is the terrible quality of the components. My board is extremely warped and the paper wrinkled. From what I've seen in the forums, that's not unique--I've yet to get a reply back from the company about this. And the other components could have been better. too. I'm not normally very picky about quality, but I have to say it was a huge disappointment in light of what a great game this is.

A very clever card-driven area-control game. The stylized writing on the board is a bit difficult to make out and and somewhat annoying, but there are only five provinces, so this isn't a major problem. The game feels a bit abstract, but there are plenty of choices and opportunities for clever play. Falling too far behind in influence can be deadly, though, and nearly impossible to recover from.

Fun, great theme, quick playing, easy to learn and teach. Area control game that focuses on a zen-like approach to grand strategy in the sense Sun Tzu would have prescribed. 

Sun Tzu is a remake of Dynasties. The new version is basically the same. Marco Wargamer recommends the old version, with wood cubes, over the new one, with plastic miniatures, but the board of the new version is nice and there's some more bling. For me: Wood>Plastic always. Plus, Dynasties v1 was about 1/2 the price new on the BGG Marketplace. So, needless to say, I went with that.

This game is all about bluffing, deception, and managing action-reaction dynamics along with limited resources. The whole "if I attack here, will s/he defend that or will s/he hit me somewhere else?" kind of thinking that pretty much defines strategy in my mind (and, I think, in Sun Tzu's mind).

Personally, I will apply the term "wargame" here, because I feel it applies for those reasons. I would even say it's a simulation, albeit an abstract one. It's just simulating things on a different scale (grand) and of a different sort than what most wargames tend to focus on (which is the actual combat aspect). A simulation of the solar system only needs 9 balls revolving around a central point of gravity, right? So, even though it might not account for so many other details, it is nevertheless a simulation (though it seems a vast and oversimplified abstraction).

Dynasties is a short, enjoyable game with more strategy than first meets the eye. If there is a down side, it is that the game can easily be dominated by someone with experience or a quicker grasp of the rules the first time out.

Because this game is short, I recommend planning to play at least two times consecutively if either player hasn't played the game before. Treat that first game with a new player as a learning game.

Alternately, in a learning game (i.e., at least one new player), deliberately use the scoring tiles with first round values of "1" and "2". This will insure that the first game will last more than one scoring round.

Quick, easy, light game to play with a pasted on theme of conflict in Imperial China.  The game is okay, but rarely gets on the table as I have too many other games that are more interesting.

The fact that you try to guess where your opponent has striked or how to bluff are two important elements of the game. Every decision you make, will count in the end so think carefully before deciding where you will set this card of "6". Those who have played it understand what I mean. The rest...you should play it!

Long ago, a Chinese general by the name of Sun Tzu set out to defeat his emperor's enemies in an attempt to unite China, opposed only by the forces of General Shao.
\13\\13\
In Dynasties two rival players seek to control China through marshalling their forces and conquering the five main provinces of ancient China. But it isn't as easy as it sounds. There are a limited number of armies available and both players have the exact same options to choose from, making the game a question of skill in choosing when and where to use those options and to deploy armies. Deploy them too soon and in the end, a great lead will be lost; deploy them too late, and the enemy will have unavoidable victory!

Absolutely loving it! The Sun Tzu's book "The Art of War" and its rules and wisdom does apply to this game. 

I adore simple rules games with wide strategic options like this one. On top of that the game has big replayable value. Every game is different due to random set of scoring panels, which is different for every game. 

I played the game about 18 times and the game is always thriling. The tension is enormous every round.  

Somebody wrote, that if you go all in with special cards in first three rounds of game, you always win, unless opponent does exactly the same. ITS NOT TRUE! But as general responsible for outcome of the war, you have to ensure you wont lose after first scoring round. So against such opponent you can control just one or two regions with small amount of points just to ensure you wont lose after first scoring round. And after this you will crush him in rounds to come due to his lack of special cards, which he had used during his "blitzkrieg" strategy.

I recommend Sun Tzu to anyone who loves strategic games. There is no luck whatsoever in the game. You play such cards, what you believe are best for you to win and in regard what you think your opponent will play. No luck, just your decions, your calculations and your wits.

A very underrated game. Fantastic mixture of bluff, tactics and strategy. This game will make your head explode if you go too deep into analyzing your moves.  The theme of Sun Tzu's book is present in every aspect of the game. It's quick, tense and challenging. I love it!

[EDIT] after 2 more games still the same sensation of not knowing exactly what I am doing but I distinctly had the impression of a solid tense game. Raising my rating .5, to 7.5

Nice components, simple rules, fast play, some replayability, a lof of doubleguessing that verges on almost random play. Not bad at all, just, sometimes i feel i am throwing cards on the board without a clear purpose... maybe just because it was my first game

Really regret not picking this up at Essen 2014 after a couple of plays - great chess-like war game with a lot of theme, considering the abstraction.

Quick-playing game that mixes some elements of Battle Line and Twilight Struggle. Enjoyable but simple.

My wife and I both enjoy this game.  However, after two plays both were tied on the score board - but I was the victor because I had more armies in storage.

This great little two player game has some bluffing and outwitting of your opponent in order to vie for resource points in the thrid, sixth and ninth turn.  I am sure that playing with the same partner will become more strategic over time as each learns how the other thinks.  The game has a little bit of luck, but good strategy will trump luck.

Does seem a little dry and maybe too abstract for my wife.

After 1 Play: Similar to Aton, but I think less interesting (and I'm no big fan of Aton).  There is really very little to suggest what your opponent might play, so the results seem quite random.

Quick game that's easy to teach and has a nice amount of variety within its simple design. 

[These following comments are about the 'Dynasties' version by Jolly Roger Games] Some of the negatives: The theme is a little thin and the components could have been better (the game's price reflects this, though).

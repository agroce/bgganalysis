GAME: Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game
RANK: 58
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Hasn't lived up to the hype or the promise of the design/concept. There was so much potential for amazing experiences, but after more than a dozen games they never seemed to materialize.

Issues include:
-fiddliness
-poorly defined story arc
-too much random swinginess
-some awkward rules/design.
-no suspense in the traitor mechanic.
-the game always breaks down into an optimization exercise. It turns into *unemergent* gameplay.

Wow, I was generous with this one. No need to play it again to go from 6.1 to 4.8. I really don't get the appeal with this one. I'd play it again under more ideal circumstances but I wouldn't expect the rating to go up much.

Rating based on one play with four first timers. We loved it. No traitor and we accomplished the main mission but two people failed their personal goals and regretted driving so much toward the main objective. And we ended on 1 morale. So with a traitor we'd have been doomed.

RATING: 8
A co-op game about Zombies? Not really my thing. BUT. This does have a very strong narrative and the personal objectives / traitor element puts it in BSG territory - and this plays a little quicker and possibly smoother than BSG. Recommended despite the theme.

I have come to accept that I really don't like cooperative games that much.

That being said, this is a good one. It may be a bit more complicated than it needs to be, but it has a nice mix of mechanics. 

The crossroads cards can seem to be unneccessary at times, but they really add a nice thematic element. The challenges are not as interesting as they could be, but they definitely add challenge. Balancing characters is important and adds a nice twist.

I enjoyed playing, which is novel for coops. I would play it again.

RATING: 8.5
An interesting semi-cooperative exercise, with unique and highly thematic mechanics, the game sometimes lacks the tension that I find in games like BSG - BSG is always a tight race to the end, with suspicion and misdirection flying until the final reveal, but DoW sometimes tends more towards being a few rounds of loyalty checking, before everyone being more or less harmonious.

The Crossroads cards are excellent, however!

One of the few games I've grown tired of playing.  That's high praise!  I've played lots of this, and the average length is way over what I normally enjoy, but I'm always engrossed to the end.  After every play, players discuss the game for half an hour.  Excellent game.

RATING: 2
With a traitor = 5, without a traitor = 1. Nothing exceptional or unique here, a super-busy mashup of a cooperative intrigue game, tries to achieve too much and results in lots of down time. I hate the theme and the role playing aspects which are exceptionally nerdy.

[I]tl;dr - An overdone theme and no real innovative mechanics make for a warmed-over BSG/Shadows over Camelot sequel. Hard pass from me.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Words cannot describe -- I tried Dead of Winter and disliked it a lot. I won't be trying it again -- this isn't my type of game.

First of all, there's no semblance of a struggle to survive in this game. We had to just 'stay alive' for five rounds, but everything we had to do seemed obvious. We weren't over-run by zombies at any point, we fended them off easily, and there was nothing to do except that. Perhaps we tried a bad scenario, but even so, the basic mechanics of the game seemed really...boring.

I dislike zombies in general, and this is a game that would have profited without them. Set this on a desert island, add in some sort of sun beats down mechanic (kind of like Forbidden Desert), and make the zombies wild beasts. You've instantly got a better game just because the survival aspect matches the theme a lot better. The game still would need mechanical tweaks, but the zombie theme was just a huge turnoff overall to me.

The individual personal goals were interesting, but not enough to save it for me, at all. I also found the Crossroads cards (the big draw of the game for many people) not very compelling. It's possible the group I played with had a small role in my dislike for the game, but I think I'd hate this one if I played it with the designer himself. 

I prefer [thing=15062][/thing] for a more successful take on the semi-co-op.

Having a cooperative goal as well as a personal goal keeps the game interesting; need more plays to determine if there's really a challenge there; good production, nice layout, pretty clear rules.

Bland, dull, over-hyped, and really felt like a zombie theme pasted over a collection of mechanics (and it didn't work well). Frostbite, cardboard punchout zombies in an era of great plastic minis, taking out the trash, character dice of death, and far too many of the famous "crossroads" cards that you could simply ignore... IF they even came in play... added up to "blech".

An excellent, immersive experience. I particularly love the crossroads deck, which gives it a different feel from similar co-op games. Brutally difficult game, but that feels thematically appropriate. The one flaw in it that keeps it from being a '10' is how easy it is for a traitor to win and how impossible it is to block a traitor from sinking the game. Still, it's a permanent part of my collection and definitely one of my frequent go-to games.

RATING: 10
This game is amazing.  The stories you will get from this game will stick with you.  The crossroad cards are a great touch, and the tension that the crises bring is palpable.  Group make up will make or break this game, our group focuses on the main objective while also trying to complete the personal.  The consensus is a shared half win is better that a total loss, not all gamers are like this however.  Easily my favorite of 2014, and in my top 5 of all time.

Played once and I don't think I like it. It was repetitive and way way too long. Also, I get nothing out of betrayer mechanics as they tend to just destroy the actual game for me. If it has to be betrayer-mechanics, I'd rather it was pure betrayer mechanics like in Avalon.

RATING: 8
Dead of Winter is a survival game with a very compelling twist. Not only might there be a traitor in your midst, but there might not be (which sounds really stupid, but is the difference between a foregone conclusion and suspense). Players are given every reason to be selfish, but they can't be too selfish or everybody loses. It's a fantastic game of motivations and shifty eyes, with a great deal of thematic flavor from the crossroads event deck. Sure, you'll probably hear the same crossroads cards pretty regularly, but you never know when a new one might pop up with a crazy decision that must be made. Dead of Winter is my co-op survival game of choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's got some neat ideas, and can be a great experience, but the crossroads don't work as well in practice as in theory, and the crises and traitor mechanics aren't as good as what you can find in Battlestar: Galactica.

We played a partial 3-player game. I got a good feel for how the game runs, but not how it finishes. It was selling well throughout GenCon and I do expect it sold out. It plays very smooth and is very simple to run - which I appreciate alot. The theme is spectacular indeed. I love the look and feel here - a wintery apocalypse is richly thematic and evokes the tension needed for this type of co-op. I like the idea of possible betrayal in your own ranks - everybody gets a secret objective. The general play is everyone rolls dice and then goes out exploring locations by drawing up cards. Want more selection? Draw more cards - but that risks attracting more zombies. And why draw cards? To complete the crisis happening each round as well as beef up your characters.

The main touted feature here are the crossroads card. Conceptually, these are brilliant. Your neighbor draws one of these cards and if the event listed occurs during your turn, they read to you the results and you pick which happens. But I have a few problems with this. First, of the cards we drew, ALL but one of them pertained to specific characters in the game. Only once was the character in the game - so they didn't get triggered. When one did get triggered, it pertained to one of my characters - and it wasn't my turn. I was *reading* the card. Very strange feeling to have your character's decision determined by another player. It didn't feel thematic - just clumsy somehow. Another one was a set up of a fight in the colony - but we only had a single character there so it made no sense. Second, the consequence of the decision is revealed to the player - which feels very odd in play. I'd rather know the choices, but not the consequences. This all made me feel the crossroad cards were a missed opportunity. 

That plus the rather repetitive play experience (search search search) left me a bit unimpressed. Don't take this for not enjoying the game - because I did and would gladly play again. But I didn't feel the need to buy it.

I have found the genre of theme heavy, co-operative survival games to be one of the most (if not the most) difficult genres to make. Having played a number of them, I have come to a conclusion that most are horrible while only a few are actually good ones. Dead of Winter falls into the category of horrible.
 
My biggest complaint is about the down time. At the very beginning it is still ok, but once new characters start entering the game it all freezes dead. There are just too many moving pieces on the board and all cohesion is lost. To add to the horror of waiting, an event card is drawn at the beginning of every turn. Ok, this a common mechanic but the cards in Dead of Winter have way too much flavour text. When you have patiently waited for your turn for 10 minutes, you do not want to have the game stop for another 1-2 minutes turn.
 
It is a fine balance between keeping the game playable and adding “thematic” stuff that is supposed to help with the immersion. Easily this extra fluff is not meaningful from the mechanical point of view and does not actually add to the dramatic arc either, but only gives you random and unrelated events.
 
I am still waiting for the grail in this category of games, i.e., dripping with theme and stories while everything propels the game and the story forward. As of this writing, Arkham Horror is the closest to a grail so far. At least there the down time is not so much of an issue.

Reviewing as a 2 player cooperative (5 Rating): Really didn't live up to the hype for me. Game ended extremely quickly and far too easy. I hope this changes with more players as I'm really looking forward to playing with the betrayer element.

I think this could be a BSG replacement for me. The personal objectives mean optimal play isn't always possible and their is still a lot to do for a revealed betrayer. The only downside I would say it that poor searchers can leave you with little to do on your turn.

At long last a zombie game I enjoy. Dead of Winter is designed by The same person who did City of Remnants and is a really nice take on a survival horror theme. It is like Shadows over Camelot and the Walking Dead had a baby. The premise is that you are one of a few factions within a town that exists in a post zombie apocalypse. You spend your time scavenging for resources and trying to meet one of several possible scenario objectives. The trick though is that there is probably at least one traitor in your midst who has a goal to undermine the community. So while most games of this ilk capture the external pressure of zombies well, this one also captures the internal one presented by other humans. Dead of Winter, a zombie game I will play :)

So, one of us won because he successfully went through one of six card piles with location names on them, one of us won because he was told to reward cleanliness of hand cards and one of us won because he was told to be masochistic, which led him to "move" between two "locations" back and fourth until he had two damage tokens. What a zombie apocalypse to have!

Based on a single play. Lots of fun, great mix of coop and personal goals. The crossroads cards bring a level of thematic immersion which works much better than flavor text ever does. Many memorable moments, such as the time sparky ran up to the woman dying in her crashed helicopter and chose to run off with the gasoline rather than save her. 

Ummm. Good dog?

A few plays later... Still great. Love the cross roads cards mechanic. The game is tough, but winning is possible. My only small strike is that the luck can go against you. Just like the lotr lcg (and many other recent games) winning is a combination of good play and the luck of the draw and the dice. Still very fun and very immersive so far. 

Probably my game of the year for 2013

Our first game was pretty exciting!  It feels a bit like BSG, but much more workable with 3-4 players.  I'm holding my rating until after the next game, but I'm hopeful.

Update:  We're a few games in, now, and I'm very comfortable giving this a 9.  It might just be the honeymoon phase, so I hope it sticks it out for the long term!

Update: This has pretty much replaced BSG for my group, if for no other reason than it works with fewer players.

Single game play.  My role was as the betrayer with the secret objective being to have 5 survivors killed.  I waited until the time in which I had consecutive turns and quite easily sabotaged the group in a single turn and won.  

The gameplay in general I though was quite fun, but as the betrayer I thought it was a bit easy to make the game go the hell very quickly.

Will need a few more plays to see if it holds it ranking, but I love how we're all in this difficult scenario together, but each have our own secret agenda - brilliant take on the co-op genre. And there's even the possibility of a traitor, aka BSG. Makes everyone paranoid, perfect for our backstabbing group!

It's a pretty cool experience, overall.  Almost a little too close to Ameritrash to me, but it has some Euro sensibilities.  The "crossroads" eventing makes this game what it is.  Game mechanics are a 6, but the theme-ing makes it a 7.

I don't own it but I've loved every game of it. Much better when using the app for the crossroads section - that way you don't know the outcome of actions (which takes you out of the theme a bit when you do know). I'm not a fan of the zombie theme hugely though so I am intrigued for what's next with the Crossroads system. I also really hate the dog character...

Very good traitor, social deduction game. Works much better with different player counts than Battlestar Galactica (BSG). 
However, discovering traitors is still more fun in BSG.
The characters are great as well as the crossroads cards. It is also nice that each player has different goals. 
Moreover, the game's overall goal, difficulty, and length can be chosen each game.

Thematic, fun, tense, and really difficult.  Enough second-guessing during turns to mitigate the downtime between turns, and victories feel epic if they happen (they don't happen often).

Dead of Winter is a very original game and is incredibly unique. As a zombie apocalypse scenario fan, this game actually didn't interest me when I saw it on Amazon. After doing some research of the game, I became excited to try it out and the game *somewhat* met my expectations. First off, the game plays beautifully cooperative, it's a constant struggle of working together to survive a zombie apocalypse. The only issues I had with the game was with the traitor and how many damn pieces are required! We had a game last about 20 minutes and the traitor had already won (maybe need to test more games but the times we had a traitor was incredibly boring). Great game, just wish there was a way to have less pieces (set up takes 30 minutes sometimes!)

Another roll and draw American-style game. I can see why a lot of people may like it, but it's really not my cup of tea. I appreciate that the dice rolling is not as crucial as in other titles, but it still felt underwhelming to me... almost pasted on the game, just to appeal to dice enthusiasts. I don't see why those dice are there.

I wasn't thrilled by the secret goal mechanism either, as it seems to be there just to give opportunities to the traitor. This is made even worse by the fact that the objectives don't scale. In one game I needed to have 12 survivors in the colony and we played in 5, so I started the game with 10! It didn't even have to get to my turn for me to complete it! The same objective would have been a lot tougher in 2 players. This is just lazy game design.

Yet the biggest let down for me was the concept of the Crossroads cards. What's so innovative about them? It's almost exactly the same thing that Arkham Horror does and it's exactly one of the reasons why I don't like that game. I thought that I would have liked it better here, because the player couldn't tell whether the event would trigger or not. Then I discovered that the triggers are so generic, that the events take place almost every time... making the entire thing almost meaningless. You want a sense of story done right? Look at the adventure mechanism in Robinson Crusoe! Now, that's an interesting take on event cards in board games... not this.

So again, maybe it's just not my cup of tea. It's another game that it's just all theme and no mechanics. I really don't understand where is the fun in the whole "draw and see what happens" system. Not as bad as Arkham Horror, but still pretty bad for me. Pass.

A very good cooperative game based in a post-apocalyptic universe where you have to fight zombies. It is outstanding because although it is a cooperative game, each player has a secret task and if they do it , they can win the game, also there is a traitor whose job is to hinder the group's performance. What I miss from this game are the plastic miniatures: all the zombies are made of paper, but the other visual aspects are nicely done. I can recommend this game to groups who are into cooperative gaming, but also prefer a level of competition, so the alpha player is not so accentuated.

Uma cópia descarada de BSG, porém uma cópia bem feita e com alguns mecanismos interessantes. O fato dele copiar as principais mecânicas de BSG (enfrentar crise, votação secreta, traidor no grupo) foi algo que me desagradou, mas achei o nível de dificuldade bem condizente com a proposta do jogo (sobreviver ao apocalipse zumbi no meio de uma nevasca). O fato de não ter eliminação de jogadores também foi algo que gostei e a ideia do exilado (uma cópia da cadeia em BSG) é algo interessante porque o jogador ainda participa, mas de uma forma diferente. Um jogo legal. Não original, mas legal.

1st play: Learning games like this can always be a little rough. I liked it more than most zombie games, with the hidden secret objectives and the story elements in the crossroads cards. The traitor element felt weird, but it was mechanically necessary as the game was pretty easy without that.

[b]23.10.2014 - After 4 plays[/b]
[b]BACKGROUND[/b]: For this game, I feel the need to explain my gaming background concerning this type of games (cooperative/zombie). Although many games played a long time ago, the cooperative genre is not a preferred one for me. In fact, I find "OK" only Pandemic (a classic of the genre) and Eldritch / Arkham Horror (mostly due to the theme). The other games I have played are ranked as "meh" - Battlestar Galactica, Shadows over Camelot, Robinson Crusoe and Red November.
Regarding the "zombie genre", the only game that I have played is Last Night on Earth and I thought it was weak.

[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]: Dead of Winter is set in a small colony of survivors/runners from the zombie apocalypse. Every player controls a team of survivors (starting with 2), each having three basic stats and an ability. There is a main objective which needs to be completed, as well as secret objectives for each player. A player must complete also his secret objectives in order to win, with some objectives being "betraying" ones. Furthermore, each turn a Crisis needs to be faced, which can have brutal consequences if failed. But what makes the game shine are the CROSSROADS cards, some random and thematic events that MAY be triggered by the player taking his turn.

[b]ART/COMPONENTS[/b]: The art is gorgeous, almost black & white with some color highlights (especially the bloody red). The components are nice, especially the cardboard "miniatures" of the survivors and zombies. There is just one thing that bothers me: why did they make the non-colony location from thick paper, instead of cardboard as the colony map? 

[b]DIFFICULTY[/b]: If someone listens to the complete rules explanation, she may find the game is very complex (there are over 10 actions a player can take) and with many rules. Despite this, the game is easy to grasp and with someone "watching" over the colony phase, it can go very smoothly. The scarcity of the resources, the constant zombie threat and the need to complete the objective make up for a tight and very "stressful" game.

[b]THOUGHTS[/b]: There two reasons why I like this game and will continue to play
1. It is a SEMI-cooperative (due to the personal objectives), SEMI-ameritrash game (it has dice, but they are rolled just at the beginning of the turn, instead of every time you have an "encounter"). Because of this "semi" nature, it can attract different people, even those that usually don't play these genres (like myself). I think that the "betrayer" element is done excellent in this game, compared to BSG and other games with hidden traitors. 

2. It is VERY thematic. Almost all of the actions can be explained in the context of the story. For example: you need to roll an exposure die (D12) every time you move a survivor or attack a zombie. The results may be: BLANK (nothing out of the ordinary happens) | FROSTBITE wound (you traveled/fought too long in the snow, so some parts of your body got frozen) | WOUND (you tripped/zombie fought back, so you are wounded) | BITTEN (the zombie transformed your survivor, so you lose it. On top of that, if there are more survivors present, each one may get bitten by the "new" zombie).
Also, the Crossroads cards shows you glimpses of the story, with hard choices to be taken.

I didn't like that, near the end of the game, it may become clear if the main objective can be fulfilled or not. If not, then the non-betrayers have just one option - to exile the betrayer so that he doesn't win. This is a little anti-climatic.

According to Plaid Hat Games, this is just the first game of a family of games that uses the Crossroads system. So, I cannot wait to try the others!

Fantastic coop game. Yes, there's a lot of luck needed in the game (especially regarding your secret objective card, which can be either a walk in the park or devastatingly difficult), there can be quite some down time (which I generally hate), but each time you play it's just a blast. The crossroads cards are great, the theming feels right and really helps the mechanics, the strategic options are diverse, the variety in each game is wonderful (various missions, other starting characters, new crossroads...). It's truly a fun game to play.

Cooperative game with personal agendas to final victory. Good overall production on the components. Not attractive, but functional. 

Overall experience is a weak game play that is dependent on both card draws and dice roll. Adding these 2 randomness with a strict timeline spells doom and any successes is purely by chance when even everybody plays nice and best they could.

Random chaos? Or singularity mindset? Lacking depth.

So... I am undecided, despite play count for this hitting double figures. The zombie theme is basically an excuse for a resource managing semi co-op thing, which can be fun but is a bit too bleak and miserable to beat out Shadows over Camelot as my favourite in the genre. At least in Shadows you actually achieve things from time to time rather than only stopping yourself drowning in garbage.

Игра про зомби. Ну что тут сказать. Тематика интересная, боевка и передвижение не имеют смысла вообще. Вся игра сводится к переходу в локацию и сборке там предметов с последующим скидыванием их в кучу для выполнения квеста. Механика предателя реализована плохо. В плюсы можно отнести личные цели и какой-то выбор, который иногда дают карточки событий.

Feelings towards this game are decreasing over time. The presentation, premise, and some of the mechanics really hooked me to start, but the hidden goal mechanic and highly consequential randomness are feeling more and more dated and unfun. More than once, a player has felt kneecapped by chance very early in the game, to the point of spiking the game to not play anymore. Part of it is them, for sure, but I start to feel pulled down by a game this capricious as well.

In many ways, Dead of Winter almost soars as a co-op. The art is great, the tension is tight, and it has a lot of neat thematic touches. But then there's secret goals, which I find incredibly boring / annoying. It's an added layer of plain annoying luck muddying the waters of a more pure co-op experience. And the traitors are harsh. The game is already hard. Plus, as thematic as the game is, I really do hate zombie anything. I have no love at all for the 1 in 12 chance characters have to die for moving without gas or, God forbid, killing zombies.

Not a bad coop, but I never really felt like I had to use my brain playing it. The weird mechanisms surrounding home base also felt a bit too unthematic compared to the rest of the game.

September 10th 2014: Dead of Winter, newly acquired. 

Rated: 8.5.

November 24th 2014: Sold Dead of Winter. 

Updated Rating: 6

Let me be clear, Dead of Winter is an enjoyable game. It just didn't work for me and my group. I say this with a touch of lament, but after a few games, it just never seemed to sing like I had hoped. 

Detractions: 

1) I found the game a touch messy. Cards are constantly being discarded to the box, while other cards are getting attached to survivors, nothing exists in the game to track 'once a round' use items, yet turning cards sideways does little to minimize the clutter (and cards will invariably get there on their own after equipping several to a sole survivor). Cards from one deck will get shuffled into another if a survivor with equipped items dies outside of the colony, and decks discards find themselves being tossed haphazardly. 

2) Vestigial design elements detracted from the teaching experience. Minor complaint, but stuff like the Group Leader having little communicable purpose in the design left the impression of a haphazard design. Influence also has minimal use, save creating a hierarchy for overrun and bite calculations. Rumor has it some of these elements will be expanded upon in the upcoming (though officially unannounced) expansion, but I'll ultimately have to judge the finished product before a repurchase. 

3) Lots of downtime. I tend to stay engaged in games when it isn't my turn, but for whatever reason the sheer number of actions available to the players in Dead of Winter tended to cause my attention to fog over by mid-game (when with two). I prefer threading player actions, but I'll be the first to admit this would hurt the betrayer (if one is present). 

4) I hated playing the Crossroad cards police. Lovely element to the game, at least at the low play count I've had (probably 6~ sessions). I can imagine they might get repetitious after a while, but they stayed a joy in my experience. What wasn't a joy, however, was having to constantly remind people to draw them. 

5) Semi cooperative games just aren't my thing. I've never played Archipelago, but I imagine the overt competitive subtext to the game would work better for my group. Dead of Winter matches the source material brilliantly, but not everybody I brought to the table was versed in the "everybody is an untrustable jerk" mentality depicted in media like The Walking Dead. Betrayer mechanics also strike me as a touch gimmicky, and often encourage sessions to devolve into jokey stabs and accusations, as if players feel the need to play up these mechanics to validate their inclusion. Sure, after several games, the novelty will wear off and people will just sit down and play the game, but I find it tedious. 

So, yes. A litany of complaints, yet I still rate it relatively highly. Something about it just got into my heart. 

I may repurchase the game if my group begins meeting more frequently and a quality expansion hits. As it stands, I'd rather be playing Keyflower.     
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Some good ideas here, and I love the different scenarios, but ultimately you are searching through decks of cards the entire game and hoping you don't hit that 1/12 chance of instadeath. Not worth the setup/tear down time. Because of the way turn order rotates, it's also extremely hard to stop a traitor from trashing everything. The individual goals are kind of a way to prevent this, but don't really work well enough in practice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The first play was SO dreadful (5p), but it's gotten better with each subsequent play.

Not recommended to be played with 5, because the game will significantly drag.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impressions was that of a flawless game; the game immediately loses its appeal when crucial imbalances appear, specifically within the traitor mechanic. The game sorely needs house rules because so much of the game relies on the secret objectives.

The traitor would work better if there was a ramp up of sabotage ability - maybe the first allowed sabotage action is a spiking of the crisis, followed by the ability to eat excess food tokens.

I wish there were inquisition actions where you waste action dice to secure things - food cannot be eaten for dice values, crisis cards have to go through your hand, attacks cannot be made with exposure except at the threat of an overrun. Something like that would be fitting to the theme where tyranny emerges out of the distrust.

Anyway, it's a good game that with a few minor tweaks could be a great game.

I like it BUT
I don't think anyone should face the game as they would face most games.
First the group should talk about the metagame. For us, making everyone lose just because we can't win is just stupid. We accept taking the risk trying to get our personal goals even if that could make everyone lose. But that's it. Sometimes our personal goals won't be achievable, so we end up playing without being able to win. We take it as a "well, we kinda won even if I don't".

I accept the game and its flaws because I think about the game as a experience, and not as a fair competition. I understand not everyone will think this way, and if this sound as a problem to you, you maybe end up disliking this game.

Also, is pretty random. The exposure dice can kill someone in just one roll. The resources are limited and some people could be more greedy than others in crisis/objetives and they'll probably achieve victory while other more cooperative players don't.

That said, this game definitely has decisions. When I can be greedy. When I should cooperate. Where I will go, depending of what I need, or what the group need.

For me the game is great even without a traitor, although I think being the traitor makes the game more easy than it should be in some games.

The standalone expansion sound even more unfair and more difficult, but it sounds so awesome in paper. I hope to be able to play it soon, but it looks that there are less location-specialiced characters (good, because they kinda force you to go there and keep them digging there) and the modules look awesome. I don't think having less characters would get stale faster because getting the same characters for me it's more special than boring. You remember other games and can have a few favorite ones. Also, even if it gets stale for you, you can always add one of the modules to mix things up.

So yeah, without having played the expansion I only can recommend the base game, but it looks like one could skip this game and buy the standalone expansion The Long Night and having a really similar game, but with more things to add when you get bored of it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A zombie game that borrows from Battlestar Galactica (a crisis each turn, players all getting the chance to put in cards, the possibility at least of a traitor).  Dead of Winter also throws in some darkly humorous events and - in case hoards of zombies are not enough - a touch of frost bite. Add personal objectives intended to make this a less cooperative game and you have a very tricky balancing act in terms of victory conditions; one that I don't think always succeeds.

One more thing that the designer should have taken from BSG is short player turns.  You will want to play this with a full complement five players, but you really shouldn't because the downtime will be terrible. What's more, there isn't quite enough for the characters to do, beyond searching for items, killing zombies and averting a crisis.  

For my taste the characters cycle all too quickly. I want mine to stick around long enough to build a story, I want to get into role.  That doesn't really happen when you know that any one of them will likely soon be dead.

Production quality is pretty good.  The artwork is distinctive and chillily thematic.

Having recorded a few plays of this, I must say that I largely enjoy it. The exile mechanic can be clunky and I feel that while it works most of the time, it sometimes left me feeling the very flat at the end of a game. I think one of Dead of Winter's real strengths is the crossroads mechanic. It adds a little salt to dinner for me. Some of them are much easier to trigger though, which means you'll certainly see some of them much more often than others.

The stories this game will tell are tremendous. If you dont like a traitor you can play without one while greatly increasing the difficulty of the game. My group tends to play without a traitor but personally I think it plays best with one since it adds some much needed untrustworthyness to the game. The best zombie game thematically and mechanically in my opinion.

Tried playing several games of this with people who owned it. I found it beyond aggravating and completely unfun. Rolling a d12 repeatedly to see if you're dying is an odd mechanic. With my luck, I hit it disproportionately frequently. First game I rolled it 3/6 rolls. Tried playing again, 3/10 before I gave up and didn't want to play anymore. Gave it another chance later and hit 4/13. ... I'm done with this game and frankly don't understand how anyone can like it.

Juego semi-cooperativo. Toda la colonia refugiada por los zombies intentan un objetivo general, mientras cada uno esconde un objetivo secreto individual.

Un gran juego temático. El fin de un juego temático es dar inmersión en el juego, con personalización, trasfondo y narración. Este juego lo logra muy bien, todo el tiempo se siente la tensión de estar en una mala posición, de no poder cumplir los objetivos o sobrevivir. Es un juego denso y emocionante, sobre todo en las últimas decisiones.

Es un juego que puede asustar a la gente no jugona, porque en el turno suceden muchas cosas, pero una vez jugando es muy intuitivo.

This game is tough. We usually barely make it by the end. Have lost twice because of a last turn showing of a traitor.  Lost a few other times as the game simply fell to pieces, but in a good way. It's a challenge. Bites can be devastating. Crossroads choices can swing the entire game. Love it.

I initially liked the idea of everybody having their own secret objective, but it ended up watering down anything the real traitor was doing.

Very good coop with very little quarterbacking issues. The zombies are just there and honestly could be anything else, so don't let that turn you off. The crossroads cards add a lot of flavor to the game. Can't wait to see other games with similar mechanics.

This one is a conundrum. For gaming it is typically only my wife and I. So having any game with a traitor element in it is a bit dodgy. We picked this up after seeing all the hype and after playing a three player game with a friend. We had watched a play through online with someone playing it as purely co-op. However that seems to bring out the worst in the game really. Obviously the traitor elements of the game have to be removed. Then you have to play the game on the hard difficulty in order to make the co-op mode challenging. Problem is that mode might just be too hard. But if you tone it back and don't play on the hard mode it becomes too easy. It's hard to tell what will be with Dead of Winter for now. Regardless of whether it not it stays in our collection we are still keeping the "Lucky Luke" and"Felicia Day" promos.

I really like the idea, you are fighting zombies, you can have a traitor, you all have a common and a personal goal... I'm not a big fan of dice games, and when i can lose my characters just because i'm unlucky i feel i want to play other games, IF this was the only problem my vote would have been 6.5; BUT i don't like the crossroad mechanic, i mean it is cool, but the game gets too long if you have to stop read the text and decide what to do.. Battlestar Galactica woks better and it is similar

While I might be convinced t try it again, I think that this game, sold as a co-op., is broken. Without an in-game incentive to make you try to get a good-guys-victory when victory is out of reach for you (as a non-traitor) this is a pointless exercise in social deduction... I'm a good guy but if I don't win, the good guys won't win, just because...

I generally do not like cooperative games but this one was very fun, especially through the secret objectives and the possibility of the traitor.

The different crossroad cards as well as the plethora of characters and abilities also contributed to an immersing experience.

I love this game, time in between turns can be slow with the full 5 people, but I enjoy watching people agonizing over decisions. I enjoy the coop aspect because of the twist of everyone having their on ulterior motives to include the possibility of BETRAYAL. The conversations after the game as far as why someone did this or that is wonderful. Never before have I seen a more unforgiving D12.

I really like playing this game. The crossroad cards just throw all sorts of neat surprises. Easy to get swept up and feel like you are actually in the game. I love the tension of whether there is a betrayer or not. Have played this game at least five times, still have never won! We've completed the main objective but I've never managed to completed my secret objective. Still would like to try some of the longer missions but usually only get to play the shorter ones.

I didn't not like it but I also didn't love it. It was merely okay. The downtime was horrible, absolutely nothing to do when not your turn.

The conflicting objectives are really fun. The crossroad cards are great.

However, this is no BSG with sympathetic cylons and cylon leaders with crisis cards being draw every turn. BSG does all this better and with more tension and involvement.

Excellent semi-cooperative game in which players have to balance the needs of the colony with their own secret objective. These questionable intentions lead to added tension between players, who never know who to trust with a potential traitor among the group. The Crossroads cards add so many tension on each turn, and the stories really pull you into this world. 

Great theme that is incorporated well into gameplay. Adjustable difficulty level. No alpha player problem because everyone has to look out for themselves in order to win.

Single play, 3P. During explanation, it felt like it was going to feel like Walking Dead. In practice, it felt more like I was playing a board game. Traitor mechanic was awkward with that count too, and we had one. I'd give it more of a shot, and do see thematic value, but I don't think it's fully there for me. Favorite zombie game is still Mall of Horror, and it's not particularly close.

Pretty much the best zombie 'experience' you can buy on the market right now, due to the heavily thematic struggle. But like The Walking Dead, this is primarily about survivors and interaction, and dealing with the various crises that arise. The zombies are rather 'one note' at this point, but they're not always the greatest threat if you've got a traitor in the mist. At any rate, everything from Exiles, Exposure rolls to just having dropped Survivors add their equipped gear to the local Search pile is brilliant here. A fantastic game.

This game is fine as a crisis-management co-op, but the Crossroads system is super lame.  I appreciate that the designers were trying to inject some character development into the narrative.  It's a worthy goal, but they failed utterly, since the Crossroads rarely triggers, and it is often not very impactful when it does.

RATING: 7.5
Played twice, keen to play again, as a social experience this is hard to beat.
There are lots of neat mechanics going on here. I particularly like the fact the once you play a card it's not simply discarded from the game, it goes into a trash pile which literally becomes a pile of trash in your colony which you must clean up or suffer adverse moral consequences. The mechanism by which a traitor, if there is one, can sabotage the colony's attempt to fight a crisis is simple and effective. The dilemmas that the game forces on you are fascinating (you're running short of food so do you bump off a couple of helpless colonists who are useless extra mouths to feed)?
Essentially this is a game of fire-fighting: should your priority be to fight-off zombies? Get more food or fuel? Clear that trash? Other important questions are: is there a traitor? If so who? Probably my favourite mechanic is the fact that each player has a secret objective which can make someone appear like a traitor when they are merely chasing their own goal.
This isn't a game of strategy and isn't meant to be, it's a game of survival, of beating each new crisis, and it succeeds gorgeously in capturing the desperation and paranoia of such a struggle.
Not much downtime because even when it's not your turn you're watching other players to see if they pull their weight and contribute to the general good.
Potential misgivings: the individual secret goals don't seem balanced - eg one is to end the game with three medicine cards, another with just two.
Secondly, the presence or otherwise of a traitor must hugely effect the outcome and I can't help wondering if the game will prove either too easy to win without one or too hard with one, but I haven't played enough to judge.
Third, luck. In my first game, one of my two colonists died on his very first move thanks to an unlucky roll.

Impressions after first play:

First of all we had fun and I would absolutely want to play again.

Crossroads Cards:
I had read a number of complaints that these cards almost never came up and were therefore under utilized.  I imagine that this will change somewhat from game to game but in our game we had what I would consider a perfect amount of crossroads come up.  Enough to keep the game flavourful but not so much that it lost its punch.

Traitor:
We had no traitor in the game, and the set-up seems to make a traitor appearance fairly unlikely. (2 non-trator cards to each player and then 1 traitor card).  It seemed to be obvious fairly early that no one would was the betrayer so there wasn't much tension there.

Secret Agendas:
these would have been more fun if there was ever a thought that someone might betray but they were still a neat mechanic.  I didn't really notice it on other characters but there was certainly  one time at least where people pointed out that the better move for the team was for me to stay in one particular spot but I moved elsewhere anyway based on my own objective.  Maybe the group was too trusting but it wasn't enough for people to accuse me of being a bad guy.  We all lost at the end being unable to fulfil the main objective but 3 of us had no hope of winning anyway :)

Dice:
I was concerned about the exposure dice making the game too swingy (and I think it still could) but we had a very nice distribution of results in our game so it didn't really come up.)

Downtime:
With 5 new players downtime was a factor and made the game drag here and there.I assume it would be less of an issue on subsequent plays but I think it's always going to be a strike against with a full compliment of players.  We played a "short" scenario and the overall game length wasn't too bad at around 2.5 to 3 hours.

Decisions:
I'm not sure there is room for a ton of interesting decisions - but as this is more a thematic experience maybe that's not a huge issue. I wouldn't say it's totally devoid of choices but it wasn't chock full of them either.  I mostly camped out at 2 diff locations and searched when I could, killed when I needed to, and leftover dice sorta just went to trash/barricades.  The lack of traitor tension probably brought this aspect down a notch as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I usually avoid rating this style of game because I don't like them and I don't think it is fair to pass judgment.  Kind of like any dish with eggplant.  On the flip side, I continually try to find a game in this genre and am determined to keep playing them until I find the one that works for me.  Part of me feels like I have to b/c so many in my regular gaming group enjoy this style of game.  Part of me really enjoys a strong narrative in a game and you'd think this genre would fit the bill.  The problem is that there is almost never any tension in these games that isn't related to the randomness of a die roll or card pull.  As such, then tension doesn't really build - it just happens,,,and I'm not really even sure if it's tension at that point . . . 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Very good game idea. Game play is simple, your objective depends on the cenario objective, and your personal objective. Each "good" player has a secret objective that they are trying to achieve, in addition to the cenario objective, the "bad" player is trying to fail the cenario objective and acomplish his secret objective.

Fun semi-coop. Traitor mechanism (although it's hard to botch crisis since the cards are labeled with their sources).
-Reverse turn order can help traitor a lot.
Voting for exile didn't happen much yet.

Dóri:
I like this board game very much: cooperation during a zombi-apocalipse is always exciting. The rules seem to be a bit complicated at some points, so it is not very good to play it with someone who is "new" in the game. Maybe there are too many little tokens in the game, but after you have learned the rules it is an enjoyable game.

3- Each Survivor may only move once per turn.
4- You do NOT have to play Event cards (i.e. add 1,2,3 survivors) as you draw them, you may keep them and play them like a any other card.
5- You may eat Food Tokens from the colony to enhance an unused action die you've rolled.
6- You may attack survivors belonging to other players.

Karten beim Suchen kommen immer zuerst auf die Hand und können bei belieben gespielt werden und auch an andere Spieler weitergegeben. Diese müssen die karte aber sofort ausspielen.

Kíváncsi voltam, mit tud ez a megosztó játék... Top1 zombis:) mégis sokan szidják. Nos, az első amit nem értek, hogy miért hasonlítják ezt mondjuk a Zombicide-hez? Az nekem a Doom-Odalent vonalon mozog, ez sokkal kötöttebb, itt nincsenek bonyolult folyosórendszerek, meg összetett mozgási szabályok. Van egy rakat triviális akció, és hajrá. Sokkal könnyedebb a felsoroltaknál, igazából kár is összehasonlítani azokkal. Szerintem jópofa, akár még 8 pontig is felkúszhat nálam:)

Dead of Winter is, let's not hide behind a finger, Walking Dead - the boardgame.
It is a cooperative psychological and narrative zombie game, with secret objectives driving tension between players.

Gameplay is quite simple, and it is definitely playable by non gamers. It will excel when role played.

I quite enjoyed my first outing, more than expected: tension and pathos were palpable.
Hopefully other scenarios are varied and tense enough.

Initial Impression: I'm not a fan of the cardboard standees or card quality but the artwork on the components of this game convey the dark, cold theme very well. As I don't particularly enjoy cooperative games I appreciate the hidden objectives and betrayer mechanisms in this game. The designers have liberally borrowed from FFG's BSG and streamlined the crisis mechanism into something that doesn't feel quite as repetitive. I'd like to play some more sessions to explore the different objectives, main objectives, and see if the situations create more tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun, social affair with a cool traitor aspect.  Can create some tense moments and the crossroads story cards really bring out the thematic aspect of this game.  When this game is going well, it is a lot of fun.

The problem is that it is somewhat inconsistent.  Sometimes personal obectives incentivize people to derail the game for the other players, even if all involved players are non traitors.  Sometimes a player can gather a bunch of colony members, which means that their turn is 3 times longer than everyone elses.  Also, the game can be a bit easy when there isn't a traitor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Similar to BSG with additional luck coming from dice. Rolling high is always better, the actions you can do with low rolls are limited and not as useful. So ultimately a luckfest through randomness at every step.

An individual game session seems to heavily depend on the other players around the table. I've had one or two poor four player sessions that caused the game to vastly overstay its welcome. It'd see the table more at two players, but other games in my collection are better at two players.

I received this as an early Christmas present. I have played through about 8 games, in the 2 player variant with my daughter and another 2 with my girlfriend yesterday. 

The scenarios are tough, and we are not even playing on Hardcore mode. That may become a little easier with more players, as you have more people collecting resources and whatnot. The zombies still add tend to add up quickly, and the crisis/crossroads cards really add an extra twist in the road to your objective. It's been a blast so far. It's pretty nonstop and also pretty unforgiving. A bad situation can quickly snowball and drop your morale to 0 in an instant. The rule book has been a touch hazy on one or two things, but the internet has been a good resource there.

The two player mode, is a lot of fun, but I am very excited to get more people together and start playing with secret objectives and betrayals. All in all, this game is everything I hoped it would be so far.

Okay this game COULD have been great and given an alternative theme to the social interaction genre games.  Unfortunately the rules are written poorly for this genre.  

Playing as the traitor is WAY to easy to win the game and you can basically tank the game in one turn if you don't feel like you're going to win.  Both of which should never be the case in games like this.

The combat die is far to random and having a chance on the die of just out right dying is ludicrous.

RATING: 9
A semi co-op game that has quickly become a favorite.  It's a game that has a compelling story line that just sucks you in (even if you're not a fan of zombies).  I love the balance of helping the group out in completing the main objective while also making sure your own objective is satisfied.  And, of course, I can't get enough of those Crossroads cards; you never know when one of those things will give you the boost you need to win the game or give you a tough decision to make that will hurt your game either way.  It's a different game every time you play, even if you play the same mission.

My two slight knocks against the game are that, even though the game comes with 80 Crossroads cards, you will go through anywhere between 10-25 each game, so you'll start repeating fairly quickly (they all don't trigger each game, though, so this is just a minor quibble), and the overall complexity is probably too much for casual players.  It's a really hard game to win, especially with so many things to balance as well as intricacies of the rules.  However, I have to give the designers credit for making the rules very intuitive and easy to follow (and for making excellent reference sheets!).  This being said, we've found it best to play a co-op game with new players before introducing the secret objectives so that they can see how everything works.

Dead of Winter is a solid game, and I find that the theme is usually enough to draw people in because of its similarity to the ever-popular Walking Dead. I have used it on several occasions as a game to introduce new(ish) players to gaming with great success. That being said, I am only willing to give it a 7 because, after 14 plays, it's starting to feel a little stale for me. Although the crossroad and scenario cards give the game a fair amount of variety and replayability, the variety is only superficial; all of the scenarios revolve around either killing lots of zombies or gathering lots of supplies. But I've never had a BAD time playing it, so I would be able to recommend it in good conscience.

If you like co-op zombie games, then you will love this. The crossroads mechanic is a good way to keep players engaged (the next player reads out a card and provides the current player with a choice). The hidden win conditions stops the alpha player running the show.

But I'm not that into zombies...

A big favourite. The theme is very immersive and we enjoy the decisions we are forced to make throughout the game. I wish this game was purely co-operative instead of semi co-operative - it's not as fun working together up to the point where you need to complete your own personal goal which often negatively impacts the overall objective.

Not especially enamoured with zombie games, but have played a few with my group over the years and this does seem to be better than the rest from them.

Good game I did kind of hype the game up a little much I think because I was a little disappointed, the drama kind of lacked and it felt a little like I was forced into certain situations at points rather then free will. I think one of the reasons the game fell a little flat for me is because I only play the 2 player version I can see this would be a much more solid and fun game with more due to the traitor aspect. Good game just not as much fun as I expected

For the betrayer, the game is a 10. There is this tension that boils below the surface, just waiting for the perfect moment to explode into brilliant backstabery. Then everything falls into place perfectly, and you screw everyone!

For the non betrayer, you spend 1.5 hours working towards a goal, with the paranoia that someone is working against you, just to have them destroy you on the last turn. While they revel in their brilliance, you look at the board and think, "well, that's 1.5 hours I'll never get back"

RATING: 6
Not as good as Eldritch Horror. Both in theme as in mechanics. Yet another Zombie fest which is not really suited for pure co op play in my view.

The zombie story lacks an overall compelling adventure telling. With games like EH you can produce very diverse stories which can go further than just counting up bodies of zombies.

The game I played was fun and tense to the last die roll but I think if the theme changed a bit the game could have been better. 

By this lack of a varied theme, I also think the solo play is not compelling in the long run.

I think the best possible Zombie play is something like Run, Fight or Die. No movement of your heroes, just roll combo dice and a competitive game of who dies first (game end) and who wins with a simple seperate solo option.

Me encantan los juegos cooperativos y este que tiene una parte de traición me llama mucho la atención. La mecánica aunque puede parecer complicada es bastante sencilla, pero con las crisis se complica bastante. En las primeras partidas en solitario (para asentar reglas) me agobiaba con la cantidad de zombies, pero sólo hay que centrarse en el objetivo y limpiar lo justo para seguir avanzando. Este es uno de mis juegos fetiches que he tardado en comprar, pero que estoy disfrutando.

I don't really care for the zombie theme but this is a very thematic game of survival in an apocalypse setting with immersive story telling. This game can be quite unforgiving, difficult to win even without a traitor (which may or may not be present). I enjoy playing it fully cooperative even. Crossroad cards are very well-done and especially fun if triggered. For all the quality components in the box, I wish the location mats come in thicker cardboard instead. A great game to pull out once in a blue moon.

A good zombie-apocalypse themed game, fatal flaw: it's EXTREMELY EASY for the traitor to win at the end of the ~4 hours game (and in most cases the traitor does actually win), feels like "Oh, you guys are all out trying to kill zombies and trying to survive? Guess what I'm the traitor! I'll just sneak back to base and eat all the foods, I win!"

Purchased from BAM while on clearance. The game is the closest thing to the Walking Dead TV show. When it works with the crossroad cards, it is awesome. However, sometimes due to bad rolls or crossroad cards not triggering, the game can be a dud. Pretty fun as a cooperative. The traitor aspect is interesting. I wouldn't have paid full price for it.

One of my best purchases in 2015. People often ask, how would I describe this game. I always say to imagine if Battlestar Galactica and Pandemic had a child, and add a zombie apocalypse theme to it. That's DoW. I love almost every aspect of it. ALTHO, the crossroad cards could be bit trimmed down text-wise. The game is quite fast paced imo and some of the XR cards slow it a lot sometimes. You draw one and there's literally a wall of text there. Don't get me wrong, I like story telling in board games but they are a bit too long. Especially when you are "lucky" and get an XR card 3-4 times in a row. It feels like the game stops for a bit. "OK, now we read". Other than that, I LOVE IT.

I had high hopes for this game but it hasn't lived up to expectations for me. Between the location equipment decks, crisis cards, Crossroads card, and the D12 rolls that could insta-kill you, there is just waaaay too much randomness for a game of this length. You need some randomness in a semi-coop game no doubt but overall it just feels like winning and losing is tied too much to all that randomness. Also, the traitor can win pretty easily without even having to work too hard at it. Good artwork and theme but the mechanics are just too broken to make this game worth bringing to the table that often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
DoW is a good game for sure, but worth game of the year consideration? I was really surprised by how easy it was to pick up, and how easily my decisions were to make. I thought it would have more of an "umph!" factor, but it fell somewhat flat for me. Move to this location, search, take care of the colony, take care of myself... A lot of hype surrounds the Crossroads cards, but I don't see them as much of an innovation as they are being made out to be. However, maybe the best representation of a semi-cooperative game to date. Kudos for that.

Holy Moly. One of the most THEMATIC games I have ever played. You live the struggle of a colony of survivors during the zombie apocalypse. You want your group to progress, but you must also worry about keeping everyone fed, about the hordes of the undead banging at your walls, about the group of raiders threatening to steal your stuff! The threat of death is ever present, and the undead slowly fade to the background as you begin to distrust your fellow survivors. Fear, suspicion, and ulterior motives. This game takes the psychological zombie thriller and converts it flawlessly into a board game.

I can understand why this is one of the more popular zombie games: the crossroads cards are fun story element, the theme is strong and well applied and lots of characters bring variability. However, in our game there was bit too long downtime between turns and also throwing for damage is annoying as you might get killed outright with no chance of survival very randomly (when travelling outside). Even when you have many characters I think that is the weakest rule of the game.

RATING: 8
A meta-cooperative psychological survival game where players lead a faction of survivors in a test of the group's ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside the colony.  Players are working together toward one common victory condition--but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective.  The secret objective helps create the tension and suspense that makes the emergent story all the better.

Played it at a local shop. Had a blast. I dislike the secret objectives, because, in the words of another reviewer, I felt like the secret objectives are a cheap way to hide the betrayer. The betrayer should win because they're better than the other players and not because the loyal team members were confused when a loyal player held on to extra gasoline.

Still, would recommend and play again. Especially around Halloween/Winter for the theme.

Average. Take it or leave it. 

Reasons for Selling
1. The game really requires group discussion on everyones turn, so that you aways feel included. Else given that a player can do a number of actions on their turn, it can be a long wait till your next turn. However, all that discussion each turn means that this can be a long game if everyone is not fully engaged.

2.I get that this game is all about theme but the scenario text on the Crossroads is too long and also extends the game length. I'd of preferred a sentence rather than a paragraph on the cards - to help the game play quicker. Also once you eventually get to the 2 choices - they are not even that interesting.

3. Outcomes too reliant on the exposure dice roll. 

4. Hate it when games state that they play with 2 - this game does not play well with 2. You really need 3-5.

Crisis
- in a 2P game the crisis cards are too simple and repetitive. Simply contribute two of the required items to the crisis. Crisis is different in 4P game due to face down and shuffle being relevant.

Secret Objectives
- I feel that these are such a fundamental part of the game that not having them means that game is just not enjoyable to play with 2P

Crossroads
- often the condition under which a crossroads card should trigger doesn’t happen in 2P. Not enough characters in play doing relevant actions.

I have such a strange relationship with this game. 

I've never really enjoyed playing it with others. It's a lot of bookkeeping, the mechanics the game is centered around aren't that interesting (yay, searching decks for that one card you hope for is so much fun...), and so many crossroad cards are so hard to actually have trigger that I'll only actually see 10% of the ones we draw per game. The whole betrayer aspect didn't seem quite what I expected either, I just didn't experience it as this ever-present threat

But I enjoy this a lot more while playing by myself, controlling multiple groups of survivors. I feel like I'm much more able to sit back and let the game tell it's narrative this way without dealing with those that are trying to min-max things.

I preordered The Long Night months ago, but I'm honestly considering cancelling it. I watched an early play through and it just looks like more of the same.

This is my favorite (semi) co-op. I'm not a huge zombie fan, but the game is smooth enough to get me interested. DoW has the best use of a traitor in any game I've played. The crossroads system added with the fires the group has to deal with every round makes for an amazing story without causing the gameplay to suffer in any way. This game creates story in a more natural way than any other I've yet played.

Wonderful theme and game-play, (even though the zombie thing is played out), The art is awesome "30 days of night style" The cross roads cards are funny and serious, Some Lol moments. Great game and would play any time, if i have 3-5 people or "victim's".  


Don't get to play very often, but when i do, i love it.

I can’t see how a zombie-themed cooperative game can still be considered innovative: nonetheless, as a matter of fact Dead of Winter is a very good game of its own.

The secret objectives - as well as the possibility of having a betrayer in the group - help make it less of your usual cooperative and more of a competitive game, where everyone shares a common objective (that is, survival to some extent) but sees to his own interests first.

Kind of like the real life.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
WAY overrated.  The Crossroad cards were interesting, but in thinking about it, they really are not that different than what's in Robinson Crusoe (other than a different player reads the card?). Also, I thought the secret objectives were eh.  Most of them seemed to be related to hoarding some type of resource. I think if i wanted this xp in a coop, I would rather just play Robinson.  If I wanted the traitor element, I would rather just play BSG. Didn't hate the game, and I would play it again, but as much hype as this game was getting I expected way more...

Update 1(3/13/15):
---------------------
After playing a more interesting scenario (other than the first one) with 4 players, I found the game to be much more enjoyable.  While I still don't think its as interesting as many of the review will lead you to believe, I actually do think I like this one better than BSG (Ignore my comments above).  It is more stream lined than BSG, and also takes half the time (plus it has the cross road cards with give some thematic flavor)

One play with four players. For what it is, it's a fun game. The theme is really strong here. If you like zombies and co-ops and don't mind if a game takes a good bit of time to play, this is a great choice. Also if you like games with a touch a story for flavour, it's very good, just keep your expectations within check -- it's not a story-driven game.

The Crossroads deck is fine but it's just event cards with a minor twist -- not the revolutionary new mechanism that some people seem to be claiming. More clever are the secret personal victory conditions that mean there will often be a push-and-pull when it comes to discussing what to do and how to do it. Games that play around with the black-and-white win-or-lose victory conditions have a special place in my heart. Excellent idea and for the most part a good implementation. Except for one aspect.

My main problem, mechanistically, is the secret personal victory condition of "betrayer". I don't dislike hidden traitor games, and have enjoyed SOC and BSG in the past. But in that type of game, typically the traitor is limited in how much damage they can do at once, so they have to act over time, which means they have to be more subtle so they can get away with sabotage for longer. In this game, the traitor can do a colossal amount of damage in a single turn, meaning they don't even have to try to hurt other players much before the end of the game, which means that there is nothing to go on to allow you to suspect anyone. It becomes a game of complete co-op for 98% of the game, then you find out in the final turn if it was all worth the hours of effort because the presence of a traitor will seemingly almost ensure a loss.

This is a really big problem that turns me off from playing it again. I'd prefer it as a pure co-op, but apparently the pure co-op doesn't have the hidden objectives. I think this is a really great innovation, I would definitely prefer keeping those. And I see then *why* you have to have the possibility of a traitor, so people working slightly against the group to achieve their hidden objective will be placed under suspicion. I get it.

My only problem, truly, is the the traitor is simply too powerful. Nerf that and I'd be pretty happy with this game.

RATING: 8
I like the idea of this with its possible hidden betrayer and people with secret objectives and the possibility of actions being triggered by what you do on your turn through crossroads cards. But, with all these things, it doesn't always work - cards can sometimes rarely (or never) be triggered. And people don't always efficiently pursue their goals. More plays may help this.

Egy nagyon jól eltalált játék. Az egyetlen hibája, hogy az akciólapok miatt olyan szintű játékfennakadás történik néha, hogy nagyon lelassítja a játékot. Persze szerintem ez lehet gyorsabb is, ha már rutinosak a játékosok. Tetszik benne, hogy nem egy olyan kooperációs játék, melyben egy ember képes átvenni a vezetést mindenki felett. Itt tényleg magadnak kell meghozni a döntés némi kommunikációval. Ajánlott játék, de csak jó angolosoknak

My favorite coopertive game. Play as survivors in a zombie apocalypse in dead of winter. You have one common objective that you all have to complete while keeping moral up, but everyone has their own private objective they need to complete so they can win. 

There's also a small possibility of a traitor, but it's hard to tell if someone is a traitor of just being selfish with their own objectives. 

Random event cards provide a really nice spice to gameplay

We played the beginning scenario (4 player and by chance had no traitor) and it was a lot less tense than I expected. When we were done someone mentioned how they liked the waste mechanic and it made me think that there were a lot of nice balances put into the game. We had 2 or 3 crossroads cards trigger in our game. The biggest issue I had was with the varying difficulty level of the personal objectives. I was able to complete mine, two others seemed pretty attainable, and one seemed really difficult. I'd like to try it again with a different scenario, but it seemed like a solid game.

RATING: 7.5
Possible betrayer mechanic is a hit, as is the flavor text on the game cards. This is simple enough for new gamers but complex enough to satisfy experienced gamers, so it gets played a lot. Only fault is there is some luck involved as if your secret objectives align with the group objectives, you can have an easier path to victory than others.

This is a story telling game dripping in great theme. The crossroads mechanic is great and adds to the feel of not know exactly what is going to happen next. Warning things can go very very wrong and no you won't win all the time. But its the story that gets told here that matters not the winning or losing.

This is the game that finally knocked Shadows off it's perch. The way the traitor system works in this game is a much needed improvement over Shadows. The crossroads mechanic is awesome making very little down time for players keeping people invested. My only minor nit pick is zomebies. I can go my zombie on anywhere. I'm not a zombie hater though but I am sure once something a little more interesting and unique in theme hits in this Crossroads series it might hit the bench.

There is so much to love with this game.  The components and artwork are fantastic.  I love different abilities for each character. I love the dice rolling to determine actions. The exposure die is lots of fun and adds a good amount of tension to your decisions.  We only had one Crossroads card trigger during our entire first game.  That was really the only disappointment I had, but I suspect that is an unusual result.  Lots to explore with so many different main objectives and secret objectives.

Reasons to avoid -- the game doubles in length with 5p compared to 3p.  Also, it can be complicated to decide which variants to use and how to resolve certain rules (i.e., Johnnie will be bored).  The game is supposedly best when played with betrayer variant & player elimination variant (b/c otherwise there's only a 45% chance of a betrayer meaning frequent fully co-op games and the rules if player loses all of his characters aren't so great).

Good review:

This is a really special game. It's not just that this game is in the discussion for the best traitor game available in an already strong field of competitors. It's not just that it balances key elements in the game which give rise to some terrific emergent, social play. The game is something special in the tone that it creates - a feeling that playing the game is doing something serious. I love the fact that the rule system has created warring cultures fighting about the "proper" (even "ethical!") way to play the game, provoking some interesting meta-game discussion. I love this about it - not to mention it's fun. I have yet to see whether it can equal Battlestar but I look forward to exploring further.

The buzz was loud!

And for a reason... the game is very good indeed! 

A lot have been said about this one, so I'll not be long.

I'd say that DoW is the most accurate The Walking Dead rip off translated to a boardgame. Are the walkers the biggest danger in the game? Not! Not even close! The humans are! The selfish nature of human beings will create a sense of paranoia since the begining of the game. Is there a traitor out there? Maybe not... or is it? Why would the other player do such actions? Is he protecting him to achieve his goals or is he trying to screw all of our plans? You'll never know... or will you?

That's the game! The dense interation that is created by personal goals! The drama created by the Crossroad Cards only makes it more enjoyable!

One of the best co-op games ever! Co-op? Hmmm let me think about it!

I love the stories in this game, and that it's a cooperative game. Also, that there's hidden agendas for each player and one might be out to ruin everything.

Really fun semi cooperative. Ranks up there near Battlestar Galactica for me. Crossroads are great and loved saying "Stop". There was a junkie ninja the entire game due to the crossroads cards. Really adds flavor. Would play pretty much any time it hits the table.

10/16/14 - 1st game: 4 players, intro scenario to kill zombies and get 12 tokens. had a traitor that won the game when morale hit 0. Had victory conditions just too many deaths and zombies that piled up at the end. Also didnt have the necessary food/crisis at the end. Tough to win but really fun.

Takes the right group for this game.  Not quite easy enough for non-gamers, but it is close.  You're not going to make a lot of strategic decisions in this game, which is unfortunate.  It's more of a choose your adventure/deduction game and for the length it takes I prefer other games.

This game was dull! The over-hyped crosswords cards rarely triggered in the game I played, and when they did they where anticlimactic. I don't understand why anyone would enjoy playing this game.

RATING: 7.5
Another coop/semi-coop game set during the zombie apocalypse. Same(ish) as most of the genre with a bit of a twist in the things that might happen during each player's turn (the "crossroads" cards). One of you might be the "betrayer" (also common for the genre) as one of the players might secretly be trying to sabotage the team and thus win instead of them. Each player also has a "personal" objective on top of the group objective. So, unless you are the betrayer who wins if the group fails, in the case of a team win, you can still "lose" if you fail to meet your individual object. All these ideas sound better than they appear to play out based on only a small number of plays so far.

Has a way to go to out-do Battlestar Galactica, but I'm willing to see if I've missed something...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
BSG this isn't. The crisis is done after everyone's turn, and you pretty much twiddle your thumbs when everyone else has their turn. Characters are disposable, so I struggle with who I'm represented in the game ... But as each character has a special ability and stuff they are good at and stuff they're not, the decisions are fairly trivial when it is your turn.

Overall, much much rather play BSG for a traitor/coop game.

This game is a roller coaster - even if you are the traitor ;) We have a house rule - it's pretty boring without a traitor, so we always have one.
The game is easy to learn, but hard AF. It's more like a social experiment, if you play it with the right group - and I think this is the best game to play with random strangers.

I have numerous great memories with this game.

Love it.

RATING: 5
The appeal of this game isn't in its depth or amazing layout or components. I can see this as a roleplayers dream! The best thing from this game is the player interaction. All the crisis feel the same and the only thing that feels "gamish" is trying to decide if there is a betrayer or not.

Even though there are a few different objectives to play through, it all feels the same. If you are playing a "short" game or a "long" game.....it doesn't really matter cause your doing the same thing from game to game.

RATING: 2
I'm growing to despise this game, and I may begin to turn it down because my lack of enthusiasm is rubbing off on people and ruining the game for others.

The crossroad cards are just awful.  If you read both results before choosing, they're inconsequential and gamey, and if you don't read the results, they're wildly unbalanced.  Players can also horde survivors, which hordes actions, creating significant downtime where players spend so much time doing nothing.

It's a less tense, less fun, less thoughtful version of Battlestar Galactica (which it ostensibly replaces) with tons of exploitable holes in the ruleset.  I've tried so many times to get the appeal and I just can't...

What a spectacular game.   Dripping theme, and a lot a events and strategy to boot.   I will start off with say this, move on from the recommended starting scenario "need more samples".   It is very boring compared to the other scenarios.

Great use of a the Zombie theme, without being just another Zombie game.   Lots of strategy and teamwork here, and a traitor aspect that blends in extremely well.

The crossroads aspect is really unique and adds a really cool element to the game that similar games lack.

RATING: 8
Semi-coop game where you're trying to accomplish a shared goal but also your own secret goals.  And it's that push and pull between contributing and being selfish that makes the interesting.  There's also the possibility for a betrayer and I like the betrayer variant which increases the likelihood of having one.  The crossroads cards give the game a good sense of story.  The theme is great and fits well with the mechanics- it does feel like you're a group of survivors in the zombie apocalypse like in Dawn of the Dead or The Walking Dead.  And strangely, although there's so many zombie games, very few seem to capture this sort of struggle for survival.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Quite easily one of the best board games I have ever played.  Here is a list of all the things you have to keep in mind on your turn:  Does the colony have enough food?  Is there too much waste in the waste pile?  Are we going to solve the crisis for this round?  How close are we to completing the main objective?  How close am I to completing my secret objective?  Is there a betrayer among us?  If so, who could it be and should we cast a vote to expose them?  Maybe I'm the betrayer, so how do I stay incognito until the right moment comes to make my move? What kind of curve ball will get thrown at us if a crossroads card is triggered this turn?  So much awesome tension from turn to turn.  The game is played with 2 to 5 players.  The more players, the better the game.

Very fun co-op game with a possible 'traitor' mechanic. Great theme, some luck although minimal, great quality components. We played 5-player and had a traitor in our group; on reflection with the victory conditions we had it seems like it would be very easy for the traitor to sabotage the entire group, if not win themselves.

Edit June 2015: Have played multiple times. One of the best co-ops, if not the best, I've played. I even don't mind the complete randomness of the Exposure dice, it does just spice things up and you feel like you have a 'story' to tell after your game is done. Fantastic game.

Edit May 2017: Knocking down to an 8. I don't have nearly the desire to play this as I used to: in part perhaps because the expansion was so underwhelming. Would still happily play, but I'm not "itching" to play any time like I am with any game rated a 9 or higher.

My main group tends to not love co-op or semi-co-op games, or if we're in the mood they'd rather throw down Battlestar Galactica. I still prefer dead of winter for the agency you have on your turns. I love the storytelling side of it, and I consider it a bit of a Next Step game where if I have casual gamer friends looking for a dramatic, tense and longer evening, I can throw this down. However, with five and mostly non-gamers, I've had at least one terrible, slow, drawn out experience. A great story in a box, an excellent deep challenge for a group of friends, but definitely depends on your group being willing take it seriously and to dive in for 2.5 to 3+ hours, and that's with someone cracking the whip. Try it with four if anyone's new.

I have come to the realisation that co-ops are just not for me. Although some do provide pleasant gaming moments, and BSG had some thrilling games, on the whole they to pedestrian, luck based of playing vs. the system and substantial downtime. DOW is a solid co-op game but our group just couldn't get into it and it suffers from the above issues. Nothing makes it stand out from the crowd of co-ops.

RATING: 8
This is a fun game, but it is slightly dependent on the group you're playing it with. It looks more complex than it is and organization of all the components can be a nightmare unless you have something like the Broken Token insert (which I finally did get and has made a world of difference), but if you can get past both of those knocks, it's a pretty fun experience.

One of my personal favorites. A fun blend of role-playing and board gaming. Most likely you will lose. Starvation sneaks up on you. Moral is almost impossible to maintain. Death is everywhere and immanent. It`s more of a game to survive as long as possible rather than beat the game itself. And there is always at least one traitor to the group, whether intentional or not.

Fantastic game. One of the few that actually lives up to all the hype. 

Mechanically a solid co-op, and the crossroads cards are a fantastic part of that - but the definitely shines with its hidden traitor mechanic. All the other game of this ilk we play usually devolve (in the best and most fun possible way) into backstabbing, lying and overly role playing our parts. Dead of Winter creates a genuine sense of unease at the table, and very interesting and fun social dynamics. I only expect my rating to increase with more plays as the game seems like a masterpiece.

I had huge expectations before playing this particular game and I wasn't disappointed at all.
In the past I've often thought about getting Shadows over Camelot or Battlestar Galactica because of the traitor mechanism. The idea of a Semi-Co-Op is really appealing to me and with Dead of Winter I have finally gotten my game.

I really like that game a lot. You don't know wether there is a traitor or not and everybody is accusing everybody else. You can never be sure if just the world is beating you down or if there is really someone who tries to sabotage...

And the crossroads cards are also a really cool thing that push the story forward. But I'd rather play it that way that you don't read the consequences of the card so you can't think what might be worse. You want to see what that decision brings? Choose it and you will see.

I'm really confident that this will be one of my favourites very soon.

Great thematic game. Basically, it's a streamlined, simplified, story-driven version of Battlestar Galactica. Crises are resolved with cards contributed anonymously by players, traitors can sabotage the crisis by adding bad cards, and then the suspicion begins...

The crossroads cards are awesome, and contribute greatly to the game's flavor and fun. The secondary objectives also add lots of suspicion among the players. I do wish this game had something similar to BSG's destiny deck, which added some uncertainty as to the presence of a traitor. On the other hand, in DoW it's so undesirable to be discovered as the betrayer that it is in players' best interests to prevent their discovery as long as possible. Overall, a fun game that my friends who hate zombie games will gladly play.

It is too long for my taste, too repetitive, too swingy, and too easy for the traitor because he can wreak massive morale loss on his turn when he is the last player for the round and nobody can do anything about it (and he has a double-turn if he needs it by going first the following round).  I enjoy the theme, and the foreboding of zombies stacking up in locations is fun, but the actual play of the game does not appeal to me.

This game has alot going for it. There is quite alot of complexity there, for those amongst us who like thinking situations though. But its still, in essence not that difficult a game to learn (and to enjoy as a first time player). There is a ton of replay value, with alot of characters to discover, situations to overcome and just alot of depth to keep you coming back for more and more (i introduced some friends to this game and we acutally played it 3 times in a row because they loved it so much)

What is this game about? Survive! Against hunger, against zombies and sometimes even against other players (because there is always a possibility that one (or more) person draws a traitor card). Manage your survivors, hunger, clean up your garbage, scavange for the needed supplies in the many locations included in this box.

Why you should not buy this game? If you don't like the whole zombie apocalypse theme (if you cant immerse yourself in the theme then you will not enjoy it as much, obviously).

This is a great game for anyone who likes the zombie apocalypse and likes a rich story in a board game. While there might be some minor balance issues, the game on the whole is very well designed and easy to learn, at least if you're not new to board games in general. And for gamers like me, who enjoy great fluff, the atmosphere of the game alone is enough to give it a high rating.

Co-operative or semi-cooperative game.  You're a colony of survivors with a possible traitor among you.  You must explore for goods and take out zombies while also trying to simply survive and achieve a personal and overall objective before the last round (or before morale bottoms out).

Survivor cards are assigned randomly and a lot of them are pretty cool.  Personal favorite is Sparky when he gets a bunch of weapons.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good cooperative game despite the zombie that didn't really appeal to me. Players must survive a zombie outbreak by gathering supplies ta various locations and make sure to feed the survivors and foil the zombie attacks. I'm usually not keen on co-ops but the replayability of this one is very impressive the multitude of characters, the different scenarios, and the crossroad cards that insure that that each game will feel different than the one previous one. I also love that the scenarios have different lengths so you can make the game last as short or long as you want. I also like the include of the possible traitor which keeps the tensions alive throughout the game. The dice rolls and card draws are a bit too luck-dependent for my taste and the game would probably become repetitive if played too often but it's still a game I'm happy to play every now and then.

Dead of winter is an amazing zombie survival game, where secrecy and strategy play a massive part. Although the board and rule book can be daunting to look at/read; the game is actually quite intuitive after the first play through. The steps of each turn are clearly laid out on player cards that each player receives when playing the game.

Each player has a goal that they must complete along with the main objective and crisis cards, making every game different. You can play a few ways (definite traitor, possible traitor and no traitor) and each way is fun in it's own way.

The set up and pack down of the game can be a little clumbersome and take a while, but is worth it and is made slightly easier by zip-lock bags that come with the game. 

New players can sometimes be daunted by the rules, so what I do when teaching this game is to lay out the basic rules (How to move, Use an action, Exposure dice and searching) and then say that the easiest way to learn the game is to play it. After a few turns, everything makes sense and everyone is playing with ease.

I'm surprised at how well this game works. I was surprised to see a game of this type actually carry a narrative fairly well (and by narrative, I'm talking about the interactions between characters and the decisions they take that form a story, not a series of chained events that barely make any sense like you find in most story board games (EH, AH, FanG, TotAN...).

I was shocked to see that the only die rolled for resolution was the die of death and that most die rolls are done to create the decision space where you choose your actions for the round. I expected dice for resolution all around based on the other games from this company.

I am in love with this game creating a game where the number of winners can range from 0 to everyone, depending on personal goals and the group goal (the tension between those two is what really drives the narrative). Also, for those who think this is a coöp, wait until someone proposes exiling you, not because they think you're a betrayer, but simply to make it easier for the rest of them to win.

I am super glad they went with standups because this many minis would have resulted in the same thing as in Flying Frog Games games where you have trouble figuring out who's who (you can easily have 18 different characters on the board at once in a four player game, imagine trying to tell them apart as two or three cm high unpainted minis with typical levels of detail for a board game).

The game's biggest flaws are, for me, it's complicated rules, and the fact that I wonder, if I want to create a story at the table with my friends, why not simply play a story game?

Very tentative review based on 1 play with 3 players:

I really did not get a good feel for this game based on the introductory scenario. Perhaps our mental approach to the game was wrong, but the objective was easy enough and it was obvious that there was no traitor that we could all just work together and accomplish our goals, so the game's entire shtick didn't really come into play.

On paper, this seems like a cool idea but the first game just felt like any other themeatic American game - there weren't a lot of truly interesting choices to make, but perhaps they'll feel more interesting in a harder scenario. But oddly for an American game, there were a few things that really hurt my ability to get into the theme.

I guess maybe I have trouble feeling attached to my characters when they can come and go so easily. It's for this reason that the secret objectives and traitor actually feel themeatically awkward to me - it's not a character that's a traitor, it's me, the player. It's not a character that's trying to complete these objectives, it's me, the player. It's the difference between feeling like "Oh no! I'm going to die from zombies!" and "I'm going to lose the game." - the stakes feel more themeatic and intense in the first sentence.

Perhaps if you didn't gain new survivors as you went on, I would feel differently. In Lifeboats, for example, it doesn't take long for our group to be at each other's throats in a BIG way as we start watching our only guys die and our numbers dwindle.

The Crossroad cards are a cool idea, but I suspect they won't stay interesting in a narrative sense after a few games when you've seen them before. They serve a gameplay function, but it's sort of at the expense of making them more thematically and narratively interesting - if you didn't know the exact outcome of your choices until you made them, that would make things more emotionally and themeatically tense and interesting, and give you an added reason to play again and make different choices. As they are, even under all that flavor text, they feel a little cold and mechanical to me.

So we'll see if a harder scenario can make this game really shine.

A mediocre cooperative with traitor gaming experience. All it does is remind me of every other zombie game I have played. Go to a location, search, try to get weapons, kill zombies, achieve bizarre random mission. Lots of moving, searching, killing - moving searching killing. Is this what RPGs are like? Ugh. The individual goals are completely arbitrary and depending on how the scenario plays out can be essentially unachievable.
 
The traitor aspect creates some tension, but it all feels forced by the players, desperately trying to get into it. It isn't strategic tension, or decision-making tension. Just the tension of uncertainty - like someone has a secret that you're not in on. Game seems very easy without the traitor, and very difficult to win with one if they time it well. 

A decidedly meh experience that brings nothing new to the table.

RATING: 7.5
As many others I also looked forward to try this semi-coop game as it sounded like it would replace Battlestar Galactica. Now, I’ve never been a fan of that game as it’s waaay too long, but I do love the traitor mechanism and love social deduction games with hidden roles and agendas etc., so DoW sounded like a game right up my alley. I’m pleased to say that my high expectations were met!

I don’t really care about themes in games, but I guess the zombie theme is kind of neat, and it integrates well into the mechanics (or rather vice versa). The game can be played in various ways due to the several scenarios available, and there are both scenarios for short games (~1 hour) and longer games. So far I’ve tried 3 different scenarios, and because of the winning condition each of them played out differently.

Speaking of the winning conditions, one of the best things about the game is the fact that everybody needs to achieve the overall goal of the game, or everybody loses. However, you can only win if you have achieved your own private goal as well! This means that sometimes players will act irrationally – and this is why it’s awesome that there is also a traitor included in the game! He has his own goal/objective and tries to get the morale to 0 etc., and the tension about who is the traitor is awesome – and actually there might not even be a traitor in the game due to the way the roles are dealt at the beginning of the game! But the tension alone and the fact that there probably is, but you’re never sure, a traitor, is awesome. The traitor obviously needs to not be too suspicious at the beginning of the game in order not to be exiled, but there are many subtle ways the traitor can wreak havoc (I won’t list them here as you need to find out yourselves!)

I’ve been the traitor myself in one of my playthroughs, and I would most likely have won on the following round, but one of the other players rolled a tooth 2 times and another player 1 time, which meant the morale dropped to zero a round before it should have in order for me to win! We were swarmed by zombies and the good guys had no chance of winning, but those die rolls can be brutally random and made me lose as well! At least it was a lot of fun so I don’t mind. In another one of our plays the traitor got exiled in the same round as the game ended. He had no way of winning, but as he was exiled he got a new objective, which he was extremely lucky to accomplish on his last action! The game certainly creates some memorable moments…

I like the different characters and the fact that you control multiple characters that each have special abilities. The way you all need to contribute to the crisis deck is neat too, although be aware of the traitor! It also felt like a zombie-film, sort of, because more and more zombies arrive where you are or if you make too much noise. I didn’t care for the crossroads cards; their primary job is to add some randomness and uncertainty to what can happen/is happening, and also to include a bit of story and background theme. It works, I guess, but I’m not the target audience for that kind of thing.
All in all, DoW is definitely a good coop game with a traitor. I think it’s slightly better than Shadows over Camelot and a lot better than Battlestar Galactica, Police Precinct and most other games of that type. It plays rather fast, there is a lot of tension due because of the traitor, and the way you win (need to accomplish both the overall and personal objective) is great!

RATING: 5
I liked the theme, fitting title and components which are well done and better than countless grey plastic miniatures. The teleporting of items between characters searching different locations and the dog equipped with martial arts abilities detracted from the experience and once you decide what your characters are best at there aren't many interesting decisions to be made each turn. Also because the red infection die can kill off a character in one roll, there's even less incentive to change locations. It has a similar feel to BSG (co-operative with hidden traitor) but plays faster which is a plus.

And again I notice that most Coops are just not my kind of game. While this has some value, esp. for its theme, I woiuldn't recommend it or ask for it to be played. My heavily depend on the scenario (I only played twice (and was the traitor both times!)).

Interesting extremely thematic implementation of a survival game in a Zombie-Apocalypse. Feels adequately "realistically gritty" with hard choices and some emotional turmoil. It does not shy away from gruesome themes and decisions.

It may play out over the long run once all the story-discovery is gone, but I believe it will be a fun ride until then.

Mechanically it is interesting but without the theme it does not offer a lot.

Some neat things about this game: the crossroads cards are well done and add enough variety to the game to really produce some narrative to the experience, also I liked the struggles of the main co-op objective in contention with the secret player objective with a possible traitor, which is handled nicely.  Another positive aspect is the plethora of expendable characters to choose from and you hang on to them just long enough to Identify with them. The rest of the game is a simple move and shoot zombies though, which is somewhat bland since the zombies really never fight back if you keep them managed.

RATING: 8
Looks and plays great. Plus, it comes with plenty of baggies for parts (and you'll need them). With so many Crossroad Cards the chances of having the same game is slim to none, even if you use the same scenario. Difficult and challenging, but basically unlimited lives means everyone will survive (and be participating) until the game is over, win or lose.

RATING: 9
Best way to describe it is The Walking Dead: The Board Game. This actually focuses more on the individual players and their goals than the zombies themselves. The crossroad cards keep it interesting, and the variety of potential objectives each player has leads to interesting decision making.

Dead of Winter games have been some of the most suspenseful games that I have played.  I have managed to win only once (first game was a group loss, the second was a group and personal win, and the third was a group win, but personal loss).  The secret agendas cut down on the potential of an alpha gamer taking over since everyone is looking to complete their own missions as well as the group mission.

RATING: 1.1
The game is really a 7, so this low rating is a protest against poor playtesting. The game often rests on a razor's edge. That is great! But it does so even WITHOUT a traitor.

The traitor can lay low until what is the de facto last round of the game. That round in which everyone knows that the game will be won or lost. The traitor will often realize that he can't fulfill his objective during this last round. The traitor goes all-in on the contribution and tanks the game. So no one gets to win. And there is no way to exile a traitor who doesn't show himself until the last round. No extra turns in which to exile him.

I just wish the game had something, anything, to prevent this sad ending. I've seen it happen in ALL THREE games I have played. It's just WAY TOO easy to tank the game. Frankly, I'm surprised I have yet to see a good guy tank the game when he can't complete HIS secret objective.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The whole idea of winning and losing is messed up beyond belief. Traitors can tank the game "just because," fellow non traitors can make you lose "just because" without affecting their own personal odds of winning. The crossroads mechanic is entirely disruptive to a player's turn. Downtime between turns is horrid and only made worse by the Crossroads cards (to the point where if one of those triggered I was frustrated more than anything else). It's everything that's bad about thematic gaming and very little of what's good. That said, there's some neat ideas here, but far from being a fun experience.

I also find I generally dislike these traitor co-ops where the traitor can pretty much do everything in their power to try to *help* players win only to simply tank the game at the very end, even if the odds of victory are already very slim. Makes the traitor nigh on impossible to find, makes an already difficult to win game beyond difficult to win, and distills all traitor decisions down to a simple "eff you" gesture at the very end. I feel like BSG and Dark Moon fall into this camp too.

I bought Dead of Winter because of all the stellar reviews it's received. Honestly, it's the most disappointing game I've ever played. The gameplay is dull, the strategy is very limited (there is a very clear "best way" to do things), and the personal objectives lead to a very unfulfilling victory for the one person who manages to complete both the main objective and their own.
All of my friends feel the same way. Are we missing something?

This game is awesome, great artwork and theme is very well integrated. only suggestion is maybe next time with all the cardboard standees-make the backgrounds on the zombies a different color-for right now we are using loom bands to tell each players colors, but when they are in the box and you are hunting for the characters it gets a little tedious.

I really like this game.  It is not so complex that I can't teach to new players but also not so simple that I can see through the mechanics.  The meta-co-op works really well.  I like the fact that the game's challenge is roughly the same based on the number of players yet that challenge pops up from differing moving parts.

RATING: 9.5
Una delle ultime grandi sorprese del genere cooperativo con traditore, Dead of Winter si presenta come un gioco con tantissime regole, ma che con poco tempo e nel corso dei turni filano liscio nella loro semplicità. La meccanica dell'obbiettivo segreto fa in modo che ogni giocatore agisca in modo sospetto e viene accompagnata da buffe o devastanti crossroads e personaggi assurdi come Forest Plum! Se a tutto questo poi si aggiunge la recitazione, ne esce fuori una storia ancor più tragicomica degna dei classici horror demenziali. Grande gioco, di cui non si sente minimamente il tema zombie, ma si sente tantissimo la voglia di esiliare qualcuno e atmosfere sospette!

I love this game. I like very much the thematic of the game and the mechanism of a cooperative game with the traitor. There are a good variety of scenarios and the idea of crossroad cards is very original. The presence of luck factor is present and it could be determinant to get a victory in this game. I like to play this game 4 - 5 times per year with players that like to "live" the game.

Got this game after seeing it featured on an episode of table top.  The concept of simultaneously working with a group to survive (all while one of them may be a secret backstabber) is fantastic. 

The game's pace can be optimized for long, medium, or relatively short play sessions.  I liked that you were controlling a group of survivors, rather than a single person who may live or die.  

Sometimes the game is punishingly difficult.  While it gives you the opportunity to avoid rolling for exposure, sometimes you simply must do so and rolling the dreaded "bite" mark means instant death.  We had this happen a few times on the very first move action and it immediately made the game much harder. 

Overall there is some replay value.  The game comes packed with a huge assortment of different missions, each of which has a "hardcore" version.  Each time you play you'll be using different characters, finding different items, and you'll have your own secret objectives.  

The "crossroads" cards are a really nice addition to add an extra dimension of choice and randomness to the game.

Ultimately, Dead of Winter works well.  It has a ton of concepts (and pieces) but they're easy to understand and mesh well together.  It teeters on the brink of doing too much but manages to pull it off and I'd recommend this game to any of my friends.

Dead of winter is a good game and delivers everything i expected.  It is challenging and works as well as any co-op i have played.  The added element of a potential trader really gets the game going.

My favorite co-op.  I feel this game handles the traitor mechanic better than BSG or Shadows Over Camelot because the traitor often needs to make plays that do appear to be helpful.

A game i love! but it does not get enough of love on the table. 
It takes some time to play and it is very hard.
I like hard games but some of the people i play with does not. 

In this game you are a character living in a colony after a zombie outbreak destroys the world. 
You need to find resources to keep the colony alive and also to stop crisis that happens every round. 
The art work is very good and the cardboard cutouts is really good so you are not missing minis. 

It is a bit like Battlestar Galactica but much better and sometimes no one is a traitor, but you will probably still be eaten and let your colony burn. 
Great fun and hard as trying to sneak by customs with a pineapple without a suitcase.

This game to me is a 4 player game. Why? With 3 the tension isn't there, and with 5 it plays too long. To be honest, I have never played with a 'long' scenario either - we are always playing the 'short' ones and they are quite long themselves.

There are loads of cool bits and pieces to this game that make it awesome: fun character abilities, searching locations, personal objectives, that exposure dice, and the crossroad cards.

I really want to try the expansion (though as it is the cost of the game it might be a while before I can justify it).

I was swept up in the hype for this before it came out. When I finally got it and played it, I was a bit underwhelmed. I've been trying to figure out exactly why that is over the past couple plays, but I haven't been able to put my finger on it yet. It's certainly not a bad game by a far shot.

I think one of my main issues with it are the secret objectives. Most of them (nearly all, in fact) are some variation of "make sure you have X number of Y items by the end of the game", which isn't a terribly exciting goal to chase after. I get that some of them, like hoarding medicine or guns, might cast suspicion on your actions and make the other players think you're a traitor, but I haven't seen this happen in practice. In fact, the traitor objectives that I've seen seem so ludicrously difficult to achieve that most people half-heartedly go after them but give up near the end of the game once they realize it's impossible to win. That, or they wait until the last few turns and just absolutely wreck morale. It's a weird setup that I'm not sure works for me.

I was also disappointed with the quality of the writing on the mission conclusions and crossroads cards. They seem overly dramatic, verging on campy, and the style just doesn't seem to flow with the tone the game is trying to create.

If I seem overly negative it's only because I can see what an interesting set of ideas this game is. I do like the co-operative aspects of it, with the added tension of a possible traitor (assuming the traitor's goals are actually attainable) I'm definitely going to play this more to come to a more concrete conclusion on it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is an interesting game with some mechanisms built in to build mistrust between the players in an otherwise cooperative game. I think the crossroads cards helping to tell the story of the game and the scenarios that add story make this much more enjoyable than the game would be if it was just the actual game mechanisms. If you really value the story and narrative aspects of game this game can really sing. I personally think that this one is a little shallow mechanically but can still be fun especially if you get into the theme.

This is BSG but with zombies (most over saturated theme), unneeded victory conditions (like we really needed that in an already heavy game) and basically EVERYBODY'S a traitor. But only one is the "canon" traitor. Goodie... not. I never liked semi-coop games and I just played this one and it didn't win me over. It's worse than BSG because everybody is FORCED to be a jerk just to artificially add tension to a game where that needs to come organically AND at least the Cylons didn't need to collect toothbrushes or some garbage to actually win along with messing over the humans.

A welcome change from most zombie games where the goal is to kill the undead (again).
Here it focuses on the survivors and on keeping the colony alive. You still need to deal with the undead, but you need to be much more careful since your survivors are more fragile and each death could mean the difference between winning and losing.
Possible hidden traitor actions make for a tense experience, too.

Let's get the big negative out of the way: downtime. In a five-player game, there's a lot of sitting around doing not a whole lot but watching people ponder their moves. That said, I like those moments when you're offered choices on how to handle a situation, I really like that one of your fellow players MIGHT be a traitor, and I LOVE how the game encourages you to start forming opinions about your survivors (like Sparky the Stunt Dog ... such a good fetcher!). There's even a funky-fun card that requires you to watch and wait for another player to yawn, thus triggering a special action. That's great: it rewards staying involved in the game. If only the game didn't drag so long, especially with five players!

It is a fun game. I will have to give it more plays to accurately rate it, but I have found it to be enjoyable. The one downside is it has been a bit long for the non-gamers I have played with, but I don't see that as a fault of the game, as the theme and mechanics were very easy to teach and engaged everyone I've played with.

A common victory condition and a personal victory condition. Okay, that's clever.

The game is pretty interesting thematically, and it does implement the traitor mechanic better than BSG does. The action dice mechanic feels a bit unnecessary and the game may feel a bit repetitive after a few rounds, but from what I see, no two games will play the same way. I'd like to give it another go to see if it's worth playing or leaving.

I reeeallly wanted to like this game. I ended up selling it (which I don't do often) after I think 4 plays. It's the kind of game that I found myself checking the rulebook every 10 minutes (which is dense and poorly organized) to try and figure out some minute detail to make sure we were playing it right. So exhausting. We often forgot to grab crossroads cards. My last play was at a con with total strangers, most of whom were also new to the game. This ended up being my clear favorite play of the game. One guy kept trying to convince the rest of us that he was the traitor (he didn't end up being the traitor) but we never believed him. It would have been the perfect camouflage for a well-played traitor game. We all had the right combination of humor and focus that the game played out kinda-sorta quickly and was MOSTLY fun throughout. Still, the dang nit-pickiness of the rules and all of the different cards and how they interact with one another, it just kills the momentum of the game. Also, just me but the storytelling aspect never really panned out that well with me or my groups.

Eljött a zombi apokalipszis, néhány túlélő összeverődik a Kolónia nevű helyen, és megpróbál életben maradni addig, ameddig az adott küldetés sikerül, vagy elbukik. Van több küldetés, rövidebbek is, hosszabbak is. Lehet köztünk áruló, aki titokban a többiek ellen játszik, de a kooperáló csapattagok is egyéni célokért kell megdolgozzanak, ha a nyertesek közt akarnak lenni, ami tovább bonyolítja az összképet.

Great theme, unforgiving, and tense gameplay.  Really enjoy it, with or without the modules from The Long Night.  I haven't even bothered playing any of the scenarios on the Hardcore variant, as the game is difficult enough!

Can take a while to teach new players, and unfortunately rounds/games can falter if people don't understand mechanics.  Example: food cards only count as 1 towards the end round event, not the number on the card.  Had people burn high value food cards even after being told at the start...

Highly recommended for those willing to invest time and immerse themselves into the game.  Better with 4-5 players.

Thematically very fun game. It's not so much about killing zombies(usually) but more about survival. Very dependant on the group playing, as the mechanics and strategy are pretty light. Player's mostly just go to locations to mill decks for what they need. With the right group, it's immersive and great fun. With a group that doesn't get into it enough, it's painful and boring.

Not that hard of a game to learn, but not necessarily easy to master.  There is a lot going on, a lot to pay attention to, and a lot of choices to make.  Plus the game can be very challenging to win, especially if there is a traitor amongst the survivors.  It's certainly not just a zombie killing game.  I've had lots of fun with this one.

I've played a lot of games with a traitor mechanic, but nowhere else does betraying your friends in the most devastating fashion feel as satisfying as in this game. Mechanics are tight, thematic and well realized with the possible exception of "teleporting" gear when scavenging. The infection die adds a fitting measure of unpredictability and dread to even the simplest actions. All things considered, I REALLY like this game.

RATING: 5
If you don't play this game the way it's meant to be played, it's not very good.  That's some Zen stuff right there.  I played it with two players in the two player pure co-op variant, which is technically supported on the box, but in the same way I'm still supporting the Seattle Supersonics.  It's a pathetic support for a poorly thought out idea.

With two people and no secret objectives, it's a ludicrously easy and theme-free co-op game that is significantly worse than literally any other co-op activity you could partake in, especially the naughty kinds.

RATING: 9
Love this game, the intensity of everyone working together and the chance of a betrayer and having them reveal at the end is crazy. Just hope it doesn't get old by overplaying it. Also hope for some mini expansions of more Crossroads/objective/charatcter cards to add more life to it.

Amazing game, loyal to the theme! Suspicion of a traitor in the game keeping you in suspense all the time.

Always want to play it! I totally recommend to anyone who likes the theme, cooperative games and stories that unfold with unexpected events.

This is a semi-cooperative game.  Each person has secret objectives that they want to happen to help them win and trigger the end of the game.  However, during this manipulation the zombie hoards need to be controlled.  It is a semi-dark themed game, and I had some terrible luck of dice rolls.  I wouldn't mind giving this game another go.  One thing I don't care for is the cards do have to language issues.

At first as I heard the rules of Dead of Winter being explained, I thought it sounded like a mish-mash of other games. Clearly I was going to prefer those.

To my surprise, it all came together nicely! It really moved along once we got a grip on the rules, and I felt like the playtime was perfect. Two of the strongest aspects of the game for me were the hidden goals for each player, and the Crossroads cards - where something may or may not happen depending on the player's actions.

While I don't think I need to own this game (not sure it would get played often), I will be happy to play anytime I was asked.

Fun, exciting game, with lots of aspects, cool stories and tricky, puzzle-solving gameplay.

Pros: Hard choices, lots of talking and negotiating, betrayer adds another level to the game, nice feeling of working together. Relatively easy to explain.

Cons: Too many pieces to keep a track of, can be frustrating to find stuff. Sometimes very brutal with death being easy. Sometimes too easy to sabotage everything for the others i.e. by eating all the food or attracting zombies.

Searching mini decks for stuff (kinda like eldritch).  great game

After only playing the game 3 times, I've enjoyed every single playthrough.  Definitely an in-depth game of deception, that anyone can pick up and enjoy.  If you have a good betrayer in your group, the deduction process is intense, and will leave you over-analyzing everybody's moves!  Highly recommend.  I feel after a couple more plays, this will be a 10 in my eyes.

RATING: 8
The bulk of the game (zombies, barricades, locations, searching, food, weapons, other items, etc) is entirely serviceable, but no more so than many other zombie / survival games. (Note: I can't recall a zombie game I've bothered playing more than once, so take this comparison with a grain of salt.)

But the psychology of it - the motivations introduced by the secret personal goals, and all the follow-on consequences of those motivations - is *phenomenal*. Individual victory conditions mean players may engage in odd / not-necessarily-good-for-the-group behavior, which in turn makes ascertaining traitors harder, and keeps an atmosphere of wariness even when there aren't any traitors. You can judge something of what people's motivations are through their actions and responses to Crossroads events. There's the crisis each turn for people to contribute to - or not - or sabotage. The option for Exiling a player - and how it's not the end of the road for them whether or not they were a traitor, they're still in the game but with altered victory conditions - adds teeth to the inter-player tension. Absolutely perfect for the type of game that it is.

There's more chance than I tend to like in my games, and having ten zillion figures on stands was a little inconvenient (they kept falling over), but other than that, fantastic.

No se merece para nada el hype que tiene. No es mal juego, pero ya le querria llegar a la suela de los zapatos al Galáctica. La paranoia que se supone que genera el posible traidor no es tal, ya que sabes que todos van a putear a la colonia por culpa de su objetivo secreto. Y las misiones son muy dirigidas y estáticas, una vez tienes claro qué hacer, lo habitual es tirarse varios turnos repitiendo las mismas acciones. Los personajes, una vez llegan a una localización, pocos motivos tienen para irse a otra. Una pena, porque prometia mucho, pero al final resultó una leve decepción.

Tried the Italian edition preview on ModenaPlay 2015, then received for Christmas some months later thanks to my wonderful wife. Wonderful game and great artwork & atmosphere, with some really nice additions such as the Crossroads Cards and the Traitor/Exiled mechanics. It is basically a state-of-the-art cooperative-with-traitor game, with a lot of efforts to improve the genre with new, improved mechanics and a glimpse of RPG-like experience. 

Highly recommended if you love games such as Battlestar: Galactica, Pandemic, Defenders of the Realm (3 games I love) or Shadows Over Camelot (which I personally don't like): as a matter of fact, I find DoW better of all these for the steady mechanics and the super-cool "zombie apocalypse" setting.

Definitely NOT worth the hype it gets.  It is a great game though.  The crossroads cards, hidden traitor element, and hidden victory conditions really save this game for me.  The only reason it isn't a 9 or better is because of it's thin theme (at times) and lack of gut-wrenching tension.

Only two plays, very different. My first playthrough I was the betrayer, and too cautious. Not the fault of the game, and I personally found it very tense as I chose (poorly) my moment to strike. However I imagine that the other players enjoyed it less. Still, I think even with significant downtime between turns it was enjoyable overall for everyone.

The other playthrough was a disaster. One of my starting characters (the better one) died first turn, and I never found another. Another player had a brainfart and managed to convince the other two that he was the betrayer and get himself exiled (it turned out that none of us were). The other player did very well, to the point that he had the vast majority of the characters, so his turns took a long time, and mine took 10 seconds or so. Technically we both won the game, but I certainly didn't feel like it.

It's far from a bad game, but I don't really want to play again.

Decent game, but not a keeper. Lots of downtime between turns and a traitor mechanic that feels like something is off. The Crossroads mechanic is a non-starter.

Great game portrays a zombie apocalypse. My main gripe is that players often choose not to keep their "secret" objectives secret, and work together to achieve each other's objectives. This can ruin the sneakiness and doubt about whether there is a traitor. When played properly by hiding secret objectives it can be great fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Two plays.  For what it is, I like it.  The difference between this and BSG is that in BSG, finding the traitor is basically the meat of the game, whereas with DoW you can win the game without finding him.  I do not like hidden-traitor games where it all becomes about who is the best at bluffing.  The hidden agendas mean that even non-traitors may not always be acting in the best interest of the group.

To enjoy the game though, you have to be extremely patient with random events and things out of your control.  This is not the game for people who want to puzzle out even decision.

Best or worst of the zombie genre, the deciding factor being your play group. Why do I say that? Because it is all about trusting your fellows to not stab you in the back while they try to do their own goals in a very difficult and brutal game world. Just cooperating effectively is hard enough, hell, surviving is hard enough, but add in that extra element and you have this. There is no need for any more zombie games, this one is it. Bravo.

Savez-vous que le zombi est devenu extrêmement populaire dans le monde ludique (63 pages de jeux de zombis référencées dans BGG !). Savez-vous aussi que les zombis adorent les batailles de boules de neige ? Ils n'ont certes pas une cadence de lancé bien grande, mais ils ont l'avantage du nombre. Dead of Winter, c'est un peu ça. Un jeu coop où vous incarnez des groupes de survivants dans une colonie enneigée, et où il va falloir s'habiller chaudement pour aller chercher des medocs, des armes, du miamiam et survivre aux zombis qui veulent faire de vous un bonhomme de chair. Ce jeu a un petit goût de Battlestar Galactica avec des zombis, un traître, des joueurs qu'on peut virer de la colonie par vote, ... le tout scénarisé par des cartes où les choix seront cornéliens.

Great cooperative game with both group and personal objectives and possibility of a betrayer; besides every round there is a crisis the colony must deal with; nice mechanic of crossroad events, a sound mechanic when searching, etc.; good amount of variability; different game lengths depending on scenario; a bit storytelling in it, but easy to skip if you like; dose of luck involved (dice rolling) but not too big

Dead of Winter is such an excellent game that I can completely overlook the zombie theme (which I do not like.) Every game I have played has been tense and exciting: each choice is meaningful and impactful; the objectives are difficult and everyone feels a huge sense of relief and accomplishment when they are met; the betrayer aspect puts everyone on edge and suspicions lead to player tension and unexpected development; the crossroad cards introduce surprise scenarios that randomly alter the tempo. All of them work perfectly together to make each play an experience rather than just a game.

Even though the rules make thematic sense, I find it a tough job to teach to new players because of how many small rules there are. Even small mistakes can significantly affect the balance of the game, so typically the first game with a new group is a write-off.

This game is thematic as hell.  But that doesn't make up for the fact that after you figure out if anyone in your group is a traitor, the rest of the game is just searching for items and trying to complete your side mission so that you will win the game.  The zombies become something on the periphery, and often can be ignored.  

There are moments of greatness that come from the crossroads cards actually taking effect, but that seems to happen only in rare instances for our group.  When it happens, it is magical.  But most of the time, someone draws a card and then just ends up discarding it.  It feels like a letdown every time we pass a turn with nothing happening.

This game is still fun to play with a good group, but I can see it getting stagnant over time.

I really wanted to like this but was very disappointed. The card mechanism is clever and works really well, but in most games not enough cards come out to make it interesting. In those games you are left with moving around, collecting stuff, and trying to complete a goal...all pretty dull. The semi-coop thing doesn't help, since the individual goals can be very unbalanced in how easy they are to achieve. Having a traitor makes it more interesting, but doesn't save the dullness of a normal turn--so playing a game with no traitor (or one who doesn't play well) and few card coming out to shake things up can be about as dull as a three hour gaming session can get.  Spending my game cleaning up trash every turn, or building barricades, just doesn't do it for me. 

And by the way, what's with the tonal shift? In a game that should be grim and tense, having a dog with a rifle and a mall Santa that everyone wants to kill (and Kodiac Colby) seem to be out of place.

My understanding is that the expansion adds some interest to the normal game turn, but I have no interest in investing more money in a game to try to make it good.

Whenever anyone asks what we should play this ends up being my first suggestion for groups of three or more.  Social deduction, zombies, group survival, darker adult themes, all the best aspects of other games but rolled into one nearly flawless funfest.  Some groups read the crossroads cards more effectively than others but that's been solved by the phone app if needed.  It never falls flat.  I've even whipped this out with groups on initially disinterested nongamers and had it win them over.  It's more intuitive than a lot of games with this much complexity.

My one comment for improvement would be the addition of aftergame flavour text for scenario decompression post victory/failure

This is the best co-operative game i knew so far.

Usually i am not found of games with zombies, but this is a special case: these zombies are just an excuse to put pressure on the players, as they must be controlled to not enter the compartiments where are the players, a possible reason to lose the game. These zombies appear in automatic form (depending on the players actions) and are represented by little image tokens, as are the players. Each player controlls one or more of the different characters with special, but equivalent, skills.
Through action points, players must decide where to go and what to search, collecting itens face down (only known to the player) required for the survival of the entire group.
The problem is (and here comes the great features of this game) there could be one or two traitors among them but no one knows for sure if any of them (or both) are present in that specific game (except, of course, the traitors themselves).
This way, the traitors must try to undermine the global effort without giving way their role, while the "normal" characters will be always in doubt if there is one or more traitors among them, as a "normal" player might choose not to help the team because he can´t or because he just wants to score more points at game end, not necessary on account of being a traitor...
Anyway, players might, at any given moment, vote to decide if a certain player should be expelled (remaining in the game as an outcast), but they might be wrong and expel the wrong guy...meaning that the real traitor (if there is one) remains among them!...
A real clever concept for a game and a very immersive adventure!

RATING: 8.25
It is a good semi-cooperative game with fine storytelling mechanisms such as each player having their own objectives, and also Crossroads Cards that inject further flavour into the game. Mechanically, it does have some flaws due to the fact that players need to have complete both their individual and group win conditions to "win". My suggestion is that you should probably play with people who are "nice" (aka not mean-spirited people who will tank the game for everyone for no reason apart from pure spite if they themselves can't win).

RATING: 7
A zombie-themed BSG of sorts. Borrows some mechanics from various games. In addition to BSG, it also shares ideas from Mall of Horror (locations with characters attract zombies), Castles of Burgundy (roll dice, then choose action based on die results), and Robinson Crusoe (events, crises, food/item requirements). Would be much less interesting without a betrayer, IMO.

My only criticisms are that 1) the voting mechanic doesn't work well. There should be 2 tiles (one "Y" and one "N") for each player to use rather than the simultaneous thumbs up, thumbs down.
2) The players can either make or break the game. Like most "experience" games, the mood of others at the table can affect the gaming experience in both positive and negative ways.

RATING: 6
Pros:
- Good components, great theme
- Challenging and can be tense the first few times.
- A little faster than Battlestar Galactica, but not by a significant amount.

Cons:
- Still kind of long for what it gives you, depending on the scenario's round count.
- The hidden personal goals are a cool idea but I don't find that they add much value to the game experience. Feels gimmicky after a while.
- Really boring if you end up with no traitor. It then devolves into a standard group cooperative game of action efficiency.
- Not much to do when it isn't your turn besides group discussion or accusations. That might be fine but if you find yourself in a traitor-less session, the best actions end up being pretty obvious or mechanical.

Decent game, but stop trying to convince me that it's not a re-themed battlstar. EVERY mechanic (with the exception of crossroads cards) was done in battlestar (or one of the expansions) prior to this game coming out; including secret goals (cylon leaders).

Fun game, NOT original

RATING: 7
A very solid game with many a nice component and a excellent presentation. The cardboard is beautiful, the artwork great and the mechanisms intriguing and interesting... BUT: somehow it is not that exciting a game to me. It suffers a little from the same problem as pandemic does; which is not necessarily quarterbacking but that once you understand the mechanisms, you can see that there mostly is a best move to make, making the life for possible traitors pretty hard.

The theme at times stops being there, thanks to the often clunky mechanics. I do LOVE the crossroads cards (better: the idea of crossroads cards) but the vast majority of them just seem to 'trigger' on "If X/player visits location Y".

I like the "story" part of the game. The feeling is like being part of a chapoter of series like the walkin' dead. In this sense, I liked it a lot.

I like a lot the mechanics. The "Cross-roads" cards are cool and I like the way the interaction with the zombies is done. It is threatening but somehow sutile.

On the other hand, I don't like the fact that you lose if you don't achieve both the team objectives AND your individual objectives. This means that, as non-traitor player, if you cannot achive your individual objectives, you no motivation to achieve the team objectives. 

Another problem with the objetvices is that some times, there is not much you can do to influence them. You have just to sit and wait hopeing that things will happen. 

 Keeping that there is lots of luck (your character can just die with one unlucky roll), I think that the game take a bit too long for me. I also don't like that there is quite a long waiting time between players until your next turn.

Even with these negative points, I enjoyed a lot playing the game because of the thematic/story/mechanics aspects. 

I would definitely play the game again with the same group of people but I don't think I would buy it to play with other groups or solo.

Finally got the game to the table with the right mix of people to see the game at a different level. I still feel like it's fairly easy to guess who the traitor is in the game, if there is one. The crossroads cards are pretty fiddly - it's hard to remember them and sometimes decode the trigger event. A solid zombie game that adds some nice player interaction.

[18 Oct 2017] - 6 (7 plays)
Pulled out Dead of Winter because it's nearly Halloween and I haven't really played any of the horror themed games in my collection. We only had 2 so we played it as a co-op zombie game. It worked but felt like a fairly generic co-op game. Without the betrayer there isn't much tension other than staying alive in the colony. This game requires the right type of players and higher player counts in order to really shine. If you have players who aren't emotionally invested in their mission, or who need a lot of guidance in the beginning or you just have lower player counts, the game can turn out to just be a zombie game.

Played twice and was the traitor on both occasions.  Turned out that I didn't really like ruining things for everyone.  In the second game in particular the others had recovered from the brink of defeat and were just about to win when I stabbed them all in the back.  The whole table was deflated.  It has made me feel that maybe traitor games aren't for me.

Woah. This game is awesome. 

Very thematic, hidden roles, betrayer, secret objectives...complex enough, but still easy enough to teach to anyone with 15 minutes of patience.

First co-op game that I truly enjoy. Probably because you can never trust anyone, someone giving orders to other players is quickly deemed a betrayer...

So far, this game has been fun with every group we've played. Yahoowwwww!

We are going to freeze to death, if the hunger doesn't get us first. It's been couple of days now and scavengers are yet to return with hopefully some good news. Last night has been the worst so far. A horde of zombies stumbled straight on to our makeshift base. We would be dead today if it wasn't for Sparky, the stunt dog and his two sniper rifles. He's been a good dog! But sadly, he had to go ... because all of these people have to go. They are weak! I can do better on my own. I'll wait till tomorrow and then show my true colours ...

When I bought it, I didn't know it has an optional full coop mode: that combined with its mechanics FIRED Eldritch Horror to me.

We don't like zombie games but here they aren't central so it's fine.  Anyway, first mission is about killing a bunch of them so it actually FIRED Zombicide too (and I actually prefer the standees over unpainted minis).

Still need to play with more than two to experience secret objectives, betrayals and exiling, but even without these, it's a great game that fits in any collection.

RATING: 9.3
Excellent semi-cooperative game (can be cooperative, and always is with 2-players) where survivors at a post-apocalyptic colony try to fight off zombies, and search for supplies. Always intense, it is challenging to balance the problems at hand...try not to get overrun by the zombie horde, try to feed your people, try to search for desperately-needed supplies, and don't forget the dreaded RED DIE that you have to roll every time you attack a zombie or move to a location. So even if we stop right there, we have a great game on our hands. But what really pushes this game to the next level with me is the Crossroads deck, where events can trigger depending on what you do on your turn. It really adds a depth of narrative and decision-making that is truly innovative, and just plain cool. One of my favorites.

Enjoyed this one - had seen it a couple of times at the meetup, but hadn't reaslised it was a co-op (with hidden roles). As usual, a bit lost for the first couple of rounds, but got into it as the details became clearer. We all lost this time - the traitor wrecked the game, but also didn't achieve their personal goal. Would love to have another go.

Idea of the game is very cool. There is a lot of variety when balancing game (we can choose short/medium/long scenarios, easy/hard variant, pure-coop/semi-coop, low/high change of one player being traitor). I only wish there were more storytelling, crossroads cards are read out rather rarely and scenarios are in fact only an objectives without any narration.

One of our group's favorites. The hidden objective mechanic is a clever way to avoid the alpha player problem in co-operative games. Also, the crossroad cards, though they do get old after a while (we've seen them all by this point), add enough variety to the game that each game feels different.

Thematically one of the best games I've played. The swings that can happen in the game, from finding the wrong card at the wrong time, to triggering a Crossroads card that throws a major wrench in the works, really ramp up the tension. This is seriously one of the most immersive games out there. The artwork is superb, the components are great quality (especially for cardboard chits), and it looks impressively intimidating on the table. Yet, it's a blast. A "Medium" game can last about 2.5 hours or more, so I wonder how long a "Long" game would go.

One of the best purchases I've made, and one of the few games I've given a 10-star rating to.

Haven't really played it much since the first rush.

September 2015 - 7
Good co-op, and first and foremost fixes the issue of the over-controlling player. Everyone has their secret missions, so there's a sense that you're also doing your own thing, and I love how playing your secret mission can start to cast doubt on whether you are the betrayer or not.

Secondly, in my opinion, you play this game for the experience and entertainment. Your group has to find some humor in it, or else it can fall flat. I enjoy the game play and there's definitely strategy on which of your characters does what and in what order, but there will be those rolls where one of your characters die right off the bat and that's that -- you're a man down for awhile.

It can be a little lengthy -- even the short main objectives -- and like most co-ops feel a little old after multiple plays in a short period of time.

All things considered, it's a little overrated but fun in doses.

This is a very nice zombie-game, with some interesting mechanics, like the cross-roads-card, the traitor card, the missions and the event-cards. All these in combination make for alot of replayability, since you never know who the traitor will be, or what missions you will be playing.

Each playthrough requires a new playstyle, according to your personal mission, which I think is a very nice touch. 

All these mechanics do also make for a slightly cumbersome game, that takes a while to setup and get a hold of, but as soon as you've played it a few times, the turns will be quicker and you'll have an easier time playing it.

This is the game that fixes Battlestar for me in every meaningful way. The game is shorter. EVERYONE has an objective. The game is not an automatic win for the betrayer, if there is one. The destiny deck is gone which means hiding screwage is more important. In another sense, this is the zombie game done right! In other words, it's what zombie games should be about rather than just running around killing zombies. A really excellent game if you are into this style of game and the theme.

An enjoyable and accessible co-op/possible-traitor post-zombie-apocalypse game - think 'Walking Dead' theme via a more streamlined, and shorter, version of Battlestar Galactica game mechanics and you are most of the way there.

Having your own objectives to complete on in addition to the group objective and the possibility of a traitor ('betrayer') does solve the issue that besets many co-ops in that they turn into group problem solver with an alpha player who bullies the game.

I do have a couple of concerns about the game:-

- Cycling of the Crossroads cards after a few games will reduce the surprise and challenge of the game.

- Is it too easy for the group to win without a betrayer but too hard for the group if there is one?

- The personal objectives I have seen so far don't always drive enough conflict with the group's main objective to create the paranoia they are probably intended to - it does need to be stressed when teaching the game that hitting your personal objective is paramount over the group.

Still good fun so far.

After 5 plays with 5 people, I dropped my original 10 (after 2 games) to a 9.  Yes, there is a lag between turns but it isn't boring, at least for us.  We are always strategizing.  

Our biggest issue was the Crisis Cards.  It just seemed like we kept getting food ones and the entire game was a food hunt to feed the colony and the crisis deck.  Why does only one food card count instead of using the amount printed on the card? I would like to see more variants in that, but not sure what.

The only reason I don't own is because I primarily play 2 player. I love how this game feels more about survival than zombies necessarily. I really enjoy gathering up a little crowd of survivors and keeping them all fed and alive.

My one criticism is that this game can go long at the higher count and there is a lot of down time in between go's.

Dead of winter is a semi cooperative game based in a zombie apocalypse scenario. The mechanics are based on The typical American style equipment card and rolling dice mechanic. There isn't anything particularly special here but the seem certainly does come through and with the right people it is a lot of fun. The biggest negative thing is that you can't wait for your turn for quite a while. Then you will do two or three random actions with only a few choices that might be mitigated by the other players giving you advice and then you have to wait for another 10 to 15 minutes for your turn. There is really very little to think about when it isn't your turn and there is only so much trash talk you can do. I'm afraid that this game isn't anything too new. But if you like Themeatec games with a traitor element you might enjoy Dead of winter.

[b]OPINIÓN PERSONAL:[/b]
Mi desilusión con este juego fue, en gran medida, culpa de la distorsionada imagen que tenía de él: cuando por fin nos pusimos a jugar, después de haber leído las reglas con detenimiento, esperábamos una partida ágil y trepidante... y los largos entreturnos acabaron rápidamente con nuestras ilusiones.

No es que sea un mal juego, pero si quieres abordarlo tienes que tener en cuenta los siguientes puntos:

 -> Hay que estar dispuesto a jugar una partida lenta: la duración de las misiones más cortas creo que se estima en 60 minutos... pero siempre suelen alargarse (sobre todo si hay algún jugador novato), y al tener un desarrollo tan pausado dan la sensación de durar mucho más. Hay que sentarse con la mentalidad de que va a durar mucho (aunque luego no sea así), y que vas a tener que esperar bastante mientras los demás jugadores hacen sus turnos.

 -> Es un juego cooperativo. Sentarse pensando en un juego semi-cooperativo tirando a competitivo es un error: es bastante posible que ni siquiera haya un traidor, y aunque lo haya tendrá que disimular para no ser descubierto, así que durante la mayor parte de la partida será como si todos los jugadores fuesen aliados. Es más, el juego en sí te impulsa a hablar y debatir con los otros jugadores sobre las acciones a tomar, pues si fueses "a tu aire" los entreturnos se te harían todavía más largos (dado que, básicamente, no te interesaría lo que pudiesen hacer los demás en sus turnos).

 -> Hay que meterse en la historia. Es recomendable leer la introducción de la misión y el texto de todas las cartas que vayan saliendo, intentando meterte en el ambiente que describen. Si te limitas a leer las reglas se te hará bastante soso.

Si cumples los tres requisitos, es muy probable que puedas vivir partidas memorables con este juego, y que para ti sea digno de un notable o incluso un sobresaliente... por desgracia, en mi grupo de juego no encaja demasiado bien.

Extremely mechanical and "gamey". Any theme this has is sucked right out by the uninspiring gameplay. A lot of downtime and slightly fiddly. Note: this is not a zombie game. If you like Le Havre, Agricola, et al, you'll probably love this.

Received this from my SS in 2014, and it's definitely up there as one of my favourites.  one problem with co-op games is quarterbacking, but with a hidden traitor and other hidden objectives, this helps to remove that aspect of the game.  i also love the meaningful choices from the crossroads cards.  not a big fan of zombie games, but this is one notable exception.

Co-op game: try to survive in zombie-infested winter. Suffers from usual co-op problem that you dont have enough own decisions to make.

Twist: one player can be traitor thus its not straight co-op.

I purchased Dead of Winter earlier this year and have played it at least once each month since then... sometimes more. I enjoy the co-operative aspects along with the potential for one of the players to be a betrayer. I believe that the odds of actually having a betrayer make it just difficult enough to trust everyone completely, making the game quite challenging and fun no matter which side you end up on.

I agree with everyone that this is a good game. Possible traitor, obfuscated by everyone having a hidden objection - good. Heavily thematic struggle for survival - good. Crossroads system - friggin' excellent.

All that said, I just don't enjoy playing the game. The stress of 'struggle to survive' is too over-complicated by the fact that everyone will, at the worst moment, do something terrible for the sake of their goal - and we all just have to accept it or throw them out of the camp (difficult to justify, when everyone's doing it.)

RATING: 6
The original Pandemic with some role-playing and story-telling thrown in.  I think what I like the most about this game compared to the original Pandemic is that it solves the alpha-player problem by giving each player an individual “Top Secret” objective and each turn offers a great more variety of possible options.   In Pandemic the best option for a player to perform on their turn is usually pretty obvious and is quickly pointed out by the alpha-player and everyone generally sits back and agrees.  In this game, there are so many more options and players don’t really know what is in the best interest of an individual player to solve their particular objective.  Often described as a ‘traitor’ game, this one is a bit different.  To solve individual objectives, players are often given neurotic needs (for example, to win, a player may need to hoard gasoline canisters), which makes pointing out a traitor much more difficult.  And the traitors’ personalities are much deeper than just being a ‘bad guy’; they seem to be just really crazy personalities with extreme neurotic needs that are to the terminal detriment of the other players.    
Additionally, while the Zombie Apocalypse theme is there, it really is just an extra thrown on top: this is NOT a game about going out and taking down zombies.  It actually felt a lot more like the game “Arctic Scavengers” to collect needed cards: especially when you have to ‘dig’ for resources and supplies.  
However, I recommend that you play this with someone who has the rules down-pat to chaperone this game.  The rules are fiddly and we were often forgetting little things (did we add ‘frost bite’ to a character?  Did we remember to roll for this or that).  We were all over that rulebook (which needs a better Appendix).   When we were in a conundrum with the rules, I would jokingly repeat, “Okay, time to pull out the Dungeon Master’s Guide.”  
For a cooperative game and ‘traitor’ game, this is an evolutionary step forward.  However, with a stated average game time of 100 minutes, that seems too long for this kind of game where either ‘you win’ or ‘you lose’.  The group of players I played this really like these type of thematic ‘traitor’ games, but they seemed very somber and subdued while playing it.  Afterward, with this same group, we played a game of “Saboteur” from 2004, and its like suddenly everyone was injected a with a burst of espresso and everyone woke up, came alive and started to express having a good time (with that game).

RATING: 5.25
One of the better semi-coop games I've played.  It dodges some of the problems the genre has, but not others.  

So, the theme.  Zombies yet again..  However, it must be said that the meat of the game isn't fighting off zombies (the mindless minis spawned by the game), but managing the colony, keeping tabs on the other players, and the tension of surviving versus fulfilling your own individual goals.  Zombies as a backdrop are forgivable, in this instance.
I like the whole 'group goal plus individual goals' idea, however it suffers from the usual problems.  Once you know the game, you'll start to have an idea which goals people are working on.  Some of them are easy, others really tough.  Many, if not most, are highly dependent on random factors outside your control (whether you draw medicine cards from the search deck, whether you can recruit/kill off followers, etc.).  We haven't seen a lot of traitors in our games, so I don't really have a feel for how their goals stack up.  The vaunted 'crossroads' random event cards will eventually become repetitive as well.

A few of the design choices bug me.  I really feel like the dice are mostly superfluous.  Only a few actions are limited by what you rolled; the rest can be done regardless of value.  
The 2nd thing was noted by other people during playtest, and that is about the way zombies and barricades interact.  Instead of keeping out zombies as you'd expect (same number are there, but you're buying time by raising the limit of how many can exist), barricades act more like mines, killing off zombies and being destroyed 1:1 as they come out.  Going out and fighting a zombie accomplishes the same exact thing, but A. is more risky, since you have to roll the exposure die and B. requires a certain action die value, while barricading can be done with any.  So why would you ever fight when you could barricade?

I haven't played enough times to know more than that.  I'm not sure I see it replacing the current favorite, BSG, around here, but who knows.

Ed. So, it seems I was wrong, as BSG has dropped off considerably in the past year.  I've also played this several more times recently, and am liking it less as a result.  
The most recent few times we've played, there has been a traitor.  And I hate to say it, but a competent traitor can really break the game.  Both times, they've been able to map things out, and discover that they're going last on the last round.  If that happens, you have [i]zero[/i] chance to win.  They get the hammer on the last turn, suicide all their chars (and some of yours as well) and tank morale faster than a downpour at a baseball game.  Your only counter to this is voting to exile them, but you can't, since every loyal player has already had his/her turn.
Even if it isn't the last round of the game, they can still do the same thing on some other turn when they're going last.  The only thing stopping them is getting their objective done.  

In general, I've been more disappointed with the objectives.  I hate the fact that you can have everything set up, then get hosed on the last turn because you moved back home (and moving is something you often [i]have[/i] to do) and got killed by the exposure die.  That thing can be so painful, and rolling a bunch of frostbite wounds early on can drain the table of medicine.  The objectives that require you to search for a specific type of card can be even more troublesome, as other players can come in and make off with all the stuff you need while you draw nothing but food or junk.  And in many cases, they couldn't even help you if they wanted to, since any card you gain by request has to be played immediately.
Edging the rating down as a result.

RATING: 4
One play with 5. Similar enough to Pandemic that I'll compare it to Pandemic: as far as I can tell, it's more complicated, more isolating, and potentially much longer. The traitor mechanic was buried under so many layers that I didn't find myself trying to see who was bluffing. The traitor (who was an experienced player) won in a complete surprise, leaving no clues that he was a traitor beforehand. Is a surprise ending like that fun? For me, it's not more fun than a game that emphasizes bluffing among all players. It's not more fun than a competitive game where you know you're competing. And it's not more fun than a purely cooperative game.

I would try it again if someone wanted, but I wouldn't ask for it.

My wife and I do not like Battlestar Galactica. We like the tension, and the mechanics are solid, but a game takes far, far too long. So, we were attracted to Dead of Winter, which was billed by playtesters as a short BSG. They were mostly right. My wife and I are big, big fans of Dead of Winter, and will never refuse a play. Even new players can easily get into the game, and the manual is well enough written that any rules questions are quickly answered.

Maybe the most American game I own, just because it's worth it.
The theme is strong with this one, think "The Walking Dead" and "Resident Evil". You will be there, almost.
Even though the board and locations are less fancy than say "Zombicide", the game is thicker, satisfying and it's one of the best "narrative game" examples I've ever played.
Every player will guide a group of survivors, trying to defend the colony and find enough food and items to endure the harsh conditions of this post-apocalyptic world. But a traitor could be lurking in your colony, and could be secretly working against us! Danger and suspicion will rule the game.

Interesting game with traitor mechanic and excellent zombie apocalypse theme where zombies are not the central problem. It is full of intrigue and poor choices because every resource is extremely valuable and they are always in deficit.

The big drawback of this game is huge downtime with more than 3 players. Crossroad cards are interesting mechanic, but they only involve player to the right and they don't come up too often. They are also full of favour text where important key words are non distinguishable which only increases downtime. 
Also the principle where you have a group of people that share your secret individual goal is a little bit strange to me. 

I would still rather play Battlestar Galactica than Dead of Winter.

Perhaps deserves a higher rating. This is a good coop story telling game with good flavour text, situational events and some neat resource management. I think it has to be seen as more of a story game than a competitive coop/betrayal game due to the randomness in the system and how easy it would be for a miffed player to sink the ship.

I love games that have a traitor mechanism built in.  The longer I play games, the more I think this is just one of those things that I really enjoy about modern boardgames.

The fact that the game actually surrounding the mechanism is good helps a lot (okay, I'll be fair, the traitor isn't necessarily the pillar of DoW).

As I once wrote for Arkham Horror, one of the biggest draws to the hobby for me was narrative.  While over the years I have sort of strayed away from that aspect of the hobby, DoW was like picking up an old habit and going, "omg, why did I stop?"  Sounds horrible, but you don't know how good it felt to sit down and read event cards out loud to weave a story around what we were doing at the table.  Couple this with the secret objectives and the Resistance-style levels of mistrust amongst us, and you've got one hell of a thematic game.

It's kind of a pain in the butt to set up and tear down, though, but hey, there are worse games for that - many in my collection!

RATING: 7
Highly thematic semi-cooperative survival game.

The good:
-Excellent representation of post-apocalyptic survival. 

-50 or so interesting potential characters. 

-Emergent story telling, with surprising scripted events. 

-Cooperative (well, most of the time).

The bad:

-Players will realise whether they can complete their secret objective or not prior to the game ending. If they can't win, and they're Timmy Powergamer - then why should they bother continuing to play?

-Some scenarios are nigh unwinnable (e.g. Kill Them All)

-Some characters are just better than others. Anyone that gives you a free action equivalent with minimal conditions, or prevents you from rolling the exposure die.

-Most of the game does really turn into EITHER 
--Go to location X and search for loot Y
--Kill zombies

Good solid hidden traitor game.  It's shorter to play then BSG and has a theme that might be more appealing since you don't need to have watched any show to enjoy it (well, maybe Walking Dead).  I prefer playing a single survivor but this game handles multiple survivors pretty well.  Crisis cards seem much much harder to pass then in BSG.  Overall a good game I'd keep in rotation solely because it's shorter to play then BSG.

2017-09-09 : First play. A huge solitaire puzzle game with wheels that can fail of at any time. But you've got to admire how it was all put together and how they tried to hide the really bad downtime with the seriously over-hyped crossroads event mechanic. I'm not a fan of games you can lose through no fault of your own, but simply through bad or indifferent luck, but as a game it's kinda ok provided it's a short 3 player scenario. It's also a perfect illustration of how much BGG has changed over the years - top 50 game - really ?

Dead of Winter is a game with a some similarities to BSG. You have a crisis you need to deal with each turn and players submit cards secretively to help or harm the success of it.  This is mostly where the similarities end.  Like Shadows over Camelot, you are not always guaranteed to have a traitor.  The two big aspects of the game that set it apart from others traitor games is the secret objectives and crossroad cards.  There is a visible main objective/scenario and each player has a secret objective.  Non-Traitors need to complete both to win.  This secret objective usually enforces people making selfish moves to sow distrust amongst the players. As for the Crossroads cards, the player to the left of the active player reads the trigger on Crossroad cards. If a player does the trigger action, there will be an event that usually is thematically tailored to the action.  Overall, I like BSG more, but I can see many people preferring this due to the quicker player time.  This is a good option to play a BSG-esque game, but don't have 5/6 people for BSG.

Great narrative, and some cards are innovative. But setup is too long, waiting time in between player turns are too long, and having the ability to get kicked out of the game lessens enjoyment in the end game. Would not play ever again.

Co-op with possible traitor mechanic. It plays and feel a lot like Battlestar Galactica. I think it ends up being superior in many ways. You get a better feeling of doing something productive on your turn. The enemies are more predictable, and less swingy. The crossroads cards add a lot of theme and story to the game. It plays quicker, with more interaction, more story and more fun. It's the best co-op/traitor game of that I've played.

This game has spread like wildfire in one of my gaming groups. A casual-gaming friend picked up a copy, and we played twice with a group of mostly non-gamers. Everyone freaked out, and several have since gone out and purchased their own copy. I have witnessed many people have "Oh! I didn't realize there where board games like this..." moments, but none have been as fast nor engrossing as those that DoW has insighted. The co-op nature of the game keeps it accessible, while the 'traitor' aspect keeps it tense. It also has one of the best risk-reward mechanics I've seen as players must balance food/resource scarcity, and the dangers associated with venturing out of camp. And the red die is ruthless.

I got my own copy of this at GenCon, but played it several times before the show. It's in my "Game of Show co-winner" together with Shadowrun Crossfire.

This game does a fantastic job of capturing the paranoia and uncertainty of being in a rag-tag group of post-apoc survivors.

Minus 100 imaginary points for some gendered stuff in a couple of the survivor characters that turned off some of my players.

There is lots of luck and storytelling in this semi co-op. While there are decisions to be made this is still a game that plays you and not the other way around. I like the stories that come out of the play, but between the dice and the card draws you can't take the strategy of this game too seriously. Which can be a problem if the game lasts for hours and hours.

"Crossroads" is a new series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors' ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside.

Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first game in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world where most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game.

Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition — but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for his own interests!

Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games. It's a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.

Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily- thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what is best for the colony and what is best for themselves.

One of the better co-op games I've played.  Well designed with great artwork and pieces.  player interaction is constant and its nice that each player has their own goals too.  the betrayer takes the game to another level as well.  There is a high learning curve here and setup takes a while.  I probably wouldn't play this all the time but with the right group and amount of time I wouldn't turn it down.  hope to have a chance to try more scenarios...the replay value with all the characters and so forth is very high.

My friends love this game, primarily for the theme. But they also like games where there are heavy penalties for making bad decisions and possible betrayal. It's a tough game, but we have won two scenarios out of the plethora of sessions we've had. 

Has a slight learning curve for new gamers, but old gamers should be able to figure out the game from the manual pretty quickly.

This is a great traitor mechanic game.  Since each player has their own hidden agenda, everyone is on edge wondering why other players are doing weird things.

I’m surprised to find myself saying this but the whole ends up feeling less than the sum of the parts. There’s so much here I should love from the BSG-like paranoia induced by the hidden loyalties to the personal win conditions to the crossroads to the fact I happen to be one of those people who still actually likes the zombie theme, but the sessions have all been tame so far and after my last one, I can’t say I’m in a hurry to play it again.

I think my problems with the game boil down to it being a great idea that is, unfortunately, not well executed. Granted, it’s an ambitious idea, but I don’t think it succeeds enough to rise to the compelling level that BSG does, and I would rather play that one hands down every time given a choice. What should be a lot of paranoia doesn’t materialize much because the traitor is so in fear of getting found out and exiled. In BSG, you start messing with things and even if you get found out and brigged, you can reveal and continue to be an effective outed Cylon. 

Here, if you get exiled, your endgame goal will change and you very well may have to start all over again. Better to hang back until things go wrong on their own and then try to pound in the final nail. Even when the traitor wins, it feels more like due to the vicissitudes of the game than their efforts. Furthermore, the individual goals encourage hoarding and sandbagging the team but I’ve yet to see that inspire any real paranoia.

The crossroads cards are a wonderful idea that should happen a lot more than they do. As it is, they happen very rarely which makes them feel like a missed opportunity. I want to feel myself at a crossroads every turn not maybe once a game. I think they need to be revised both in terms of how easily they activate and the choices you have. Even when they activated the choice was too often too easy to make. 

In short, I think this “Crossroads Game” needs more crossroads.

If I recall correctly, this was our first 'new hotness' purchase.  I picked this up from my FLGS when it first came out.  It was still pretty hard to find in stores for probably another 9-12 months afterwards.

The game itself still remains a favorite.  We want to get it to the table more often, but there's always something else to play or more the player count isn't conducive to good play.

I'm looking forward to the expansion.

This feels like the errand making scavenger hunt in Shadows Over Camelot and Arkham Horror. The art does nothing for me as I dislike the sterile computerized look of the characters.

I love, love, love:
- the semi co-op gameplay
- the crossroads cards adding story and tough decisions
- the secret objective cards adding personality quirks to the survivors
- the survival challenges/scenarios
- the dice results = available actions
- the number of dice equals number of survivors plus one

I dislike:
- that we haven't played all of the scenarios, still
- that we keep forgetting to do the crossroads cards stuff!

Final verdict: Fun co-op game that combines good moments of humor, bewilderment, frustration, sadness, anger, and more all into a good zombie drama roleplaying game.

The crossroads cards are the most entertaining element of the game, but they are not backed by a strong mechanism; You can have a game where no crossroads cards trigger. I am baffled by people that say the crossroads system is innovative. There are much better mechanisms supporting narrative out there e.g. Robinson Crusoe's cause/effect system. Also huge downtime.

Great semi-cooperative game. The players are survivors of a zombie apocalypse. At game start, a random team objective is chosen, and the players are given secret individual goals. One or more traitors may also be in the mix, trying to keep the team from achieving their objective.

The players start by controlling two characters, who move around the various buildings trying to search for necessities and kill zombies without being bitten. The game has a lot of moving parts, with crisis cards popping up every round that must be solved or failed, and crossroads cards potentially affecting each player on their turn, all in addition to the group objective and the player's individual goals. However, the variety adds a lot of repeat playability to the game.

I like the ambiguity that the secret objectives add to the game, as they make it much harder to suss out if anybody is a traitor. Any weird activity by a player may just be them trying to fulfill their secret goal.  I also really like that the game is tough.  Even without a traitor, the players have to work hard to beat the game.  The component boards and stand-up characters are solidly built.  Highly recommend this game.

very good coop game, don't play the easy scenarios, they are way to easy! I'd rather lose with lots of action, then winning with no action or any difficulty at all.

Our four player game lasted 3 hours (which is why I'm not giving this a 10) but we had a blast. The theme is pure and true. I felt like I was watching the first season of a new zombie show. No-strike that. I felt like I was LIVING the first season of a zombie show. The characters are all interesting and the hidden objectives kept me feeling off balance and nervous.

The crossroads mechanism is wonderful. I hope to see this implemented in future games. Crossroads system gets a 10 out of 10.

I did notice that there was about 20 minutes downtime between my moves because each player needed like 7 minutes to run their turn. This will likely speed up as my gaming group gets to know the system better - but I can't give Dead of Winter a perfect ten because of down time. Otherwise, I LOVE this game.

Quality expansion for the first game, but redundancy of components is annoying. If you have both, you end up carrying two boxes around for one game. If a non-standalone version ever gets released, becomes 9 as expansion.

After one play: structured like a co-op, but a blend because you don't win if you don't meet your private objective (which includes the global objective, except for the traitor).  So, you want to pursue your private goal at the team's expense, but cooperate just enough to keep from losing completely.  The mechanic of kill or pick a card in different rooms works nicely.  But, the zombie theme is not so compelling and the card board stand-ups are hard to distinguish while playing.  They need player color coding or something.

I highly recommend using the variant that increases the chance of a traitor. The co-op game by itself is okay, but having a greater chance that there is a traitor really ramps up the paranoia. Seeing a game go from almost certain success to dire failure within one round is when Dead of Winter is at its best.
Only tricky part is teaching new players as there is quite a bit to teach, it sounds like a lot more is going on then there is, but explaining what actions can be taken, the scenario win conditions, crisis conditions, food, waste and how zombies are added can confound initially. After one round most people realise they take about 2 actions and move on and the rest takes care of itself.

I really like this interesting zombie survival colony game. The die rolling before you turn to determine what you can do in your turn is really nice and you can always add pips to dice (at a cost ;)). Rolling for exposure is brutal, as is fighting zombie (as you would expect).
I love the flavour of the chain reaction if you get bitten, in that you must then choose to kill the next lowest influence player, or let them roll  the die, which if they get bitten transfers to the next player and the next .... and the next !:zombie: everywhere!
Crossroad cards are interesting but many depend upon the player being a certain character therefore often it is not possible for the card to trigger. 
Secret objectives vary greatly in difficulty and there are betrayal mechanics (although we have yet to add them)
Lots more left to explore with this game and looking forward to that exploration :)

RATING: 4
Let us start with the good, the art and components are gernally great throughout the entire production.  That is it.  This doesn't meant that it is a bad game, but so much of it is crushingly mediocre.  Be it the Zombie theme (yes I know the real monsters are the human players), the crossroads system that fires every now and again and offers a random choice for a random reward, the lack of threat from a possible traitor or any defining need to cooperate beyond the bare minimum whilst endlessly searching for that second book you need to complete your secret objective.  There is so much that just misses the mark.  

I played this after owning and playing Archipelago for a while, and there are enough similarities that after I introduced that group to that game, DoW hasn't been played since.  Add in Battlestar Galactica for some genuine threat from hidden traitors, and the only purpose this game serves is fuel for the fire.

I usually like semi-cooperative games, and this is no exception.  I've heard that some don't like the secret objectives because it makes everyone seem like a traitor, but I think it adds an extra challenge, and a touch of realism.  No other game is closer to the Walking Dead in a box.

Semi coop, zombies and thematic. It was my idea of a perfect game.

My first play of DoW took 3 hours for the short scenario. I am not a big fan of dice rolling but there is something satisfying about hearing the clatter of dice on the table. Yes, we did have instant deaths with the exposure die but it was either that or live long enough to be back stabbed.

Excellent co-op game with a fun storytelling element. And I stress the co-op, because unlike games like Pandemic where one player can ultimately end up playing for everyone, it's much easier for players to actually have a say and to play for themselves.

This is aided, in part, by the betrayal element of the game, which, in theory, sounds fun. I say in theory because, in all our plays, we've only ever drawn one traitor, and it was ridiculously hard for him to achieve his goal, so we've yet to delve into the exile portion of the game.

RATING: 6

[b]DEC/15 -1st play-[/b] had just enough of interest that I feel I have to give it one more chance at least, but my gut feeling is that this game isn't for me. 

There were a few problems with the presentation: the theme isn't interesting to me, the graphics are so snowy that they look samey to me, and the game played way longer than I feel it should have (2.5 hours for a short scenario with my two opponents both being experienced players. I was the fastest player).

I also found problems with gameplay. I found myself drawing Food and Junk cards nearly the entire game while my opponents drew Weapons and Survivors. A lot of the characters are variations on each other. The individual win conditions aren't terribly interesting, again being variations on each other.

It felt inevitable that I would compare this to Robinson Crusoe, and later the same day, I pulled out Robinson again to compare. Dead of Winter has the whole potential traitor (which is great), but the different win conditions were uninteresting. DoW also has a bit more event cards in a single deck (as opposed to RC's five separate decks), so let's call that a draw. Otherwise I think RC wins in every category: visuals, board layout, ease of play, component mechanics, special tools, unique scenarios.

Overall I liked it.  I thought it captured the zombie apocolypse very well.  I felt like I always had something to do, even with a poor die roll.  Getting people equiped from the start with a weapon of some sort is key to keeping the zombies down.  But you need to be searching for stuff all the time since you'll be spending it all the time.

Don't play with 5 new players as the game went about 3 1/2 hours before we failed.
I would play again with 4 max, and one of the shorter scenarios as I think you'd get the same experience as the longer ones.  Even with the long time, the gaming session went quickly and it didn't feel that long.

I'm not a fan of co-op games, but this one isn't bad - especially since there's the option of betrayal, which means its not purely co-op.  I must admit I enjoy giving a dog a sniper rifle and letting it go to town on some zombies.

If you love co-op games, this is great.  But for me personally, I'm just not going to play it unless its what everyone else wants to play.

Pros
-Lots of characters, good variety of objectives and scenarios
-Secret objectives, changing objectives, optional traitor elements
-Crossroad cards are neat when they trigger
-Fairly fast paced, downtime isn't too high
-Players are usually kept in the game due to possible traitor element, and coop style
-Theme is overdone but suitable here
-Set game lengths due to set number of rounds

Cons
-Very minor but I find board looks a little bland. Fully functional though
-Crisis cards are very bland, they are mostly clones of each other
-Very little surprise at the end of turns since Crisis is revealed at the start of the turn
-No randomization to crisis contributions can out a betrayal player early on
-Very deterministic crisis resolution, every card contributed is just worth 1 (contrast to battlestar galactica's votes which are more exciting since you can be close or far off)
-Crossroad cards don't always activate, and that is where the main story/narrative elements arise from, and also where the interesting social decision making comes from (e.g. votes, debates)
-Lots of repeating items in search decks
-Each player having a party of characters makes the game feel very awkward logistically. I find an item but I can give it to anyone in my party? How do I contribute to crisis for afar?
-Can be gamey where players intentionally play a certain way to get exiled to get a new objective
-Use of D6 seems inelegant since having a high dice roll often doesn't make a big difference (e.g. a 5 and 6 usually serve the same function).
-Not a lot to do at the colony; also despite there being a good variety of actions available, it usually comes down to just two primary/interesting actions: searching and combat. Game can get somewhat repetitive.
-Lots of small number/rules to remember such as rolling a 4+ for noise is a new zombie, but fighting another survivor is rolling less than their combat strength
-Need to remember to draw crossroad cards every turn
-Objective cards and crossroad cards often depend on several factors and players may need to interrupt the game and ask the exact count of things (e.g. cards in a players hand, or who moved where), giving away information
-The concept of having a leader of your group is not further explored and serves no purpose
-Game can be on extremes, it will be much easier if you have no traitor, and much harder if you have a traitor
-High price point to purchase game

I'm so sick of the zombie trope However, DoW is probably the best implementation of it by putting the zombies in the background and survival (whether the elements or other people) in the foreground, without overshadowing the very real threat of the zombies. The Crossroads are very clever and add an amazing storytelling element. This is one of few games that I can get more than just 2 players to come play at once.

I loved the mechanics of this highly thematic game and the fact that they included secret goals for each player as it effectively removes the part where one play takes the lead and basically plays the game by himself. The biggest con for me is the playtime as it can take quite a while to get to the end and the fact that you can lose characters in one die roll by being unlucky, which cuts down your possible actions too much.

Played only twice. Nails its theme and is very immersive, with intense story bits mainly in the form of the crossroads cards. And you have to be on the lookout for possible betrayers or they will screw the colony if they manage to pull their act while sneakily undermining everyone else's efforts. Downtime can get a bit long, but this is somewhat mitigated by having to manage crossroad events for the active player and by analyzing their every move for tells on their secret intentions. I also like how you can choose from multiple scenarios with varying flavor (e.g., fully coop) and duration.

Semi coop. Très bonne ambiance, le theme bien respecté. Fin de jeu un peu facile avec des multi-égalités sans départage. Le mode difficile est beaucoup plus difficile mais du coup transforme quasiment le jeu en full coop ce qui est vraiment pas top (cela implique des auto win du traiter assez probables aussi).

Seul les cartes "Croisée des Chemin sont bien en fait". Le reste de l'ambiance est très artificielle.

Au dela de l'effet "Wow" de la première partie le jeu m'a chaque fois déçu (et la note grandement baissée).

I did enjoy this game but I feel that it dragged on for long enough to where I lost interest toward the end. I don't like semi-cooperative games that much for the reason that it seems like it's far too easy for the traitor to mess everything up without being found until it's too late. Our traitor didn't even try to mess anything up until the last round and it would have worked if he had executed properly. That demoralized me a bit to play this game because I feel that the game already works against you in big ways.

Dead of Winter mostly draws its appeal from thematic immersion, as it's pretty drab mechanically. I have to admit that Zombies are one of the least appealing themes for me so it kind of fails on that front by default. Apart from the setting DoW is somewhat similar to Battlestar Galactica although it seems to me that the available action choices are a little more constrained. On the other hand some aspects are handled a little better, especially the crises checks go faster now. The crossroads cards are a nice touch, too.

I like mostly everything about this game. There's just a *little* bit too much going on, between all the tokens and cards and when you can play things to the crisis and when they go face up and everything. However, it totally nails the tension when things start going wrong. I think the secret objective system is brilliant, everyone has something suspicious they need to do so the traitor gets cover.

Designed by a near and dear friend. I played an early prototype that I enjoyed thoroughly, which is crazy as I typically dislike playing prototypes. I got to play the near production version recently as well. 

This game is the best I have seen at telling a story yet managing to keep gaming elements. The traitor element and the personal goals elements make it a tense experience in that you cannot entirely trust everyone yet everyone needs to work together to save the colony. 

The theme integrates beautifully. It provides a strong sense of impending doom while giving the players choices that feel meaningful. Those choices are individually decided because of secret personal goals which removes the most common complaint of cooperative games - that one person takes charge and controls all the decision making.

The only complaint I can think of is that a central mechanism of the game is running to various locations to search for items (specific decks of cards) needed for survival. It's not my favorite mechanic, but it works quite well for this game. I am not sure how I would do it better anyway.

This is a powerful storytelling game that evokes desperate feelings and can simulate heroic struggles to survive. I eagerly anticipate getting my pre-order and introducing this to many many people.

Played it only twice, so I can't really give it a rating yet.

My first impressions were pretty good. It mainly comes from the theme, which I enjoyed a lot. Having a dog with a cape driving a car to the grocery store and doing whatnot is really funny for a post apocalyptic game. Also the crossroads deck was very cool. What I don't know is how well-balanced the game is, cause it didn't feel that way at all. Also, with five players the game took super long to finish and there was generally not much to do during other players turns. One player was doing their thing while the others were chatting or making phone calls. But somehow that didn't bother me.

I can't get enough of this game. First off, it's ridiculously easy to explain to new gamers. The action allotment system with the dice just makes sense. You need to roll at least this number to do this action with this character. Done. You can pretty much play the game. The exposure die is hilarious and crippling. The hidden objectives really makes this game come to life. The Crossroads cards add awesome theme and tension to the game as well, and cut down on what could be some lengthy down time. Could not recommend this more. It deserves its high ranking.

RATING: 6
I have wanted to try DoW considering I am a fan of zombies and semi-co-ops, plus it's very highly rated. I was a bit of a let down, sadly. The Crossroads mechanic is interesting an adds some narrative and a "choose-your-own-adventure" option system, which is neat. I actually wish it was better formed, as sometimes the Crossroads text was sometimes poorly timed or completely irrelevant.  There were some other things I liked as well: making noise, survivor unique effects, dice action selection. But the game as a mechanically interesting experience is quite boring. The crises are extremely repetitive, finding items are a chore, and watching other people take their turn is a sleepy time. Thematically, it works okay. I can see this game is more of a social experience with passable mechanics to drive the story. However, the story drives you most the times instead of leaving it up to the players to make a unique, interesting narrative for the game. And what the game's narrative seems a bit of an interruption at times.  ("Let's celebrate Christmas, when we're at morale 1 and 25 zombies are at the door and we just ate a horse?!") Anyway. Better as a social experience, but I need a little more meat mechanics wise to get into a game like this. Merchants & Mauraders does it best for me when it comes to balancing Ameritrash with mechanics. And yeah - I would rather play BSG any day over this. So I can't imagine wanting to play this again. A bit flimsy.

I really like this game. A zombie game and survival game in one.

I really like that zombies are not the sole focus of the game.

The semi-cooperation aspect works well in this game and there are some other interesting mechanics but not a game I would like to play again. 
- Too much search, draw a card and hope it is the one you need. 
- Characters are often very obvious how you should play, example: teacher, better at searching in school. Go to school and search. Your turn is then basically just draw a card.

Interesting semicoop game. I really like the fact that it takes just a few minutes to teach new players  enough to get going and yet it offers such a meaty game experience.

A very polarizing game. I think this one really depends on who you are playing it with

For me, traitor lying games aren't my thing but I could overlook that part and try and enjoy other parts of the game. I like the concept of hidden personal goals that help the traitor out but I did not enough the balance of it in this game.

Unlike BSG where I felt every game was winnable, in this game I feel the opposite. Most of the time, the game is super hard and you are struggling to get by. This coupled with the fact that people will openly tank the game if they can't win because of their personal goal makes leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I don't play the players for this as this game makes it seem like you should try to win as it is not as much of a narrative games as I thought.

Also the fact that sometimes people can get a lot of actions and other times you have a character that dies and you are stuck waiting between turns

The crossroads is a positive thing that came out of this game, I wish the game had more narrative elements to it and then I care less about trying to win it and more about enjoying the experience.

Starvation tokens (among other things) are an a$$hole.

[b]Update:[/b] This should be obvious, but if your group isn't invested in the story or his particular survivors the game can fall flat. This was very much the case with the last group I played with. Unfortunate, because they usually like hidden role / traitor elements in games.

To be fair & honest, I had only played DoW twice before rating it. I wanted to like this more but I wasn't a fan of the pseudo-cooperative play. We had 4 people & never drew a traitor. So I figured our personal objectives might make me feel like there was still a traitor but it never felt that way & mostly felt like we lost because of poor draws & dice rolls instead of poor decisions. The game did have great art, theme, & ease of play (we played this with a person who thought board games ended at Monopoly & they had a blast with it), but the mechanics just didn't click for me with our 2 plays. Don't get me wrong, I feel like this is a good game, just not the game that has been hyped. Maybe with some more plays I'll feel differently.

RATING: 9
This game is quite fascinating. The core mechanics are basic and boring (dice rolling, card drawing), some aspects of the game are definitely fiddly (for instance, if one of your characters finds an item, you can immediately equip your other character with it even if he's on the other side of town; there is little incentive to bring characters back to camp once gone as it would mean alerting more zombies and needing more food, you can find survivors and keep them in your back pack, if you loose your two survivors - so be it, you get a new one, in fact the game is significantly easier with a smaller group, rather than being equally difficult in a different way, In hard core mode, whoever is the traitor is much more likely to win, without having to do much to destroy the group).
But the game is awesome. The theme is splendid thanks to the semi-cooperative aspect and the cross-road cards. 
It really feels like a bunch of survivors having common interest to work together for some time. Trust is quite central and each decision feels important. It always feels a balance between the group interests and my own personal interests. Selfish people will lose. Altruist people will lose too. You will need to find the right balance. Just like in the real world. 
It is possible for a player to can the game if he sees he can't win it. But if he does, the game is doing you a favour because just like in the real world, is that person worth spending your gaming nights with?
I also like the dice mechanic. We get the nice feeling of throwing many dice and we don't get punished that bad by bad roles. You'd rarely lose a game because of a roll.
This game is good. It is by far the game I play the most and I am so looking forward to the upcoming expansion.

We love this game.  The mechanics line-up really well with the theme.  I could go on for hours about what I meant, but suffice it to say that it's tight, always fun (even when you loose) and the components/characters/mechanics are great!

Co-op is a mess. I would never recommend it.
Competitive is better, but the personal goals are far too easy to achieve, which removes a lot of the tension of them.
And the traitor mechanic is clearly unbalanced, too easy or too hard for them, based on where the traitor is SITTING IN TURN ORDER, which is not a design decision I appreciate.
Also, thematically, the perfect information of when zombies will come out, when they will kill people, cleaning the "waste"... this doesn't say zombie to me.

Positive: the components are great and I like the thought behind the crossroads cards.  I also appreciate that adult themed cards are designated as such and can be removed for a mixed audience.

Negative: Oh so fiddly and too easy for the game to be thrown.

I prefer BSG and Dark Moon for my hidden traitor itch.

RATING: N/A
This game reminds me of Munchkin, which I find silly and annoying, and Shadows over Camelot, which I find mostly annoying, but with an attempt to have more of a game.  The idea of secret objectives and betrayer are good in this semi-coop, but the mechanics and cards make it clunky, and the whole thing bogs down for my taste.  It's too fiddly for lots of players, and yet with fewer players, the social dynamics don't shine.  It's clear a lot of story work was put into the game, and I can see why a lot of people LOVE it.  Just didn't work very well for me, who frankly is not really part of the target audience.

RATING: 5
Semi-cooperative game (there is possibly a traitor) of killing zombies and trying to fulfill some conditions.

This kind of game, with endless special powers and abilities, doesn't do it for me. Every card is different, every character is different, you control several characters...to no real purpose.

The Crossroads mechanic is definitely interesting, and forcing you to make choices adds to the game. But the effects were often not worth the trouble of reading the card. Starfarers of Catan did this the best because it was so much simpler, but the effects were so much more important as well. 

The game wasn't horrible, but it wasn't that fun either. It overstayed its welcome even at 90 minutes. We played with five, which is too many since you just don't have enough to do. And zombies are definitely one of the most overdone, boring themes ever.

RATING: 9.5
This game is heavily inspired by another popular game, Battlestar Galactica, but I will skip the ethical part of tthis.

If you like BSG, you will love this game. If you dislike BSG, there's still a huge chance you will love this game. 
* First off, the game manages all the players to get into a role play mood (and you don't have to watch a B-class TV series for that).
* Secondly, the main goal, crisis, and crossroads cards are very clear and everyone always knows what they're supposed to do (unlike BSG, where newbies are always clueless about crisis cards and easily manipulated).
* Third, each player building his own team and equipping them is super fun. You specialize on the go, unlike BSG where you choose your role upfront.
* Fourth, there are no jumps whatsoever so you don't do anything that won't matter in a few rounds. Every turn & every action matters.
* Fifth, a new scenario each game changes the way you play.
* And Sixth, the only resource that'll make you lose is morale so you can compensate stuff with other stuff.

The only downside is, each place you go do not have specific actions as in BSG, which was a good thing and gave you purpose to move around.

Overall this is an unforgiving, solid strategy game that never lets you ease.

I have issues with the traitor mechanic in this game. On the one hand, the possibility of a traitor increases the tension. You never know if someone is just fulfilling his own, additional mission goal or if he is a traitor. Without the traitor mechanic the game would lose tension. On the other hand, I feel uncomfortable being the traitor and playing against all other players while constantly lying to them.

A very good and deep thematic game, but real AmeriThrash with a component of "Sudden Death" that not everyone will like it! If all players get into the game it will be very intensive and creates a paranoid scene. Otherwise it will be boring.

A great mix of mechanics that create a good and thematic game! The secret player goals combined with the traitor is perfect and the crossroads cards are always exciting. There's a lot of stuff to remember and some player goals are impossible in a short game, but that may be helped with more plays. 

The problem is that the game feels broken unless you play the long scenarios, but those scenarios are way too long and the game gets into a routine and overstays its welcome. Also, there's a bit too much luck and dice rolling for me.

EDIT: I'll add a recent post I wrote about the theme:
[q]I'd argue that DoW is a very thematic game, but that the crossroad cards are the least thematic thing in the game. What really sells the zombie theme for me is that you're in constant risk whenever you venture out of your comfort zone due to the exposure die and that you can never be sure about your friend's true motivations. 

What draws me to the zombie theme is not the zombies themselves, it's what the post-apocalypse does to the psyche of your fellow humans. It's your friends that are truly dangerous, not the zombies. I can agree that having everyone be forced into acting suspicious is a crutch for a traitor game, but I both think it's thematically brilliant and not an important part of the game. It can be played completely cooperatively, the traitor mechanic is just an added, optional difficulty as far as I'm concerned.

I prefer zombies to be not immediately threatening but eventually unavoidable, they continues to chip away at your defences day after day until you give up- those are the zombies depicted in DoW. They are only dangerous in large groups and you should be able to easily handle them, but if you ignore them for too long they can mess you up.[/q]

We'll play this two player quite often, purely cooperatively.  It definitely plays better with more players and when you have the hidden traitor.  I rank the original (Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game) a little higher since it has more scenarios than The Long Night.

The most memorable game was a three player game where someone had contributed an unnecessary card towards the crisis.  One of the players did not contribute at all, and accusations were had back and forth as to who had sabotaged the crisis.  The innocent player could not agree on whose side to take so there was no one was exiled.  In the end, we achieved the main objective, and when we revealed our hidden objectives, we all completed them as well... no one was a traitor.  We still do not know who added the useless crisis card (or how it got there).

This game is so much fun. Cooperative with the chance that someone in your group might be a traitor. The crossroads cards may trigger in a given round and present a choice with consequences to your group, adding a great element to the game.  The various main objective, personal objective, and crisis cards keep you on your toes and change the way the game is played each session.

Fantastic game. Best with 3-5 players. Only knock against it is that it isn't as fun with 2 players.

Only played once so far. The rule book is kind of intimidating, and our first time playing we were all new. Once we got the ball rolling though everyone enjoyed themselves alot because of the wacky characters, weird personal traits, and the horrible, yet funny incidents that happen throughout the game. We almost won if it wasnt for drunk santa making all that racket and getting us overrun in the end xo.

big game group favorite. After an initial round everyone got into the feel of it pretty easy. For some reason or another though every traitor had problems being the traitor, but ive never been the traitor so I can't judge its difficulty as of yet. So until then it'll stay as a 9 till I get first hand traitor experience

doesn't seem there is alot to this game anymore, players in my game group said there is not enough happening in this game

A very tense game that captures the mood of a zombie apocalypsis. The art is awsome and the character likeable. The only problem I find is the mechanics of the game. It feels a little repetitive; it's just going to a location, search and kill zombies. All missions are practically the same. On the other hand I have only play it cooperative and never with the traitor factor. The game is good, I like it.
Edit: The traitor adds a lot of flavor to the game and turns it extremely fun. Using the traitor is a must.

RATING: 9
One of the best co-op games available. Secret personal objectives make it impossible for other players to judge your decisions. Thus players with varying skill level can enjoy the game together since no one can tell the optimal game play to anyone else for certain.

If your group is experienced at gaming in general, always opt for the hardcore difficulty.

My tastes are definitely changing. I still enjoy the game very much, but the downtime is a killer and I am beginning to realize that I simply don't enjoy coops all that much. I think I'm going to try to trade/sell my copy. I'll play this anytime, but I certainly don't need to own it as it will rarely come off the shelf. The theme and atmosphere are still top notch and Plaid Hat did a great job with this production, but this is not my cup of tea like it once was.

One play with three, one with four, and one with five. The underlying game mechanisms are nothing special, but the possibility of a traitor adds spice and the "crossroads" cards are fun and ingenious. It also does a good job of getting across its theme, I think. 

I'm not a fan of this type of game, but if I have to play one, Dead of Winter is a tolerable choice. It's certainly better than Zombicide, City of Horror, and Betrayal at the House on the Hill, anyway.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like the game but there's one thing that rub me the wrong way. The fact that there might be a traitor in this co-op game I've found to be more annoying then fun. That's a problem because it's one of the core aspects of DoW. But because it's there, and because people have their own agenda, ánd because your not guaranteed a joined victory (you can lose if you don't complete your personal objective) there is this strange competitive/hostile atmosphere. It kinda makes thematic sense? But it's not necessarily fun mechanically, hurting the overall experience. 

The components are good though, I like the characters, the standees and all of the different cards that add story to this game. I just wish the traitor aspect was either removed or a guaranteed part of the game like in Betrayal at House on the Hill.

On a trip to Yellow Submarine with fellow board game geeks, we found this one in English for a second-hand price. When we enquired about the game's maintenance,  the staff told us only rule book was open, everything else was intact - the pieces haven't even been punched out. Did not think twice.

Got it, took some time setting it up - man 'oh man, after setting up it looked gorgeous. Absolutely stunning. I just wanted to know all the details about it. So once we familiarized ourselves with the rules. It BEGAN!! The first night in the Dead of Winter!

So the gameplay itself after round two felt easy to grasp, it's more about surviving as team than about killing and going on a blood-lust zombie hunt. 
The 'Crossroad Cards' were quite unique to me (also considering the fact that I am new to board games when writing this review). That damn exposure die was so scary and it would ramp up the tension, so the game went on for couple of rounds. But soon it somehow went into the "let's get this over with" territory (it was quite late in the night). I played as Mike Cho and Grey Beard, both of them ended up getting killed. We chose not to eliminate players from the board if their survivor dies.

I loved many aspect of this game, one of my favorite is the "traitor" part where one of us was a traitor (could have played without it, we chose to have a traitor card). 
I love that tension, but not sure if we played it wrong or what happened, the traitor player wasn't revealed to be one until the last moment. Things got frustrating as we waiting for a long time for one player to finish and it was getting a bit of chore by then.

So in short, I really enjoyed it - but need to play more of it to kind of grasp the in & outs, understand the traitor aspect of the game a bit more. And I want the traitor to play his/her game of selfishness at the beginning, that will keep everybody awake and tensed.

This game is so-so. The theme is interesting. It is fun to race against the clock. The traitor mechanic is fine, as is the crossroads mechanic. It just seems too overwrought for what it is trying to do: a semi-cooperative experience with a traitor mechanic. Battlestar Galactica and its expansions do it better...but not simpler. Ironically, BSG requires more set up and understanding of the rules but its thematic tie in is so strong that the game works in spite of its heaviness.

Dead of Winter is simpler, easier to learn, and not quite as fun.

DOW is not a bad game. It's a good game. It's just not a great game.

A cool co-operative game with some interesting elements.  It's pretty hard to win, but after a few plays you've figured out what some of the bad decisions are and how to avoid them - and suddenly you start getting closer to winning more often.

It has a great traitor mechanic.  It's actually possible to wrongly accuse someone of being the traitor and still have them win the game with everyone else.  You can also have people who aren't the traitor acting selfishly to achieve their own goals and a lot of the time there is no traitor at all, just lots of suspicion.

It helps to reveal how people play games.  You can be left with a decision of not completing your solo objective but still helping everyone else win.  Of course, you could always make sure that if you aren't likely to complete your own objective that you play badly enough for everyone else to lose.  but what sort of person does that...

Kaverin kanssa ostettu, tullut jo useamman kerran pelattua ja on kyllä paras zombieteemainen peli mitä koskaan pelannut. On paljon eri scenaarioita ja vaihtoehtoja, traitor tekee pelistä tosi mielenkiintoista ja hauskaa. Haastava peli voin sanoa. Taidettu 10 kertaa pelattua ja vain 2:lla kerralla voitettu.

RATING: 6
A solid spin on the zombie genre focusing on community and resource management.  Strong ideas but it suffers from a relatively simple and dull optimum strategy that remains relatively unchanged in any scenario, and mechanics that encourage alpha players driving the action while others have relatively short turns doing rote tasks.  Still a decent pick if you need yet another zombie boardgame.

Love the story-telling aspect of the game, and the ability to run it co-op or paranoid back-stabby betrayal mode.  The survivor characters are funny and well thought out.

RATING: 8
Probably the closest thing you can get to a true 'Walking Dead' board game. The uncertain social dynamics and painful decisions make this game one of the best zombie game there is. Also, the crossroads system is a very nice way of making event cards truly thematic while simultaneously adding even more tension to the game.

A really good game. What makes it good? The fact that it is a well woven coop zombie survival game... or is it coop?

You never if there is a group a traitors (a player's characters) among the survivors.

To be played with people who talks and are not afraid nor shy to express themselves.

Otherwise, the game is quite boring if everybody is staying in their corner saying little like a big serious strategy game.

Good game with nice mechanics. But... I feel that the end game is far to random and there are some strange game situations that arise when the actual goal of the game is unclear. Like, if I can't fulfill my personal goal, should I work for or against the group.

Cooperative game, where each player also has a personal, hidden goal (or could even be a traitor working against the others). Each turn, you allocate 3 action dice to your characters to execute actions (fight, search, etc…). 
Luck-dependent, doesn’t offer a lot of meaningful decisions, and compensates its lack of sound and original gaming mechanism with theme and atmosphere - neither particularly original.

As far as coops and zombie games go (both things I don't like), I would say that this game rises above my bias just a little bit.  There are way too many different moving pieces, if you haven't played it a million times you have a 100% chance of having to look in the rule book every single session.  The game does look good though, and the resource management juggling aspect does not feel awkward or too daunting to deal with, dealing with the mechanics of this does not deter from the strategy of the game.

Zombik, hó, halál, árulás és száműzés
Most kivételesen a véleménynyilvánítással kezdeném. Megjelenésekor nagyon szimpatikus volt a játék. Van benne egy csomó számomra szimpatikus játékmechanizmus, mégis minden eddigi gém végén nem tudtam elégedetten felállni az asztaltól. Talán a túl sok holtidő a játékosok között (megnövelve a keresztút kártyák böngészésének kínjaival), „áruló módban” a küldetés teljesítésének szinte elérhetetlensége, a különböző helyszíneken történő tárgyak utáni folyamatos keresés-kutatás, a megszerzett tárgyak sokszori haszontalansága.
Eddig teljesen koop módban egyszer sikerült nyerni. Tudom élvezni a nehéz játékokat is, de a kilátástalanokat már nem annyira.
Pedig minden adott, hogy megszeressem.
A téma tetszik, zombi apokalipszis után fagyos időben foggal-körömmel küzdünk a kis kolóniánk túléléséért.
Játszható csapatjátékban és korrekt az „áruló módos” verzió is. Mindenkinek a közös cél mellett külön-külön kis küldetései is vannak, tovább formálva a játékosok közötti együttműködést versengéssé.
Nagyon jók a játszható karakterek és megtetszett a keresztút kártyák alkalmazása is. Könnyfakasztó jelenetek játszódhatnak le: például függő kémikusunk zombik hadát robbantja szét tuti keverékével miközben kutya játékosunk mellette szaggatja szét a többit „vállvetve” a gyermekeit védő anyukával és a háttérben figyelő részeges áruházi mikulással.
Kivitelezés is korrekt, maga a szabályrendszer könnyen megérhető már a kis tapasztalattal rendelkező játékosok számára is.
Természetesen angol nyelvfüggősége korlátozza a leendő játékosok körét, de itt hiába várunk magyar megjelenést (bár ki tudja).
Esélyt még kapni fog, hátha megtörik a jég és megérzem azt a hype-ot, ami a játékot körüllengi. Addig „árulós”-nak megmarad a BSG. Talán a megjelenő „stand alone” kieg is segít a számomra hibának tűnő elemek javításában, kiküszöbölésében.

RATING: 8
This is a game about Zombies that is not, after all, About Zombies at all. It's about a bigger monster, a more cruel monsters, the Human themselves.

In this game, Zombies are just a pretext to see human natures at his worst. Each user work together for the survival of the colony but each one has their own objectives and agenda to accomplish. Worst (or best for our gaming experience) some will want the colony to fail as they are traitor. This game, with the right group, can be incredible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decided that you need 5 to really enjoy the game, and further all 5 must be either part of a consistent group or very familiar with the game. If a few people have never played the traitor mechanic does not work well. As great as the game is when all the stars align, it is way too difficult to get to the table. 

Another update: How good it is really depends on player count and your group, which in my mind really limits its ability to get to the table. At 2 or 3 there are loads of other co-ops I would rather be playing. At 4 or 5 the game can shine. Then there is the fact that it is hard to bring the traitor element in until everyone in the group is very comfortable with the mechanics, this is especially true at 3. Also you are right, the circumstances and difficulty of the game can vary wildly which is another issue I have noted approaching 20 plays now. I am almost at the point where I may sell it off just because it is good, but not good enough or versatile enough to stay in my limited collection.

Update: After around 15 plays with 2 groups I have found that the whole group really needs to understand the game mechanics for the traitor element to shine. As a pure co-op there are much better choices, but once you implement the traitor my comments below stand. In this regard, however, you need a regular group to play with. If you are only able to whip it out occasionally or not often with the same people I don't think you will be able to take the game to its full potential. I will also say that with 3 it is much harder to be the traitor, and not quite as much fun. At 5 everyone is scratching their heads when you start to the throw the game, but at 3 it can be quite obvious who the person is. 

An instant classic for us. Played several games with 5 players, and at that count the game is great. Play was fast and fluid. The down time in this game is actually exciting as you have players rolling exposure to avoid death, you are constantly watching player behavior to spot the betrayer, and of course the crossroads cards. They are a good mechanic that had an impact in different ways during all of our games. It is hard to complete the main objective depending on die rolls and search results. We had several characters die of exposure in a row one game and that really buried us. Also to complete the objective a good deal of cooperation is required. I am going to try with 3 and 4 player counts and will post my thoughts accordingly. Right now this is one of my favorite games as played with 5. I do think that your group will have an effect on your enjoyment of the game.

One of teh best games out there, Dead of Winter does a masterful job of balancing Cooperative play with potential intrigue. The fact there may, or may not, be an actual traitor, coupled with personal, secret objectives really lends itself to robust game play. My only (slight) complaint is that the Crossroads Card text can be pretty small, but the 99-cent app on my iPad makes that a non-issue.

Had my first play with my usual gaming group last night with the suggested first scenario 'We need more samples' and we also took away all the betrayal elements. 

Seems like a pure co-op may not be as fun as some betrayal elements being mixed in. The potential for strategy is definitely there and tension is high with so many things to cater to. Great game.

This is in some things very good and in other very ugly, which can leads to very fun or boring and frustrating experiences. 
I expect games to be fun 95% of the times I play them, even if I lose... but this is not such a game.
You can win and be very bored during 2-3 hours or also lose and be bored.
Some items of note:
1. If you play with bad players, the game will be boring. This means, new players will probably ruin the game, which leads to another problem which is that you need to play 2-3 games with new people to start having some expecation of fun the next game.
2. People can easily ruin the game for everybody by being a traitor and not knowing how to win.
3. The game is extremely confusing in the secret objective mechanics, since you may be a traitor, get exiled and later on maybe win the game, but the other players who detected you and exiled you may even lose that same game.
4. Traitors are very dependent on which turn they play, for ex. Traitors can win easily if they are the last player of the round, but they have no way to manipulate who will play first or last, so in a 5 players game, you probably get to be last in the round 1 time during the WHOLE game... so that means traitors get a chance to easily complete their objective or not decided by a RANDOM factor. This specific point is to me the WORSE mistake in design.
5. The game has many others game wreckers elements based on RANDOM dice rolls. For ex. you start with 2 survivor. If you move a survivor you roll a dice and you have 1 in 12 chance of dying. In a 5 player game there are 10 survivor, so very probable at least 1 player will being the game with 1 less survivor during the first move (which you need to do otherwise you basically can´t do anything useful). There is also 0.7% that you will lose BOTH your survivor in the first turn just because of a RANDOM roll... again, very very bad design.

This game plays like a movie with a lot of flavor.  Not the best for two players since a bit element of tension is the possibility of voting a traitor out.  We had a hard time really feeling it...sort of ended anticlimactically.  Might need to play with a different and bigger group.

[ES] Excelente juego meta-cooperativo que hace un gran trabajo en transmitir tensión de supervivencia que mejora bastante con los objetivos secretos y la siempre presente amenaza de un traidor. Las cartas de encrucijadas eliminan la linealidad de las misiones y, junto al dado de la muerte, mantienen las partidas impredecibles. Me hubiese gustado que hicieran algo mas con los lideres de grupo y que incluyeran suficientes figuras de zombies en lugar de los  menos atractivos tokens de zombies.

The crossroads cards are fun and very thematic, but the victory conditions seem not at all balanced. So, if not enough crossroads come out, all you're left with is some seriously wonky balance; some victory conditions are trivial and some are impossible, based merely on the scenario. There's not enough meat here as a strict co-op, and the other stuff is all over the map. Disappointing.

I can see potential problems. Analysis paralysis is one. Getting "behind" in characters early on and not getting the right people to search for what you need or another survivor to add to your group is another. The long wait between turns when you go from start player to last player is yet another.

However it's a fantastic game. Evocative, tough and with some great decisions to make and story to tell. It also offers up some excellent moments.

I had the pleasure of playing a pre-release demo of this at U*Con in November, 2013.  Very immersive game -- I really enjoyed it! Great tension, nice narrative, good decisions, good challenges. Loved the independent goals + shared goals + possible traitor elements, and the storyline was engaging. Very nice game.

Everyone has a secret objective. Most secret objectives have the requirement that the group completes the main thematic card in order to win. There's a chance someone can be a traitor, whose personal victory requires that the group :lose: this major objective. In addition to the group objective, people also have private victory conditions (hoard as many guns as possible, collect enough science textbooks, etc etc) that don't always mesh nicely with the other players -- even if they're theoretically on the same team. So even when players aren't the traitor, they're not always motivated to act in the group's best interests (why share guns with the group when you need to be hoarding them yourself?). So it creates all of this crazy paranoia that's just delicious.  Definitely removes a lot of the staleness and "quarterbacking" that permeates other cooperative games, which is nice.

This is a solid game but I can't believe its rated as highly as it is here on BGG (#19 as of this comment).  I guess I need to play some more to appreciate everything?  The traitor mechanic is nice but is not as well done as BSG, because of the individual objectives it is very easy to screw the group while making it look like you are pursuing your goal.  It also abstracts some of the things that makes zombies fun.  

The powers, combos, and tension are all top notch though and it isn't too long for a big zombie game.  I liked it a lot.

Here's where I'm at with Dead of Winter. It's my kind of game. I like the sort of co-op sort of not thing there is going on. Having a group goal and an individual goal seems to work really well. I like that it feels a real challenge to survive, particularly whilst trying to secretly fulfil your own goal as well. It almost feels like you can't quite do all you need to, and good or bad fortune is going to have significant impact. I like all that. However I feel I haven't got the best out of this game as it doesn't seem to suit the people I normally play with. This game seems pretty polarising, and that means it's hard to get stuck in and get the most out of it, sadly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After several plays, it has become clear that there are some serious flaws in this game. Nevertheless, the overall experience is generally an enjoyable one, if a bit overlong at times. 

Dead of Winter has players managing groups of survivors in a zombie apocalypse, struggling against the hordes of undead, the harsh elements, and against one another. Mechanically, this is a competitive game where each player has a secret objective to complete in order to win. However, there is also a public objective which all players must complete, or no one wins. This has certainly been done before, but it works pretty well here as there is often tension between contributing to the main goal and helping your own goal. 

Unfortunately, there is also a “traitor” element that is also incorporated. The difficulty of completing the main objective is often so hard that it will be failed even with all players attempting to complete it. So throwing in someone who seeks to undermine it is very bad for balance. A single failure can mean a game loss for everyone except the traitor, and it can occur without even being obvious WHO the betrayer was. Even IF the other players do identify this player, doing so simply allows them to stop him from doing further damage. It does nothing to repair what has already been done and still allows the player to interfere in some aspects. Yet playing without the possibility of a traitor removes the suspicion of paranoia. If someone is not helping the main objective, you know they are just working on their own objective, not actually undermining the group. So it’s not the traitor element that is bad, it’s simply the implementation and balance of it.

The reason the subtitle of this game is “A Crossroads Game” is due to the system of “crossroads cards” that really add to the narrative feel. On your turn, the player to your right will draw a crossroads card, keeping it hidden from you. If you meet the triggering condition at some point on your turn, the card will be revealed and you will be forced to make a difficult choice, usually between doing nothing or gaining a benefit and penalty of some kind. These really add to the narrative of the story and help keep players involved during other people’s turns. Unfortunately, even their implementation often leaves something to be desired. Twice in three games we have had cards that required us to get a certain character to a certain location, risking the exposure along the journey. In both cases, the character was already at the target destination, but the rules made no allowance for this, requiring an exposure role for a journey to the place the character already was. Simply anticipating these common scenarios would have gone a long way towards making the game feel more immersive. 

All in all, I am excited to see what else can be done with the crossroads system, but I am hoping it is used in a game with otherwise significantly different mechanics. Despite the excellent presentation of the game, it still comes off feeling unpolished. More mediocrity from Plaid Hat leaves me to wonder if Summoner Wars and Mice & Mystics were just flukes.

Overall enjoyable but I feel like it was overhyped. Need to give a few more plays to decide for sure. I like the overall gameplay structure and the crossroads cards. Not a fan of how getting more followers in your group are just cards or how vulnerable many characters can be to a hostile player.

It seems like most scenarios encourage you to send a single person to a remote location and camp there and search repeatedly for several turns. Not many interesting decisions early on, but some later in the game.

The game tries to play the grim-and-somber theme straight but the dog totally ruins it. Virtually everything you can do with the dog - especially if you activate a crossroads card - is comedic.

The crossroad cards is probably the worst mechanism I've had to endure in a game. You draw a card and there is a slim chance that something might happen? But I guess it pairs well with the d12 roll,which is whenever you move there is a 3 in 12 chance of anything happening. Also the co-op part of the game is basic and boring as hell. So you have a boring co-op game with a couple of mechanisms that may (but usually don't) add anything exciting to the game. The only good mechanism in the game was stolen from Battlestar Galactica.

But this isn't a euro so the game doesn't have to be solid. It's about theme. The thing that bothers me most about the theme is why is there a group that trying to sabotage the whole colony? It...just doesn't make sense. And it's not like there is one bad apple who gathers followers to his ideology. The characters are always dying off and being exchanged for new characters but somehow this religious like fervor to destroy everyone else stays alive. 

And for a zombie game I would like zombies shambling about. In DoW they just kind of spawn, and stay, and never move. They seem more like a hurdle you have to jump over instead of a zombie you have to run from.

The only saving grace this game has is the artwork and the board layout is nice to look at. 

Do yourself a favor and spend the extra hour to play Battlestar Galactica instead.

Tense, atmospheric, engrossing - these are words I would use to summarize Dead of Winter. The game is dripping with theme and story, and really lends itself to players involving themselves in the narrative. The unique characters are awesome (Sparky & Forrest for life) and really act as excellent platform for players to role play the story out. The components are well made and the art is nice and dark! And the game design is somehow just as superb! The secret objectives always makes players suspect others of being the traitor (and you just know they are, damn it). I only play with the traitor variant, which is how I highly recommend everyone else play it. It only ratchets up the paranoia! *mwah* Bon appétit!

Lots of interest from members of my GOTCHA meetup group - I've played it twice now, and it really makes a difference how many players you have (and that you don't screw up and accidently have two betrayers) because the main objectives scale per player.  I really want to play a few more times to get a better feel for the game, but I did like the "Crossroads" element with the interupt in an individual's turn if they triggered an event, and that it could easily just not happen.

I had hoped this would replace BSG, it did not.
This game simply does not work. But with all the hype, very cool artwork & droves of die-hard kickstarter fan-boys the game will remain in the top BGG ranks. 

The whole die-role mechanic is just incredible lucky.
The crossroad cards are okay at best, but feel poorly implemented:
Very often players forget to draw them, and then mid-turn the card is drawn & if activated complicates timing issues.
If it's drawn most of the time everyone has to wait until the card has been read, just to hear, nah nothing happens.. or the player keeps looking around the board to see if character x,y,z is present.
But since you don't have any influence on what card you get, it simply feels like a poorly implemented event deck.

Where BSG is all about finding the traitor/s, in DoW it's about haggling.. for one you can't be even sure you have a traitor & second there is no proper game mechanic to find out.
So since everyone is doing pretty wonky stuff to fulfill his secret objective (in our last game, one player shot his own character because he needed a wounded character to win) you never know what people are up to anyway.

So everyone is working at his own goals, and most often won't contribute to the team even though they're not a traitor.. and that doesn't generate a feeling of "us vs. them" but rather a feeling "of no idea, no way to find out, me vs. all.." so Player 1 won't do a task that needs to be done in order for the game not to be over, so Player 2 has the choice to either do the task, save the group but loose his chance of winning, or get closer to fulfill his objective and push the decision further down the line.
So because no one wants to loose deliberately usually no one sacrifices his win.. and then the haggling starts.. "okay so you wanna search there instead of killing that zombie.. how about i kill the zombie and you do that other thing..? That's not possible either.. hm.. okay.. so what could you do? Are we allowed to tell about our secret objectives so we can plan properly..?" No you're not. "Okay so we all stay secretive and let the game drag itself on.."

In a way the game probably depicts zombie shows pretty well, with characters constantly doing stupid things for no apparent reason.

I'd rather go to the toilet than play this game.

Brilliant and challenging co-op game, in which refreshingly the actual center threat are not the zombies (although there are zombies in the game) but more like all the threats, also common-day problems that could be threatening the survivors of the post-apocalyptic world, like starving, freezing (hypothermia), possible in-morale among the colony leading to possible conflicts, deceases of all sorts etc. There's a lot of problems to take care of, and at the same time you have keep on eye on the all of the zombies that might also threaten your colony. I like how the game emphasizes exploration, risk evaluation and true co-op decision-making instead of battles. Because of that it's also refreshing that the actual battles in the game are relatively simple. Game looks good, it has good quality components. It also plays fairly quickly, for the game of its size, it is really fast playing. 
And then there's the possibility of a  traitor among your survivors, a player who has a hidden negative agenda, who usually have to sabotage other players in order to achieve his own goal he needs in order to win the game. And it's never certain whether traitor is in play or not. Every other player also has own goal card which to follow in order to win. So yeah, game starts as a co-op, but in the end only those players who have been able to meet all the requirements of their personal goals win the game.
Game is not without its flaws. Sometimes it feels the game is too short in order to even have a realistic chance of getting all the things done that are required. Perhaps that has been intentional in order to elevate the difficulty level of the game. Still I personally found that a little frustrating. Also the fact that many things, even some crucial things, are heavily dependent on roll of the dice, is frustrating too, especially when there's a chance (1/12 chance) of outright dying when moving or fighting, because you have to roll a die  which have basically only bad things as results, and one of those 12 results can actually kill your character right away, no matter how fit or prepared the character is. That's really the biggest single thing I would have liked to be different in this game or even removed. 
But as overall experience perhaps one of the best horror-survivor experiences in a boardgame format you can have.

A fun, zombie-themed game that reminds me of BSG and Shadows Over Camelot.  There is a chance of a betrayer and everyone has some individual goals.  Not something I feel like I need to own but definitely something I would like to play now and then.

Rating is based on first impressions. This is one of the first games I ever bought, and it had the unfortunate role of following Cosmic Encounter with my playgroup. 

Problems: Players were so invested in just winning at all that they didnt really pay attention to the traitor aspect. 

This game, I believe, needs either a skilled teacher or a more experienced group to function properly on the first play.

I want to believe that it will go over better next time, now that I can teach it better and my group will be less intimidated.

RATING: 9
Probably the best hidden traitor game. Maybe not the best zombie type game, although its definitely oozing with theme. The scariest thing in the game is not knowing who to trust. Instead of one player having a hidden role or objective, ALL the players have objectives to meet, but only one person is an actual traitor. So throughout the course of the game, players make shady moves or decisions - but it may not be that they are the traitor, its just that they HAVE to make those decisions because their objective calls for it. This game makes for an exciting, finger pointing game. Always a hit.

Come out, come out, wherever you are....

Dead of Winter masterfully combines thematic game play with a rich narrative to deliver a satisfying gaming experience.

There is nothing more satisfying then successfully betraying all your friends who thought you were trying to help the colony survive the winter.

You might not have a 10/10 game each time, but overall the game delivers a 10/10 experience.

Quite creative in taking normal mechanics like and making them interesting. Great theme, lots of depth and replayability. The tension balance in this game is perfect between trying to complete the group's challenge and trying to complete your own mission which inevitably makes you look suspiciously like the betrayer.

[COLOR=#66CCFF][size=18]*[/size][/COLOR]
First play was rough, as I was the betrayer (dammit!) and had no idea how to nudge things in the desired direction without looking fishy.  Providence lent me a hand with a disastrous "hospital adventure" in which two survivors perished (a vivid and memorable narrative moment), but after I dumped the first real turd in the punch bowl my poker face slipped and I was caught in a lie, summarily exiled, my objective rendered impossible.  Next time will be different... right?

[imageid=2266458 original]
Some crossroads cards are marked with a li'l swearing word-balloon to indicate "mature content", facilitating their removal for those who'd rather not endure potentially disturbing material.*  This is a neat idea in general ("Hey!  I can play this with the kids, and Gramma!") but the application seems haphazard.  The cards with the symbol aren't [i]that[/i] rugged,

[o]Why can't we have a debate about [i]smothering[/i] the baby?[/o]
and at least one card that wasn't marked has a truly horrific encounter with 

[o][i]your dead parents[/i]—one by apparent suicide, the other zombified and coming straight at you.[/o]
If I were lily-livered and that one popped up in front of kids I'd probably faint.  A note to the designers:  If you're gonna go for the jugular, get to it.  Hesitation marks evoke the wrong kind of disquiet.

[b]After 4 plays:[/b]  This gets a 7.  While the narrative moments are grand (last night we decided that exiles get their arms duct-taped to their sides, with a police whistle affixed to their mouths**—they get a boot in the back to send them staggering into the icy night, all a-whistlin' to beat the band) there just doesn't seem to be much tension.  Betrayers haven't been at all difficult to spot, and we've taken to exiling good people just to get the numbers down to beat a crisis or meet food requirements toward the end.  Hopefully this picks up with experience, but so far the few bright spots have been awash in a sea of ennui.

[size=7]*Seems ludicrous in a seriously-toned game about rooting around in the putrefying corpse of civilization while screwing each other over, but whatever.

You have no agency.  This a great 'game' for unintelligent people.  If you understand how the system works you can exploit it for a draw or a loss and you would realize most outcomes can only be achieved by rolling better.  If you are too intelligent to believe rolling better is an intelligence based skill then this is nothing but a terrible slog through a boring game.  Terrible game.  No redeeming quality.  Not really a game.  As bad as all those Arkham 'games.'  The completely contrived special objectives are obvious - you have the thinnest patina of a reason to ask for guns once you have some, or more food or more gas.  Take a step back and watch what the other players keep asking for and you see these asks are a revelation of the 'secret' objective.

Excellent co-op with unfortunately a zombie theme, but the good news is that you don't have to worry much about the zombies, as they are a collateral nuissance.

Rating based on two plays in which we had great fun and did not win.
I am not sure thou how I like the semi coop implementation. I do like traitors in coop games but having a personal goal, an overall team goal and a traitor is a tricky combination. I have to play the game more often the figure out wether I think the game made a good job in combining everything or if it needs to be houseruled at least for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The Crossroads cards are a huge stack of misplaced development time, since even though you're always drawing them, you're rarely acting on them. The game itself doesn't know what kind of movie within the zombie subgenre it wants to be, so it tries to be all of them and doesn't do a good job of any of them. The goofy stunt dog character might end up drawing the "mature" cards such as "one of the colonists has thrown its newborn baby in the dumpster" -- it's all over the place.

It's almost good! But it's not good.

RATING: 8
Very thematic semicoop game. Its mechanics are very interesting and it's very unique in the zombie genre. Most likely my favourite zombie game and one that I will play very often with my group because everyone enjoys it very much. I found the 2 player variant pretty pointless since there's no traitor, which is a big part of the game in my oppinion, and some crossroads cards feel thematically broken. I won't ever play it with 2 players. I also recommend playing with high probability of a traitor. We didn't have a traitor in my first two games and, for a moment, I thought this game was not that good. In my oppinion there are much better coop games out there if you "take the traitor mechanic out" of this one.

Solid hidden-traitor game. In our first game, we didn't have a traitor so I'm looking forward to a session where this is the case. It seems a bit overhyped, though.

Update August 2015: downgraded due to inherent brokenness of the game. Me and my group will (rationally) sink the whole group if we can't win along, as traitor (ofc) or survivor (disagreement in the community) which is quite easy. This doesn't replace BSG for me.

Very good game; definitely a hit with every group that I've played with.  I also enjoy playing it with just my wife.  2-player loses the traitor mechanic, which is some of the fun.

RATING: 8.5
A game I picked up on a whim, and boy was it a good choice. I would say I'm drawn to co-op games, but this adds a traitor mechanic akin to Shadows Over Camelot. What sets this apart from Shadows, is that not only are we all trying to survive the scenario,but each player has a secret objective that they're trying to achieve. So you have to decide, "should I help out the colony, or hold back and keep things I need to finish my personal goals?" But what truly sets this game apart from many other co-ops with a traitor mechanic, are the Crossroads cards. The fact that they can make each game a unique experience and will only be triggered when certain characters are in play, the player does a certain action etc. The crossroads can truly hamper or help someone in a pinch, while others require a majority vote on the outcome. These usually have people losing trust in one another when one person votes in favor for something truly horrible to happen...or where they really considering what's best for the colony?

The game can have a bit of complexity, but nothing that goes over even the greenest of gamers. I've been able to teach this game to fairly new gamers or people that barely play games and it has gone over well. 

When you see it, you'll immediately think "ah, another zombie game." But it's far from that. Zombies in this game is more of a looming threat on top of everything else the game will throw at you. Zombies aren't center stage, but if they get out of control then you're boned. There is so many different mechanics and things happening in the game, that makes the zombies just the icing on the cake. Great game, one of my favorites

Wow. What an amazingly fun game. Every game tells a different story. It often gets you to make absolutely brutal decisions in the name of survival.

I'm actually glad it has a zombie theme because finally this is the game which does justice to the theme. The biggest threat to your survival may very well not be the zombies, but the other survivors.

My perspective here: I'm frequently forced to play BSG and I am ALWAYS a Cylon (and sometimes also play Shadows over Camelot and am ALWAYS a traitor).  I get really tired of it. SO, I liked Dead of Winter, because although I was obviously dealt a Betrayer card, I had another objective besides bringing down the game and so you can focus on other things. I like the Crossroads and I like the idea that others may have destructive objectives as well. (1 play)

The individal player objectives add a layer of deception and tension in the game because you never know if a person if "evil" or just a fellow good survivor who wants to keep some meds with him cause he's a pusher - which is how I imagine post-apocalyptic world would be.

This is a thematically strong game complete with zombies, crises (e.g. blizzards which demand you collect fuel for fire, food spoilage which require food contributions, etc.), locations for resource-gathering (don't make too much noise or more zombies will come), and death - lots and lots of death. 

If semi-coop with a dash of competitive play and zombies are your thing, this game is for you.

RATING: 4
Three honest tries now, really wanted to like it because it's two of my friends favorite game. However the story element doesn't grasp me, the gameplay seems like there is not many options on a turn, and oh so long between turns where if I'm at the table or in the bathroom doesn't seem to make a difference. If I want a fun storytelling game I'll play Tales of the Arabian nights, if I want a long engaging euro game I'll play Terra Mystica, if I want an awesome zombie game I'll play City of Horror, and if I want a great betrayer hidden-roles game, Avalon still works great. Mashing all four of these elements together in a sub-par way just doesn't seem to work for me.

Update: Played again, this time with 4 (the other times were all with 5) and there was a little improvement due to less downtime, but not enough to change my rating. Will probably only play again if there are three players. Had more fun with a half-hour conversation after the game ended on how it could be improved.

The crossroad mechanism is interesting and thematic. The rest of the game is...less so. 

If one person ends up with significantly more characters than the rest, expect to sit there while that person does a ton of stuff. 

Also, you'll often find yourself with your characters just sitting there, shooting or searching, without much else to do throughout the turn.

Looking forward to the next Crossroads game to see if they can bring some fresh mechanisms along with their greatest innovation.

The semi-cooperative nature of this game just doesn't work for me.  Everyone has their own hidden objectives, which depending on the objective, can make the game awkward.  I spend one entire game at a single location just searching every turn for guns.  In addition, in my experience the crossroads cards almost never actually trigger.

RATING: 2
One of the very worst mistakes of my board gaming experience was falling for the hype and stupid reviews praising this game. Nothing you do in this game matters. Everything is just boiled down to anti-climatic dice rolls which completely determine the outcome of what's happening at any point in time. The thematic immersion that many seem to be praising the game for is rendered completely mute by the sheer amount of randomness and luck that drives the game. What's the point of playing a boardgame if nothing you do matters? If you like zombies just watch a zombie movie or read a book or play a videogame about zombies. Gameplay wise, this game gets a zero, the rating of 2 is for the good artwork and components value.

Delightfully duplicitous, this semi-cooperative game forces you to not just fear the zombies or freezing to death, but also the other players. Chose a survivor, complete with a well-characterized standee and individual powers, to pit against the elements from outside and within that conspire against you. My only gripe is the individual goals which must be completed by survivors - in addition to surviving itself, which is no small task - can create some intra-group conflict ASIDE FROM the betrayer.

Very, VERY cool semi co-op game (traitor element involved). I could take or leave the theme, but mechanically, this is an excellent get-together game for 5 and also works pretty well as a straight-up co-op for two.

Beautiful production values, straight-forward gameplay, interesting decisions and excellent sense of escalation.

It's a fun co-op game with some flaws. I find that most people forget to pull a crossroads card during the other players turn, the personal victory conditions are silly, the frostbite side of the die is an auto death for the most part and I felt like there should be ways to upgrade the colony. I think rather than having conditions for individual players to win, it should have just been, traitor or not a traitor. I still enjoy playing but it has dropped down a bit on my list.

The best zombie themed game! Zombies are an environment threat, much like an arctic freeze taking over the world. The threat of death comes from the environment, but the core game derives from the survivors. This game captures that element. It's great. 

There are some inconsistencies within the game, which break immersion. I think more needs to be done to make being a Betrayer more interesting and less blindly disruptive. Expansion should address this.

I don't get it, I really don't. Both times I played, I was totally at the mercy of the item decks.

The first time, I didn't get the items I needed, so I lost.

The second time, I did get them, but the traitor stole one of them from me in the very last turn of the game.

Both games were equally tedious, a lot of semi-co-op hemming and hawing about equally mundane alternatives, followed by an underwhelming finish.

Not enough game in there for me to get excited about.

Boring highly thematic but at the same time highly trashy game. Crossroads cards may be easily forgotten even i didnt understand what it adds to the game except for a some random event.

This game has a lot of components and cards to keep track of but the player board and presentation goes a long way to keeping it all manageable. After that you are left with an enormous amount of re-playability to explore the different scenarios, victory conditions, and what new stories you'll have to tell. The traitor mechanic is quite interesting since it is so easy for good people to act suspicious or traitors play cooperatively until it is too late.

I loved this game initially, but over time the game has sort of faded for me. It begins to feel like just a ton of searching, which is thematic but also pretty boring. I also don't really enjoy co-ops in general. While the traitor mechanic shakes this up, it often isn't enough for me. That being said, this is one of the best co-ops out there in my opinion and it scratches an itch that nearly no other game can scratch. Overall, I still really enjoy it.

A pleasant enough play with the right people, but so many of its elements don't work as intended (crossroad cards) or are executed better in other games (traitor mechanic). That being said, it can be a lot of fun with people invested in the story and the aesthetics of the game are just amazing. I also really appreciate the thematic mechanics of making noise and frost bite. But the bottom line is that, while it can be entertaining enough, there are too many plates to spin that detract from the theme rather than accentuate it.

Cooperative Zombie dice-rolling "hits&health" style game with the potential for a traitor which is a mechanic I personally love. Within the main game goal which changes based upon the scenario you choose, there are individual hidden goals each player must achieve to truly win. Nice playing board and pieces in an enjoyable package. Maybe not "Game of the Year" material but worth owning. I still put "Betrayal" above this game.

This is the only game I've played that truly lives up to its zombie apocalypse theme. A co-op game with hidden objectives and possibility of a traitor, DoW establishes that every player is out for themselves feeding into the inherent suspicion and human flaw of selfishness that is characteristic of the genre.

5/4/16 update: Game becomes tiring. My opinion would improve if you could share with other players. This feels like an unnecessary limit in a game about survival. Yes, it's also about selfishness, but it makes the difficult to balance competitive co-op more lopsided on the competitive side and any screw up causes the board to collapse.

One of my design partners and I may have to abandon a project we've been working on for 3 or 4 years (sporadically) due to how incredibly similar this game is to ours, same theme, core mechanics, metagame, semi-coop, just unreal (talk about a bummer, but we did take too long) 

Needless to say I'll be picking this up...

Edit - May 4, 2014 - Holy Shit, read the rulebook, its like these guys sat in on one of our design sessions, its the same core game with some minor differences, just unreal. We started our development in 2009, my partner blogged about it a few times in 2011 but no where were major details revealed.... I mean an Apoc semi co-op game with a face up team objective, every one having a secret objective, a chance (here its about 45%, we were shooting for like 38%, unreal!) there is a Traitor, a Morale track, roll for exposures (working almost the same!), Crisis cards (ours were events but amounting to same thing), some of the same locations and item cards, and a few other minor things just incredible. 

There are a few significant differences too, but I'm not sure where that leaves us. Anyway its a must have game for us obviously and would recommend it to others looking for a meaty semi-coop potential Traitor game with good paranoia in it.

Seems like an ok game but it doesn't really work for our group dynamic. Granted this was one play on what seemed like a fairly easy scenario without a traitor, but the game fell pretty flat for us. Crossroad system was interesting and fun but it was a pretty small part of the game the rest of which was a pretty straightforward affair. It was interesting how since we needed to kill a lot of zombies there were times when we'd purposely fail something if the only punishment was getting more zombies on the board. Maybe part of the problem was that we happened to get characters/items that made it so collectively the table could kill something like 10-11 zombies a round without rolling the exposure die, and if that were riskier there would have been more room for a traitor to sow discord, but it seemed like a traitor would have had a really hard time in that group. By the end we had all told each other our secret win conditions and worked together to make sure they were all satisfied before we won, which I feel like isn't supposed to happen.

RATING: 7
A very interesting twist on the zombie game where the zombies are actually somewhat incidental to the entire game play.  It is a little dice-luck at times, but good players can mitigate that effect with good planning.

After more plays, the dice is not as bad as there are other means that I didn't realize to mitigate your rolls and the exposure dice isn't as bad as it first seems.  This is almost a 10 for me and it may well be as we play with other players.

After a play with 4 and then 5 players, this game is certainly a 10.  We keep wanting to play it and the story that the game tells has been completely different every time.  The secret objectives are not so difficult that you are pulling against the team all the time.  We haven't had anyone be a betrayer yet, so we may make it a bit easier to have that happen.  All in all, this is a great game!

This is one of those games that is deceptively long. By that I mean it's one of those games that feels like it's going by a lot quicker which is a fantastic thing.

The way you actually handle a party of characters instead of just one, and the action dice system are both fun and clever; good way of handling randomness. The crossroad cards seem fiddly and somewhat annoying and the game seems a bit unfocused.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The ease with which one player's character can die, combined with the ease another player can pick up extra characters can lead to a game which is hugely asymmetric in the involvement levels of players - One player having a lot of options and actions to do each turn, while another player can be done in 30 seconds and then having little to do for the next 20+ minutes. 

But there's a lot of fun in here - some on the blocks of text over hundreds of cards, and some on the traitor mechanic and the need to co-ordinate differing players' agendas.

This is the first game I've played that I feel truly transcends the labels of "Eurogame" or "Ameritrash". It's incredibly thematic and uses some brilliantly streamlined mechanics (like the Exposure die!).

I absolutely love this game and would recommend it to anybody who asked, but I'll just lay out the couple issues that kept it from being a 10 for me:

1) Why bother including the "long" objectives? Nobody wants to play a 6 hour game. We played one accidentally and had to give up after 2 hours when it was clear we had at least another 4 hours remaining. 

2) The board(s) make it look pretty soul-less. It looks ugly and intimidating on the table.

This may just be the people I play with, but it also tends to be very static. I've noticed the game usually starts with several people leaving for places to loot and then sitting on that location all game. Some mechanic to force more movement might have been a good addition.

Having played Robinson Crusoe, I think the system used in Robinson Crusoe, as far as I know it doesn't have a special name,  of having events, some with decisions to be made, with delayed effects is much better than the Crossroads cards. I prefer it because: 1) the events or decisions just trigger when drawn, instead of requiring arbitrary prerequisites that usually don't trigger; 2) the effects appear more meaningful to the game most of the time; 3) and the use of a token to mark an upcoming effect from an event gives it a nice sense of tension, knowing that you're going to be hurt but not how or exactly when. That isn't to say that the crossroads system is bad, but I'm hoping future games that try to implement this kind of thing will lean more on Robinson Crusoe than Dead of Winter.

Super fun game! Ameritrash at its best. So many decisions to make each turn that will help or hinder the whole colony. Even without the (pretty awesome) Crossroads card mechanic, all kinds of interesting stories emerge through the gameplay. 

I do think it MIGHT be a little too easy for the betrayer to win right at the end, and I'm still not sure how I feel about the player order passing to the right.

Great survival horror semi-coop game. Player elimination when you're outted as the traitor is great, meaning you don't lose the game on the spot and watch the survivors try to stay alive.

The hardcore versions of scenarios when playing without the traitor are really good as well and gives a nice way to play the game for people that don't enjoy the traitor mechanics as much. Depending on your group this might be the way to go as some people are just bad at playing the traitor and others just don't like the mechanic.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2014)

Dead of Winter is certainly a good game but as many people named it “Game of the Year” I was expecting something a bit better. Still I have only scratched the surface of what the game can offer so I still have high hopes for the game. I feel it is a mix of Battlestar Galactica, with Mall of Horror and Robinson Crusoe.

The game rules aren’t complex and they are easy to teach, however the game has a lot of English text and due to the secretive nature of the crossroad system and the secret objectives all the players need to understand the language very well. That’s bad news for many of my friends. The art is GREAT and the components are adequate. I would have loved if the game came with zombie minis but the cardboard pieces are ok and they serve well their purpose. I think I will use zombie miniatures from other games.

I’m a big fan of apocalyptic and/or zombie themes so that’s another plus for me. However Dead of Winter, although in a Zombie setting, feels something more so I feel the game will appeal to people, even if they hate the zombie theme.

The secret objectives are great (although unbalanced), and along with the traitor mechanic and the crossroad system, are the best the game has to offer for me. They allow for very interesting group dynamics, even if there is no traitor some players will make weird moves that throw suspicion in their direction, or (mean) players could exile other players just because :devil:. Due to this, I feel this is the one of the greatest Semi-Coop games out there. Many games fail at this but there is real tension in Dead of Winter.

There is some luck with the dice each player throws each turn, but you can mitigate it a bit using food, and that also throws suspicion your way. 

Bottom line, a good game I want to explore further. It could go up in my personal ratings, but it also could go down as easily. I still prefer to play BSG over Dead of Winter.

I thought the game was going to improve after more plays, but for us, it has become a bit boring each time. Now I feel the game to be exceedingly long for what it offers, it has A LOT of uncontrollable randomness (exposure die, cards, unbalanced secret goals). I’m downgrading its rating. As of right now, I’m trying to sell my copy but I will probably play it again in the future. My desire to play DoW took a hard plunge.

Still feel the crossroad system is great. BSG is miles above DoW.

After even more plays I continue to downgrade Dead of Winter's rating.

The game is really hard to win so when there is a traitor he doesn't need to do anything exceptional to tank the game. This makes for a boring experience as there is no evidence if there is a traitor and he can attack at a critical junture when everyone trust him. This sounds great but here it isn't because the traitor is hidden not because he plays very well but because the game allowed him to hide without any effort at all. In all my games I haven't yet seen bad cards in the current crisis and this doesn't hurt the traitor in any way. 

All things considered, I only like the game's theme, artwork and the innovative crossroad system, however I would like the choices on the crossroad cards to be blind, that makes a lot more thematic sense.

my favorite zombie game. I love the hidden agenda, the way the game beats you down, and the crossroad cards make this game shine.

RATING: 6
It is a very fiddly game.

First, the objectives does an adequate job of hiding the betrayer, however it gives a false sense of ending game conclusion. If the colony gets overrun and you complete your objective, you lose. However if the colony survives at the end of the rounds and you don't complete your objective you lose too. It feels like you can't the objectives and ending game conclusion are very different.

Second, the encounter die shouldn't be here. I hate that this part of the game is completely random. Granted you can get items that can ignore it, but you seldom get these items because the range of items you can receive is huge! Also even IF you get the item, you probably need to spend it for the crisis.

Other than that, I love the encounter cards and how they can be randomly triggered. I love searching for supplies and trying to fix this puzzle of a survival game.

But it has a lot of blemishes, that prevents me from enjoying it fully.

This does NOT replace BSG, but it is certainly a slightly shorter semi-co-op that plays 3-5 nicely.  Time between turns can get slow if playing with too many noobs, but we burned a 3p short game very quickly.  More than likely the betrayer variant will be used in our games.

I hsve my brother to thank for this game... i picked it up just for his visit.
I have played this game twice now and have yet to win a game. I didn't expect much from this game and when I was setting this game up with my brother it looked incredibly complicated.  
Supriszingly though it is not that complicated at all and in no time at all we were having fun. This is a long game and you need to plan that time if you want to see the end. Although you can have some long down time between your turns, there is enough of a story unfolding to keep you engaged the entire time.
We would make up little stories about our characters when something happened to them.
After my first game I didn't know if if liked it or not...kinda the same way I felt after playing twilight struggle. ... But just like twilight struggle I couldn't help think about this game all the next day and found myself wanting to play it again
This is my brothers no.1 game!!! And definitely in my top 10!!!

2014-10-01 - I needn't have worried about whether or not this game would live up to the hype. It really is very good. I've only played the first scenario (2 times), and it is a little on the basic side, but it's good for getting to know the game. It takes a little while to teach, but is actually fairly simple. The theme really comes across well. This felt a lot like Battlestar Galactica to me, but shorter and with more to do. I really like this one.

2015-10-04 - The shine has worn off a bit. I'm dropping my rating from an 8 to a 7, because the dynamic this game builds just doesn't seem to work for me. I think my group has had some trouble figuring out the betrayer goals. The good guys have lost way more often than they've won, but the betrayer has never actually won (despite frequently being the reason the good guys lost). So, more often than not, no one has won, which would be fine if we were playing Pandemic, but is just frustrating for me in this kind of game. I do have hopes we'll figure it out, and this game will go back up in my estimation. For now, though, it's dropping to a 7.

2017-07-03 - So, in the end, I don't like the betrayal mechanism in this game. It's too fragile, and just not very interesting to me. It feels like a hack to make people feel a certain way. Lowering my rating to a 6.

Dead of Winter is an action-packed game that constantly provides you tense decisions, both as a group and for your own interests. The mechanics work well together, and the suspense mounts as the session progresses. As someone who isn't a fan of straight co-ops, I wish there was a way for there to be a clear winner; but the game is fun enough that this ends up being a minor caveat. I'm not often in the mood for a zombie game, but when I am, Dead of Winter is my drug of choice.

The next evolution of zombie games: not only must you complete the scenario to succeed (a la Last Night On Earth) but you must also complete an individual one as well -- though there may be someone in your group who wants to betray you and make sure you don't win. Zombie arrivals are pre-set, chances of failure are quite decent... all around, this isn't an easy game to win but it's certainly fun if you happen to lose.

BIG PLUS: integration of different mechanics
PLUS: strong use of theme, piece quality, variety of options
MINUS: not a simple "right out of the box" game... though picks up when you get the hang of it

I very much enjoy this game and I manage to get to the table pretty often.  Sort of a combination of Pandemic and Avalon: ostensibly you're all working together for an objective but maybe there is a traitor in your midst?  Paranoia is high and the game works really well as a result.

Interesting game with a great, immersive theme. . . that gets old as the game wears on. Once the "wow this is cool" factor wears off, the same-e-ness of your choices - despite the cool Crossroads cards that add great texture and twists - becomes apparent. 

"Here's our next crisis card - it's a fuel one again. . ." Every round becomes an exercise in collecting a certain number of cards to avoid some crisis. The only difference in the events that occur is what kinds of cards you need to collect. Blah.

Wishing that something more happened as the game ramped up, besides just more zombies and more mouths to feed. This game just grows tiresome for how long it takes to play. Enjoyed it, loved the theme and the descriptive texts, but won't be purchasing it for the high price tag due to scarcity at this point.

The epitome of ameritrash games, as far as I am concerned. Tons of atmosphere that sucks you right into the world - you feel the cold and desperation as you play. Often a little too random, but that randomness is there to give the traitor a place to hide. I love how subtle the betrayal is in DoW - it's never failing missions or outright sabotage, at-least not until the Right Moment; it's not cleaning up after yourself, eating the food, not sharing, making just a little too much noise. This fosters the sense of paranoia that makes the game what it is.

Great game, always fun, never won it.

RATING: 8
Very solid experience game. Feels quite similar to Battlestar Galactica in a number of ways, but most notably in the betrayal and crisis mechanics. The advantage this game has over BSG is that it does not have the infamous FFG rules bloat that makes BSG a huge chore to teach and a really long evening to play. Now that I have this, I doubt I will ever go back to BSG again. Dead of Winter improves upon it in almost every way, except for the tired theme. Fortunately, it does not play like a typical zombie game (which nobody ever needs more than one of, if that).

The rules are almost too efficient. In your first play, you are likely to come across a lot of situations that the rules do not adequately address. Be prepared to reference the FAQ (which is also pretty thin) and/or make judgement calls during play. After a couple of plays, you'll either find an answer online or a satisfactory house rule that stays within the spirit of the rule set.

Played this again with the correct rules and it was much improved. Feels like the Walking Dead, in fact that's what everyone in my group calls it. Most sessoins are farily tense with a fair amout of difficult decisions. Players pray to find the right items, debate the merits of adding survivors, look suspiciously at one another, and hope that holding onto to that can of fuel doesn't come back to bite them. Literally.

Nearing 10 plays and I'm beginning to feel a bit of burn-out. It took 20+ plays for me to grow tired of Robinson Crusoe and that one I still like to go back and play. I might need a break from DoW.

Not bad... like the crossroads mechanic, like the exposure mechanic, like the waste mechanic (although seems rarely a factor).

First game with 4 players was a blast and we were able to get plenty done and have a great time, but second game with 2 players cooperatively there just weren't enough rounds to do everything that needed doing, even discounting Crisis and Crossroads events. 

Gets a 4 for a 2P experience but an 8 for 4P.

Too fragile and mechanically boring for my tastes. 

Writing is of variable quality which sadly wasn't enough to redeem it thematically.

Story wise the crossroad mechanic is pretty flawed as well. They give you a detailed 'story' on a card that leaves no room for the players agency, as opposed to say a game like Eldritch Horror that gives you micro encounters that build up to make a story. I'd rather read a book.

I haven't played a lot of thematic games, but the characters, flavor, and especially the Crossroads cards immerse you in the world so completely that it's more about telling a story and taking in the atmosphere than the mechanics (which are also fun). I'm a fan.

Great game. Fun, thematic, and the crossroad cards are a really special twist that can add a lot to the game and create real moments of drama. Would easily be an 8, maybe even a 9 if it weren't for the way the traitor mechanic plays out. There's nothing wrong with the hidden traitor, but in order to hide him the game gives each player a secret goal that just completely breaks the immersion of the game and creates a lot of confusion without a lot of payoff. Want to play this more as a pure coop and see if it improves.

A good mix of theme and semi-cooperative gameplay. The first zombie game that isn't as stupid as its theme. While no revelation, most of the time players have real choices. The trade-off between individual goals and the common goal is interesting. Risking movement at the danger of being bitten, save items for future crises or use them now - the right risk management is decisive. Once a traitor is in the group, winning becomes much more challenging.

Many characters, ten scenarios and the crossroads cards provide replayability. Repeated plays in short time will lay bare the limited mechanisms but as a thematic diversion only every now and then Dead of Winter gains a place in my collection as first zombie game.

Overall, very impressed. We'll see how this one holds up over time.

A fine semi-coop game. Although I do not find the traitor mechanic all that intriguing. Most, if not all the time, the traitor do not need to do anything deliberately to achieve their winning condition or Forces everyone to lose. 

Simply because of the way the game unflow, the sequence of the type of crisis card come out, dice roll, item serach, personal goal. The game can go from being super easy to impossibly hard. 

One of my main complain is that some personal objective combine with certain main objective are pretty much unwinnable nonsense.

This is one of the weaker co-ops, though I suppose if you like a zombie theme, this might do it for you. Its Battlestar, but BSG does traitor paranoia better. Its Robinson Crusoe, but RC does survival better. Its Shadows over Camelot, but SoCam does simple co-op better.

The mish-mash of mechanics is okay, if it wasn't so slow and boring on someone else's turn. The Crossroads mechanic wasn't as groundbreaking as I imagined it to be.

RATING: 5
Requires the right group. Only good if the players are decent role players/storytellers. If simply played mechanically and robotically rather than for its story experience and social interaction, for which I'm sure it excels, then don't expect too many satisfied players.

Needs a traitor player who can play their role in an interesting fashion too. That player needs to enjoy stimulating some kind of fun-chaos in the game. It's absolutely no fun at all if the traitor behaves themselves through the entire game. The point of that role is to create an air of distrust, fun discussion, finger pointing and tension. Without that, our night ended with an awkward, bitter taste in the mouths of many when the traitor finally made himself known and annihilated our hard fought chance for victory at the last possible second. The game is certainly no cakewalk! On a side note, I just can't enjoy how fiddly things get as the game goes on. When more characters, equipment and items start coming out, things start getting chaotic and tedious quite quickly upon the tabletop.

But still, I can certainly appreciate the idea and its design. If played with the right mindset and game group I'm sure it'd be an absolute blast. But several games later I've lost the patience trying to discover that sweet spot.

It's okay... But given the choice to play a different game with a (possible) traitor, I would always opt for something else. The crossroad cards are a just a blown up random trigger and the choices they present simply boil down to making the mechanically right choice. Having the app only tell you the thematic choices (and not the consequences) is a huge improvement which shouldn't have been necessary. It should have been in the game right from the start. The individual goals hurt make the game susceptible to tanking, since there's no incentive for players who can no longer reach their secret goal to cooperate with the others if they can't reach their goal they will lose no matter what. The thing that one of your characters could just randomly die by moving is (imho) a horrible design choice. And ultimately everything else which happens in the game is rather tedious and bland... search items, fight, bring out the trash (really?!) Just not my game...

I hate zombies but love co operative games. You can play this many times and never get bored.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
I don't understand the love for this game.

First thing first: the theme is puerile. You know what? Dead is dead. Dead things stay dead. A game based on dead things moving about has a tall mountain to climb. Even if you are prepared to suspend disbelief in the second law of thermodynamics, zombies aren’t scary. They shamble about and fall over. Bits fall off. They are tedious and stupid. But in Dead of Winter it's relatively easy to get past the theme since the zombies don't really feature anyway apart from the mechanical whack-a-zombie routine at the start of each round. But when it comes down to it, zombies are at best not fun and at worst they're a reason to throw a game on a fire. 

It's confusing to teach, because there seems to be such a lot of irrelevant and random stuff going on, and it's hard to avoid pointing out the obvious: don't leave too many people in the colony, but if possible leave someone there who kills zombies without rolling for exposure, move as little as possible from location to location, and ensure that you barricade whenever possible. And if you draw new colony members, always make noise and draw again. Apart from this there's limited space for tactics and absolutely none for strategy. So the game manages to be formulaic while at the same time being chaotic and depending too much on chance.

Setup takes too long and is too fiddly for what the game is, there’s too much downtime between turns, and the game invariably overstays its welcome - which in my case never lasts more than about 10 minutes.

Why am I so impatient with this game? Apart from the stupid theme? Because it is overly dependent on luck. For a start, the powers of the characters in play make a huge difference to the outcome of the game. If you get characters with complementary powers, you will have a very different game from the one you get if you have characters with powers that don’t complement each other. Next, everything you do is subject to the roll of dice. The outcome of the roll can go from nothing to dead, and you have no way apart from re-rolling to react to what you roll and mitigate the outcome. Bad rolls have no upside, high rolls are have no downside. That’s not good. And if the player had some agency, the randomness might be fun. In this game, what you can do is largely determined by things outside your control. Games that depend on luck but give the player no agency are not going to stay on my shelves. 

I don’t like the atmosphere of the game. The traitor mechanic and personal agendas leads to suspicion between players. It also emphasises their isolation from one another, which is not lessened by any sense of common purpose. The game has never felt to me like anything more than a strange solitaire where the only common bond is mutual distrust. The game is designed to cause each player to mistrust the others. I don't enjoy mistrusting people, and mistrust isn't the place I'd start if I'm looking for a good time. Feeling betrayed is bad enough in real life not to want to look for it in a game.

The traitor mechanic actually breaks the game when the player knows what they are doing. Behave totally in keeping with the other players until very close to the end, and then drive the morale down to zero in a surprise move. 

In this game, collecting resources is a forced, mechanical rote, a dull chore. There are no interesting decisions. You just dig through a heap, collect resources, make noise, whack a zombie, roll a die, die. I find I can "meet with Triumph and Disaster / And treat those two impostors just the same" rather easily in this game. 

The crossroad cards are intended to give the game a much-needed shot in the arm every now and then. Unfortunately there is no coherence in the crossroad cards, with a startlingly wide qualitative range of possible outcomes. But that wide range is often immaterial since the cards are rarely triggered and when they are they usually have little or no impact on the game.

There's minimal story arc or sense of progress (or the lack of it) and so very little tension. The game is what it is from the start. I feel myself plodding stolidly through my turn, then waiting rather dully while everyone else plods through theirs. And hoping that it'll all stop soon.

This game takes some of the things that BSG does well and breaks them. By having players wait until their turn to do anything consequential, it loses the constant engagement and decisionmaking. Characters are disposable and too many rely on the "take an extra card" mechanic, so you aren't even really invested in outcomes because there isn't enough differentiation. 

I appreciate that it's shorter, but I wouldn't play a short version of BSG, either. The whole game is about doing the one thing your characters can do well until they get overwhelmed, so once it's your turn again, you're STILL not making meaningful choices. Totally unsatisfying to me.

One of best coops I have played as of late. 

Concept of hidden goals is great and ads so much tension to game. Based on this and my love to BSG I no longer enjoy pure coops (without either traitor/hidden goals or one vs many or something with realtime aspects) so much. These more traditional coops feel too dry, are prone to analysis-paralysis and aplha player syndrome (and I must confess I am guilty of being aplha player too). 

Story is nice too, although I would probably enjoyed it more if it was not zombie themed.

RATING: 8
A fantastic atmospheric game, this comes back often on the table when we have 4-5 players. Can be lengthy, and long to setup/manage components/play through turns with so many things to think about, but more often than not it is worth it.

A bit more bland without a traitor, so I highly recommend increasing the odds of having one (but keeping it possible to not have one). Lots of lore, good game play, meaningful choices - you'll never be able to have a perfect plan.

While the hard objectives looks like quite a steep bump in difficulty, after a few games I recommend using it - it is possible, especially without a traitor, to not be challenged enough as you get better.

Overall, a very thematic game I would recommend if you like managing a lot of components, like to plan out your turns in groups and optimize survival - but beware of those pesky traitors.

Even when there is no betrayer the game is hard and when the suspicions rise it becomes much more chaotic. The game definitely feels thematic and the atmosphere is there. My only complaint is the downtime and I use the variant with the one action per player until dice run out to solve that (each player takes little turns until they run out of dice). I recommend the game but I don't get why people recommend it to newcomers. If one of the player doesn't know the game well teaching and playing just takes so long a shorter better gateway game would be much more enjoyable. After this not hitting the table for a while it became previously owned. It is just too long.

RATING: 5
2016-10-09 - 6.5 - I played once the first easy scenario and there was no traitor drawn. Even with all that in mind I have some doubts if this game will live up the hype. It was fine, sometimes funny, sometimes creepy but it was not the experience which can be compared to the one I had with Battlestar Galactica. DoW has advantages over BSG, like playing time and lower number of players required to have a good time. But the gameplay seemed mechanical and was basically digging in one of the 6 piles of trash most of the time. The Crossroad mechanism is interesting, but not as good as I would expect and happened rather rarely. 
The game is not the easiest to explain as well, but maybe I just had a worse day.
Anyway I will try to play at least another scenario, which may add some spark to the game.
It's not bad. But I expected much more.
One more thing - I worry about replayability. If you know what the items can do and what Crossroads cards there are (or at least what kind of cards you can encounter) the game will be less surprising and might become even more mechanical, which is not a good thing in a such story driven game.

2016-11-15 - 6,5->6 - It's only ok game, but a big disappointment due to mechanical play. There are better games and I think this one is rather not worth my limited time. I won't propose it, but I can play it from time to time if someone suggests it.

2016-11-23 - 6->5 - I got rid of it. 5 is more accurate rating of my desire to play this game.

Ugh.  Glad I didn't buy this one.

Semi co-op means everyone is grinding away for their own secret agenda and maybe someone is a traitor, but in practice it just makes for inefficient fumbling through a dice riddled card hunt.  Sometimes you win easily; sometimes you have no chance.

Thematically it's uneven at best.  I'm not entirely sure how walking to the gas station gave me such horrible frostbite that I died.  Doesn't anyone wear gloves?  The dog just blasted that zombie with a shotgun?  Weirdness.

Not sure about a random luck of the draw causing some players to have a whole army of characters while some may get whittled down to one.  Combine that with the occasional impossible secret goal and you have one fragile game experience.

A MUST on any gaming shelf! This game is another that has a lot of replayability because regardless the outcomes will turn out differently each time you play it. I also recommend playing with more than 3 people only because it allows for more excitement and "edge of your seat" storytelling. Also depending on the group you are playing with I recommend the betrayal aspect since it adds a certain flare and twist on the game but again beware of the group you are playing with since it could "end friendships"

Co-op games are meant to be difficult. This one is no different. However, the frustration that is often tacked onto other co-op games doesn't seem to exist here. Perhaps that speaks to how well put together this game is. And those Crossroad cards truly do add some color to the story.

After 3 or 4 plays, I thought that this might be the greatest game I've ever played. After 5 or 6 plays, I realized that I actually didn't like it that much.

És gyakorlatilag ez a lényeg, aki szereti a nagy sztorikat, bele tudja élni magát egy-egy kalandba, és bejön neki a zombi tematika, az jó eséllyel imádni fogja... Számomra viszont egyszerűen túl sok a szerencse benne. Nem, nem azt akarom mondani, hogy minden a szerencsén múlik, és biztosan sokkal okosabb döntéseket is lehet hozni, de egy ilyen összetettségű és játékidejű társasnál én ennél nagyobb kontrollra vágyom.

Loved this game upon original purchase, and still love it. However, after more playthroughs, some elements of the game I have cooled on. The betrayer mechanic is great, but how the betrayer can sabotage is really uninspired. Instead of subtly tanking the game throughout to raise suspicion, all the betrayer has to do is wait until the last round and attract zombies, eat food, move, etc. Downtime can be long with more players, and personal objectives can also be very unbalanced. My first real thematic game though, which will always stay in my collection. Have great memories playing it with friends. If your group doesn't get into the theme, the game will definitely suffer.

This game is one hell of a zombie game! My favorite zombie game is Last Night on Earth, but the possibility of a traitor in the group makes this an edge of your seat game. The different win conditions is also outstanding...some win, some lose, one winner, all winners, all losers. Awesome!

First play through was awesome. Game is just deep enough. Love the crossroads cards, they really make you feel like you're in the game. Loved the traitor mechanic - I was the traitor the first game and managed to win the game that way. The others in the game didn't even realize I was acting as the traitor until I turned the card over - they just thought we lost a tough co-op game. The looks on their faces was awesome! 

Will definitely stay in my collection and be played often.

Another co-operative game with the potential for a betrayer. Players get all kinds of extra equipment and potential other followers in this zombie apocalypse game. Leveling up is always fun, and rolling the die to see if you get bit is also tense. I still have not played this game with a betrayer yet, so I may bump this up depending on how those games play out. As is, the cooperative aspect of the game has been fairly easy when there has been no betrayer, even if players seem to do fairly odd things to meet their largely arbitrary, and sometimes impossible goals (which I do have a problem with). As a strictly cooperative game it has some fun and enjoyment, but other games do it better.

RATING: 8
I usually don't get into overly complex and long games. But this one is just one you MUST  play for anyone into End of the World scenario playing. It's psuedo-coop, meaning everyone works together, unless you're the betrayer (randomly and secretly handed character goal cards), everyone wins if you beat the main crisis objective. Each round brings on a new crisis, each round you must feed the colony, and morale is of utmost importance. I've never played a game that weaves story telling, plot and scene setting like this one. If you have a group of board gamers, someone MUST own this game to bring out from time to time...

+ The rules needed to know to get up and running are easy to get. There are some minor things that are still ok if one player knows and reminds other players to it at the proper time.
+ plays fast
+ tension!
+ soaked with theme

- Personal objectives are inbalanced. Some are easy other are much harder to complete. Also the survivers you control can make them easyer or harder to achieve. It's always fun keeping the objective in mind but in the end when all the objectives are show it's always clear wich were the easy and wich were the hard ones.

- I dislike the story-telling aspect of this game. I just want to play the game.

- I dislike the traitor aspect to this game. In my first game, the traitor failed to do anything threatening.
- I dislike how the difficulty of the secret objective cards varies greatly. I'd rather have decks of easy, medium, and hard secret objectives.

At last, a great zombie game without tons of figures !!

This game features some great ideas. Most are already present in other games but the designers of DoW used them perfectly so they fit well together.

The result is a really good game were the players must cooperate but still go their own way (whether they are traitors or not) while facing all the tension and challenges the game mechanics put on them.

RATING: 9.6
Semi-coops have come and gone, but the extra Crossroads mechanics - which add a layer of storytelling - take this game to a different narrative vein. It's too bad Crossroads events are so random - they don't feel fully integrated into the pace of the game.

Also hard to learn - betrayal is always so hard to get right with a new group.

If you're into this kind of thing. This game may not appeal to the abstract euro crowd - it's more Walking Dead meets Werewolf. :)

08-27-2014 - This is a good game.  But it doesn't live up to the hype IMHO.  For one, i think it's too hard.  Perhaps more plays will give me a hope that it's possible to win, but now it's just so many cards you need, the cards aren't incredibly easy to get (burns action dice, cards are buried in numerous decks, etc.).  The designers put in things to help you accomplish certain tasks (characters who can draw extra cards, other stuff), but it's just not enough.  It is just a slow death march so far that isn't as enjoyable as other death marches, like Arkham Horror for instance.  Perhaps playing with the sweet spot of players will help (3 or 4?)?  Perhaps finally playing with a betrayer will help?  I don't know.  For now, 7 seems too low but 8 seems too high.  7.5.

The game delivered.It had the good stuff from Robinson crusoe. And added different objectives for each player. Which meant that all players acted suspicious. The crisis each round wasn't too bad. the crossroards, special events that occur when the condition is met that player turn added a lot of flavour. we are not rpg guys. but we all liked it. I liked it a lot. 
We had two ap prome players though. so next time 
i might add a clock. Speed is one of the biggest advantages we have over zombies.

Btw love how it dealt with the goals and that each player lost at least someone in the game.

As always- great expectations. It was said to be a psychological game. It is but in a way I hate- that is- if too little players work for the team instead of themselves, the whole team is going to lose. But if no one is doing anything and you're trying to fix it- you're going to lose. So let's even say players work together for shared victory and can play a nice cooperative game.

There are these crossroad cards (which can simply even eliminate one of the player's characters before he even gets to play one turn)- and they are supposed to be tones of fun. They are cool. Once. But when in three games in a raw you read the same three paragraphs about a crashing helicopter, it feels like watching the same movie over and over again. The cards are one use only, really. They would be much better if they were more generic, leaving more to imagine and less to read, also giving a player just an option with flavor. 

It also seems like every player has a team competing with other players' teams and every team has a leader character. Except the leader does nothing... It's only a name. Or our copy of rules is missing some pages. Also killing other player's characters will not work for you, so why the option? Just for the traitor? 

Some things and ideas are really cool here but we found the game to not work as it should. Everything semi-cooperative here just breaks the game. So if you simply play a classic cooperative game with a traitor, everything works fine- even personal goals.

RATING: 8
Only played it once, but I think this is just about the perfect zombie game, and the option for pure co-op vs. "I [i]think[/i] we're cooperating" means you can satisfy two different kinds of gamers.  Lots of neat little touches like indicators on the cards which should be removed when you're playing pure co-op, or Crossroads cards which might be objectionable for kids (uhh... you know, kids who are playing a game about flesh-eating undead).  Also, I like the basic mechanism of rolling your dice at the start of the turn and [i]then[/i] figuring out which ones to use for combat etc.; it's a little like Mage Knight, only without turns that take 20 goddamn minutes.

Update: the first time we played, it seemed like the Crossroads cards didn't really make much of a difference--but the second time, we got cards which changed our victory conditions, affected our food supply, and had some other neat effects, so it really depends on which ones come out.

Update: after a couple more plays, I'm sticking with the "just about the perfect zombie game" claim.  Our last game, everyone lost; we had it [i]in the bag[/i] until the last turn's crisis card came out.  The game before that, I was worried that I wasn't going to make my private goal before someone ended the game... then I [i]did[/i] make it (in what was going to be the last turn); then, as I was clearly happy (and the common goal had been met), someone called for a vote to exile me (just so that I wouldn't win), but it didn't pass... then that same person inadvertently hosed my goal... then through a stroke of luck I got [i]un-[/i]hosed, so it was a good emotional rollercoaster.  Tentatively calling this an 8, after adjusting for new-game-infatuation, but it could go up or down.

Update: two more plays tonight, both wins for me; also, we had our first Exile tonight (in the very last turn of the game), and it turned out to be the betrayer, which was [i]necessary[/i] for me, because exiling the betrayer (if there is one) was my secret goal (which I think is a really tough one).  [b]I thought it was great,[/b] tense right up until the last moment, but the betrayer said he didn't enjoy that game at all, because from turn 1 he felt he couldn't achieve his goal (having 4 guns equipped).  I didn't agree--I had [i]given[/i] him a gun early on, and if he'd played differently, I might have given him others, because I had more than I needed--so I felt like he would have had more fun if he'd seen his goal as [i]difficult[/i] rather than [i]impossible.[/i]

2016-09-12: yeah, sticking with "just about the perfect zombie game."  However, non-betrayers really need to understand that if they let the game end before they meet their secret conditions, [b]they lose,[/b] so they need to not let that happen.

Although this is a good game, I need to downsize, so gave to bjlillo.

Not sure why everyone is so fond of this one. Seems overrated to me. The crossroad cards are nice, but that's about it. The ethical dilemmas that you get with them are stupid. The game starts of with a lot of tension but the tension definately decreases after a few turns. After finding a few good weapons, you can simply stay where you are and shoot zombies or search, without ever having to roll the exposure die again. Also, that die can be terrible when starting the game. Losing your two characters in the first round is no fun at all. Wouldn't play this one again unless there isn't anything else to do. 

Whatever Dead of Winter does, other games do it better. A lot better.

RATING: 8
 Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition — but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for his own interests!

Semi-cooperative, story-telling game. The goal of the game is to survive the cruel post-apocalyptic world, while achieving your own individual goal. The entrance barrier is high due to the amount of rules that need to be explained. A very interesting mechanics of this game is that a player may trigger a random event at any time of the game which will results in hard decisions to be made. These require some reading, so some English proficiency is recommended.

Some sort of euro resource management zombie game. There are a few interesting things in this game, but I think the game is pretty long, or we were playing too slow.

We hopefully could not finish the game. The first turn took an around 1h, the 2nd turn took 30 min. There were 4 turns left. I don't see how the game could end in 2 hours.

This is also the cross road cards that are pretty new idea, but for me it does not work. When somebody narate me some text in english, I don't see to understand anything. It also add much more down time because we need to wait for those narration. Finally, most decision on those cards consist in "do you want to take a risk or not" instead of "you have a choice between 2 important decisions".

One thing they could have done is to separate the flavor text from the rule text by placing the rule text in bold. So if you want to skip to the rule text  you just read the bold text.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

While it is a zombie game, I didn't really feel the theme as strongly. It could easily be just an enemy out there causing issues. The cooperation while trying to achieve individual goals to win the game does add a bit of angst and intrigue to the game and can make anyone look guilty of being a traitor even if one is not present. I also really enjoyed the Crossroad cards and their effect and some of them are quite creative in nature (if a player yawns, they are sleepy and something might occur...).  Dice determine actions that are of any value and the 1 in 12 chance each time you roll the encounter die of dying is quite nerve-wracking...as well as when the disease can spread through multiple people at the same site unless one chooses to sacrifice their dude.

Dead of Winter owes a lot of it's design elements to it's predecessor [gameid=37111]. But, just because you are the illegitimate offspring of a genre defining game doesn't mean you have to be a retread of that game. Dead of Winter may be one of those rare situations where a great game is replaced on many people shelves by an even greater bastard child of a game. I have only had a few plays in so far but you immediately see the parentage in the design as you present with a dire situation for human kind that must face bad situation after bad situation with little to no signs of hope. After a few minutes those those similarities to its predecessor quickly fades and you find a wholly different game that branches off and is able to do just about the same thing as BSG in about half the time, and one that will not feel like it is the same game over and over again (which isn't necessarily a bad thing in the case of BSG). DoW packs a huge punch in short package. The components are top notch, although miniatures would have been nice (but in no way practical). The crossroads cards are pure dead brilliant and I look forward to their inclusion in other games by PHG. I do wish that the Crossroads cards didn't give what happens when a choice is made and then let the player decide. I prefer to read the opening paragraph and then give the player the choice, and then after they choose tell them what happens to them because of that choice. Makes for a better game in my opinion and adds a level of realism to the game that is great. Some of the objectives that requires multiples of tools can be incredibly difficult and I would like to have seen a whee bit more balance in that regard. But overall I think this game is a home run, and if you enjoy hidden traitors, adult themes, and lots of dramatic moments do yourself a favor and play Dead of Winter.    

[u]Comments Update:[/u]
After a number of plays with Dead of Winter I came to realize that every time I was playing there were moments where I would think to myself "I wish they had done this thing like they did in BSG." Or just flat out saying I wish we had played BSG. Sure DoW is really streamlined, and has the start of a GREAT mechanic in the crossroads cards, but it isn't nearly as refined of a game as BSG, not nearly at all. BSG really does do the hidden traitor mechanic by far the best that has ever been done. Every game of BSG would come down to almost the very end, and the reveal of the cylons were always a surprise. This just isn't the case in DoW, often the traitor doesn't reveal themselves at all. The Crossroad cards should have been designed differently, so that players didn't get to hear the outcomes of their actions before they made the choice of what to do. That is a HUGE design flaw to me, and I hope they revise that mechanic in their next Crossroads game series. Overall DoW is a decent game, I probably wouldn't turn down a game of it, and I don't regret preordering the game at all, but I it really can't come close to replacing BSG for me.

This was a hopeful purchase that worked out better then I could have expected. I had just played my first game of BSG and wanted it but I went with this because I heard they had a similar feel and thought the theme would work better with my group. I was right. This has been so much fun. Every time we play a story is created that we still talk about. I love this game and am always looking forward to playing it again.

Very cool, immersive zombie survival game.  I liked the Crossroad card mechanic and felt like the game had a good overall flow.  The secret individual win conditions felt a little odd in the context of a (largely) cooperative game.  I think I would prefer for it to be more fully cooperative (except for a possible traitor of course).

Theme is a huge win for me. Love the dice management. We have not played with the betrayer and don't intend to. I'm not a fan of social deduction games and don't have much interest in this variant. Would appreciate more scenarios though.

This game gets played a lot. Although it has a bit of a learning curve, once understood this game is a ton of fun. The team strategy mixed with the traitor element bring a lot of drama to the experience. I do feel the theme trips over itself a bit too much for me,  I do not understand the perspective half the time that most of the game's dialogue is coming from...

I love playing Dead of Winter; it is complex and encourages teamwork and coordination (playing with a betrayer alters that), and the desperation theme and the feeling of never really getting ahead gives it gravity. However, there are so many pieces it takes a long time (relatively speaking) to setup and breakdown! If you can get other players to grab things and set them out or pile things back together, etc. it will to much quicker.

This was a neat concept that just wasn't executed well in my opinion. Games without a traitor are boring and often the game drags on far too long even during the shorter scenarios. There always seems to be one player that gets to do a ton every turn and another that can't ever do anything.

RATING: 10
After 4 plays, this game is the most fun I had since BSG, if you're thinking about co-op games with a traitor aspect.
 Not sure if it's 100% balanced, or if it even has to be, because there will always be randomness in the plays. Every play was radically different from the last, and even if the colony didn't win yet (mistakes were made), it's nice to have a game that has all these elements and still plays fairly quick. Story cards are fun, first try should be without traitor I think.

Up to 5 players are burdened with the task of survival in a frozen, zombie apocalypse. Frostbite, zombies, and starvation are the least of your worries however, as the possibility of a traitor is ever present amongst your peers. Could the non contributor be a traitor undermining the food supply of the rest of the group or is he simply another survivor trying to fulfill his own objective whilst simultaneously trying to survive?

Dead of Winter did a great job with the crossroad cards, adding a very nice story telling element to a tough co-op game. The added traitor mechanism, though, is what puts it in my top 10. It is so much fun to make your guys thin your on their side and finally surprise them with a stab in the back. Edit: I'm still not sure what to think of the expansion. Its added ideas need to be played more to make up my mind.

Played it once, and ended up winning (the group and myself) - but I jut kind of 'stumbled' into winning with no real strategy or plan, it just kind of 'happened'. That didn't sit too well with me.

We love this game because it's so interactive with others and very thematic. 

I like that the zombies are just a backdrop and not a main plot of the game. The crossroad system is great.

Find it extremely hard to denounce the traitor or be the traitor because it's already so hard to win even as a co-op. Love that everyone has their secret objective.

The Terra Mystica of Ameritrash: it's an overhyped jumble of the genre's worst excesses.

The game boasts "innovative" mechanics like Crossroads (just a random event card that someone else reads and watches your turn to see if your actions trigger it or not). 

DoW "solves" the inherent broken-ness of semi-coops by... uh... It simply doesn't. It's kingmaking in a box and expects you to just play along and read the flavor text instead.

Dig past those 2 issues and the gameplay is utterly derivative Ameritrash of the FFG/Flying Frog kind.

Disclaimer: I've only played this game once and so am not sure how accurate my first impressions are.

This game is very much a game of post-apocalyptic survival of lacking resources and braving the weather rather than a zombie one due to the zombies not actually doing anything unless they overrun a location, which I feel is much more realistic. Most of my actions were spent searching for items to avert the current round's crisis, and building barricades preemptively to stop the zombies is much more efficient than actually fighting them.

There were about 5 Crossroads cards that were activated in the game I played. They made the game much more interesting since you never knew what to expect (besides adding story with some nice flavor text). However, if a group got unlucky and didn't get many Crossroads cards to activate I could see them thinking this game is mediocre (especially if it turned out there was no traitor), as it does seem to hinge a lot on these cards to spice up the relatively long turns.


The action point allowance with the dice adds some variability of your available options to the game, while possibly allowing the traitor to sabotage the food supply without being obvious of his/her nefarious plans. I'm not sure how much I like them being tied with the number of survivors you have though, as going down to one survivor in your group is really debilitating both winning-wise and fun-wise. Also, if you get a few survivors early in the game you can just power through the game leaving the other players to twiddle their thumbs. With their much less effective aid.

The traitor in this game I felt had to be much sneakier than say a Cylon in BSG, as the items are labelled with the location they came from, so it is much harder to add negative cards to cause the crisis without being called out on it. The traitor seemed to have to take a more passive role because of that which might turn off some people, but the traitor in my play still had fun, and still had something to do when not sabotaging because of the secondary task the traitor has to complete to win.

Rolling the bitten symbol on the exposure is horrible but I don't know how else they could have made it both unexpected and unlikely (maybe they could have done something like the way Betrayal did the triggering of Omen cards, in that the first time you move, your chance of being bitten is really low, but each additional move has a higher and higher chance?). 

I don't like how they did the probability distribution of whether there is a traitor or not, since it is more likely there is a traitor with fewer players, yet I feel like a traitor is more manageable with more players. However if my prediction is true this is an easy fix.

EDIT: Hmm not sure what to think of this game anymore. My first two games were very memorable, but since the shine of the crossroads cards have started to wear off, and each game just feels like a slog of searching + some management of food/zombies, making the game feel like more upkeep than story. Also the game can drag, and a lot of the scenarios while having very different objectives have similar feeling paths to get there. I considered rating this game an 8 after my second play, and now consider rating it a 5.

Excellent game. Love the zombie theme and the mechanics. Wish it worked better with 2 players as that's how we mostly play it but we still enjoy it. We like the randomness of rolling dice and drawing cards in this game which keeps it fun and each game different enough that we enjoy replaying it. Gathering supplies, killing zombies, dealing with exposure, all that apocalyptic stuff keep us coming back for more.

Because it's dropped in ratings/rankings for me so much over the past two years, Dead of Winter is a very conflicting game for me personally. I love hidden traitors and AVCs, but I don't like that players have the ability to tank the game if they can't achieve their AVC. I love solid co-ops, but I'm so burnt out on the zombie theme in general that I have a hard time getting into it. I've enjoyed basically every play of Dead of Winter that I've done, but I don't really ever have a desire to have it hit the table.

I think this is a game that requires loving the theme. Truly, it's standard zombie-shtick, and for me that's awesome. Being a lover of the Walking Dead, I think it delivers even more strongly for me.

That all being said, this is a TOUGH coop; probably the toughest since Ghost Stories. Adding a traitor element. Ales it even harder, for both sides, and if your group is good at bluffing like ours is, there is serious tension added to the experience. 

We are just a few plays in and the a-ah! Moments keep coming in rapid fashion. With the upcoming expansion I expect this not only to see table time, but consume us for some time to come.

An ultra-thematic game with excellent mechanics.  I don't love co-ops, so the semi-co-op aspect of this really appeals to me.  Is someone being shady because they're trying to complete their objective, or are they the betrayer?!  Paranoia in games is great, so this one definitely works for me!

Love the crossroads cards and the flavor they inject. Not sure how I feel about the potentially-continuous introduction of new survivors.

Semi-Coopératif dans un univers hivernale Zombiesque. (The Walking Dead).
Jeu à identité secrète avec possibilité d'un traitre dans la colonie.
Les mécaniques sont généralement thématiques, les crossroads cartes apportent un aspect narratif au jeu qui amène parfois des situations tendu et terriblement excitantes.
Le jeu n'est pas facile d'un point de vue coopératif.
La production est bonne et l'esthétique est cohérent.
C'est un jeu relativement conséquent en temps de jeu, mais apporte une vrai ambiance post-apo-zombie autour de la table.

Love the theme, love the art, love the components, love the variability in missions/content, and love the "story". Great game for any fans of zombie-stuff.

Warning: there is quite a bit of luck involved (random card draw for supply hunting, dice rolls for combat as well as dealing with exposure, etc) but overall the theme and mechanics feel great to me. The potential-traitor aspect is fun and keeps everyone wary of trusting their friends, though often you kinda have to. 

Somewhat fiddly to set up, as well as during play, but overall this is a great thematic game.

This and Zombicide, are the only 2 decent zombie games I've ever found, after decades of searching. Finally!

The way the mechanics work is simple and elegant, and it plays well co-operatively.  It has a good challenge level, so that you and your shelter-mates have to work hard to win.  

The only thing I find less satisfactory is the personal objectives, which seem a distraction and somewhat pointless, but that could be me: I focus on the survival of the colony.

I have yet to try the "Exiled" part of the game, though I came pretty close last time.  I look forward to that!

A good Zombie game which would on the surface appear to be an oxymoron.  However, the game is made interesting in that you have a personal agenda and there are cross-roads cards which often have two different outcomes or paths you can choose.  

The game is very fun and definitely worth playing.  It seems like minis would add to the game but would also add to the expense.  I liked the game a lot but it is a bit long for what it is.  

If not for the Zombie theme, which I don't like, I would regard this a excellent.

Dead of Winter is hands-down the most absorbing thematic game I've ever played. While there is a ton of information to take in at first, it's not very challenging mechanically once you've played a few rounds. The Crossroads mechanic adds a fantastic level of randomness, humor, chance, and replayability. The broad cast of characters are great, and I love the semi-cooperative nature in which everyone has a common goal as well as their individual goals. The action dice pool (a great mechanic!) lends the perfect amount of chance to everything. My main complaint is that it can be difficult to bring to the table because of its length and initial complexity, but with the right crowd it is always a top choice. A lot of people feel that the game gets stale because often searching is your main focus, so you're just doing that every turn and maybe managing zombies when they start showing up. I still love it, but I can see why the hype has died down.

One reviewer (https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1216628/dead-winter-review-or-zombies-are-soup-players-are): However, if you love games with a narrative element, add this to your collection. Even if you don't like zombies, don't worry about it. This game handles them the right way. They are set dressing. A threat that drives our motivations and nothing more. You aren't afraid of what the zombies will do--they are easy and predictable. You are afraid of what the other players will do. But more than that, you're afraid of what you might do.

11/2014 Co-operative game with a possible traitor/saboteur.  I just don't like the combination.  In a co-operative game one should play together with the aim to accomplish something - then either win together, or loose together.  This game doesn't accomplish anything and just leaves the players with a feeling of having wasted a few hours.  It's way too easy for the traitor to ruin everything in his/hers final move.

Over the course of eight to ten plays, this game quickly dropped from an 8 to a 6. It's just about ok as a co-op game. I will, however, never be a fan of the semi co-op version. I have seen it crash several times with different groups. The artwork is really nice, the setting is convincing and the stories are decent, but as a competitive game the thing falls short for my taste. I understand that I am in the minority here, but what are ratings worth if you are not being honest?

Fun and very tense, even if the theme is not my cup of tea. The individual objectives are kind of useless, they're not very balanced so some are pretty easy and others are almost impossible, and we find the hidden traitor to be thematically stupid, so we don't play much with either of these. It's still a great game without them, the crossroads cards are really cool and add a lot of story and theme to the game.

RATING: 5
Not a bad game, but not particularly fun for me.

IMO, the biggest problem is the lack of random card inclusions when contributing cards to overcome crises. I really think the math of BSG works better in a hidden traitor scheme.    

I don't care for the luck-heavy rolls. 

Crossroad cards aren't my thing: I am personally not interested in reading the story cards, and it most of the time they are a hassle you can easily forget to draw; I found they break immersion in the gameplay to inject a random story, which isn't worth the tradeoff. As for creating a decision point, it does so, but not in routinely compelling way, as the decisions are usually pretty obvious choices of "what can we afford at this time?" 

In the end, I haven't walked away from the table feeling like something cool happened. Unlike BSG, I haven't gotten any stories to tell from our plays.

Dead of Winter is a survivor game and an alternative to Battlestar Galactica in the semi-coop with traitor genre. Zombie theme, lots of survivors, personal goals, and variability. It doesn't quite distinguish itself to rival BSG for playing time, so this is for real big fans of the genre. The game is ideal with Medium length main objectives, drags a lot in Long main objectives and is a bit too repetitive.

Everytime I play, I like it. So that's good. But then I also think the traitor mechanism in this just doesn't work. Being the traitor is hard. Having a traitor is hard. This seems to work best as a pure coop. The game is hard enough as it is.

All efforts went in the atmosphere and so the gameplay is quite lacking (from banal "hope to roll well" to the poorly implemented personal objectives).

Has uninteresting mechanics (digging through piles, dice rolling can do nothing or randomly kill you) with a theme I dislike (Zombies).  I will give it credit that the semi-coop fits with the theme and reduces the alpha player problem but I have no desire to play semi-coop games.

RATING: 7
The game is very well done thematically. The problem I have with it is that firstly the down time in this game is extreme and secondly(and most importantly) there is a huge bug in the game(although it can be fixed easily, and from now on we'll be playing it this way). The bug is that if you search a location A with a character X and find items I1 and I2 you can use/equip them on characters Y and Z on locations B and C immediately... what's up with that? We'll be playing it like this - all of your cards will be split among your characters. To use a card on other character they ARE GOING TO be handed off normally AND to contribute to the colony(food and/or cards to the crisis) THE CHARACTER holding those cards MUST be at the colony. That's the only way we'll be playing that game again. Then it could actually be fun.

semi co-op with a possible traitor. This game is awesome and have yet to win but have enjoyed every game non the less. collect items / kill zombies / contribute to the colony. each player works towards their own hidden abjective. Nobody seems trust worthy.Crossroad deck add additional weight to the already superbly themed game.

This is a fun game, and we played frequently when it first came out. Since then, it's been brought out in October for 2 years. I still enjoy it, and think there is a lot more depth than I've seen, but there are things that are annoying. 

Crossroads cards only trigger a couple times in a game, which destroys the novelty a bit.

I am not a fan of the zombie apocalypse genre, but this game is not about the zombies.  They could have replaced the zombies with just about anything: bandits, wild animals, tentacled demon-velociraptors, etc.  The game is about tension and psychology in a semi-cooperative environment.  In that, it succeeds beyond expectations.  I really like this game.  I would love to see more Crossroads games from Plaid Hat (Star Trek DS9, please?).

While this game gets a lot of hype, I think the play is a little limiting and harsh (though I know it is a zombie game) for longer play-through than I want.  The crossroads mechanic is interesting but under utilized.  The traitor mechanic should be used every time.

Zombie survival co-op with a chance of a betrayer? Yes please. This gives a you a huge amount of anxiety and you find yourselves making choices that you would not normally make in life. Like letting someone die for the sake of keeping your group alive. Takes a long time to set up but enjoyable when complete.

RATING: 5
Disclaimer:  Not a fan of Co-ops or typically Ameritrash but usually willing to try most titles at least once.  

First play (5P @ 4 hrs):
When your leader dies on Turn 1 (on the very first d12 roll) there is (IMO) a design/rules issue that deters "new" players from ever having the desire to invest any more time in this title.  Also, many of the Crossroads cards are so extremely situational, they don't come into play and serve no purpose.  Just additional fiddley-ness.  May try another play but certainly not eager.

I really like how you have to balance multiple things at once - crisis cards, main objectives, secret objectives, feeding the colony, keeping the zombie population under control.  For now, my main complaints are the downtime and something about the traitor just doesn't feel right to me. Can't put it into words yet, but maybe after more plays?  Still a fun game.

I was excited for this game after all the reviews and videos. I got it and it was not that great. It wasn't bad, but overall not something I would bring to the table. Also it should be noted while it says 2-5 players. The 2 player game or full co-op isn't very good at all the supply collecting becomes tedious and boring instead of tense and mysterious.

RATING: 5.5
Seems an interesting game, with a nice group dynamic. 
8.5 tentative as solitaire cooperative variant

Edit: Yesterday I played with 4 non-gamer it was awful. Teaching them, they don't understanding what was going on. So advice, play with 2-4 players. Hoping to get a better experience next time.

Edit: Later I've played solitary, starting with 6 survivors and 14 initial objects and cooperative. It was too easy, even when the general objective was difficult. Maybe I'll play with less survivors, initial objects and a harder objective for next time 

Edit: First time I play this as it should be (with a betrayer) and this game really shines. Keeper

Edit: First time four players. It is fine, a lot of conversation and discusion...But there is a lot of time between turns

Edit: This game started as 8.5 and now it is only a 5.5. Every new game was a new disappointment. It is a sloooowwwww non sense dice rolling. Between turns is sooooo long and boring, no one was paying attention to was going on. SOLD

While I thoroughly enjoy the game, it tends to drag on, especially with 4+ players. It doesn't always matter, but when you get familiar with the game, it gets boring when people have AP with the simplest of things, like where to build barricades or which locations to search. The crossroad cards are also a hit or miss, most often a miss. People tend to choose the path of least resistance, even if thematically and ethically it's wrong. Not everyone is a psychopath, but playing this they are. That takes away some of the decision making in this game, but it's more a fault of the group and not the game. Still, a worthy experience and even this version has loads of replayability, might be even better with the expansion, or the expansion as a standalone.

Short summary: A very swingy, luck based game attempting to randomly generate a story through tortured mechanics.  For the record, I wanted to like this game, sadly I could not.


What do I mean by the above?  Lets start with the luck factor.  Luck comes in multiple die rolls, the main one being the action roll and the exposure roll.  The exposure die is rolled when traveling is an instant 1 in 12 chance of death, additionally there is the possibility of frostbite which is a wound adds an additional wound every round if not treated. There are also straight wounds (3 wounds result in death - wounds are treated by medicine cards randomly drawl or by characters like the doctor which are also randomly drawl).  The exposure roll is also rolled when combat with zombies occurs (pretty much every turn) - unless certain randomly drawl cards are in effect.

The players Action dice, one per character plus one, are a pool is rolled every round together, and a single die needs to be allocated to preform a single action, that die needs to be hire than what is listed on the card of the character (e.g. search is 4 or higher while fight might be 2 or higher).  This can be mitigated by spending food, etc. to offset the luck at the cost of resources.  Typically 1 pip for 1 resource.

Depending on the scenario, there may be addition rolls required as well - our was to collect samples which happened on a 4,5,6 of a 6 sided die every time we killed a zombie.

The next layer of luck comes in the allocated characters you can choose from, and their abilities.  Some are very useful - like the solider who can kill 2 zombies instead of one per die.  Others are less useful like the lawyer who can look at one players randomly drawn card.

Then there is also the luck of the draw piles in the locations.

Then there is the luck of the crossroads card drawn each time a player starts their turn - these typically are targeted at named characters and come into effect if that character is currently in play rather than in the deck - though they can also be trigger events that occur only if something happens, like a character is moved from on location to another during that players turn.  They also usually involve a choose your own adventure type option choice of a or b - the group we played with used a rule which said the reader had to generalize the options and give as little information as possible about the choices and most importantly the outcomes of the choices to preserve the story feel. Clunky but understandable.

The last 2 bits of luck, at least that I recall, are secret agenda card assigned at the start of the game randomly, and the crisis card drawn on every player turn.  One of the cards in the agenda deck is a traitor card, in the game we played with 5 people, I think the agenda deck had 12 cards including the traitor, and 2 were dealt to each player.  This is where the crisis card comes in.  Each round it too is randomly drawl and states a certain number of cards of a type from the players hands must be donated to addressing it or some bad thing happens.  Cards are contributed secretly - and in theory this adds some level of dramatic tension as to if the traitor, if there is a traitor, is actually contributing what they say they are contributing.  In practice, we were crushing the game (thanks to luck) for the first 5 rounds, and then the luck in the 6th round swung against us causing a number of character deaths that dropped our moral to zero and lost the game. No traitor was needed at all to loose, and I suspect this may be the case pretty often. (I would have been disappointed with such an easy win, but I was even more disappointed with the reversal of fortune that lost a game where the colony was so far ahead.)  

One more tortured mechanic I need to add, players are allowed to ask each other for things like books or weapons, but players are not allowed to say which resources they have or who they would really like to give them to - I assume this is to help shield the secret agendas, and the traitor in particular, but in practice it is just clunky.  Once the card is asked for and received (a character can receive it no matter the characters location),   it must be played immediately.   However once the card is face up, it can be traded via handoff to other characters in the same location.

I think the game is an imaginative attempt at a random story based game that falls short on execution.  I also think there are better executions on it out there, and certainly for those looking for an involved story based game, perhaps I can suggest an actual RPG.

My 2 cents.

I question the replayability of this game as a two-player, fully cooperative game. As a two-player game, we haven't lost yet.

I also wrote end game stories (for both a win and a loss) because it seemed strange that there was an opening story for each scenario but no end story.

This game has one of the best (if not THE best) components/art I have ever seen in a game! It is very thematic with the exception of(a major one that kills the theme for me) that not every character has cards, but they are shared... So you can get item (I) from location (L1) with character (C1) and give that same item (I) to a character (C2) in another location (L2). The major problem I have with the game is another though. The downtime is INSANE!!!! I mean 3 hours of play to do 5 moves that take you like 3-4 minutes? NO. Just no! I guess that is why they killed the theme with the exception I just talked about... the downtime would make me throw this game away! Another problem is that the token passes to the left instead of to the right (what's up with that?) and as if the game is not hard enough -> the bad guy should always win? I will be keeping It but I hope they fix all the issues with the expansion, otherwise It will be traded (I hope someone wants it) away!

Very good semi-cooperative game. Mechanics reinforce the theme very well. While it is a zombie theme, the zombie part is light and doesn't feel like every other zombie game. Possibly a traitor at the table. On top of that, there is a team win condition as well as individual win conditions, and both must be met for victory. Every choice is important, and acceptable losses must be taken in order to achieve final victory.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like this game. The artwork, theme, rich narrative, quality components, fluid mechanic, mix of co-operative play and the traitor element. The negatives are the lengthy downtime between turns, especially with 3 or more players; the lengthy rules expositions; and the random element which may alienate some tactical or strategy-based players. But there are ways to keep the game fresh and invigorating. Focus on the experience for your players. Expand on the narrative between turns with the players and raise the emotional stakes with regards to resolving a crisis. I guarantee they will be talking about the game long after the components are packed away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The concept of a main goal with each their own subgoal and possibly having traitors is very cool. There are also some cool options for trickery as a traitor with the crisis card, attracting zombies etc. The survival game is slightly dull though with what seems just a game to minimize having to roll the red die. It's also a bit messy with the separate location boards and player stands.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Way too random for my taste.  You roll a die on everything that can easily cause instant death, while the betrayer has way too many options to screw up the work of the colony within the last round.  It feels like you spend an hour or two just to see what happens in the last 5 minutes.

Mediocre game that is only popular because "zombies"

I thought that this might be overlong, and that it had little chance of living up to its hype, and I was wrong on both counts. It's splendid.

While there's quite a bit going on, it's not fiddly. The theme is strong -- and a personal favorite -- and closely tied to what happens mechanically during play. The components are marvelous.

My first two plays were in the same session, one with no betrayer in the deck -- a learning game -- and one with a betrayer. The first was good, a 7 or an 8, but as a pure co-op DoW competes with more games I already enjoy, and it felt like it was lacking a certain spark. With the betrayer -- both before and after finding out we had one in our midst -- it jumped to a 9.

I'm iffy on semi co-ops in general; I almost always prefer full co-ups. But with DoW, there's a layer of menace and unease and tension that's both sublime and perfect for its theme.

DoW borrows lots of mechanics and ideas from other games but manages to bring its own twist and feeling into the play. It has many similarities to BSG but still manages to stand out as its own (especially with a bit shorter playtime which is a plus with most of the players).
The game offers lots of intense moments and multiple ways to play the game which helps getting the game on the table with different gaming groups.
Some people have complained about the downtime but it isn't nearly as bad as in most of coop games.
I really hope they will release expansions to the game and add more complex crisis cards and new challenging elements to the game (not that I have any complaints regarding the offering with the base game). Also the traitor mechanic seems somehow forced and doesn't add much to the game.

RATING: 4
Lot to say about this game, but not much is good.

Actually I should say "lot to say about this story creating box" as it is not much of a game and much more a randomized story being laid out in front of you.

Scenario 3 player

Shuffle 6 non villain + 1 villain secret objective

1:7 chance to have a villain which cant do anything until the very last turn or will get exiled and... Do nothing.

Then shuffle the character deck. Pass 4 to each player.

12 characters being drawn.. We keed 6 of those. 
Low chance you get the power 6 double searchers (one for each location) 

but still, if you can get the library double search in the begining, then get the blue prints ... You already won.

Maybe its the police double search... You won. (Little "tougher" but you still won.

You got the cook... You'll never run out of food.

Anything else is fluff with some of it really bad fluff.

Ok you got your characters... Lets shuffle item decks... So randomly shuffled that no matter what, all the same items are always in the same place... Just in a different order. So be sure to be real lucky to have shuffled it in the optimal setup because theres nothing really you can do about it later (except making noise... But that mechanic is as dumb as it gets)

*Side note - noise mechanic*
If you decide to make noise by looking at one more card and still picking just one but having to deal with two zombies instead of one, well... You like rolling danger dices for nothing.

Instead of making noise... Double search. Spending two dices in a search and getting 2 item at no risk (and spending another dice to deal sith the automatic zombie for your presence in that location feomthe previous turn) is better than speanding 1 dice for 1 item and having to fight 2 zombies.

The only time it comes in handy is if tou get the hell out of there by the end of you turn.

Crossroads... Only good for killing useless survivors.
Seriously ... Lose 1 moral save 1 can of food a round (most of the time) . Its a no brainer.

Accumulated cards in your hand stay there until you need them. Never pay a food if your reserve is made for this round.


This game plays its self out. You have no choice to make. None at all. 

So why a rating of 4?  Visuals. I guess it can be fun if youre drunk or not a really hardcore gamer.

Sad i bougnt it to say the truth.

Dead of Winter is a really cool cooperative game. We played with 2 different groups at BGG con. It feels a little bit like Robinson Crusoe, but take out some of the complexity/difficulty and add a traitor element. The removal of these things makes me like Dead of Winter MUCH more than RC. I don't think it's a gateway game, probably 1 step up. However, if you have a group of non-gamers that like a challenge, this could work. It's dripping with theme, is not too difficult, has excellent components, plays in about 90 minutes, and is a lot of fun. One of my favorites from BGG con 2014. 

Update 8/16/15:

Played this 2 more times with family this weekend. My rating is going to stay the same. I really enjoy this game. BUT, it's got a lot of problems. There's simply too many fiddly rules. Every time I've played this (4 times now), we are spending half the game flipping through the rule book. Plus, and even more damaging, turns take forever!! You only get a limited number of turns in a game (3-4 usually in a 4-player game), and you have to wait a very long time between them. Between my first and second turn (I was start player in the game), I had to wait a full hour. That's craziness. This game would be dead to me on that basis alone, but the theme is just so good. It's incredibly atmospheric, has great components, and offers a great cooperative experience. Mechanically, I rate it a 6. Theme is a 9.5. Taking the average, I'll round up to a 8. Just plan on spending 2-3 hours between setup, game time and clean up. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Very cool game, that made me wanna play again immediately.
Unfortunately I think the group I played the first game with didn't really connect with the game, but I liked it.

It's quite simple, in fact it seems like a mash of mechanics from other games, put together in a streamlined way. With the novelty being the addition of the Crossroads.

Being a simpler game is in no way a bad thing, just different and the Crossroads are quite interesting but definitely this won't be my final score for the game. I need more plays with different and the same group.

I really like the idea of this game. Every one has a hidden agenda that might make them appear like they are being malicious to infuse doubt in everyone. Sounds great on paper it just doesn't seem to play out that way. I was hoping for a decent alternative to BSG but I am not feeling the experience is like that at all. It feels kinda grindy. I really want to like this game and I hope that future plays changes my opinion. We shall see

Bought at Miniature Market Black Friday Sale.

The tension in this game is great, and the crossroads cards give a good amount of theme.  The traitor mechanic can be tricky, but I've seen some great implementations of it.  I actually enjoyed this more than I initially thought I would.

Multiple different scenarios, different survivors, crossroads cards, and multiple search decks really help replayability.

----

Update 1/10/16 from 9 to 6.5.  While the first play with Michelle and Daniel was amazing, it's fallen flat the few times with other groups since.  Mechanics are fairly simple, and there really isn't as deep of a strategy as I've become used to in heavier euros.  Lot of good replayability in scenarios and crossroad cards though.

Isolated and surrounded by flesh craving zombies in the dead of winter, all while someone amongst the group is the traitor trying to kill you all! This is a great game! It's a must try. I wish there was plastic mini's and not cardboard cut outs, but it doesn't take away from the fun factor!

I like this game a lot. The story telling through the game is great, the game play is great, the traitor element is fun and I would love to give it more than 8 but I can't because of the standies.... I am a sucker for a miniature and if this game had them i think it would take it up another level. Also you just don't get enough Zombies. If you end up with more zombies than you have standies for then things are going wrong but that seems to be the case more often than not. It just seems odd to me that they give you little cardboard discs which you can use when you run out of standies, so why not just a few more standies? Surely it wouldn't have cost that much more.

Wow. This game is amazing! My friends and I played it for the fist time last weekend and we played until 3am. It balances complexity with intuitive and natural actions that really makes it easy to understand for such a deep game. We were all intimidated at first but after a few turns we had figured most of it out. There's a ton of replay value to boot. No other game makes you feel like you are in a episode of Walking Dead like this game does.

One of my favorite coop games.
Very positive surprise... It's the best 'Walking Dead' game there is. Downtime vs. actual decisions made (most of your turn is just different dice rolls) is the biggest issue, but the game is worth some boring waiting and you can discuss strategy or share cards even if it's not your turn. I hate the red dice, but it's thematic and exciting.. I love the personal objectives (REALLY awesome in portraying the selfishness),betrayer,Crossroads deck and simple euro mechanics (dice placement and free actions). Artwork is ok, setup is very quick. Variability seems good too. It's just all around very smooth and solid game. 

2-Player Comment:
*Check out the Prisoners Dilemma variant by designer of the game. (Follow 2p setup, then give each player two Secret Objectives, one of which is betrayer - but if both betray then it's a loss). It's really awesome and makes 2p one of my favored player counts (best with two or three in my opinion, since there's quite a bit of downtime).

RATING: 9.2
This game is awesome, and has quickly made its way to my top 5 I could play at any time. The theme is really well represented, and the game has some incredible mechanics built around it. 

I mean, where do I start? 

I think the encounter die is brilliant (even if it may earn you an insta-death on your very first move... of your very first game... EVER!). 

The characters are very fleshed out, and the detail that Plaid Hat put into the diversity of them really shows.

Then there's the Crossroads cards... wow! Every time I've played this game I've discovered a previously un-triggered card. It's always presented my group with a significant, but rewarding, challenge. They add this ever-present sense of dread throughout the game that really heightens the tension. You may think, "Oh man, we've got all the food we need, the crisis is as good as solved, we're gonna knock this round out of the park!" then suddenly someone draws a Crossroad card that pulls the rug out from under you. This game really encompasses that old saying: "Life is what happens to you while you are busy making other plans..."

I didn't even talk about the betrayer mechanic!

If you like thematic, co-operative, games with a fair amount of tension, Dead of Winter is for you.

I didn't find this one as fun as other co-op games like Battlestar Galactica.

Also, most of us didn't find it very fun. It was go to location, search, etc etc...And those die rolls were terrible...

Great components / presentation, but lacks the polish that BSG has.  The key advantages for this over BSG is shorter play time and the flavour text adds an Arkham Horror type element to it - but with zombies rather than Cthulu.

Solid game, but not great. Suspect it might improve after a few more plays, but don't think it would really push BSG.

RATING: 9
An amazing social experience. The zombies really only offer a background to everything else that's going on. Players must survive, but one of them [i]might[/i] be a traitor who wants to see the world burn. There's hand, resources and crises management. Players who are not a traitor have both a common objective and an individual secret objective that they must accomplish in order to win. Games without a traitor can sometimes seem too easy. The crossroads system is nice and adds some nice story-telling to the game, though some crossroad cards will inevitably end up being resolved a lot more often than others.

Good
Great zombie themed game. The mechanics and art blend well together to make it feel like you are a part of a struggling colony trying to survive harsh conditions as well as a zombie horde. 

Potential betrayer and individual objectives is brilliant because you are never sure who you can trust. 

There is a large pool of characters that can be played and each plays uniquely further increasing the replay value of the game. 

The cross roads cards add tension as well as entertaining story elements that further help tie the theme into the game. 

Solid core mechanics, you pre-roll dice at the beginning of the turn and then can execute actions based off of those dice. The higher the roll the better the actions. So before it's even your turn you can pre-plan what you will do on your turn without random chances of failures. 

Bad
You need to be careful who you play this with. AP prone players will make this game drag out to the point where it isn't entertaining.

This game breeds paranoia.

The mechanics are nice, but the game at this point seems to be leaning towards the traitor in winning the game.

We haven't figured out a way to smoke the traitor out in time and we lose in a double turn screw up by the traitor.

Maybe we have a lot of learning to do, but the game is great nevertheless.

The roles and the secret objectives add their own spice to each game and it feels you aren't doing the same action in every game you play because of those two factors.

Also the crossroads (random encounters) are something i like really much.
The events doesn't usually offer a huge impact to the game, but they add a little story to each game, great stuff!

Note: At this point I've played 3 games. Will adjust rating if/when I play more.

+ Mechanics are interesting.
= Survival theme is neutral for me. Wasn't interested enough in the crossroad cards' thematic aspect to slow down the game in order to read them.
- A bit wary of the game when betrayers are in. Particularly the fact that they have the power to tank the game and will do so to make everyone lose.

Cooperative masterpiece. Fired BSG, perhaps Eldritch Horror (except for those nights we really need tentacles). Mechanics are not too hard to grasp, one person who knows them can guide the others through a few turns and they will pick it up quickly enough. The meat is in the choices, the emotional tension, and the story elements, which can be fantastic. Don't let the zombies turn you off the game, there is so much more than that. It can fall flat if not everyone gets invested in the story or struggle, so the right group is important. I wish there was a mechanic to get more survivors other than random card choices. Have had several games where one or two people had all the survivors past the initial two; bad if its the traitor.

This didn't click with our conflict-averse 6 player group, since everybody just worked on the team goals. 1 play with a traitor, one without, both lost by the whole team. The traitor element only works if people act at least a little bit suspicious in order to achieve their private goals. Without it, what remains is a rather amerithrashy dice rolling luckfest.

Pros: 
+Fun overall. Comes together into a solid game
+Thematic decision making in the crossroads event cards is definitely the strong point of the game

Cons: 
-Not enough variability leads to low replayability. This game relies a lot on the hidden roles to make things interesting. The gameplay itself is pretty predictable
-Coop variant badly oversimplifies the game for the reason noted above. This is not a good two player game, which is mainly how I play. Coop game is very straightforward.
-The game would have benefited from miniatures--the cardboard zombies are rather lame and easily damaged when putting them into stands repeatedly. The components are generally uninspired and not of great quality. Not enough zombies are provided to fill the board.
-Board design choices are questionable--huge amounts of wasted space on the board (not even filled with good theme or art) while most of the game happens on small cards that are not on the board

RATING: 5.5
Game in a Nutshell: Objective based zombie game of completing a cooperative goal but also a secret selfish desire.

Played as: 4 player

Pros: There are some very nice thematically integrated mechanics- how helpless survivors cause you both want to save them (to sustain moral) but also drag you down (consuming food with no benefit); how a bite can spread panic, and possibly the infection, among a group; cross-road cards that trigger when you might not be expecting it, inject story into the game.  

Cons: A lot of the character abilities are a deadly combination of being unexciting (even the zombie killing ones) and necessary (using what can be very limited 'action points'). The secret objectives were a bust. We all know we're each going to be doing something a little funky on the side, so who cares. The most disappointing part of the game is the zombies are largely passive. Without a strong spacial element, they never feel like much of a threat beyond being another resource that needs to be inversely managed. Perhaps that sums it up, there just wasn't enough to keep it from being another bland resource management game where the challenge comes from stacking those resources heavily against the players favor. I just never felt 'stressed' like I have in other horror (Last Night on Earth, where the zombies chase you down), Co-op (Pandemic, "someone needs to get to Asia stat!"), or hidden role games (The Resistance, where who is what REALLY matters).

Other: So the cross-road cards (what was supposed to drive the originality of the game)... At the worst they felt disruptive and tacked on. At their best, they were well written pieces of narrative that drove a story. That said, this is where I think the game will either succeed or fail. If your group can embrace the narrative, role-play a little even (not just the cross-roads cards, but the game as a whole), I think this game can succeed as an experience. On the flip side, as a break-down of mechanics, it's just not that interesting.

Best Use: A structured role-playing-esque game for people who want to play up the story.

Good co-op game, and the secret objectives part is a very interesting mechanic. I was unfortunate with my first playthrough to have a non-traiter player (who due to his objective believed himself to be a traiter) unknowingly ruin my chance of winning right after I had supplied the last item needed for us to complete the game, which sucked, but didn't put me off the game. I will play it again and I found it enjoyable despite the unfortunate turn of events during my first game.

I like this game because it has zombies and things related to zombies and can be played cooperatively or semi-cooperatively.

The crossroads cards add an interesting and suspenseful element. Despite the mechanistic method of adding zombies and causing damage (a bit o' randomness isn't a bad thing), it works. And the game is hard to win.

Overall, a success.

Tense game to play. Great game when playing with friends who like a bit of role-playing and imaginative play. Not so good when some aren't really into it (this is a problem in any game, but moreso in a game like this where you play roles). It's also quite long, so you need dedicated time and attention to play. However, the highs are very high!

RATING: 7
Semi-Kooperatives Spiel mit einem sehr stimmig umgesetzten Thema. Das Material ist ansprechend und grösstenteils selbsterklärend und verfügt über das passende Design. Die Kartentexte sind teilweise nicht optimal übersetzt, was aber den Spielfluss nicht ernsthaft hemmt. Die Schicksalskarten sind mit sehr kleiner Schrift beschrieben und entsprechend schwierig zu lesen. Hier sind gutes Licht und Augen gefragt.  

Jeder Mitspieler "steuert" eine kleine Gruppe Überlebender. Das Spiel kann je nach belieben in einer kurzen (ca. 75 Min) einer mittleren (ca. 150Min) oder in einer langen Version (ca. 300Min) gespielt werden. Die unterschiedlichen Szenarien sowie die über 30 verschiedenen Überlebenden bringen Abwechslung ins Spiel.

Die Regeln sind eingängig und schnell gelernt. Die Spielsteuerung erfolgt über zum einen über Aktionswürfel und zum andern über Karten. Die Mechanismen sind ausreichend ausbalanciert, um ein gewisse Kontrolle und Planung zu erlauben, dabei aber auch durch die Würfel nie ganz berechenbar und zugleich auch nicht zu kompliziert, so dass der Spielfluss nicht negativ beeinträchtigt wird. So entsteht eine schöne dichte Spielatmosphäre ohne wirkliche Längen.  

Dadurch das jeder Spieler neben dem gemeinsamen Ziel auch noch eigene, geheime Ziele verfolgt, wird verhindert, dass einer der erfahreneren Spieler die Planung aller übernimmt. Zudem könnten auch Verräter unter den Mitspielern sein. 

Fazit: Bin eigentlich nicht so der Kooperativ-Spiele Spieler, aber dieses hat mir sehr gut gefallen und ich spiele gerne wieder mit.

As far as zombie games go it was pretty fun.  Turns were pretty fast and combat abstracted enough to make it fun without bogging down.  Hilarious when someone gets bitten... No worrying about tracking hit points in such situations.  The crossroads cards fun but unfortunately underused.  As mentioned by my friend James, rather amusing people so excited by the innovative Crossroads cards: I have a ton of games using event cards, most of which actually come into effect and not so specifically keyed.  Still, the choices on the cards are amusing.  Rules are simple and I imagine the various scenarios keep the game game fresh.  Quite a few different characters as well.

The traitor can really mess the game up if allowed to stay in the colony, so there's great incentive to take him out before late game. The paranoia and speculation it generates keeps the tension high. The narrative build up is also very engaging with a pinch of imagination.

I love the theme and the components are really good.  the d12 can be a bit swingy on exposure rolls.  The replay value is excellent.  I think the crossroads cards, while adding variety to the game, have a bit of a clunky mechanic especially for new players.  It's easy to forget them and to not really be able to tell whose survivors are in which buildings for some of the triggers.  They should always have soem effect be it positive or negative, in my opinion.

A strong thematic game co-op RPG with social betrayer elements, this game is relatively good but I find it's too complex and takes too long for most groups, and the mechanics aren't as good as I would like.  Relies too much on the theme and the Crossroads story-telling, but the main drawbacks are that the game takes too long, plays too sluggishly and doesn't engage the group too well -- at least in the groups I've played in. I guess you need a group that loves games like Arkham Horror to really get the most out of this.

Coop zombie survival game with hidden victory conditions and possible betrayers. My problem with most of these games is that turns can be largely scripted based on your characters special abilities.

Despite the crossroads mechanism and the individual goals, this really didn't feel any different to me than any other cooperative game.

Bonne ambiance et thème bien rendu. Les parties sont plus fluides et plus rapides qu'avec battlestar galactica (on peut naturellement rapprocher ces deux jeux).
Par contre après quelques parties, je trouve l'emploi des cartes "crossroads" un peu plombant tant au niveau du rythme que des mécanismes de jeu: tout est saccadé quand on s'en sert puisqu'il faut lire une carte (pas toujours bien traduite) et constamment vérifier si elle s'applique.

Everything fires on all cylinders and it runs faster than Battlestar Galactica usually does.

Oof.  I went into this really expecting to enjoy it and I did not.  Some of the factors for that would include another new player who was very confused and slow playing, the fact that we didn't draw a traitor, and a dubious house rule letting you respawn survivors if you dropped too low... but that's not the only reasons.  The rapid rate at which your survivors could chain die is awful and the social deduction aspect of the game was entirely absent from my play through.  The Crossroads cards seemed like an interesting idea but in practice they were just kinda fiddly and rarely mattered.

I really like the game.  Scalable difficulty, very theme heavy, nice production quality.  My play group seems to have a preference to playing the game in a more co-op fashion than I would like so it basically turns into a Forbidden Island/Elder sign hybrid which I'm not too keen on.  Good mechanics and lots of re-playability from what I've seen thus far.

This game is exceptional. So exceptional that, when we finished playing it, my friends and I held an hour-long discussion about strategy. We then recalled our favourite moments from the game, and we acted them out as our survivors. Then, we excitedly looked through the survivor cards, noting how the jobs of each survivor directly relates to their special ability.

This game is thematic. It's tense, it's consistently fascinating, and it's thoughtful. The mechanics are strong, there are always exciting decisions to make. The game is cooperative, but it's also competitive, in that everyone is working for the group goal, and their secret personal goals. Everything about this game works.

Most importantly, and this is the point that I feel best sells the game, is that the game accurately recreates what it would be like to live during a zombie apocalypse. And it's a complete thrill.

In summary, Dead of Winter provides one of the best experiences that the hobby can offer.

I enjoyed my initial plays of Dead of Winter despite it not really being my favorite style of game. The Crossroads cards were (and still are) the best part of the game, but I enjoyed the dice assignment mechanism as well.

Unfortunately, my impression of the game significantly cooled after subsequent plays. While the Crossroad cards are still amusing, every game (for me, anyway) has devolved into a somewhat dull exercise in set collection lacking much in the way of player agency or interesting decision points. I end up feeling like spectator, a problem I have with many of the games in this genre.

Finally, while in theory this game should be more about narrative than anything else, none of my games have produced much of a remarkable story. The Crossroad cards inject some narrative flavor, but by their very nature are disjointed from the stories of the individual scenarios and the other Crossroads cards themselves. Usually the events in the game are either fairly generic or simply get played for laughs.

I'd love to see Plaid Hat develop the Crossroads concept further and perhaps make a game in this style that's a little more interesting to actually play.

Excellent game. I would rate higher if it wasn't for the its bad packing. I will go over this later.

The lore is pretty well written, character design, item design, situations, and crossroads. I love that it has variants like 2 player co-op (it is pretty difficult) and it has an excellent replay-ability adding social deduction to the mix, missions and crossroads.

As for the packing it has no way to divide item cards for each location, crossroads, situations, characters, missions, betrayal, etc (there are a shitton of different cards). When packing you need to find a way to divide them otherwise the set up will take a lot of time. Once everything is set you will have a game that you will definitely enjoy.

I love Dead of Winter from start to finish. I've always been a fan of the zombie genre but my favorite zombie stories are ones that focus on the plight of the survivors. This game focuses heavily on that aspect - surviving in spite of yourself against the undead horde and your asshole comrades. The competitive cooperation makes it hard to trust players in a game where you'll fail without it. The art is amazing as well.

I generally don't like co-ops, but this works. There's a traitor, possibly, and players have personal motivations and private goals. That's good. The game play is fast enough, and while it's mechanically kind of drab, the Crossroads cards are interesting and there are neat choices involved.

However, after the initial games, I haven't really felt any need to return to the game, for some reason.

What a rich narrative experience! It's everything I have wanted from a zombie game - hard moral choices, where I must choose between personal self-interest or that of the larger group, risk management, characters I actually care about that aren't merely cartoons.

There is just enough BSG built into the system to demand cooperation and feel threatened by betrayal, but it is not the dominant focus. The story is the focus, and those crossroad cards are just fantastic at making things feel three dimensional. 

I think that if we don't over play it, this will become a regular staple of our gaming evenings.

Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game received rave reviews from everyone who played it at Cancon and as I like games with traitor mechanics and am very receptive to the zombie theme I thought this would be right up my alley. It wasn’t hard to find some other interested players in the games library so we borrowed a copy, set it up and got down to playing.

Initial reactions were that the game was a little fiddly with a heap of different decks to set up. The game played okay as we struggled to fulfil our mission. Morale went down when some-one didn’t take out the garbage and then the traitor revealed to make us fail a mission de jour task. Our guys through judicious searching (one seems to spend a lot of time rummaging through grocery stores which is realistic but less than enthralling) to get all we needed to set ourselves up for a win, but the crossroads card before the end of the game was not in our favour and a zombie broke into our HQ and ate someone making us all sad. Sad enough for us to lose.

Overall it was, I am sorry to say, a pretty ‘meh’ playing experience, lacking in tension and interesting decision making. For this type of game I would much rather play Battlestar Galactica or Shadows over Camelot, for real zombie fun I’d play Zombicide. Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game is not one I’ll seek out again and probably won’t purchase. In all honesty, once the ‘hotness’ wear off this game it is one I just can’t see being anywhere near as popular in two or three years time.

A pretty good co-operative ameri-thrash game.  The game has a lot going on: hand management, dice allocation, tactical movement, punishing random die rolls, story telling elements, even a traitor mechanism; but somehow each round still feels a bit dull.

Great Story telling game with great mechanics. First game I ever preordered. I got sucked in by 'Board With Life' play through and watched every video about it. Swept me into the hype. It helps that the game is amazing.

RATING: 7.5
The traitor mechanisms (goal, vote-out, new goal) in this game are excellent, which makes this fun for groups of 4 and more.  I like the gathering of objects, the Crossroads events, the location item diversity, the personal goals, the fear of the tooth roll, and uncovering the hidden donations.  Yet most of the Crossroads cards rarely apply (thinking of limiting character-based cards so that they're added as the characters come into the group), and the crisis cards are terrible.  There needs to be more crisis cards since they change every turn.  And they need more variety in story and in impact.  A few of them stand out, but most lack imagination.  Perhaps this was needed to provide a stable threat mechanism, but the lack of variety really impacts play for me.  The cardboard stand-ups are fine, because there are a lot of possible characters to play.  Many of them have personality touches that are great.  Set up is really not bad for a game with tons of chits.  Great mechanisms here, but the Long Night expansion is really a must for me, and I still want more variety!

RATING: 7
A simple narrative survival semi-coop in a zombie apocalypse, with a traitor (or not).

Very simple mechanics, highly luck-based (dice roll). It's a game about the players, not the zombies (they can easily be anything else, including "The Thing" monster in the Carpenter's movie).

The game is fun, albeit not that tense imho, and the crossroads cards, being so random, add very little to the overall narrative - if the event is random, it can be anything; if it's linked to a specific character and he's not in play, it's a bit frustrating.
For us it becomes a bit more interesting if you must choose blindly the crossroad fork, without knowing the consequences.

I'm not a big fan of semi-cooperative games mainly because of the temptation to screw everyone else if you can't meet your personal victory condition.  On the positive side, this game is challenging to win and often provides end game tension.

My enjoyment is fully depended on how it's played. If people are trying to play full coop in a semi coop game it gets really hard for a traitor. This game should always be played with a traitor and always with an air of secrecy.

Schon wieder ein Brettspiel mit Zombiethematik?! *gääähn* 
Nein, aufwachen Leute, denn Dead of Winter (dt Winter der Toten) ist quasi The Walking Dead in Brettspiel-Form und mit Abstand das beste Brettspiel mit Zombies. Die Spieler übernehmen die Rolle von einer Gruppe Überlebender, während der Zombie Apokalypse. Doch die Untoten sind nicht die größte Gefahr, denn der Winter steht vor der Tür und Nahrungsmittel und Ressourcen sind knapp. Außerdem geht das Gerücht um, dass es einen Verräter in den eigenen Reihen gibt. Winter der Toten ist ein semi-kooperatives Brettspiel mit Verräter-Mechanik. Die Spieler müssen zusammenarbeiten, um unterschiedliche Ziele zu erreichen. Der Verräter 8sofern es einen gibt), darf aber nicht zu früh sabotieren, da auch er ein geheimes Ziel besitzt und sich vor den Zombies retten muss. So ist das Misstrauen nie so omnipräsent wie z.B. bei Battlestar Galactica, aber man hat die Möglichkeit immer im Hinterkopf. Wirklich toll ist die Crossroads-Mechanik, die bei uns am Tisch schon zu manch verrückten Situationen geführt hat (ich sag nur Kaufhaus-Weihnachtsmann und Show-Hund)! Wer auf kooperatives Spiele und Zombies steht, kommt um Winter der Toten nicht vorbei!

Ok, I just played this game yesterday for the first time. 5 player game and to be honest, I really loved it. However, I will not give a 10 because of only one thing. When comparing it with City of Horrors, Dead of Winter really lacks the voting system and items card. 

Apart of this, it is a much superior game. However, I really like the voting on CoH. That is why I give DoW 9.5 and it doesn't replace CoH. It dos replace certainly Battlestar Galactica, but the lack of a voting system is the only obstacle for a perfect 10.

RATING: 6.5
Puntos fuertes: Muy bien ambientado. Buenas ilustraciones. Las cartas de encrucijada y los roles ocultos le aportan algo extra a las misiones. Las historias/misiones están bien montadas. Es fácil de aprender, aunque tiene su complicación. Para el precio los componentes están bien. El juego está bien equilibrado respecto a la dificultad en relación al número de jugadores (no es ni más ni menos difícil). Tiene muchas misiones, así que tiene cuerda para rato.

Puntos débiles: A dos no aporta la misma experiencia. No puedes jugar con roles ocultos y las encrucijadas tampoco afectan tanto. Tiene bastante despliegue y, aunque no es tan relevante, solo tiene una orientación el tablero.

Conclusión: Juego cooperativo complejo pero fácil de jugar y de aprender. Sin duda mucho mejor para grupos a partir de 3, a dos se queda muy corto. Consigue meterte en el papel por la ambientación y la narrativa. El no ir con un solo personaje es un punto que le da variedad y posibilidades. Nuestra valoración de 6.5 es para dos, pero a 4 le daríamos un 7.5. Buen juego.

I was looking for a good (better) alternative to BSG and DoW (partially) delivered.
It got a very similar feeling and is much shorter. What I did not like, is that you can only exile one player, meaning if you got the wrong one the traitor has won, because he can not be stopeed anymore.

My friends really like this game, however I'm not a huge fan.  The game is a coop game which each player has their own objective.

In playing it, if you are going to win or not usually coming down to the last turn when everyone is trying to do everything they can to complete their own objective causing everyone else to lose if they are unable to succeed.  Because of this, the end of the game becomes frustrating.

The game does have some fun with the various cards with humorous events and interesting characters you can play as.

Much to my chagrin, this game is better than BSG. The rules are clearer and cleaner and the play time is much more manageable. As a result I know this will get played a lot more. The traitor mechanic isn't as pronounced as BSG, in that it's entirely possible that there is never a betrayal, and even if there is that person might still need the main victory conditions to still be met. 

The Crossroads cards take this game to the next level, the narrative they present and the decisions they provide are very rewarding and give the game a real story feel. Can't wait to get this to the table again.

I bought this game because I love the surviving part of a  zombie apocalypse game. There is more scavenging and managing resourses than fighting. Zombies are coming but it's dangerous to fight them. Dead of Winter is like State of Decay but during Winter :-) There are many elements what change at every game: objective, the presence or not of a traitor and the numerous events cards. It's a difficult game but there is a lot of fun at every game, even when all your survivors die starving, or are eaten alive by a zombie or (the list is long)

RATING: 5
I know I'm in the minority, but Dead of Winter is much more mechanical than story-driven. Stockpiling resources just so bad stuff doesn't happen isn't all that interesting, and you know exactly who put what in there, unlike BSG, where the game is designed to throw you curve balls. I think this game is false advertising also, because the rules as written don't make this game cooperative. It's everyone for themselves, but if you don't collaborate then no one is going to win. So many good ideas, but it just doesn't come together as well as it should.

Vastly prefer Battlestar Galactica in comparison.

Ok, the second game was WAAAAAAAY more fun than the first. Lots of laughing and needling.

The fact that there is an actual solid need to get the main objective done for the other scenarios is a huge plus (instead of the random dice rolling for "We need more samples." 

Was close to selling this, but now I'm keeping it. Good game.

The combination of cooperation game and hidden agendas creates a good level of friction between the players. Many cards are drawn and dice cast but since they are played afterwards, there is balance between luck and skills. 

That said, the mechanisms are not very inventive: roll a die, move and draw a card. The challenge is not to follow a deep strategy or find surprising tactical actions but to optimize the odds and there are better and simpler games for that.

Those who appreciate roleplaying games are sure to appreciate the colony's struggle against weather and zombies while tacticians and strategists may lack control.

This game needs the right group to play and be enjoyable. If your group doesn't like long pauses between each turn for example to read crossroads cards or the descriptions on the survivors cards to read their abilities, or texts on item cards, then don't waste your time with this game. All of these take time, and then add many other things you just have to remember, like adding a die for new survivor or counting the zombies before your move and then you say "stop, I just forgot to read the crossroad". Yes, each player spend a long time finishing their turn so if you play with 3 (which is the recommendation on BGG, there will be more than around 10-15 minutes before the first player get a chance to play again. As others stated before, this is more of an experience, like a movie, not a game you would like to play every day. You have to be patient to able to enjoy the game by  watching other players play their turn, talk about it, talk about the crossroads and plan a head. But if you find the right group, I am sure that you will enjoy every second of it,

Almost every mechanism in this game makes sense thematically.  It's a thinky co-op with a brilliant secret objective based traitor mechanic mixed in.  The crisis system in BSG might make the game seem like it has less downtime, but I find myself very interested in every other person's turn in DoW, and the cards contributed to the crises themselves make more sense thematically.  I'm not into zombie games, but this game completely overcomes that aspect of the theme to me.  It's the best zombie game ever made.  It's the best traitor game I've played.  It has a harsh dice roll that just flat out can kill a character, but somehow it just adds to the suspense and fun for me.  That's a rare feat.  Well done, Plaid Hat Games.

I've mostly played the straight co-op, non-traitor variant with 2-3 players and the game is a lot of fun. The theme is implemented very well and you feel like survivors in a zombie-infested world. We've won a few times, but have lost even more. I would like to play with the traitor mechanic (and with more players), but I've yet to do so. I think having a "group of survivors" (more players) will breathe new life into the game for me and really bring out the theme. We shall see!

An ok game that needs a fix for preventing tanking the game as the betrayer.

I'm keeping both BSG and SoC since this does not replace these games for me.

A good supplement to the cooperative+traitor genre, but still not the perfect game in the genre that I was looking for.

Changed to a 1 because of this:
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1256602/variant-prevent-betrayer-tanking/page/1

My experience of the game will now be associated with this thread, which kills the game for me. I didn't get the tanking problem fixed and my mistake was to assume that people reading my thread would help me out. Instead I was attacked by people loving the game and the designer for: "lying" about the problem. 
When the only people reading threads are people liking the game, this is what you get. Silly me :)

The designer was nice enough to write me back:
"I do care about your thoughts and criticism. If something I said implied otherwise I apologize, as that was not my intention.

I stated in a previous comment I did not think you were lying, I'm only trying to understand and help solve this problem. And to see what the problem is.

Again, I'm sorry. I generally stay out of these types of threads, and will revert to doing so in the future. I did not mean to make you feel bad, I only wanted to help. "

Which is very kind of him.

Yes it´s an overhyped clone of Battlestar Galactica in a zombie setting. And it only does about 5% of stuff you haven´t seen on earlier games. But it´s damned good.

In no way does this live up to the hype for me.  Certainly not a bad game, but I would much rather play BSG.  Just an ok game.

If you enjoy a narrative and social time with board games you will like this game (thus ignore my rating). Not for me or many others however; minimal to no meaningful decisions to be made that exert control over the game. More just roll with it and see what happens. I'll try these games but won't seek them out in any way, I usually can't stand them (my personal subjective rating would be 1). Similar to and equal in experience with Dead Winter.

RATING: 6
This game has a lot going for it: crossroads, secret agendas, group agendas, relatively high replayability, different scenarios, a traitor mechanic that works sometimes, different feeling characters, and generally decent gameplay.

But I do have some issues with it: downtime especially at 4/5P counts, high swinginess due to the ease of tanking morale, widely different personal objectives that range from trivial to very hard, and some other nitpicks.

Together, the pros and cons become a wash, and its a decent game that I'd play but am not crazy about.

This game can tell a very intricate story if the players foster it.

It is desperate, you are always behind and barely surviving.  Overall a well designed game that is satisfying but can be emotionally draining as some of the decisions are morally tough.

The only thing holding me back from a higher rating is the zombie theme, which while not completely in your face it is there.

RATING: 7.5
My impressions after one play is that this game evokes a real sense of feeling for your characters and the colony as a whole.  The mood is tense and the game very quickly puts you in a position that every decision is important and there is a very real chance that you can fail in your endeavors.  I had multiple survivors get killed and failed a crisis at one point.  The feeling of impending starvation loomed.  Morale in the colony was whittled down to next to nothing.  The storytelling elements of the crossroad cards added to the immersive nature of the game.  Teegan loved it.  Even though there were many complex strategic decisions to be made, he was caught up in he story and really enjoyed the ride.  This game surprised me by the amount going on.  Reviews and video run-throughs fail to properly capture the feeling that is created by playing this game.  It truly is a unique experience.  Because of the adult theme and the desperate nature of the game, this is not a play everyday type of experience and keeps me from rating it a bit higher.

Very immersive game! I like it a lot! We always play it in the cooperative mode. It's very hard. We only have won one time. No matter the result! It always funny and not very complicated. I would like to try the traitor mode, perhaps it's not so punitive like the cooperative mode. I can't wait to buy the expansion.

An elegant, flavourful survival game with true semi-cooperative objectives: each player receives a secret goal to complete in addition to the main objective (or, rarely, a betrayal objective, which is incompatible with the main one). The difficulty and randomization balance seems just about perfect, as well – each game is feels unique and perpetually on the verge of failure, but a well-coordinated group can handle just about anything. 

Exceptional!

One of the better player vs. board experiences, creates a good zombie survival story feeling.

Make no mistakes about it, DoW is a eurogame. Yes, despite all that thematic flavour text and the great art, it is a very mechanical eurogame.

Contrary to what some people say, I think the zombie theme fits this game quite well. What I didn't like, though, were the "Request" action and the Waste Pile - those just feel clumsy. I mean, in a post-apocalyptic, zombie infested world are people seriously worried about taking out the rubbish?! Some people aren't even in the real world... Anyway, the actual thing that spoils the game for me a bit is the dice pooling mechanic instead of having individual dice allocated to characters. I think this pushes the game much further into eurogame territory than I enjoy as this mechanic really makes for bland, generic characters and considerably detracts from thematic values. This paired with the far too quick cycling of characters give the game a much more euro feel than it should have.

Love the theme and traitor aspect. The crossroads cards adds a nice bit of surprise and can really change up our strategy. Really sucks when someone rolls the tooth and instantly loses a person, especially if it happens the at the beginning of the game.

I have only played two player so far, and it does miss that sparkle of secret objectives and a potential betrayer without 3+.  The story telling is still engrossing, but the real meat is the hidden agendas with more players.  UPDATE:  The "Prisoner's Dilemma" variant makes two player quite amazing - adds in secret objectives and betrayal routes.  Totally META and beyond what I even thought possible in a board game.  UPDATE: Now have multiplayer plays under my belt.  The games were very enjoyable and the Xroads Cards work perfectly.  It was the one game we played twice during an all night gaming marathon...  UPDATE 2: Played another multiplayer game (4P), this one with a betrayer - who lured a ton of helpless to our colony before being exiled...  We lost and the exiled betrayer won...  TOTAL FUN!

This is a personal favorite of mine. You and the other players control a group of characters in the aftermath of a zombie outbreak. These survivors are part of a colony, and various game objectives require travel outside of the colony for resources. A card draw at the beginning of the game determines one of ten possible objectives for winning. Each player also draws a card to determine their own secret objective for an individual win condition, and one of these may be a traitor card that pits that player against the others, unbeknownst to them. While the zombie theme has certainly been overdone, this takes nothing away from the fun of this game, and because of the aforementioned combination of objectives, replay value is quite high.

This is an evolution in co-operative gaming. Plenty of diverse roles with some interesting strategic options; immersive atmosphere (even if some of the flavor text is a bit cliched); the traitor mechanic fits the theme very well; and the crossroads deck is something that I can see other games imitating. This is a diamond in an over-saturated zombie genre.

Hype of Winter's alright but I was going in expecting a higher suspicion level than SoC because of individual secret missions. Turns out those missions are so easy to complete, they only seem to implement an interactive level of mild auto-screwing to the game.

RATING: 5
Dead Of Winter gives a very thematic feel to each play. The zombie apocalypse is well conveyed through game mechanics. Unfortunately, the game has several clunky factors that eliminate it from being one that I would consider owning.

Set-up and tear-down is an ordeal. Game length can exceed 2 hours. Some elements, specifically the Crossroads cards, never seem to fire off, making them a mostly pointless task. And then there is the possibility of a traitor in your midst. While this does create an atmosphere of suspicion, limiting outright cooperation, I would rather do without it. Personally, whenever I wind up the traitor in a game with such a mechanic it instantly ruins the game for me. Usually I am playing such a game for the cooperative aspect and now having to work against the group makes it a completely different kind of play experience, one that I'm not interested in having.

I'm glad Sean owns Dead Of Winter, as it is worth playing every now and then. It's his kind of a game anyway.

I don't know that I can say enough about this game. We played 3 short encounters tonight, and I really feel like we barely scratched the surface of how deep and fun this game can be. We never exiled a single player, and there were a few characters that we didn't even manage to bring out. There is a lot of nuance to take advantage of, and it really captures the tension of a real zombie encampment well.

A fun hidden traitor/resource management game. The is so much going on that an alpha player is less frustrating than in other games, especially for gamers who prefer lighter games. The hidden objectives also help to balance the alpha gamer. This bodes well for future Crossroad games.

RATING: 8
A co-op for players who enjoy Robinson Crusoe, and who (somewhat) appreciate the gameplay of BSG but not its extra-ness. It's also for those players who wouldn't mind a light dusting of Ameritrash -- one or two character-specific abilities and dice-based combat (but not so much that the experience descends into dice-rolling RPG-land or general drudgery [Eldritch Horror]). Importantly, in Dead of Winter, you roll the dice [i]first[/i] (this is now my thesis statement in explaining euro vs. Ameritrash). The plethora of scenarios and starting characters promise continued novelty value in complement to a streamlined character-based co-op experience (simple stats, straightforward game-losing conditions, few # of phases each round, customizable game length)-- with some engaging add-ons in the form of hidden loyalty, hidden secret goals, the possibility of banishing suspect fellow players, and a couple layers of booby trap every single turn.

Very inconsistent game - sometimes it's short, sometimes it's long, sometimes it's fun, sometimes it's not.

There are a ton of fiddly rules, and many of them, particularly item handoff or requesting rules and PvP combat, never come up.

Exiling is quite broken. If your group is cooperatively minded, you can break the game by giving all the survivors you find to the traitor, then exiling the traitor. The exile objective is usually orthogonal to the colony's success, and you now have a very powerful player, who you don't have to feed, who can trade with you to make sure everyone can accomplish their goals. Even if there's no traitor, exiling someone usually improves everyone's chances of success, which feels wrong.

That said, it's good for the same reasons Betrayal at House on the Hill is good. I just  want a game like it that's more robust to good strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
It has some mechanics from Galactica, but I would not say they are very similar. It is nowhere close Robinson Crusoe, but I see some similarities with Shadows over Camelot. The designers made a great work at creating a set of simple and coherent rules that work very well. Easy to teach, easy to understand, easy to play.

Most of the decisions are quite straight forward and lack depth. Still, it is deeper than the average ameritrash game. 

I guess most of the fun most be in the social aspect of the game. We didn't see that in our game, because we had no traitor; even if the social aspect in our game was limited, we enjoyed it.

It is certainly a thematic game, but  I don't see it as thematic as many people insist. I see it more as players trying to beat the game mechanic: you already know how many zombies will appear and where they will appear, you know the things you need for your turn mission and the numeric consequences of failing it, your morale level and how many morale points you can afford to lose, etc. For example, of you stay put at your location, you do it because you have 1 morale point and you don't want to risk this character to die and lose the game, and not because the character is afraid, or some other thematic reason.

Some people say it's very easy for the traitor to make all players lose. I can easily think some situations where he can do a lot of damage by exploting tight situations. I guess veteran players will be able to minimize this by taking less risks. 


Things I like:
-> Game mechanics: Simple, strong and fun.
-> Fluidity: Being able to roll in advance allows you to plan your moves in advance; you will only need minor adaptations depending on what the other players will do.
-> Duration: The designers succeeded at keeping it short enough.

Things I dislike:
-> Lack of replayability. Survivors have skills that define their strategies, they will always be played the same. You always get the same locations, with the same cards. I foresee games being very similar and plenty of expansions being published.
-> Lack of balance. There are shitty characters and great characters. One player can suffer a bad roll and stick to one character (and 2 action die) for the rest of the game. The next one can have one of these "draw 2/keep 2 cards" every time you search, and get up to 7 characters (and 8 action die) mid game. It's does not kill the fun,
-> I don't like having to read the effects of the Crossroads cards; it substracts to the theme. It would be much more thematic and intense to read the effects only after the player made the choice.

Overrated game, but still has its fun moments.  You can really get screwed over at time just by card draws, but it does lead to engaging stories.

Expect long gameplay if you don't get immediately screwed by the cards.

Cooperativo con possibile traditore, molto dadoso. Questi i principali motivi che rendono questo gioco non apprezzatissimo da me. Da dire che le partite sono anche simpatiche, non tanto per l'ambientazione (zombie) da me non amata, ma dalla necessità di sviluppare la capacità deduttiva per comprendere se ci sono traditori. Questo aspetto è stato sapientemente studiato offrendo ad ogni giocatore, oltre ad un obeittivo principale, anche un obiettivo secondario che se non colpito corrisponderà alla sconfitta. A mio avviso in 5, specie le prime partite potrebbe farsi sentire un down time un po' fastidioso. Il gioco offre diversi scenari per rendere le partite sempre varie. Inoltre ogni giocatore potrà controllare un paio di personaggi ognuno con capacità specifiche. Gioco da provare.

Verdict:

What I Like: The atmosphere of mutual suspicion this game creates. The crossroads cards are the distinguishing feature, and they are fun. The artwork is fantastic. Everyone I've played it with loves it...

What I Don't Like: ...a lot more than I do. The actual cooperative gameplay lacks the brutal intensity and teamwork I crave. And if the difficulty is bumped up, the game becomes too easy for any traitor. If the traitor possibility is removed for balance however, the game loses all intrigue and becomes uninteresting. I wish the location decks were a bit more varied with the items they give as well.

Fun game only played it a few times. Great theme and story. I loved all the character. IF you enjoy games with a hidden traitor mechanic you will like this one maybe better then Battestar or Shadows of Camelot. I think this one is much harder to win because you are given every one a hidden objective. So you have x amount of people who need to do x amount of separate things and you could also have a traitor. Makes it hard in my opinion

Grosse claque ludique pour le coup.
Ce jeu contient beaucoup d'éléments qui me plaisent :
 - un thème bien rendu : les zombies et l'ambiance stressante sont bien au rendez vous
 - de la coopération riche : les intéractions sont diverses et profondes. Et pour être précis c'est de la semi-coopération (que j'ai découvert avec ce jeu au passage)
 - des events : la fameuse croisée des chemins qui vient mettre le bazar dans la partie
 - du fun : les objectifs perso créent des situations très marrantes.
 - les jets de dés : moi j'adore ça car ça peut vite dégénérer comme devenir épique en cas de grosse moule

Pour peu que l'on joue avec des joueurs qui sont à fond, c'est un des meilleurs jeux auquel j'ai pu jouer.

Had great expectations on this one, but the game, alltogether, is not as good as Battlestar Galactica. It does have a much better storytelling (the crossroads mechanism!) and, dependng on the scenario, can be played within a much shorter time. But: There is downtime. You're not involved outside you turn, and that is a thing that BSG does a better job with. As a traitor, it's a lot harder to make a sabotage.

Robinson Crusoe should take note. Complexity is not always better. Story can be had without it.

After 4 plays I am a little disappointed no one has been the traitor yet. Because of this I have gotten to experience the Social Gaming side of this so much.
Also we played an easier campaign collecting samples twice, the first time the dice were being totally mean and we almost didn't win, which was exciting because i think it literally came down to the last round. the second time we rolled dice like a boss and crush it with time to spare, not as fun. Also the hidden objectives sound cool in theory, but in the end I just kind of tell people I am going to do something stupid to get my objective fulfilled, i guess with an actual traitor this would become more interesting. I am def. compelled to play this again, i feel like there is more story to give, more crossroads to read, more betrayals to occur.

A very intense and deadly game! After my wife read the rules for the game, but before we played for the first time my wife stayed up late for a week putting together a soundtrack/playlist for Dead of Winter. One that was entirely zombie themed. When asked why she did this, she said this game is so scary with it's winter season theme and the constant loss of life and tough confrontational situations with other characters in the colony...this game deserved the right music for ambiance. 

The components are excellent and I really appreciate the bitter cold artwork. This is an intense semi-cooperative game. Each player has their own personal goals for winning. The game also has a goal for you to achieve or no one can win. It is super difficult living conditions in a zombie apocalypse. Food is scarce, morale is always low, moral questions will always come up. Do you take more survivors into your already struggling colony or send them away? Every game is unique and even if the same moral questions come up they may not be voted on the same way depending on the current climate of the colony.

Each player controls two characters at the start of the game. But those characters could succumb to frostbite or become infected and not survive. You will also probably be faced with taking on more characters during the game too. The simple task of traveling to any outside building in the town is so incredibly dangerous. But someone has to get some supplies...right? This game reminds me a lot of Shadows of Camelot, the difficulty of just traveling to a destination is a huge part of the game...and of course the Betrayer. Yes...someone in the group could be the Betrayer!

Before purchasing this game there was a lot of hype over the Crossroads cards. To be honest, they are an exciting element to the game, but only because they offer surprise choices and good back story to the game. I don't think they are incredibly innovative as some would have you believe. I feel like they are similar to the Encounter cards or Other World cards you might find in Arkham Horror or Eldrich Horror. Some crossroads cards you vote on as a colony, others must be decided by the active player. 

A difficult game to win. An excellent and intense winter survival zombie game, where surviving as a colony becomes everyone's goal, but individual goals are still needed to win.

I think this is one for more serious gamers. I played it with muggles; I had fun, they had fun but we all had more fun with Pandemic and The Resistance. I think if you were more familiar with those games you would probably appreciated the nuances of this game more but for beginners that subtlety is lost. 

I would say too that while the art on the box and the standees are gorgeous, the actual play board is really bland and ugly; an undifferentiated grey expanse. 1 point off for that.

Have only played the first scenario with no traitor and waltzed it in. Would probably be better if the traitor was involved, but it's absence had a huge impact to the game. It became pretty obvious that there was no traitor and after that was understood, it was all too easy.

Feels almost like a roleplaying game, except that you have less emotional connection to your characters, of which you typically have several. They can die and be replaced by others. So in this sense it's less RPG, more board game.
I especially like the action system, whereby you roll a set of dice and then decide how to spend those dice, according to your characters' abilities. A mechanism borrowed from the euro genre, it lends a puzzly feel to the gameplay and is a divergence from old-fashioned RPG mechanisms (which typically revolve around you deciding to do something, then rolling to see if you're successful), and a welcome one at that.
The bite die adds an injection of true randomness and chaos to keep things from feeling too deterministic.

Really strong entry into the co-opetition space: everyone has to make sure the game isn't lost, but you still need to win your own game. Terrific take on the zombie genre, too: focus is on the survivor drama, not the zombie killing.

RATING: 8
The decisions are pretty basic - move to a location at your peril (roll a die), draw cards at the location (each location has a different mix so go where it's more likely you'll draw what you want), and push back the zombies at your location so there's not enough to kill you. The cool thing is that each game is different. Not only does the group have a new mission (collect this card or that, or do this or that), but each player needs to fulfil their own secret condition to be part of that win as well. So the priorities of what you're searching for and what you care about are different each game. Additionally, you'll be playing different characters with different specialties each game. So the attraction is not so much about the game-play, it's the theme and the flavour. The possibility of having to cope with the potential traitor (executed in Shadows Over Camelot style) adds some angst as well. I'm a fan of scenario driven variety, so put me down for more.

RATING: 9
A tight game and gaming experience. This may be my favorite semi-coop board game, yet. So much going on, but it all works beautifully. You don't have to like zombies at all to appreciate this game. It even plays well 2 players.

I think that what makes this game different is that any time the survivors go out into the cold or attack a zombie, they could die instantly from a bad exposure roll. The inclusion of this particular mechanism, coupled with the crossroads cards, makes the design of the game a breath of fresh air.

I really didn't care for this game. It is heavily plot driven and that's what the game relies on to be good. However, I wish the event cards would work more like make your own adventure books, even though there are decisions that can be taken, they aren't of significant consequence to the game play.

Not interested.

What an awesome game ...

Three games this year have really rocked my boat and have been three of my best games of the last decade nameley:

Dead of Winter
Alien: Legendary
Shadows of Brimstone

So many clever mechanics in this game, well,produced well,supported and can be played very well solitaire especially if you choose your actions first then draw your crossroad card then carry out the actions ...that way the crossroad card will not influence your choice of actions. A very simple way of making the game very solitaire friendly using multiple characters.

First play- really cool, but some significant downtime issues waiting for turn. I was surprised that this smacked a bit of AH for me, and not in a great way. We didn't have a traitor in our game, I would really like to see what its like when there is one.

Originally, this quote from user Mattrick in his review has me wanting to play this- "No Alpha Leader - one thing I hate about some cooperative games is that a loud vocal person or dominant player can basically control the game and make decisions for everyone taking the fun out of the game. With secret objectives, secondary objectives, and hidden hand I found this was pretty much non-existent."

Now that I have played it, it does feel like still has some Alpha stuff going on.

I really need to play again to assess this.

RATING: 8.2
At the outset this is an incredible looking game. Presentation is excellent - there are loads of parts and the options when you turn comes are great.

After a few plays though, you realise that although this is a lot of fun, there isn't a whole lot of strategy involved. Mostly this is because the mission design is a bit weak. Either you get a simple enough mission that you might be able to complete or else you get a stupid one you have no chance of achieving and instead of working towards a goal you just mess about, sandbox style.

While I think this is a much better game than Battlestar Galactica overall, the whole part of guessing who the traitor is is better in BSG - so BSG is not obsolete.

Downtime can be pretty bad between turns, especially if one player has a lot of followers.

Dead of Winter is a semi-cooperative game in which players must achieve a shared scenario goal as well as a secret personal goal in order to win.  Players take control of multiple characters, which can be killed off (usually to the group's detriment) or recruited anew (which has a penalty), and they move those characters around the board collecting gear and fighting zombies.  Resolutions of movement, fighting, etc., was determined by die roll, which seemed pretty random to me.  The gameplay itself didn't really seem compelling.  The secret goals were a pretty good idea, but they definitely weren't balanced--some were much, much easier than others.

I'll definitely give it another shot, but so far I wasn't that impressed with it. The story telling was different and immersive, but the actual things you're doing aren't really that interesting. I also didn't understand with some of the crossroads cards why we lost morale. It seemed pretty damned beneficial to me to kick someone out that was infected. 

I also felt like there was a lot of downtime between turns. Not to mention the rolling of a d12 to see if you survive. I need to actually read the rules to this because I've heard it's not as brutal as that, but I'm really not that interested in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The issue with this game is that I never feel like I have any interesting decisions to make. The choices that you do have always possess a very obvious optimal ranking, and it ends up feeling like you're doing chores and never getting anywhere. 

Also, a competent betrayer can safely tank morale on their last turn and there's nothing you can ever do about it, destroying any progress you think you could have made. It's difficult to slowly sabotage things throughout the game, since each struggle or crisis is explicitly a win/fail affair—this means betraying is a binary action with no nuance and no real room for depth in gameplay. A lot of the time the betrayer's objective is so difficult that they may not even achieve it, leaving a game where everyone loses.

Even if the gameplay were more compelling, there are some really, really strong thematic-gameplay contradictions. It's optimal to exile the last player on the last turn before they can take it, even if it's less fun. It's optimal to take boring cards like the Mother and the Cook who just stay in the colony because they're extremely useful. The game's intro scenes and crossroads events are a mixed bag; some read as though they were written by fourteen year-olds, others are incredibly serious, some are frustratingly facile, some nonsensical, and others just outright comical. It's like the game didn't want to settle on a cohesive theme besides its zombie skin.

This is my favorite game.  I was very hesitant to purchase this game as most of the zombie games are cheesy and overall not fun.  After one play, I have been absolutely hooked on this game.

This is probably the zombie game I've been looking for which matches closely to popular shows.  The variable powers for the characters and hidden objectives is a nice touch, as well as the challenges and threats the survivors face each round.

I think the zombie bite and frostbite mechanisms can be too powerful and hate the chain reaction, causing devastating losses.  The game took awhile to setup and the turn orders can be clumsy.

Very fun game, great mechanics and a hit with our group.  However; we will see what the longevity of the game is.  After many play through's everyone still asks for more but I can see where, even with randomization of goals and setup the game is a bit same-ish through plays.  I'm going to give it a strong 8 at this time and we will see what I think after a year.

One of the few co-ops with the traitor mechanic. I don't traditionally like playing against "cardboard AI" (besides Mage Knight) but this game puts an interesting twist on that with the traitor and secret personal objectives in addition to the main objective.

An enjoyable but tense co-op, tho' the personal objectives are not as well-balanced as they might be. It might be fun to try it replacing the cardboard zombies with some of those from Zombicide.

More survival than zombies which is probably a plus for us.  My favorite part is probably the psychological part of the game.

It is also a really nice game...rich in theme.

This was a good experience, but not something that is going to get repeated play. It was clear we didn’t have a traitor and yet we barely won the introductory scenario.

A great survival game. It does a great job at drawing you in with the crossroad cards and characters that help you form a story and get into the theme of the game. I like how the chances of there being a betrayer are on the small side. I enjoy the challenge this game always seems to bring to the table.

RATING: 3
The secret traitor mechanic fails in this game because the traitor can accomplish far too much in back-to-back turns. Many scenarios can be sabotaged with a single action, such as the "empty two decks" objective which can be sabotaged by a traitor killing off one of their own characters on the last turn of the game.

Successful coop-with-a-traitor such as Battlestar Galactica, Dark Moon and Saboteur work by limiting the amount a saboteur can do in one turn.

RATING: 8.8
(01/18) It was like my 5th board game, I've played it more times than it says here.

I love how people get engaged with it from the 2nd round, even on player's first play. Love the game without a traitor, so, imagine how much better it gets when someone is trying yo screw everything up. I haven't played Battlestar Galactica and I consider this one one of the essential games with a traitor dynamic and a narrative storytellling.

The Crossroad cards are incredible, add so much to the experience (PlaidHat said they were going to do more games with that dynamic, still waiting)

I will update my rating today from 8 in may 2015 to 8.8

I was really really interested in this game when I first purchased it.  I thought this was going to be the game to get my very competitive group into co-op games.  But that was sadly not the case.  We played it a few times and after every game we never felt the need to play it again and we never felt like what we did was very epic.

There's a possibility that it was because we never had a traitor that fully understood the rules or if we needed to bump the difficulty up to hard, but this game has always left me with wanting more.  It gets a 7 because the mechanics are solid, but I'm pretty sure I now own much MUCH better traitor games.

Good game, if a bit long and fiddely at times.  I not sure the game around the traitor mechanics is necessarily fun, but this game is all about the people you play with.  The Crossroads Cards really make this a great game.  Even though Crossroads Cards are random, they are really fun and random works in a game ultimately decided upon by social choices.

I finally got this game played at my most recent meetup for my local board game meeting. 

This is one awesome game with the right crowd. It was funny that the hardcore Euro players turned down the offer to play but fortunately we have enough players who are interested in more thematic games to play a 5-player game.

We played a short game and I think it was the right choice for a beginner's game (we have 3 newbies). 

This game has many good mechanisms mixed into it and the crossroad card really makes it feel like we are playing THE WALKING DEAD video game. Each choice you make affects the game differently.

We won at the end which was a plus in my book. I would like to play again if possible.

One of the most thematic games I've played. The traitor mechanic works great since everyone has their own selfish agenda even while working together to survive. Every time I feel like I am in an episode of the Walking Dead. Not for everyone however, my game group doesn't enjoy it as much so it doesn't hit the table as much as I'd like. For me however, this is a culmination of everything I love about games.

The game mechanic 'co-oprative play', I came in touch through 'Pandmic' (like many others I pressume); I liked it and played lots of games in the same genre from the tons of co-operative games that came out in the slipstream of Pandemic. 
But after a while I became bored with this mechanic, as in there core, they were clones of Pandemic with some other some and twists that weren't exciting for me. Even the praised 'Robinson Crusoe: Adventure on The Cursed Island' couldn't excite me.

For the first time since long, I had a positive feeling after playing dead of Winter, a co-operative game. I think what does it for is the simple addition of the secret missions. It makes that while in the core it stays a co-operative game, it's not that sure you/everybody will win when you complete the common objective.

RATING: 8
Great game. For myself and my group at least, it stands out from the general glut of zombie-themed stuff.  Z's are more of a vague, pervasive threat around the survivors in DoW, as opposed to a Shoot Em Up like Zombicide.

When done right, it provides tense drama and tough decision making.

Wish I could play it more.. Played 3(4) times and the second game wa the most fun game I ever played. Also it is my brother's favourite game. Bought it when it was low on print so had to buy it at 10000 rs as I was desperate to try it after watching it on tabletop.
Have most fun in the mood/ setting creation things we do like character background story, cooling exposure die in freezer, playing background zombie theme music, dim lights,etc.

Played with 4 Players. No one in my group liked it. 
The main problem is the lack of meaningful decisions a player can make. The game mechanic is simple but not  elegant like in Pathfinder the Adventure Card Game. On your turn you draw item cards from different location decks, use the items somehow and kill zombies. When you kill a zombie there is a chance that you die instantly or  get wounded. Three wounds and one of your characters is dead. Well, just search for new characters in the location  decks. That´s the game in a nutshell. Lot of downtime for the other players. 
Traitor mechanic and hidden goals do not work well.
Maybe the game is better in the pure cooperative variant with just two players. I´m willing to try it this way.
Better coop games with traitor: Shadows over camelot
Better coop games with storytelling aspect: Pathfinder the adventure card game.

Most scenarios in the game are hard enough to win without having a traitor in play. In addition, many traitor objectives are completely invisible since they blend perfectly in the game which defeats the entire purpose of hiding your identity as the traitor. The crossroads cards are a little long to read. All in all a good game but i would simply play without any traitors for a straight up coop game.

RATING: 5.5
Unfortunately, seems that this game is unbalanced on what people can play, that is, a player that searches a lot would get plenty of characters. I went last on the first turn and by then there were so many people that searching for more would have cause morale loss, so I did not do that to help the team. I never saw more than two characters and generally got stuck with not so good tasks. I like cooperatives and semi-cooperatives, but this one did not manage to grab me.

RATING: 7.8
This is a brilliant game that is, at its core, of the Ameritrash genre, but with hints of Euro-elements that make for a very streamlined and fast paced zombie apocalypse survival romp. 

The story revolves around a colony of survivors that are struggling to survive a particularly harsh winter sometime after the zombie uprising and subsequent fall of society. Predictably, a la Walking Dead, the colony has fragmented into a number of cliques, each controlled by one of the players. Each game, the survivors have a different objective that they need to complete, while each individual player has their own secret objective as well that may, or may not, be compatible with the colony objective. And all the while, the zombie hordes advance - constantly pressuring the colonists and forcing them to fight and forage to survive. 

And if that weren't enough, there may also be someone lurking in the colony who's working to bring about the colony's collapse. 

The game's components are extremely high quality and the shear variety of characters, objectives, secret objectives, make the game infinitely replayable. In addition, the inclusion of the Crossroads cards keeps everyone engaged during other players turns and continues to keep the gave fresh and lively.

The traitor/betrayer mechanic saves this game from being a rebranded Zombicide-style game.  I like playing it and I find that the individual objectives keep the game fresh and interesting. Semi-coop is a cool thing.

I was skeptical that this would live up to the hype, but several plays in and I'm a convert. There's a lot going on, but at its heart an easy game. Theme is strong, loyalty mechanics are well done, plenty of things to do and experience.  Tons of replay value.  I do think the game often comes down to a bad die roll or card draw, which keeps it from being truly great, but still quite an accomplishment in board gaming.

Beautifully illustrated. I love all the standees and the personal touches to differentiate people and stories. For many objectives, feels like you might not be able to control completing your objective. The game tends to be hard enough without a traitor, with a traitor, feels like they have too much power being able to lure zombies over. Traitor in the last player position and calling zombies can be a major setback even if things are going well....which they never are.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a game with a lot going for it:
- It has awesome multiple mechanics (a bit like Battlestar Galactica)
- It is very well themed
- It is immersive
- ...

Personally I feel the best part is how the co-operation mechanism has been implemented though.

DoW is a co-operative game in which co-operation is not the mindless "decide-together" typical of some other games like Zombicide or Pandemic, but in which individuals make the deliberate choice to co-operate (in full or in part) and personal and collective objectives (often at odds) makes choices meaningful for the player performing it, and ambiguous for the other players (even more so when the game is played in "betrayal mode".

My only [minor] gripe is that all games look alike, because the main mission/objective only plays on a couple of variables (stocked goods, number of barricades, locations...).

A thoroughly enjoyable game though, highly recommend it! :)

I *LOVE* this game. Complicated to learn, but the mechanics are so logical that once you have it, you have it. The complexity ensures that each game is different.

I really hope it's space, but I think I'll like it no matter what the theme.

Semi-Coop (hidden objectives, possible traitor). One of the best zombie games (but it's not necessarily everyone's cup of tea) and theme and mechanics blend together quite well. Definitely a medium weight strategy game, probably not a great learn-and-play party game. Doesn't play great with 2, better with more.

I first played this on Aug 27, 2016 with Kenny, Aldi, and Zach.  It is a game of cooperation against the zombie horde that seems to overrun and eat you.  It has a difficult learning curve, but it was worth it and we won our first 2 games played on hardcore mode.

RATING: 6
This is a very well written hidden role game, where you are living in a town plagued by zombies. Each player gets a personal goal to complete, and all players have one common survival goal to reach as defined by the scenario. As you play, events happen that force you to make interesting story choices. One minor problem is that it's more fun if you don't know the result of your choice until you make it, but the game sort of forces you to read the resolutions on either side of your choice and make an informed decision based on repercussions. Death happens often in this game, and often it happens randomly because there is a die that has an autodeath face on it. You get new characters, but often this can be frustrating as you lose progress on your secret quest. There is also a traitor mechanic which can make things tense. overall I like this game a lot, but it might be a little too random for my preference.

Very good.  Tense, difficult, well produced, and quite innovative.  Can't think of another game in my collection that plays the same.  
We did co-op with traitor in our first game and didn't have a traitor...which was kind of a drag.  That's alright, however, as even without someone "within the organization" gumming up the works, we still lost.  REALLY looking forward to getting a traitor, regardless.

This is a really cool game that looks great with the standees and doesn't outstay its welcome.

The crossroads cards are really thematic and add drama to the game.

Good communication is definitely needed to maximise player turns as the turn counter is quite unforgiving, meaning you have to get started on your missions from the get go.

Players are challenged to balance the mission, crisis, food supply, secret missions and morale which can create some difficult situations.

Can foresee the replay-ability factor being an issue though as each game I've played has generally followed the same pattern.

Would recommend, especially to lovers of the zombie genre.

This game has been a stable in my gaming nights and I love it. It's a semi co-op game with a possible traitor. The theme is based on a zombie apacolypse but unlike other zombie themed games, the zombies don't play a major role in this game. It's about the interaction of the players and the difficult decisions they have to make. What I love is the crossroad mechanic. It adds a lot of flavor and story to an already immense game. My favorite game of 2014. Highly highly recommended.

RATING: 8
Great theme and lot's of interesting decisions. Most comparable to Battlestar Galactica, but a bit shorter and with better theme integration.

My biggest complaints are the lack of balance in objectives* and the radical variation in difficulty depending on whether there is a traitor.

* There are two objectives which are by definition not balanced: one requires 2 medicine cards at the end of the game and the other requires 3 medicine cards. The other objectives are also generally not balanced, but the two medicine objectives are glaringly imbalanced.

Played a few games, don't like how some traitor cards make you do things that the team doesn't need to do. and when you do it, it will just raise the red flag, however I found out that some non-betrayal secret objective cards do the same which raise suspicions as well so a traitor can use that as a cover.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An interesting collection of ideas that doesn't really work as a satisfying game. I like the crossroads mechanic, which adds opportunities for story and characterization in an otherwise pretty mechanical game. I like the possible traitor, though other games do it as well. I like the way the crisis cards work, where you have the option of filling the need or suffering the listed consequences.
However, even if there is no traitor the game is punishingly difficult and there is often no way to mitigate the disasters that come up. In particular, I dislike the red exposure die, which has a chance of instantly killing a character any time they attempt a meaningful action. This is very swingy and frustrating, and bad rolls can easily make you lose the game regardless of what you do. The way you find extra characters in the search decks is also problematic, since you don't get to make a choice about it. You just automatically have to take the new character. It would have been much more interesting and gamelike if there was a choice to make about whether to recruit them when you find them. As is, these two mechanics can lead to vast differences in power and ability between players over the course of the game, and sometimes getting stuck with extra characters can make you lose when you would otherwise win.
Overall, it just feels like more of a story generator than a game, because of limited decisions and very swingy dice and card draws. And most of the stories are "You die horribly and there was nothing you could have done about it."

This game is fascinating because the zombies and theme are a backdrop to how well you can function as a group and the social paranoia that ensues when you start thinking there might be a traitor amongst you.

I'm a fan of cooperative games and of social deduction games, and therefore games with a hidden traitor often interest me such as Shadows Over Camelot and Battlestar Galactica. I find this does it better mechanically and thematically than either of those games, partially due to secret objectives making discovering the traitor more challenging. I love this game but did find it starting to become stale--therefore very happy to have preordered The Long Night to freshen the experience for many more plays.

I loved the potential traitor aspect of the game (we had one and never realized). I may have rigged the deck so that we drew the stunt dog and mall Santa as new characters, and I regret nothing. I was worried about the theme (I'm not a huge fan of zombies) but the game had a nice mix of crushing hopelessness mitigated by absurdity (like when the stunt dog picked up a pistol). The crossroads cards seem like they'll add a lot of variability, and I feel like there's still a lot of game to explore. I'd definitely play again.

I was expecting something along the lines of Battlestar Galactica but instead got Betrayal House on the Hill. Not much there strategically. However, the game manages to get the spirit and the theme of a zombie move into a game through those Crossroad cards, which are merely event cards with narrative text on them.

One thing I didn't particularly liked: players can gain more people in their faction/entourage to control. Unfortunately, this is all luck-based. So if you have only one or two characters to control while others have five or more, then bad die rolls hurt you more, and there is much less interesting things you can do on your turn.

UPDATE: We made a serious rules error: You are not obligated to play event cards (in particular, those that give you new characters) immediately. This enables you to give these cards to other players, or save them up for later. However, I don't think my rating will change despite this.

After much research,  I recognize this as more a story telling game and not just a traitor one. Like many of my favorites with the meta game,  this game is focused more on the experience than a clear victory.   You won't enjoy the game looking for the win.   After I realized that,  I liked it a good bit more.   However, there is not enough time in the game to realize a vision like that.  The personal goals are too clunky.  There is never a time that I would want this over Shadows Over Camelot for either new people or gamers

Coop game, allowing for a traitor. This game really dragged on and on, and the minis actually hindered gameplay, making it difficult to locate them. I expected so much more, from the hype this game got.

Lots of great ideas in this game. Lots of solid game mechanisms. Absolutely stellar game components. I love the story elements and making moral decisions. With all that said, I still plan on selling the game. We have a lot of co-op games, which we love, but we just don't seem to be in love with Dead of Winter. I would never turn down a game if I was at a game night but I don't request it in my own home.

A clever game with cool ideas, but one that hails from the Arkham Horror school of design where the game mostly plays itself and player input is just incidental. 
 
The game is heavily reliant on random chance for both play and narrative. Characters can and will die at the roll of the die if you attempt to use them in any respect, and the story telling frequently makes no sense.

Still, if Zombie games are your thing and you don't mind a 30+ minute rules explanation, you could do a lot worse.

This is a great game. After my first play it left me thinking about it later that evening and wondering about other scenarios and future plays. My first time playing was in a crowded store surrounded by kids playing card games so it wasnte the best environment for such a story driven narrative type game.

I look forward to playing this again and really getting into the theme and choices that this game presents. I am very interested in discovering the other scenarios and secret win cards. 

:UPDATE:

Played this 3 times over the Thanksgiving holiday with 4 players and had tons of fun. So many interesting situations came up everyone was engaged and having fun. Right after finishing a shorter scenario everyone looked around the table and my mom said "want to try another scenario"

Life is a vulgar absurdity. Dead of Winter is an appropriate name as this game is long, depressing, almost hopeless churning of turn after turn that makes every player feel bad about everything.

It takes a long time to play and not much reward, unless you are a masochist, but I guess that is the point of DoW. It is not supposed to make you feel good.

This game has not done it for me the few times I have played it. It could be due to me only playing with smaller groups and the possibility of the groups just not providing what i need to enjoy the game. But I don't think that is the case. I'm not a huge fan of the mechanics or the theme. However, the verdict is still out. I am willing to play it a few more times to see if something changes. I just haven't had the opportunity to put together a 4-5 person game and see yet. Therefore this review is tentative and I acknowledge that the majority of gamers really like this game. I just find it to be average at best.

Kind of torn on this one. I like the idea of it and there are some good and interesting mechanics. The co-op/hidden traitor balance doesn't feel quite right, though. There's not much balance between the various hidden roles, some are too easy, some too hard, and that throws things off.

This was a recent addition to the collection, and I/we loved it.  Given the content, this is really only for play with my gaming group, but it has gone over very well.  Love the semi-cooperative nature of the game ('You're with us right?  Not a traitor?!?) that is bursting with theme.  The game was a little intimidating to new players because of the number of components, but its beautiful when played.

A solid contender to BSG in the traitor game category. I feel like you have to use the betrayer variant to make it really interesting but even without a traitor it's a solid co-op. I like how the hidden objectives force you to be selfish at times and prevent quarterbacking. It adds spice to the game even when you don't have a traitor. The crossroads cards are also a brilliant mechanic but can slow the game down a little. Another minor criticism is the difficultly can be a little swingy.

Played 1 game - and never has a game gone over so badly.
Two guys were just complaining throughout the game. The game either being too complex, fiddly, had too much downtime or had too much reading.
I really don't know whether I like the game or not. I'd be open to play it again, with someone who doesn't complain

2nd play: Definitely better then first time around, but the game is just too random. We lost the game due to one bad die roll - we had a good chance of winning otherwise. Not my kind of game

RATING: 8
Dripping with theme. Each time I play tells a new interesting story. There are some pretty wild swings of luck, so sometimes the scenario will be a cakewalk or totally destroy us, but players always have a choice in how things play out. Overall, I love the way this game inspires suspense. A rare occurrence where a games quirks/"flaws" can actually enhance the gaming experience. Possibly brilliant.

RATING: 6
The theme is nice, the painted cardboard charecter is way better than Mini. The overall gameplay is nice but a bit slow.

The downtime is very strong with this one, and the Traitor mechanic is not that strong due to everybody's secret objective. 

also some text to read might be a problem for some ppl.
espacialy a crossroad card.

looking forward to play this as pure Coop game

reason to sell: I like the way this game look, but I don't want to play it. better save up for other game

RATING: 9.5
Played two times so far, and both left us exhausted in the best possible way. The theme really comes through. I'm not even a big fan of zombie-centric pop culture, but the tension and story kept me engaged. I like the Crossroads mechanism quite a bit, though my group kept forgetting to draw the cards.

My only complaint so far is that even the short scenarios are pretty long--although I'm sure play time will shorten a bit as we grow more familiar with the game.

**Edited to add: I've played it a few more times now, and wow, this game is amazing. A day or two after you play it you find yourself telling each other the story of what happened--who tragically died too soon, who took a foolish risk and got someone killed, who turned into a ninja badass with a sniper rifle. Takes a bit of time to teach, but totally worth it. Leaves people itching to play again.**

RATING: 9
I'm not a huge "Zombie" guy, and I don't watch "The walking dead", but I like this game quite a lot.

What I like about this game :

- the crossroads cards add tremendous amounts of theme and there are a ton of them.  They can be highly specific so some don't often get used, but when they do its so immersive.  I love it when someone is taking there turn and the player to their right says, "hold up one moment".

- Great component quality.  The art is good, the thick cardboard stand ups are fun and make the game look appealing.

- the ability to customize it so there is a "no traitor" version of the game.  Personally, I think the traitor mechanic is fun - and typically we play it that way.  However, my wife is not a fan of traitor mechanics in games.  The ability to flip the objective card to the "hard" side and not use the traitor was genius.  It will totally allow me to play this game with her that otherwise I liekly wouldn't be able to.

- in the same vein, it's nice the creators made a symbol on the crossroads cards that indicate some of the more "adult themed" cards.  If you are playing with a 12 year old, it lets you as a parent easily find the cards that you might feel uncomfortable playing with and remove them.  Since there are so many crossroads cards, you won't miss them much.  That being said, I *do* often play with a 12 year old and I haven't come across any cards I find problematic so we use them all.  Still, nice to have options for other folks.

As far as negatives go, I don't have any stand out issues with this game so far.  I will update if I find any as I continue to play the game.

First play seemed to suggest there was more that we weren't seeing.  Second play didn't do anything for me at all.  I hate that a traitor will run your game into the ground just so that you don't win - one of my least liked mechanics.

It lives up to the hype. It's seriously fun. My one complaint is that it's too easy for multiple people to win, but this is after just one playthrough. Still super fun. Feels like it's very rule-heavy at first, but once you get into it, it's actually very approachable. All the rules make sense. Definitely tense, and seriously fun. Also the first (and for now, the only) game that I made a custom insert for, because this game has a TON of pieces, and I wanted a better way to organize them other than plastic bags.

The exposure die really bogs this game down for me.  So much so that I don't think I'll ever suggest this game.  I've had games where 3 of the first 5 rolls were a bite.  It's so stupid and I can't figure out how people like deterministic dice rolls like that.  So.  Stupid.

The ONLY reason this game isn't a 4 for me is because everything else about the game is solid.  I hate the exposure dice that much!

Snooze. This game virtually plays itself and has a lot of bookkeeping, downtime and randomness.

Move somewhere and do something obvious *then wait for your next turn*. Stay stationary and do something obvious *then wait for your next turn*. Discover a medikit, so share it with a player who has injury tokens *then wait for your next turn*. Etc etc.

After four plays, I'm dropping its score from 6 to 5.

Table conversation seems to be 95% dull checking (i.e. "Between us, do we now have all items we need in our hands?") and only 5% interesting deduction etc. One player may dominate.

Its two main innovations do add 'spice' to the game but detract from it in other ways:
- The crossroad cards and other cards add flavour but also add many interruptions while text is being read.
- Hidden player objectives for all players, in addition to a possible traitor, should be cool. But they add too much fog/noise, almost reducing the hunt for a traitor to guesswork. The way turn order changes means a traitor usually just waits until they get two turns in a row and saboutages things at that point.

The similar, older Battlestar Galactica game has a more satisfying/deductive 'find the traitor' mechanism (provided you have a good memory for who's played what cards). I'm surprised Dead of Winter seems more popular.

Quite a hard cooperative game, with both a traitor and egoistic goals mechanism. I think the traitor is superfluous (since the game is quite hard anyway), but this individual, egoistic goals are a good twist on the usual coop approach. 

However, the gameplay is rather pedestrian. The crossroads mechanism is also quite boring and I do not know why this random event mechanisms is a hit to so many people. Random events were already more engaging in Starfarers Catan.

Excellent Co-Op game.  Never knowing if there is a traitor or no heightens the game play.  Quick to pick up even though there are a lot of pieces.  Game length varies by the main goal and how long it takes people to make decisions. The Crossroad cards offer a great variable to the game with some fun decision making. For example you may have to decide to take a new person in even though it's going to cost you more food, or leave them to their fate.  Excellent choice for those who like "Zombies" or "Co-Op"

Just got this one to the table for the first time.  The first two plays were quite excellent.  Three player game crushed the intro scenario, and then a five player game we got hammered.

It's a very good integration of theme and mechanics, and the individual goals make the game work.  They provide a nice question about whether or not players are sandbagging to blow things up, or just trying to accomplish their private goals.

Good fun.  I like it.  My rating may improve with further plays.

(05/28/2016) - [7] - All things considered, Dead of Winter is an enjoyable game. I'm not sold on the crossroads mechanic, and the tension is not nearly as high as games of Battlestar Galatica. The individual objectives sound great in theory, but end up being so overly specific that finding the betrayer is lost in the shuffle.

Fantastic game that offers a variety of scenarios to suit play time, anywhere from 45 minutes to hours of gaming.

The game is easy to teach in a short time, and with a few organizers, is quick to set up and put away.

Even better if you pick up a pack of Zombicide's extra zombie minis for it.

The only downside to the game is that the default setup always has the chance for a traitor, but the chance can be rather slim, especially in a 5 player game, with 10 standard objectives mixed in with the single chance for a traitor. We've started playing with the standard setup - 3 or 4 non-traitor cards for a game with more paranoia and excitement.

I should like this game.

It does have solid mechanics and the materials quality is pretty good - both big pluses.

It's co-op, which I'm fine with playing. It has resource management, which I love. It has figures (card, but still) which I like. It has a possible traitor element, which I normally revel in.

Yet, there's something I really just don't like with this game. I can normally give a much better justification as to why I mark down a game, but I can't with this one - I just don't like it.

As regras assustam no início, mas uma vez aprendido, o jogo é até bem simples. Os maiores problemas são: 1. muito fácil (talvez apenas a missão inicial seja fácil assim, depois melhora) e 2. em nenhum momento me vi confrontado com alguma decisão difícil. Outro problema, mas aí é só meu, é ser cooperativo. Não gosto de jogos em que a estratégia é toda formulada em conjunto.

I'm not sure the game is as amazing as some AT gamers make it to be, but it is decent.

I can't say much more about this that has not already been said. It was a long-time favorite co-op game, the theme of which I do not care for, but it was certainly well-executed. There are now more suitable cooperative games for me. The traitor mechanism is a little underbaked, as well. They either swipe the win from unwary players, or have no chance at all to do so due to extreme precautions made by a strong team.

Sadly, one of my friends pegged me as the traitor, which was correct, even before we did anything in the game. It made it hard to fully enjoy playing when my actions specifically were being monitored over everyone else for no reason.

Awesome coop, best zombie game. Lots of options. Almost an RPG in a box.

RATING: 5
the semi-coop nature is very interesting, and the crossroads deck adds thematic and interesting choices.  The balance between character goal cards leaves a lot to be desired, and it's a much less interesting game when few crossroads cards trigger.  So, the game is very interesting but seems to have a rapidly diminishing fun factor.

RATING: 9
This is a great game! I realize it won't be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. As other people stated the zombie theme is secondary to the game plot. The flow of the game is great and the tension is palatable. The greatest thing is the crossroads mechanic when you just don't know if it will be triggered or not which adds to the tension and the story when it does.

Don't have the words for this game. So thematic, so engaging, so many things to cheer for each game. The possibility of having a traitor at each turn makes the game tense...

02-12-2014. Sold after 7 plays. Dead of Winter remained mixed. Some games I loved, some games fell a little flat. Ultimately, I noticed that I got a bit bummed out by the game. I still like it and would play it, but I am not running around in circles thinking the game is fantastic. I think I like the Cylon hunting in BSG or Resistance better.

06-09-2014. Rated after 3 plays. Dead of Winter is the little brother of Battlestar Galactica and Tales of Arabian Nights. Situated in a zombie-environment you play a bunch of characters trying to survive a zombie-holocaust, while coming out on top yourself. DoW is a semi-cooperative game, with hidden goals and a potential traitor. 

So far, my experiences with DoW are a little mixed. When the game works, it's a great experience. But if the cooperative scenario is too easy and there is no traitor, the game feels a little meek. There is no BSG like tension of knowing there is a cylon, and if the cooperative game doesn't push you to your limits basically everyone wins a relatively tension free game.

However, when there is a traitor, it becomes a very fun game. My 8 score reflects the fun during a good game (9), to the more boring cooperative scenario with too easy characters (7). I think I'll play with X+1 cards from now on, to increase traitor chances.

My son's favorite. We never play with the traitor, which I know for many is their favorite feature, but we still find it pretty tough to win even fully cooperating.

I really enjoy this game but need to find better people to play it with. The secret goals seems to really throw people and getting them to remember it is cooperative, too, has been a challenge (even playing with no betrayer).

RATING: 2
This game has way too obvious of decisions to be made, especially if you get a hidden goal card that is pretty much not what anybody else is doing so the entire game you pretty much have to do the same action over and over and over again (I played twice, one of them was have a bunch of barricades built in the community. No one else wanted to bother, especially since I already built enough to stop zombies, so I had no choice but to build walls for my entire turn, every turn, for the entire game, in a futile manner, because I had no hope to get as many walls as were required to win).

If that weren't bad enough, the game has nothing for you to do in between turns, so if other people have more interesting things to do or a lot more survivors to control, it can take FOREVER to get back to your totally boring turn.

Then there's the Crossroads cards, which are a cool gimmicky idea, but I didn't enjoy them much in practice. When it's your turn you basically have to avoid doing any nervous tics or saying anything or scratching yourself or exclaiming out loud or...basically have any fun whatsoever... just so you can avoid triggering the card and having something bad happen to you. I get that some people might get a kick out of trying to get those to trigger, but the game is punishing enough that you don't need anyone blaming you for making it even harder because you had the nerve to cough on your turn. If they were only based on what you do in the game and not outside of it as a player, I would probably enjoy them more.

Basically it seems like the designers looked at Battlestar Galactica, thought the hidden traitor thing was cool and tried to do it with the zombie theme instead, but missed 1) the fact that even though a game of Battlestar Galactica is long, it doesn't feel like it, because you have a decision to make on every single player's turns when the crisis cards come up, so that keeps you engaged the entire time, and 2) Battlestar Galactica offers a myriad of ways that you can sabotage things as a bad guy while pretending it was the best thing you can do, between the jump choices, not helping the crisis cards, not playing the best cards in your hand, not going to the most optimal location, sending people to the brig because you 'suspect them', etc. Dead of Winter does have some of these things, but the hidden goals dictate what you're doing too much and doesn't let you be subtle in how you slowly doom the table to oblivion.

Basically, just skip this game and play the game it was inspired by instead: Battlestar Galactica. It offers a much, much better experience than this game.

Great game. I'm impressed that in a tired old genre, DoW focuses on the "survival" aspect of survival horror. Zombies are less of a threat than something to be managed. It's not a perfect ten for a few not-so-important reasons.

Breaking theme: The cards are so immersive that when you roll the event (?) die, the icon on the die roll has a much more abstract feeling than, say, drawing a card from the deck to determine a result. The rules for trading equipment cards allow a survivor in one location to trade with a survivor in a different location. The dog is able to be equipped, and is not immune to negative food effects.

Secret information: Since information is hidden, new players may trip up on various rules they need to know to achieve their objective. The DoW mechanics *can* support full coop, and perhaps rules for a full coop mode would be more helpful for new players.

Strategy: The objective we played was to search through two location decks. We didn't realize how many cards we had to search through each turn, resulting in us setting ourselves to lose the game early. Some strategy tips for the objectives would be useful to keep players from setting themselves up for failure.

It's not exactly "Heavy", but there is a bit of a learning curve, and certain mechanics are easy to overlook (i.e. Drawing/triggering crossroads cards at the appropriate time) or forget (dealing with uncommon events like exiling players, death of all a players characters, etc.). 

That being said, it's an absolute blast and has given me some of the most epic board game experiences EVER (i.e. My heart was actually racing during the last turn as we negotiated for our lives with an exiled betrayer).

RATING: 4
Ambiguous rules, a very slow pace, first move of the game hit a 1 in 12 to lose half my resources. Extremely grindy and mean-spirited - we flipped a coin to win or lose the game and lost, but realized we could have guaranteed a win by exiling one of the 4 players and forcing a loss onto them. 

Everything this game does, I think Battlestar Galactica does better, I would always play BSG over this.

This slots nicely into the semi-cooperative game spot. After a single play the concepts and mechanics were cemented into my mind and I'm certain I could teach a fresh group to play the game in 5-10 minutes. When there is no betrayer it's still a very satisfying cooperative game with great art direction. Highly recommended.

A semi-cooperative game in which one player could be a traitor. And exactly this makes everyone so paranoid even if there is no traitor. Thematically a blast: a zombie apocalypse in wintertime ... there is a lot to do and due to the different scenarios you can do it. The crossroad mechanism adds a lot of theme, although mostly nothing happens. The game is not that complex as "Battlestar Galactica" and not that thematic as "Zombicide". But it's a really good game for its own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The crossroads bit didn't blow my mind to the extent that I think it was supposed to, and no amount of obtuse and spurious comparisons to McCarthy's The Road will convince me that this is anything more than a decent hidden traitor game - all the stuff tacked on to that core focus felt unnecessary and...tacked on.
The noise mechanism was cool. The brutal die was scary/uninteresting. The fact that dying just lets you nab a new survivor felt wonky.

Very much an exciting game of determining who may or may not be the traitor and the general challenges that come with living together in a colony with zombies hoarding around. While the theme may be overused, Dead of Winter doesn't focus primarily on the zombies but rather the human interaction with the other colonists, and while the acclaimed Crossroads cards may not always activate, when they do they are generally always a treat to solve and provides that extra umph that this game has to push it towards the top.

I'm in the minority it seems in enjoying the personal goals. I think it keeps things tense and enjoyable.

I enjoy this game most when playing without the hidden traitor and just the personal goals. For when it is played with the traitor, we ignore the actual rule for passing the first player token. Downtime is not an issue for us so we do not feel a need to use a rule that is there just for that reason when double turns can so easily be taken advantage of by the traitor.

RATING: 4.5
Kinda boring... In the first round I lost both survivors because of the dice roll. I rolled the red dice 4 or 5 times during the game and 3 times I rolled the "kill tour survivor" side. Also the action dice are almost useless if you roll low value and if you have only one survivor left, you practically don't have any decisions to take. Also the downtime is huge, and the theme is very uninteresting to me.

Entertaining. For me, the balance of co-op to hidden objectives is about right. Seem to be a lot of flaky cards, which can be forgiven, but might lead to problems depending on how a group play. Some objectives far easier to achieve than others, though that's somewhat of a minor quibble - I like that exact balance wasn't considered necessary in the design, it should be possible to enjoy this without it. 

Overall, play experience can be much greater than the sum of the parts. The atmosphere generated in the game really fits the setting.

Ich bin üüüüberhaupt nicht voreingenommen (vorbestellt, GEWARTET, Gummibänder zum Farbmarkieren der Spielerfiguren bestellt, GEWARTET, gehypt!!!!!), aber mir gefällt es sogar als 2 Spieler Co-op schon sehr gut. Ähnlich Flash Point Fire Rescue (oder Robinson Crusoe, hab ich gehört) muss man sich hier schon ganz genau überlegen, wie man seine Aktionen (bzw Würfel und Sonderfähigkeiten) verwendet und kombiniert, und in welcher Reihenfolge. Dazu kommt im Spiel zu mehreren noch der potentielle Verräter, und die ganzen anderen "normalen" Verräter (die Guten und ihre secret objective), die lieber Sachen auf der Hand horten oder andere egoistische Dinge tun, als mit voller Kraft zu helfen, das wird super!
Und viel kürzer als BSG. Außerdem weiß man nicht, ob es einen Verräter gibt, aber es ist immer alles so angespannt, weil weil, es gibt bestimmt einen, wer ist es, WER??? Schnell ins Exil mit ihm! Ups, doch keiner?

This is a pretty hard game to comment on because it does so many things right and so many things wrong. Ultimately it doesn't work as a game, or at least as an appealing game. The traitor mechanism is executed terribly. There's no room for clever sabotage. You can't drill holes in the damn, you can only blow it up. You rarely even need to though. The game is pretty difficult as is, if you just don't do your best, that'll probably be enough for the players to lose.

I played the base game after I played [b]Dead of Winter: The Long Night[/b] and I was actually mildly disappointed - I didn't realize it would be the exact same game without any of the cool modules... so there's almost no reason to get the base game other than the objectives, characters, and cross roads which are different.

The game is great regardless, but [b]Dead of Winter: The Long Night[/b] was a huge step up and made the base game obsolete (unless you need just the different cards).

My intro game was 4 person game with 1 person who was teaching the game to the rest of us. Liked a lot of mechanics and theme. Unfortunately, it became a rich getting richer scenario when the experienced player ended up with 11+ characters, lots of equipment, and lots of supplies, and lots of action points. The only way to possibly win was that for that player to continue helping...and of course he had a couple questionable moves. It came done to resolving the crisis then surviving some noise rolls. The crisis was sabotaged. There was no possible way of completing the objective without that player's characters, so exiling would not have helped. Enjoyed the game, but reserving a higher rating until a few more plays.

Ugh. I like this game. But it really does have some serious problems. 

 Roll high. Sure, you can spend food to increase it, but that's not very viable. So it's right back to "You better roll high!"

 Getting the traitor is a cakewalk (at least in my limited experience). The game is already very, very tough. In our first game the traitor didn't have to do anything and we just offed ourselves. In our game last night there was no traitor, but if there were, he wouldn't have had to do anything, either. Even if the good guys are winning, it's so easy to tank things--and holy crap, when you have two turns in a row you can wreck the joint. 

 On a related note, the secret objectives are just insanely unbalanced. Some are tough. Some are easy. Some are almost guaranteed to happen just through normal gameplay. Congrats if you happened to draw that one. You don't have to work as hard as other players. Well done. 

 The gameplay is kind of monotonous. Move-->roll-->hope. Kill-->roll-->hope. If you roll low, get ready to build some barricades and take out the garbage a lot. Adventure!

I still have fun when I play it, and I like the Crossroads cards a lot. It's fun and flawed. 

I'm excited to see the system in space. I hope they fix the problems and don't just do Dead of Space.

These days, zombies are the it thing for thematic games. It's either zombies or Lovecraft lore. 

This game is different, zombies are there and scary as hell but not the driving factor. The protagonists are the other players at your table. One could be a traitor and want the game to tank. Always look at what everyone is doing closely , that's a pro tip.

Can I even classify this as a game? I think it's a social experiment/experience. It's beautifully crafted with the crossroads cards, every game is a different story. 

Go play it now, before the zombies get you.

Cool game. I love the crossroads mechanic. But still a little on the fence with it, because the first two games were pretty one sided. First game there was no traitor and we won by a mile. Second game the was a traitor an we got beaten down so fast the traitor didn't even got the chance to win his secret objective. 
Third game no hidden traitor, but a very interesting outcome: Had the chance to finish the main objective, but since nobody except for one person needed one more round to complete our secret objectives, so we played one more round and lost because the morale went down to zero.

Incredibly fun game. Have only played with traitor but like the concept that you can do a co-op only variant with a harder difficulty if that is what group prefers. 
I prefer this over BSG as it scratches the same itch and I like this theme more.

Amazing thematic game, I love the flavour text of the Crossroads cards (and the idea of them in general). The different locations really give you a feel of searching through a gas station/school/grocery store to find the items you need. Still haven't played with a betrayer yet, and I feel like that'll be essential to determining a rating for this game, so I'm holding off until I've had that experience. Without that, it's still at least a solid 9 from me. Edit: played with a betrayer a few times now, and especially the most recent time was pretty awesome - multiple exiles, betrayer, etc. So good!

Debo reconocer que no soy fan de los juegos con mecánica de traidor, pero sí me encantan los juegos cooperativos.

Este Dead of Winter me ha encantado, me ha gustado mucho la mecánica de objetivos personales aparte del común, me han gustado los personajes, y sus geniales habilidades, los objetos, la interacción, las cartas de encrucijada. Y sobre todo, que el juego no acaba cuando a partida termina, sino que esa sensación de haber vivido una historia lleva a la necesidad de comentar con los compañeros las sensaciones y los devenires de la partida.

Quizá la duración se excede un punto más de lo que yo esperaba, pero para nada la partida se hace larga. Un gran juego.

RATING: 10
I've played this game about two times and both times created a sincere sense of dread amongst those who were involved.

Thematically, this game strikes all points true. Crisis cards add flavor to an already tense and harsh environment. Little bits of story-telling that give good or bad outcomes.

Mechanically this game could use some work, but I still love it. I like the action die concept, and rolling for exposure after most combat, however just simply removing a die and a zombie and then just rolling to see if you get hit is a little lackluster, likewise instant death on overrun? Hmm. The game makes up for it with everything else.

Amazing Production, Great Deception based game, solid variants, LOVE IT. Don't listen to the bad reviews, if you're on the fence, watch some gameplay (THERES A LOT) videos to see if it's for you and your gaming group.

RATING: 4
Admirable developmental work with the cards and theme but not impressed with the design -- like Vega's other games, simply a mash-up of other games (Shadows Over Camelot, Arkham Horror, Mall of Horror) without much of its own soul. So-called mind-blowing Crossroads mechanic is simply another player reading your random encounter card beforehand and watching for the trigger... eh? What am I missing?

Its central idea, making everybody 'Cylon Leaders' with a selfish objective in addition to a secret one, sounds good in theory but is flawed in implementation. If I'm loyal but not achieving my secret objective, what stops me from becoming a kingsmaker? What stops us from Exiling somebody near the end of the game (heck, after he's taken his last action in the game) and giving him no time to complete his new objective?

Exposure die is tedious (and derivative of Shadows Over Camelot: Merlin's Company), and as in City of Remnants and Bioshock, I don't like the same random events determined by a die roll ad nauseum.

For its dedication to theme, I find the instant teleportation of items found and received between members of my group awkwardly dissonant.

2+2

With zombie games getting done left, right, and center, this one takes a lot of the focus away from the zombies and places it on the mechanics.  I like how some, all, or none of the players can win and the crisis cards really make the possibility of a traitor come to life.  The crossroads mechanic is one of my favorite mechanics.  I think that the personal goals can be a bit easy to accomplish and I would really like a higher potential for a traitor.  The traitor mechanic is definitely one that walks a thin line - it either can work splendidly or fail miserably.  Really good stuff and one that I'd be happy to play again any time!

The amount of setup and teaching time involved in getting this game going tends to drag it down before it can even get rolling. The number of options available at any given time can trigger AP in newer players. Far more enjoyable with players who are less victory-focused and more into an RPG-style experience.

The crossroads cards as well as the entire game setup make for a very good thematic game. Not knowing if a betrayer is in out midst makes that everybody is keeping an eye out for what the others are doing, increasing player interaction while its someone else his turn.

OMG the zombies are coming.  This game brings my love for zombies to life.  There are so many different variations to the game that I doubt we will ever have the same experience twice.  The movement of the characters and the different special abilities allow for so many things to go right or wrong.  I also like the fact that there can be a traitor in the camp.  Probably, because I was able to win a game as the traitor.  The rules are a bit difficult to understand but after watching a couple walk through and doing one myself I found the mechanics pretty simple.

This game becomes complex very quickly. I love the duality of the cooperative and individual goals though. The first time I played it (I'm sure I'll play again), we lost as a team, but our friend who owns the game won because he was a traitor-type character. Best for older teens and adults. My 13 year old daughter struggled a bit to keep up.

I really want to like this game, but it total ruined by a few factors. The fact that you can go from several super healthy dudes to none so quickly  a poor design decision in my opinion. It's like the difference between the original zombicide and zombicide black plague. The original zombicide you are too fragile just like in this game. You can go from winning to losing too dramatically without any poor choices being made. You can still make a tough game without the silly dramatic swing that are out of your control. This is a prime example of a game that sacrificed mechanics at certain points for the purpose of theme. I don't appreciate the compromise. The are several things I still really like about the game, so my rating would probably be lower otherwise.

RATING: 8
Ok, so here are my first impression thoughts after 2 initial plays (both 4 players).

Good:
1.  Unique cooperate experience.  Feel a bit like Eldritch Horror, but tighter and not as drawn out.  More interesting that the typical "put out fires" coop game.
2.  Thematic, with a nice dose of role-playing.  I love the characters and all their unique powers.
3.  Lots of variety in scenarios, difficulty, and length of game.
4.  Traitor mechanic does provide a fun layer of constant tension and suspicion.
5.  The exposure die is hilarious.  
6.  This is a fun game.  Period.  People around the table are consistently smiling.

Bad:
1.  I really only see this being excellent with 4 players.  3 wouldn't be enough to provide a real feeling of a "group" (esp. with 1 traitor), and 5 would be too much down-time.
2.  When there's no traitor, the basic scenarios feel pretty easy.  However, if there's a traitor in your game, then a "hardcore" scenario is going to be near impossible.  So, I suspect my favorite way to play will be to"
   - boost the chances of there being a traitor
   - use a "moderate" difficulty level, in between easy and hardcore

I received this game in trade and I'm really happy I did. I've only played it once as a 2-player game and I suspect we did not follow all of the rules for a 2-player variant.

Dead boring more like. Players manage characters caught in a zombie outbreak...in winter.

Later on betrayal mechanics, secret objectives, limited resources, zombie hordes etc. 

The game is a snore fest. There's no real tension as players just essentially take their turns and have to twiddle their thumbs till their next turn.

There are many other co-op games I'd pick over there.

You know something is off when a gamer walks over to see what you're playing (Dead of Winter) and politely declines saying, 'I've played it thanks'.

RATING: 9
Appearance: 9/10
Mechanics: 7/10
Clarity: 7/10
Pieces: A lot

Dead of Winter is what I like to call a "Nothing Else" game. When that board hits the table, the TV is cut off, cell phones are put on vibrate and all the lights except the one illuminating the table are turned off. In my experience, this is NOT a game you break out during a rowdy party because it takes all your mental capacity just to survive, let alone actually win.

The art and pieces are gorgeous, the only thing i didn't like is the plastic pieces that hold up the standees. If you're too rough combining them, you can damage your standee.

The only thing about the mechanics I don't like is that you'll have a hard time completing the objective with consistently bad dice rolls, but the bright side is that there is no such thing as a completely worthless roll and the slack can be picked up by your fellow survivors

The rulebook is pretty clear, but every now and then some confusion arises about how the order of events should trigger and how some items found work.

I do highly suggest that you buy or make foam board trays to hold and separate you cards and pieces. Using baggies and rubber bands is very time consuming when setting up/breaking down.

Overall, I would call this game a must have.

I explain this to people as "The Walking Dead" the boardgame. It's more about the people and their stories in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and less about the zombies.

I always play full co-op, as I find the game too difficult to win even without a traitor sabotaging the game.

Non-gamers can pick up the game pretty easily if they're interested in the theme, as there's only a few actions that are really used all the time. I take care of all the game management phases so they aren't overwhelmed.

I held off on this one for a long time. Read every critical review I could and convinced myself several times that, even though I like co-ops and hidden role games and am fine with zombies, this one wasn't going to work. Bought it on a whim and am really glad I did. While I understand some of the naysayer's issues - and I have a couple of my own - no game is perfect. But, for my money, this one is pretty close and it gets the important things right. Strengths and weaknesses have been debated and listed by smarter and more eloquent people than I, but the biggest reason I have this as my highest rated game is this: to date I've played 7 games and I can distinctly, vividly and fondly remember key tense moments or conversations from every game - win or lose. That's what the hobby is all about for me and my friends and family, and I expect that this game will continue to make that kind of indelible impact for a long time.

[i]BSG Killer? Don't Make Me Laugh[/i]

Reduced rating because I'm pretty convinced the game is broken by the traitor mechanic. Basically when the game winds to a close things get tenser, as most games like this do. There are different ways you can lose. So when there is a traitor he can really wreck house with a decisive reveal move at the very end of the game when you are inevitably close to death but don't have enough time to reverse his maneuvers.

So you really NEED to find the traitor and exile him. Games like BSG make this no problemo because if the traitor plays too "sneaky" (pro human) then he will put humans too far ahead and have trouble winning... so signals start getting thrown out and alert humans will finger the traitor.

Problem with Dead of Winter? The traitor doesn't need to do anything fishy at all. He can just play like a human until he sees an opportunity to kill you at the end of the game.

Also near end of game you might have incentive to exile a random player, to hopefully catch traitor and to reduce requirements for Crisis. That player is screwed because he won';t have enough time to complete his objective.

Finally, for all the talk of supposed immersive theme, there sure are a lot of weird things in this game. Why does my character want to have 3 food? Maybe I can justify that with my imagination, but why does he "lose the game" if he doesn't have it when he completes his other objective? How do I teleport items across the map to give them to other players? Why are some humans so willing to sacrifice themselves to stop the spread of the plague? Why do I not care when my less useful characters die, even wanting them to die sometimes? Etc.

To pile on the complaints: Lack of artwork is a shame, this game is a co-op with fairly obvious decisions, none of the mechanics really feel tight or well developed, has some of BSG's problems with secrecy rules but isn't as good to make you want to ignore them, downtime is problematic with higher player counts, and more.

To the game's credit, it does do story-telling fairly well, with the most card-based flavor text I've seen since Android. Design rating would be lower otherwise.

When this game first released, I was incredibly excited about the concept. So much so that I jumped in with both feet and pre-ordered it directly from the publisher. And then I played it. It's a decent game, but one that I find quite tedious. The mechanisms are extremely disappointing and as a cooperative game, it's a mess. However, there is fun to be had by increasing the chances for a Betrayer. In that sense, it works quite well alongside games like BSG. Additionally, you need an understanding group for this game as it is quite prone to one player tanking if they realize that they can't win. It's not a great design, but it has some moments. Unfortunately, those moments aren't enough to warrant a spot on the shelf.

basically no interaction with each player beside very very few trade of equipment, a lot of the secretive objective seem way too random to even try to do them, because you don't have the effect you want when you want.
the big random may effect a lot of your chance of winning, getting 3 character kill by the 1/12th chance of instant death of the being bitten, meh!
the zombie seem tacked on and doesn't do much, they are forced action to not be instantly killed by them

Depends on some randomness and who you are playing with, Can be tense and exciting or boring and uneventful. I got tire of it after around 15 plays. I believe betrayer variant is a must because pure co-op is a cakewalk most of the time.

Absolutely love this game! I think it captures what a zombie outbreak could be like and what folks would do during it. After we finished, we all wanted to play again immediately, but it was a bit too late.

I don't think this game is for everyone (zombies are over done, and it's not a combat game), but I think it captures the tension of what that kind of life would be like quite well.

This is a fun cooperative game with a traitor in the same vein as Battlestar Galactica. Great components and art, and the theme shines through and makes great sense with the mechanics. Games can be very short or very long. There is too much down time unfortunately.

Good semi-co-op, but got overplayed quite quickly and didn't work well as 2-player. I enjoyed the crossroads cards and the sniper rifle - ultimately, if we ever want to play it again there are enough people wanting to play it without us needing to have.

The main thing I enjoy about Dead of Winter (after being one of the last gamers to actually get to play it) is that the repeated plays are going to be so varied.  Love the amount of characters and options available, and the crossroads mechanic is a blast.  Love that there "might" be a traitor each game.  Fantastic work.

Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first game in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world where most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game.

Semi-Coop, with (but not always) a traitor mechanic. Good feedback so far. Out in Sept/Oct in UK
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a game that I fell in love with the minute I heard the premise, but the actual gameplay has left me feeling a little cold (pun intended).

As others have pointed out, there's an optimal strategy to the game, which is to move pretty much everybody out of the colony to reduce food needs (using fuel cards to reduce exposure), keep them in a single location the entire game if possible, put up barricades every turn to prevent zombies from showing up, and don't add extra survivors to the colony.  Prioritize your personal objective over the colony objective and crisis.  When you boil it down to this strategy, your turns basically boil down to "draw a card", maybe two.  Repeat 4-5 times and see if you won or not.

The betrayer aspect is interesting in theory, but the game provides little room for a betrayer to actually do anything.  Betrayers typically will just wait until the very end to actively sabotage the game.  So the game really just boils down to: "Do you have a traitor, and if so, did you play well enough that he wasn't able to drop morale to 0?"

That all said, in reality it's unlikely that is going to play with optimal strategy in mind, so things won't go as planned.  People will act selfishly beyond their own personal goals, which will ultimately further the betrayer's agenda.

It can be a fun game if you have people really into The Walking Dead, zombies, etc, but I think the game itself falls flat theme/story aside.

Much like Robinson Crusoe, a great cooperative game that does a very good job of telling a story. I do especially like the encounter cards and how things can happen conditionally.

RATING: 7
A good game to play with friends, but I don't think the traitor/secret agenda mechanic is well implemented. I'd personally suggest this game as a pure co-op experience. 

If your survivors are better off in the colony, then your experience of the game is going to be less interesting than those who have to move around and scavenge. There is risk in moving around, yes, but there is fun to be had searching through the various resource piles in an effort to help the colony/yourself. On top of this, recruiting new survivors expands your personal ability to DO more during the game, and thus is usually exclusive to said scavenger players (as they're not prone to share their option of increasing their player agency in the game). 

There is a fun narrative at play here, and it can often feel like a desperate situation when things get worse and worse - but this is often dependent on the current crisis in play. If the same resource is needed after each card, it's possible to be exhausted by the situation. If differing resources come around, it's a lot easier to deal with. 

I have enjoyed my playthroughs of this game, and it is actually very simple to play and teach, but it's not a game I feel the need to own.

Expansions: The Long Night

A good game with a fantastic theme that works very well, but can be let down by the luck factor, particularly when its' enhanced by the traitor mechanism. If the next crossroad game can nail the balance while keeping the theme it would make me incredibly happy.

The expansion adds some cool elements, although Raxxon seemed less interesting than we felt it should be (It essentially just sucked up one persons dice every round to cancel the bad things). Not yet played the Bandits module.

It's a co-op! I'd thought, after reading the rules, that there was one winner -- the person who achieved their secret objective. Everyone else, though, seemed to view that as some kind of "super" win! Playing that way, we would have won. Playing for the individual win, though, we all lost.

Here's yet another game with too much randomness. The crossroads thing is kind of fun, I suppose, but also kind of annoying! And those damn dice rolls again! We weren't taught an important rule -- the one about spending food to add to action dice -- but even so, I doubt this would ever be my kind of game. I might play it again, though, but NOT as a full coop!

RATING: 9
-General Impressions
Dead of Winter is a co-operative boardgame with secret objectives. It is a zombie-themed game, but it's all about the players; zombies are just one of multiple challenges the players juggle and prioritize. Because of this, it's appealing to a wide variety of my friends--people who typically aren't interested in zombies enjoy the game because 1) they're given a wide variety of choices, 2) their choices matter, and 3) there are a lot of individual and group decisions and choices that happen. The interaction with people is what makes Dead of Winter fun, engaging, and re-playable--and once you throw in the betrayer card, it adds a nice trust dynamic into the game.

-What it does
Dead of Winter gives players a lot of meaningful choices and options. This is especially valuable when there are a lot of problems to solve and goals to prioritize (i.e. main objective, immediate crisis, food supply, zombie presence, and personal objectives).

This is a co-operative game, but there is a possibility of a betrayer. Players may choose whether or not to add a betrayer to the secret objectives, but doing so will add a trust dynamic to the game and can make things more challenging. There is an ability to exile a suspected betrayer, and after exile, they can still participate in the game with a different objective--very good system so all players are still active.

The crossroad cards are extremely fun in that it adds thematically to the game and gives players more unique options--which in-turn can benefit the player/team or add to the challenge. It's not a core mechanic, but is a very excellent addition to the game that makes it stand out and adds to the replayability. It also shows how much time, effort, and care Plaid Hat Games put into the production of Dead of Winter.

-Why I like it
Although it looks like a complex game with a lot of  moving parts, it was easy for me to learn and teach. I was also able to get away to teaching as we played.

I also feel like Dead of Winter takes the best parts of games i like. It's a unique addition to my game collection that I can always bring to the table.

I also like the balance of luck vs. decision making. Being able to roll action dice and plan what you can do is an excellent way to balance this and make players work together optimally as a team (or help people plan how best to take advantage of the situation for personal gain).

For the crossroad cards, my friends and I play a slight variant: We present choices like Tales of Arabian Nights where only the immediate choice is revealed and the effect is revealed subsequently to the decision. This adds an interesting moral dynamic and makes choices harder to measure and make.

RATING: 7
This is a story-driven MOSTLY cooperative game of surviving a zombie apocalypse.  The zombie theme is a little out of control in board games right now.  This is a well-designed and enjoyable game but there are other conflicts to center a survival board game around than zombies and I wish they had.

The game is played by trying to accomplish the goals of a particular scenario.  A story tidbit is read from a book to introduce you to the world and provide a little bit of atmosphere and then players take turns mitigating disasters and all the while trying to accomplish the scenario's goals.  The reason I say MOSTLY cooperative is that each player has their own secret goal as well.  In order to win you have to accomplish the goals of the scenario as well as your own secret goal.  This is a very neat concept because multiple people can win.  I like the idea of working together as a team while also having your own personal agenda that doesn't interfere with that.

There is one secret goal I'm not a fan of and that's the traitor.  Traitors in games like this don't typically work very well, often the game is already very difficult and so winning by losing is a lot easier and it puts a bit of a sour taste in some people's mouths when one person wins while everyone else loses and they're helped along by the game while everyone else is fighting against it.  This is alleviated some by the ability to exile players, like finding the traitor in Castles Over Camelot.  But again, mostly the game is going to push the players towards losing anyway so the traitor doesn't have to really advertise his evil intentions.  This is still a much better option than something like Archipelago.  The first suggestion by anyone who reads that is going to be "just don't play with that card" but I have a well-documented aversion to making house rules or removing content from games to "fix" them for the designer.  The traitor isn't a bad mechanic in theory, it works really well in Battlestar Galactica but it is an integral always-present part of that game's mechanics.  This is a possible, in my opinion tacked on addition to this game but that's enough about that.

Players progress through the game by rolling dice.  The numbers on these dice dictate what actions are possible by the one or more survivors you control.  You move around a board of locations killing zombies, finding items and weapons, and mitigating disaster to accomplish your goals.  One neat mechanic that adds to the story-driven nature of the game is on each player's turn another player draws a card from a deck that lists a trigger and one or more possible outcomes to that trigger.  If the acting player sets off that trigger then there is a story blurb to read and consequences in the game to what happened.  I like this a lot, it makes the game seem alive and really adds to the atmosphere.

I think the one thing that keeps the game from shining too brightly (other than my opinions on the traitor role) is the length.  I don't mind a long game but this definitely seems longer than it needs to be.  The game is reasonably light in terms of mechanics but there is so much to do on a turn.  Aside from the 6 or so options you have to spend your dice on there are also 8 or so things you can do for free on your turn from moving to trading cards to playing them.  Considering all your options and stepping through them each turn causes the game to drag and there is nothing for the other players to do when their turn is over but watch.

It also fills the same space as Eldritch Horror I think and while Eldritch Horror can easily take as long in total, each player takes 5 times as many turns as they do in this game so you're always doing something.  It is also a tighter game so I don't really see a need for this one but I will play it if suggested and mostly enjoy the experience.

Superb from several standpoints. As far as I know, the game is broken right now, which explains the low score: The mechanics of the betrayer creates several problematic end game scenarios (see my thread in General), mainly: the betrayer will wait until he sees an opportunity to tank the game in a single turn.

Once this issue is fixed, could even get a 10.

This game is just okay. Honestly not all that impressed by the personal goals mechanic, which can more fittingly be called the forced drama mechanic, because it basically exists to force drama in a way that doesn't feel at all natural, and also negligibly affects gameplay. Personally, I feel like the game could hold up just as well without it.

It's a great co-op/strategy game. There are so many variables that the replay value is very high. I love how one minute you think that no one is the betrayer and then near the end the betrayer reveals themselves and causes major pain. 

The only issue is that the character cardboard pieces are hard to put into the stand and some have ripped due to the pressure. 

I also purchased the organizer for the box...which is a must have due to the number of cards and pieces.

Solo play to learn mechanics. Tension/enjoyment must come from secret goals.

Like the mature story lines, and morbid humour . Not what I expected  from a Zombie themed game. 

Mechanically simple. Need to play again as not completely gripped by fear of losing as a group or there  being a traitor (there was not in 1st proper game). I think this might be quite group dependent - the narrative needs some carrying by the players.

Tremendous down time, it feels interminable with 5 players and after being start player you can wait 30 minutes to be involved. This might be mitigated by trying to suss out a traitor. However if you are sure that theeir is no traitor and everyone knows what they are doing you could go and watch Tv for 30 minutes.

smooth game play, clever mechanics  - its no BFG though.

Disappointed with this game. There is little thematic incentive to hide or achieve your hidden objective if it will potentially compromise the success of the group. Game becomes a glorified co-op at that point that takes a bit too long.

The game itself... search, search, search... that's about it.

RATING: 10
Dead of Winter is a truly great feat of cooperative game design. While I still like Battlestar Galactica, this game distills the essence of BSG while adding in a few elements to better support the theme and removing some of the chaff. The Crossroads deck is an absolutely amazing idea and I am eagerly awaiting the next game in this line. Sure, you might see the same cards every game, but when one of the rare cards triggers it will be a real treat, and it could be dozens of games before you see them all. Every mechanism in the game is well-balanced and the game takes a while before you will get it and start winning. Even then, it always feels like it's due to you learning how to better strategize and not because the game is out to get you. The players are more dangerous to themselves than the game itself at times, and this is perhaps the shining example of why I love this game so much. I thoroughly enjoy my purchase and look forward to expanding it well into the future.

RATING: 5
A little too much chance in this game and not much you can do to hedge your risk. To give you an idea, on my first couple of play throughs, my 2 characters were killed off completely. The game encourages you to LEAVE the safety of your base to gather supplies/weapons. Well... leaving the base requires you to roll for exposure, and I'm great at rolling the tooth apparently (i.e. instant death).

Down time between turns can be excruciatingly long if one or two players begins to horde survivors (i.e. adding actions). Gameplay doesn't give very many options; there's plenty to do, but typically only 1 or 2 good choices (e.g. search/draw a card, kill zombies, build barricades). The traitor mechanic feels a bit forced, sort of like a "meet too!" attempt, but had it been fully cooperative, I would've passed.

In short: This is a story game. It is a shared experience amongst the players, be it a good or bad experience, an experience nonetheless. I hate The Resistance, I just HATE it and I'd rather play this instead, even though it is pretty much the exact same game, because Dead of Winter actually tries to envelop you in the world and storyline it creates. Yeah, there isn't a lot of strategy in it, but that's not what you should be looking for here. You should be looking for a game of social interactions and illogical deductions, a game where your best friend will betray you and you can die by foolishly breaking your leg on the way to the library. It's marvelous.

That being said: I just don't play with the stupid dog.

Great semi-cooperativ game. Tention, Theme and so much fun. For me a similar feeling to Battlestar Galactica, but better because its played faster. Because the traitor is not sure and everyone has his own goals it feels really intense. You goot the possibility the roleplay, but the game is also fun without that. It just works. Also so many possibilities for expansion, waiting for these, even its not necessary because of the variety in the box.

Our games group just can't get enough of this game.  It is so well balanced, with a brilliant narrative running throughout.  The possibility of a traitor in the party ads just the right level of tension. The collaborative approach to the game is great, but not knowing who may stick a knife in to fail, or when they might do it works so well. In pretty much every game so far the game has hung in the balance right up to the last round - where on a regular basis I have had to make a call on whether I complete the main objective at the cost of my secondary, or hope that someone else completes..... It's atmospheric, tense, and a whole lot of fun!

I think the writing is kind of poor (which seems important for a theme-y game), and I don't like how much downtime there can be.  I also do not care for the way turn order is done.  I can't figure out a better way, but two turns in a row is an awfully powerful thing to get to have as a betrayer.  You can wreak enough havoc to push a lot of games over the edge before anyone can do anything about it.

I hate, loath, abhor the balance in the goal cards, with some of them being absurdly terrible, some easy, and some making no sense thematically or otherwise.  I'm interested to try the game without a betrayer on hardcore and see if I like it better.

Could it be? A zombie game that doesn't suck? YES.

I like this more than Robinson Crusoe because the players are independent and have their own motives.

Hands down, the best game I ever lost. I generally enjoy playing far more than winning, but most cooperative games leave me flat when they get too hard or if I lose sight of possible victory. However, this game just gripped me from the second round of the first play and hasn't let go. It balances resource scarcity with the incremental gains in a thrilling way.

Great theme play.  Game is easy to learn and play.  Mechanics very dice dependent with heavy luck factor.  Seems to be a lack of catch-up mechanism and s snowball effect.  The more characters you have, the more dice you have, which leads to more characters.  There are characters which will get the snowball rolling for you too.  Components are good - nice boards with fair artwork, thick cardboard playing pieces, plastic stands & dice (many!).  No-so durable cards with fair artwork.  Game time is dependent on the mission, ranges from about an hour to 2 hours.  Two hours may be a bit long for this game.

Very well builded semi-cooperative game filled with a zombie thema! But the true enemy is within ;)
The game is more focused on the survival of the colony and personal choices than you would expect from something containing the Z word.

Lots of cards (320+) with beautiful-themed pictures.
Sleeve them at your own risk (so much!)

Be careful, Crossroads cards have tons of text! Buy the game in your native language for best immersion in the story!

A negative point: Zombies standees have the same shape as survivors and it's difficult to distinguish them quickly on the board. I use plastic zombie standees from Zombie 15' instead for best game clarity.

After 1 play with 5 people: 

Really great game. One of the best I've played this year ( the other being Arcadia Quest.) The game is a solid resource gathering adventure game with a few twists.

The first twist is that every player has a secret agenda which impacts your decisions and adds a air of paranoia neccesary in a horror game.

The second twist is the crossroads cards. The cards are narrative choices that pop up only if the active player satisfies the condition. The preceding player draws the card and watches the active player then stops the game when the event occurs. The stories were really well written (thanks to Mr. Bistro!) And the random nature made them more exciting and immersive than a paragraph game (like tales of Arabian nights)

Really well done game. This one is going to  be a smash hit.

Succeeds in creating an atmosphere of tension and mistrust, through the simple medium of making everyone look guilty, even when there isn't a traitor. Has a number of interesting and innovative mechanics as well as good implementations of things you've seen before. And like the best zombie movies, is more about the survivors than the walking dead.

edit: better when there is a traitor.

edit2: mmm. Done with this after a couple of tortuous games that just weren't really much fun. Still like bits of it, but not the whole package.

I have two groups of friends I play games with.  The first is my wife 1v1, and then other couples.  I just don't really enjoy lying to them and do not enjoy this game.

But then I have a group of guy buddies.  I love lying to my friends! This game is revolutionary.  You sweat the whole game, trying to deduce who the traitor is. Every move your friends make is suspicious, because every turn there is a crisis that you must all work together to solve. It always seems that your friends could do more to help, but you don't really know what they have in their hands.

My favorite (semi)coop game. So thematic, especially the awesome crossroads cards. There are some very cool story elements that come to surface because of those. So tense, until you realize there's no traitor, which is what I like less. I like the uncertainty of a traitor, but not the fact that there is less than half the chance of one being in there. I probably have to try and tweak that.

Underwhelmed. That's the feeling I have about this game. Somehow, the mechanics are all interesting, but the game wasn't really exciting and offered almost nothing new compared to Battlestar Galactica, Panic Station or Defenders of the Realm. OK, the Crossroads events are a smart thing, as it involves an extra player on your turn, but otherwise...

In Panic Station, you feel more anxiety, as every time you move you deal with the traitor mechanic. Here, you simply roll a die and possibly remove a character. What fun.

The way zombies built up was ok, but it is quite predictable. Unless you are going digging for items, something that probably only is done near the end of the game to meet personal conditions and/or by the traitor to get more zombie pressure. Even then, it's always an exact 50% chance so quite predictable. In Defenders of the Realms, you won't know where it is coming. You have to react instead of mathematically predict your best chances to 'be out there'. 

The 'useless' survivor thing in the colony is nice in putting the pressure on, but the first scenario being such a wimpy condition that you cruise to victory certainly doesn't help in feeling any of it.

And finally, the 'hidden traitor' mechanic. I was a traitor, but literally felt nothing of the excitement I feel being a Cylon in BSG. There are only two ways to effectively ruin  the game. One in putting 'wrong' cards in a check (a mechanic copied from BSG), the other being loading yourself up with survivors (putting useless ones in the colony as well) and go attack other characters at the right moment. I did and succesfully brought Morale down from 5 to 0 in one turn. Which left me wondering if a decent Traitor isn't way, way too powerfull in this game.

In BSG you KNOW there is a traitor. That ups the tension from the start, as you know somebody will make things hard for you. Also, the actions you can take are so much more varied as: do I either attack, search or move? 

Yes, in DoW you can 'clean waste' or 'barricade' as well. Big joy. Playing a game to clean out shit or prevent future events. These actions are so lacklustre (and for a traitor completely no option) that there are almost no incentives to take them other than a personal mission. I get that the waste pile shouldn't hit 10, but it just brings back memories of student home quibbles about who didn't clean out the toilet. Fun? No.

Coming to the personal missions, that is a nice touch but also these have been done before.

In the end, I fail to see why this game get so high ratings and so much anticipation. Maybe being a traitor in the first scenario (collect 12 samples) isn't just not a fun thing to be, and I would have to play more to see.
Not having the game myself and hundreds of others screaming for my attention, I doubt I will.

That all being said, it is not a bad game. Copying from great games isn't necessarily a bad thing. Guess my expectations were raised a bit too much by the hype.

Rating is provisional, as I have only played one time. We'll see about next time but I'd rather be playing BSG or Descent.

I've been able to play enough to say that this is an outstanding game that fundamentally changes every time you play. It's a difficult game to win (depending on the main objective) and has players working with, against, and/or without other players. The theme is great as well, I thought I was burnt out on all the zombie apocalypse stuff nowadays, but this game gives you the feeling of actively working to survive against the horde and other survivors. Also, while there is seemingly a lot that can go on for each individual turn, the rules are very easy to follow and the game becomes very accessible within your first play through.

I only thought this game was okay.  Maybe it would be better if I were in a different mood, but when I played this, I thought it took entirely too long and wasn't really fun.  I thought there was no reason I should work with the group because if I did, I would not be able to complete the goals why would I want to help my group, therefore, everyone in the game basically became a traitor to the group because they wouldn't work with anyone.

zombie board game with the degenerating humanity feel (you know like in "Walking Dead")
It's probably one of the better zombie games.
There can be a possible betrayer like in "Shadows over Camelot". Cool is that the personal goals can bring you near to the edge of betrayal so you might seem to others like the betrayer although you're not.

There are bigger problems in a zombie apocalypse world than bringing out the garbage. :/

Played it several times and really liked that the theme was coupled with mechanics which made a really good sense - the twenty sided die is an excellent way to keep up the suspense when moving between locations. The crossroads cards were also really clever and could set the tone, however, they quickly became old and samey. Our major issue with the game was the traitor mechanic which was sometimes fairly obvious - especially with the mass murderer goal. I would be happy, but not overly excited to play the game provided that there is no traitor in the group and we are playing one of the more challenging scenarios. Overall a good, but not excellent game.

Online commentary had me thinking I'd dislike this. Ultimately I didn't hate it, but I suspect it's more of a coincidence of the playthrough rather than a change of heart.

If the methodology here is to tell zombie stories, I think there are too many cogs in the machine. I wanted more nuance from the crossroads cards, and less chit-wrangling in the upkeep. Maybe the chit density gives the traitor more things to nudge, mechanically. But really, it seems like a traitor has limited opportunity to obscure his motive anyway: he's either going to blow the airlock, or he's never leaving his bunk.

Dead of Winter's a zombie-themed set collection game with a possible hidden traitor. I think a lot of people look at that description and get hype; I know I did. But after a couple playthroughs my reaction is now "...That's it?". The tension in the game basically comes from randomness sources -- the ordering of the items in each location, rolls of the exposure dice, and the random turn (Crossroads) and round (Crisis) events. Here's how the metagame looks to me:
  *  There's enough information on the labelling of the cards to identify the traitor if he tries to sabotage the Crisis pile with anything other than his starting items. Even if he shares a space with another person, that narrows it down to two people at best, so it becomes obvious to the other person who's lying. The game tries to help by giving everyone an objective that looks kind of strange, so you can normalize out all the collection-specific requirements on the hidden objective cards; the only effective difference is whether the player is trying to tank the group's morale. There's also the behavior of accumulating a large number of outsiders, which flags a person very quickly.
  *  So basically the hidden traitor's job is to set up as best he can for the double-turn he will get by ending a round and starting the next one as first player. He has free reign to do as much damage as possible during this time, since votes to exile will only be triggered on other peoples' turns. (Bonus style points if your first action on during the double-turn is to get someone else exiled.) May the gods help you, though, if this opportunity shows up too early.
  *  Other than hoarding cards, the traitor emits no signals during his setup, excluding the effects of "peek at someone's hand" cards. So you kind of have to ignore the potential for a traitor, except to watch for the red flags above and maybe to add an extra crisis contribution or two preemptively. In particular attacking someone before they're exiled isn't a good idea; if they die, the group still loses morale. So until the traitor reveals himself, everyone's basically just playing a set collection game and hoping not to get killed while collecting a set.

And a game goes for 2 to 3 hours? For this?

It's not a bad game, but it's long for what it is, and if you don't like the theme (admittedly I don't have any strong opinions there, but some people are very sick of zombies), the game will wear out even more quickly. I'd give it a second try before some of my other middling games, but that's as high as I'm willing to rank it.

Decided to pre-rate this even with only 2 plays as I have really enjoyed this game so far. I have only played it at 2 players in Co-Op mode and already enjoy it as much or more than my other Co-Op games which I rated highly. I'm excited to play with more players as it adds the elements to the game which are the main reason I wanted it (separate goals & potential traitor) I suspect my rating will stay the same or go up with more plays.

Il gioco riesce abbastanza bene a tematizzare, ma è in completa balia dei lanci di dadi, risultando purtroppo incontrollabile ed estremamente noioso. La durata delle partite è eccessiva per ciò che il gioco dà, le missioni di turno in turno sono tanto pese che sei costretto a fare di tutto solo per non beccarti i malus che ne derivano, per me l'esperienza di gioco ne risente negativamente perchè le scelte diventano obbligate.

I'm one of those people who used to love zombies, then with all the new zombie movies, The Walking Dead, zombie board games, etc., I zombied myself out. Zombies became annoying to me, until I saw Dead of Winter on Tabletop.

I feel that this game does zombies right. The zombies aren't really a core mechanic, they are a hazard among the many other hazards in the game. The real gameplay is the interaction between the survivors in the colony, aka the PLAYERS. And the fact that you could possibly have a traitor just adds to the game.

Bought at Boardgame Warehouse

Step One: Destroy all your other zombie games.
Step Two: Double Destroy any game with "Walking Dead" forced into the title.
Step Three: Destroy Pack away all your hidden traitor games.
Step Four: Change the title of Dead of Winter to The True Walking Dead Game. (It already has a sheriff and a character that looks like Carl)

Great Game. I mean a GREAT game. Yes, the Betrayer has a small chance of being used and an even smaller chance of winning. That is the biggest complaint I see. I think that is what drives this game.

Why this game is so good:

#1: The Hidden Agendas that make you look like you are up to something.
#2: The Exposure Die that could ruin all your plans.
#3: 30 Characters with different abilities.
#4: The Crossroad cards!
#5: There is probably not a betrayer, but maybe...

If you have not played this game...well, if you are reading this you probably have. Good luck Betrayers!

The best zombie game I've played.  It really focuses more on the survivors than just killing zombies.  The different survivors and the crossroads cards really make for interesting storytelling.  The traitor mechanism is done really well and adds a lot of tension.  I think I would 100% of the time rather play this than Shadows Over Camelot, BSG, or Zombicide.

Pure distilled chaos.
This game is dice chucking trash.  I have to assume that people are willing to play these games for the theme despite the mechanics being so terrible.  
We died on the 3rd  turn for absolutely no fault of our own and nothing interesting happened.

If "I" EVER say I don't want to play Dead of Winter, please know it's an imposter. It's co-op, but also filled with intrigue and possible backstabbing. There's story and hard decisions. My heart pounds when playing, and I love that. If a BOARD GAME can make my adrenaline rush, it is a GOOD game.

One of my all-time favorite games. It encompasses many aspects of the Zombie Apocalypse that people have come to know and love throughout various forms of media, while adding its own unique twist to many of them. The characters, scenarios, and crossroad cards deserve to be singled out as extraordinary aspects of the game, but honestly I feel as though every part of the game deserves praise (Especially the Betrayal mechanic).

RATING: 4
Dead of Winter is yet another RPG clone.  Fight the spawning zombies and make 1-2 mildly interesting decisions; repeat 'til finished.  The Crossroads cards are the only unique element here and, although they inject much-needed flavor text, they are rarely activated.  Dull.

RATING: 8
This is certainly a very good thematic game. I like the semi traitor mechanic with personal goals and a possible traitor. The crossroads mechanic is just a normal event and decision making mechanic as seen in Battlestar Galactica, so I don't get the huge excitement for this element. It still works well, though. The artwork is also a bit overhyped, but it also vonveys the theme nicely. Certainly one of the best Zombie games out there.

RATING: 9
LOVE this game so much. The difficulty is not too bad and the choices, oh man the choices. The crossroads events that happened every turn have saved me multiple times from certain defeat, but also have cost me the game. The debate between searching another time or clearing out a zombie from your location was always a fun thing. great game and lots of fun.

It's a fun game with some neat twists on the (possible) hidden traitor genre and plenty of variability to spare.  I especially like the Crossroads cards.  It does seem to lack some tension, though, since a lot of it is fairly calculable.  Plus, the actions that would achieve most secret objectives feel artificial rather than organic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
When done right, I have to admit that this game genre is one of my favorite game types. And Dead of Winter definitely gets it right. It's such an incredibly immersive experience. The artwork, the crossroad cards and the paranoia-driven interaction is drawing the players into a very desperate and desolate place. It's as if you were teleported into an episode of The Walking Dead and played alongside the cast.Better than that: you are the cast! It does not fire BSG for me. They both are great games with such a different setting and very distinct originals they are paying homage or licence fees ;-) to, that I wouldn't want to not have the choice of theme when I get the chance to bring this game type to the table again.

I actually love this game pretty much every time I play it but for some reason I just don't want to play it when I'm faced with the option of playing so many other games that I just enjoy playing more than it. The gameplay is tense and merciless, which I like in a game. The player interaction/teamwork yet simultaneous freedom to pursue your own private goal is great. The narrative and mechanics are well written and implemented even though zombies are boring to me and highly overrated and oversaturated in our culture. This is overall a great game, which deserves the love it gets, yet simply doesn't appeal to me to want to play it too often.

RATING: 4
A nice, intricate game with a lot of depth and replay potential. That said, it has some issues... Actual play tends to be/feel slow, and set up/tear down is brutally time consuming... A single playthrough is likely to take over 3 hours. Even with all the RP elements, play can feel dry and chore like. The biggest issue is difficulty can vary wildly, from so easy rolling it out is formality after awhile, to losing suddenly outside your control... Game ends often felt unsatisfying and anticlimactic. It's hard to explain because it has a lot of virtues, but it just isn't very "fun".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fascinating concept and execution, and certainly something I'd jump at the chance to play again.  That said, I don't think I'd rate it as highly as the majority of people seem to here.  Especially late in the game when resources get tight, things really start to drag -- people start really min/maxing everything, trying to consider every possibility, and then a bad roll unravels all that careful planning anyway.

I do love the "possible traitor" mechanism, and how well it goes with the individual victory conditions.  I love how the game ensures that even loyal players will have to do things at times that look bafflingly selfish, as it really keeps things lively.  

Edit: the more I'm around this the less into it I am.  Not a big zombie fan and this seems to take twice as long to play as it should.  I still think it's cool but it's not a title I want to own anymore.

Overall there's a lot to like here, but the game does have some possible issues. The co-op aspect, but you don't know who to trust, is very well done. The downside is that, as has been discussed on the forums and I've personally seen it at least once, the traitor can easily wreck the game on a single turn, without leaving any clues up to that point. In other hidden traitor games you usually have some information to help try to figure out who the traitor is, but in this game the traitor can just play as a normal colonist up until near the end of the game when he can destroy morale and win on a single turn (or even on a double turn).

It also seems like the game can be too easy if you don't have a traitor in the game, so it's just boring as a pure co-op.

Still, if the traitor doesn't wreck the game it can be a fun experience. The dice mechanic is good because even if you roll poorly you can still usually do quite a bit. The large selection of characters is also nice as each one has different stats and a special ability.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 4-5[/b]
You need at least four players for two reasons. 1. The traitor is more interesting. He can more easily blend in and sabotage the team without being as obvious. 2. You need more players competing to complete their goals.

Update: Found another issue with the game. The player objectives don't seem to be very well-balanced and you can basically lose the game early on if you have a bad objective. I had an objective to have the most characters in my party by the end of the game. Early on one of my characters died through no fault of my own, and I wasn't lucky enough to draw many of the "gain a survivor" cards. Another player had a character (the fireman) who lets him find more survivors, so he used that to gain many more characters so that he could get more dice, even though we suggested that it was bad for the group to take on that many helpless survivors. So I played the whole game knowing it was impossible for me to win. Other objectives can simply be "don't have any wounds by the end of the game" which is much easier to accomplish and is within the control of the player.

A lot to like here, but the bad outweighs the good and I'll probably be getting rid of this one eventually. So why do I give it such a high rating (a 5)? The crossroads cards can make for some memorable experiences. I still remember the time a character got addicted to drugs when they used some medicine to heal, when a maternal survivor turned against the rest of the colony because she wanted to protect the zombie children at the school, or when we found a weakened horse roaming the streets and were able to feed the colony for an extra round.

The TRUE choices you can make on your turn are minimal at best. Too often you are just left to search a pile and hope you get what you need. Additionally, a player getting tons of followers bogs down the rest of the game.

Dead of Winter has just the right combination of death, misery, hopelessness, and ridiculousness to make it a pleasing experience.  After one game, I can't say I'm impressed by the "game" aspect of Dead of Winter, but the cards, characters, and resultant player interactions were certainly memorable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Dead Of Winter is a very dark survival game where you're constantly scraping by to fulfill needs without many resources.  I liked that the zombies are more a looming threat than an actual enemy; you never fight zombies. But they build up, and if too many of them fill an area, that area becomes "overrrun", and characters die. I think our only complaint was that player downtime between turns is a bit high.  It just seemed like when it wasn't your turn, it was a long wait. Still, overall an awesome game, and we all really enjoyed it.

I like the game system. I like the Crossroads cards and the way they implement a story element. I like the art direction. I like the game a lot. I just think it needs some refinement. It took way too long and downtime is a real problem in this game. If the game was more streamlined, and downtime wasn't such an issue, this would be a smash hit.

:thumbsdown: Play time is a bit long. Further games will speed up, yes. But I rarely get second chances with my friends and family.
:thumbsdown: Down time is pretty bad. Especially at the end of the game. I think my last turn took us about 20 minutes. And I don't see this being totally abnormal. You wait a very long time between turns. This is where the game needs serious refinement.

Unfortunately, the two thumbs down it gets are two very big thumbs down. The game just slugs along at a pretty painful pace.

Theme is awesome, I enjoy the secret objectives as well as the team objectives. I like the traitor mechanic (although it depends who you play with as I know not everyone likes this). 
My only real issue with the game is how the crossroad cards are handled. I like the idea and theme of them; however they need to be re written to be:
A) Clearer on the Choices and
B) So you dont know the result.

Aug 26 play: 4/6 rounds, all medicine put into the pile for the cure, just have to survive the round and we win.  On the first player's turn, a bite spreads and ultimately leaves 4 dead.  Morale at 1, crisis sure to fail and drop us to zero.  Two player turns later, they have the option to make barricades and prevent the morale drop.  Instead, they dump out half of the camp's food, and as the rest of us are processing this insane action, the player moves to the gas station and pumps 2 rounds into Sparky's head.  Morale at zero.  He was secret betrayer, even added medicine to the goal to make us think he was good.  So many emotions...

For trade condition: mixed with The Long Night.  Threw out original box, so I can't separate.

Not quite the BSG killer as I was led to believe, but it doesn't have to be.  It brings a different flavor entirely and I enjoy it.  Some don't like the very semi-coop nature of the game can lead to some tanking the game if they can't get their private win condition.

The game is more enjoyable when you try to 'partially win'.  Ex. If you're not a betrayer, even if you can't get your private victory of say "have 3 gas and 2 food" but your other victory condition is "the colony must survive".  I would try to make sure the colony survives as a #1 priority and private victory would be #2.  The colony might not do well because I'm also going for my private victory condition, but I would never make the entire colony die just because I can't get my private victory condition.
I see it as "we all survived, but we're not all happy."

The game can be a bit long, even BSG long, but it's easier to explain and there's always something to do unlike BSG that sometimes has issues with lack of things to do.

Walking Dead the board game, less about the zombies (walkers, biters, geeks...) and more about not trusting anyone around you but at the same time having to rely on everyone to be helping.

Seriously an amazing game. I love the artwork on this game, and I like the feel of this game, the mechanics help it feel stressful for survival let alone determining if there is a traitor or not. The hidden traitor aspect was something new for myself when I played it, and I still enjoy it every time. And if you don't want to play it that way, you don't have to. The crossroads cards are great as well, additional bits of story make it more entertaining. We've actually taken to drawing two crossroads cards each turn, and if either happens you stop the turn and give the decision to the player as sometimes they don't come up at all.

My intro into the world of CoOp. An excellent game, and especially exciting for people that don't generally play boardgames. Theme is exciting enough, and the mechanics are fun. But can be a little repetitive after multiple plays, especially when not using betrayer cards.

If you look through my collection you'll notice that games with a strong narrative often get good scores from me. Dead of Winter has it in spades, and I've never had a dud game yet.

Personally, this is the ONLY zombie game anyone should ever need. It's the only one that captures the feeling of what it would be like as a survivor of the zombiepocalypse, and has a focus on the human character.

A great game, and one of my favourites.

An survival game that creates amazing stories.

I was impressed by the thematic attention to detail, though the simple co-op mechanisms didn't really convince me this is much more than a good experience. Not that sharing and participating so actively in a good story is bad just by itself, but it would help if there was actually a good co-op game under the hood as well. I'd love to play more to find out though.

Based on my only play, I was a bit underwhelmed. It has too much luck for a seemingly strategic game. There were definitely points where I made the incorrect choice (I put the good of the colony too far ahead of my own good), but I was definitely hurt by some very poor rolls. I got all of my high rolls and good searches in the early game. In the late game, I could do nothing and when I did try, I lost characters for it.

What I like: 

-Very unique game. Between crossroad cards, traitor and semi co-op with personal goals, this is unlike anything I have tried before. 
-The theme is amazing. It truly puts you in the shoes of your group. The cards paint a great picture, and the mechanics really create that feeling of struggle both with the group and with yourself. I love it.
-I like the different main objectives and characters. Its easy to imagine having to be that character in that situation and maybe even role-playing abit. The game just puts you in that mood. 

What I dislike
-You gotta play with the right group and the right midset. If all you care about is being strategic and making sure you and only you win, then this won't work. Please don't tank the game just cause you cannot win - sacrifice yourself nobly for the good of the group at least then. If you don't want story bids and role-playing-ish, then it isn't for you. 
-The downtime and playing time is abit much. The wait becomes even longer if people think they have to be extremely efficient with their actions. 
-If English isn't the first language in your country then it can be a bit rough if everyone at the table hasn't mastered that darn language

I don't consider myself a totally boardgamer, but I've played complex games. Well, for me, this is the BEST GAME I've ever played. Didn't play a game with SUCH AMOUNT OF TENSION. 

Rules are very difficult to explain to other people, they are easy to learn and at last, they are very very easy to play. Theres no victory point track, complex score rules, intrincated actions. The system is very simple (number of actions in one turn) but every action has his mechanich, very very very simple mechanich. The win conditions iare so intuitive and easy to understand, the much you are going to calculate is Moral track, that is so intuitive again (someone dies, Moral goes down one, etc) and thats the las thing you are going to calculate about points or something like that. This doesnt mean theres no mathemathical thinking in this game, because you have to have control over everything, the number of survivors, the zombies they are going to reach the School, The meal tokens, etc. But everything is like very intuitive, very themathic, very easy to learn. So themathic and intuitive.

The Traitor is the key of the game. I didnt played a game that is co-op but CAN have a traitor. And I say CAN have a traitor because is not sure there is one. Is not Battlestar Galactica, in wich you know there is surely one, or Archipiélago, in wich theres no traitor, but is not actually a co-op game, theres only some wining conditions.. THIS is a co-op game, everyone is against the game, even the traitor, but the traitor is also Against the other people, and even the normal people have their own secret objective. So you can imagine, is all about TENSION. Even when there is no traitor in the game, you have TENSION because it could be a traitor. Only the possibility of having a traitor despite it is really in game or not gives a lot of TENSION. And of course, apart from the traitor, there are lots of things to be stressed at, like zombies, crisis, hunger...

The other great thing about this game is the Crossroad cards. There are 80, and its not easy to activate them. So prepare to discover a new Crossroad card in the 10th game. This makes the definitive touch of luck, of chaos, and the touch of narrative history. Is not a role game, but with imagination this well-written cards get you inmerse, diving in the game. The decisions to make with this cards are so dificult sometimes...

Its definitivle replayable. Theres 10 differents scenarios with each scenario two levels of difficulty, so 20 base games, BUT every game you'll have different secret objective, that will change everything about your decisions, beaing the traitor a different player (or the same one, or no one), with different survivors each time each player, different crisis along the game, even the crossroad cards that appears different each game, that can even change the main objective for everyone. So prepare for a lot a lot of replayable. Even more: each game I had the sensation of a story. Theres no worker placement, theres no victory points (wich for other games is a good mechanich) but this has caracters, people you began to concern about, the secret objective affects you in a story way, and the interaction with the other players is so memorable, you will remember the games, you will remember because its like a story, but without legacy, role, written campaign or anything like that. Only playin makes this a story.

For that all, I strongly recomend this game and I give it a 10. I recomend it to people that want a not so easy game but at the same time not so super difficult and complex game. For the ones that love Zombie games, or (like me) the ones that doesnt think if the theme will be good or not but if the game is good or not.  I recommend this for the people that are looking for something VERY different. Not the typical co-op. Not the typical two teams game (everyone against one player), not the typical everyone against everyone, not the typical euro game, not the typical narrative game, not the typical action game, even not the typical suspicious game with traitor (cause it could be not traitor!!), for the ones that look a well designed rules, an excellent art and quality of components, an inmersive game, but most importantly: i would recommend this game for the ones that want a strong interaction between players but not being a party game. A strong strong interaction when everything you do affect the colony, but you have your own goals, but the colony goals are necessary , and even though there is a traitor there that you cant trust.... or mabye there isnt, and you have triggered a croosroad and you have to decide the good of your group or the good of the colony and............

Fantastic game. better for 4 people, 3 is great, five is great if the people is not impatient and if you have time. 2 is not so great, without the traitor the game is not the same.

And i finally recomend this game to those who want a lot of TENSION in the game. A lot of TENSION AND TENSION AND SUSPICIOS AND MISTRUST AND CRISIS AND SUDDEN DEATHS AND LUCK AND DECISIONS AND MORE AND MORE TENSION. :-P

10/10 Waterproof. I spilt half a cup of water onto the game, but the board and non-colony locations did not absorb the water, and the cards were sleeved. We had the tokens on another table, so they were safe. Thank you Plaid Hat. You saved me from my friend's wrath.

Lots of fun. I thought hard about whether Battlestar Galactica or Dead of Winter was a batter game, but I came to the conclusion that they are different enough from each other to be incomparable. BG has more crises and the group is definitely looking for a traitor while DOW is more of a co-op survival game where if someone makes a fishy move, you immediately exile him.

Well, the hype machine REALLY got turning on this one. I haven't seen so much love for a game in a long time. I tried to not buy into the hype, but I may have. Upon playing I like it, I really do! However, I think it is over ranked. I am a big fan of social deduction games, and this is a great one. The fact that the traitor is possible, but not a surety is terrifying. You will constantly second guess your self and accuse other team mates. It can get nasty. That is the game, though. The mechanics are rather drab though. Come for the theme, stay for the destruction of friendships.

You can feel the theme already before tha start of the game. All the mechanics are coherent with theme. The tension is always present, in every action. I love also the narrative aspects of crossroads cards: you feel the presence of imminent threats.

Games with traitor elements are some of my favourite ones. Dead of Winter is always different thanks to the Crossroads, scenarios and goals. 

This is basically "Walking Dead: The Game". Zombies act more as a backdrop to the problems the colony is facing. Love the various characters and the little bit of background you get from their crossroad cards.

Un juego muy bueno de tensión, traición y cooperación. Tiene algunos fallos como entreturnos largos o, si tienes una malísima suerte, empezar fatal el juego, pero los aspectos positivos como las cartas de encrucijada, los objetivos secretos (incluyendo los de traición) y la ambientación en general lo superan ampliamente. Edit: Jugada sucia por parte de la editora de sacar una segunda edición un año después maquillada como "expansión autojugable". Muy feo el gesto, menos mal que lo vendí.

My first impressions review in English is [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1326461/dead-winter-crossroads-game-review-q-and]here[/url].

My first impressions review in Portuguese is [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1326303/dead-winter-crossroads-game-primeiras-impressoes-f]here[/url].

The Q and A:

[b]Q - The game works thematically?[/b]
A - Yes. The crisis follow a logic in what they are, do and require, and the same is true for the things the players do (moving around, searching for resources, trying to avoid zombies, surviving the cold). The Crossroads events, though they happen unannounced, due to the conditions they have, the events will make sense: only a person in the game will do something. You won't be able to have an event in the colony if you don't have someone there, for instance. By the way, the votes, when they happen for the group, can only be given by players that have people in the colony, otherwise the discussion will happen without you (as your group is outside). A player commented that one thing he didn't find thematic was the personal objective, since no matter who you find or die, the objective remains the same. But this is clear to me: isn't really a [i]personal[/i] goal, as much as a group objective, but [i]your[/i] group. Or, if it is indeed personal, is the objective of the leader of the group (you), and you don't die or leave in the game, so the objective remains.

[b]Q - How much luck there is in the game?[/b]
A - A good deal, but is smaller than I expected. [thing=150376][/thing] has less luck built in than its colleagues like [thing=2471][/thing], [thing=113924][/thing] and [thing=29368][/thing]. Sure, you roll dice at the start of your turn and they restrain somewhat your actions, but the use of them is given, there won't be any surprises here. If I rolled a 4 and my character attacks with 3+, I will surely kill a zombie if I want to. The same if I want to search and a character has 4+ to search - I will surely find [i]something[/i]. But there is still plenty of luck - in the search you don't know what you will find, however each outside location has a chart showing which things are more likely to be found there - so, if I sent someone to the School, I know that I have a good chance of finding food and books, but a low chance of finding people. There is also chance in the Crossroads events - the conditions are arbitrary, you can't control them or prepare for them, but, at least, several of them, when they happen, give the player a choice. Also, there is luck in the objectives and crisis: sometimes you will search the whole game and won't find what you need, in others you will start the game with the objective completed (as I did in my second play: my objective required 3 medicine, and I started with three). And in some plays the crisis won't hit as hard in the very thing you want (personal or for the main objective), but others, as I mentioned above, you will want to stock food and three food crisis will turn up. Now, the main point of action of luck is in the exposure die, that you roll when a character moves or attacks a zombie. As any die worth its spurs, it is possible to pass a whole game rolling blanks, and in other (as again happened to me) you start your first turn, move a character and rolls a tooth - character dead. You have to accept this and just have fun. This is a game you must first play for the experience, not the end result.

[b]Q - And how are miniatures?[/b]
A - The game doesn't have any.

[b]Q - But I want miniatures![/b]
A - Cardboard standees will do?

[b]Q - Miniatures!!!!![/b]
A - Well, [thing=150376][/thing] comes with 30 different characters. Thirty! Imagine the cost to make 30 different moulds (even more, because you would have to make at least one more for the zombies) and the size of the box to include everything plus 60 miniatures (30 characters plus 30 zombies). And I can only wonder what the MSRP would be. What I can't even think is the hassle to look for a specific character among 30 equal color miniatures (even if it was 30 different colors). Cardboard standees do the job just fine.

[b]Q - If I don't think I will fulfill my objective, can I sink the whole game?[/b]
A - Hum, yes, yes you can. Now if you should do this is another question.

[b]Q - Should I do this?[/b]
A - Well, ok, this is indeed another question. Anyway, only you can truly judge this. Thematically I can see it going both ways. For one side, if the colony survive, your group survives, which is, I guess, a good thing. And, being loyal, I think is expected of you (and the game) that you will do your part to help. But, on the other hand, people in desperated situations do stupid things, they don't think straight, choose wrong and are paranoid. So it would really go against the theme to not help as much as you can. However, as I said, I think it would go against the spirit of the game, which is that the loyals will be, well, loyal. So, even if you group didn't win, you still survive, you beat the game, the challenge of the colony, and this is worth something right here. After the celebration is that Rick will shake the hand of someone else other than you, saying they did a fine job - maybe next time for you. For the betrayer, is expect that he won't help too much, and even disturb, confuse, when you can. Can the betrayer help the colony in the last turn, when he knows he won't fulfill his objective? I guess so. Live to fight another day and things like this. Even in the game spirit I feel it works. But if the person sees the defeat of the colony, the destruction of its Moral, as a little win, well, go for it also.

[b]Q - Can I play with green?[/b]
A - In spirit, yes, you can. In the game the players don't use color to represent them. They use characters. But some of these can indeed use more green than others. There are definitely some that go heavy on red.

[b]Q - Can I attack the others? Because, you see, I so want to attack others. Is really important to me.[/b]
A - Sure! Is indeed possible. But mind that there is a good chance for your group to be exiled shortly after.

[b]Q - Is language dependent?[/b]
A - Yes. The Crossroads cards have a lot of text; each character have text describing their special skill. Even though the game says is the person to your right that reads the Crossroads, you can have one player to read all of them (except their own, of course). But since there is a betrayer in the game, you can really ask to someone else in the table to help you read or understand something in a card, since no other player can know what cards you have.

[b]Q - Is the game long?[/b]
A - It can be. The scenarios are divided into short, medium and long. I played two medium scenarios, and the first lasted around 90 minutes, and the other around two hours.

[b]Q - Is the set up long?[/b]
A - If you compare it to [thing=31563][/thing] or [thing=15987][/thing], no. If you compare it to [thing=11][/thing] or [thing=18803][/thing], yes. It is a little faster than the one for [thing=113924][/thing], as you don't have to built the scenario.

[b]Q - Is the art cool?[/b]
A - I liked. Isn't super awesome for me, but it do its job fine and, in general, I found it to be well made, and with a good graphic design for the components.

[b]Q - Is the game complex?[/b]
A - Not much. The set of available actions isn't huge, and most of the time you will only use two: search and attack. Controlling several characters isn't too hard, because even with more dice (thus, more actions) you don't have to use everyone - the dice can be use just for one character if you want. Isaround the complexy level of is siblings in theme: [thing=113924][/thing] and [thing=29368][/thing].

[b]Q - What should I take to the zombie apocalypse?[/b]
A - A crowbar.

Intensely atmospheric. The crossroads cards add terrific flavor to a terrifying scenario. It depends on the people you play with, though, whether the game can be enjoyed. The role-playing element definitely is part of the fun. Only downside: Even the short goals can easily take upwards of one hour to play.

***Update 27th August 2015

I've moved this down to a 7 (from an 8) now.  This is because it's basically just an OK game hidden behind a great theme (and I don't like zombies!).  The theme carries this game.

Essentially it's just a game where you collect cards.  That's it.  And the mechanics of the game don't really change that.  No matter what the situation, you'll still stay in the area that offers the best odds at giving you the cards you need, and you'll just lie about why you're there if so.  Or just say it straight.  Then you'll move to the next place that gives you the items you need etc.  

It doesn't really matter what the main mission needs or the turn needs, as almost 100% of the time someone else will already be at the location that gives the best odds for that, and you moving there will just attract more zombies, so you have an excuse not to go.  And the place you're at will already offer reasonable odds as well on top of that.

Triggered Event "Crossroads" cards are meant to mix thins up, but they don't really, as they don't often fire, or do much to affect anything.  Also, the fact that you know the outcomes of any choices these cards give you before you make your choice is pretty poor.  

I don't think this game has a lifespan of much more than 5 plays (after which point, you'll be happy to play other games instead), regardless of the mission you're doing - the missions are all the same, just collecting cards...but you may have a harder time depending on which one you do.  But that's not variety.

I don't mind the traitor mechanic in this, and don't think it's a sleeper agent type affair as people say.  You can act right from the go.

I can see myself reducing this game to a 5 "average" before long, and won't be surprised to see others do the same.

***original comments:

Great semi-coop, which gets around the alpha gamer problem because you're all working for your own hidden objective as well as the groups' one.

You can also be a hidden betrayer in the group, where you want the group to fail.

Many great game mechanics, but the main issue for me is that you're basically just looking for items from several decks of cards.  There are some other objectives you can have, but quantities of items is the main gist.  

More variety would be welcome, then it'd be a 10.

Great thematic game. However it can get a bit dark and depressing or downright silly in odd times. Favoring the later.

Not a game for everyone. But if you like zombies, love hidden agendas, and can tolerate a bit of randomness this game is a must play for the experiences it offers.

This blew my mind when I got it. I had just finished a season of The Walking Dead and this game fits the atmosphere of that TV-show SOOO well. The zombies are there but the real game is between you and the other players. Are we all working together? Do we have a betrayer? Who is the betrayer? (It is always me)
Absolutely love this game. 
Looking forward on trying it with the new companion app to read the crossroad cards.

Played one game with 5 - maybe above the sweet spot player-count wise but not too bad

We played in a loud game store and it was impossible to read the cards and get into the story at all really so the gameplay suffered

One of my Characters was a dog with a hammer - now that was awesome

need to play again with voices and proper reading of cards to get a feel for how this will hold up

Definitely needs people that like story and theme over pushing cubes - I tend to like both so with the right group I think this will be good.

Did use zombie minis from a different game and that helps the cardboard standee thing

I'm not a fan of cooperative games in general, but I decided to take a chance on this one based on the acclaim it gets.  I was also intrigued by the crossroads cards, and although it's a great idea, the implementation of it here is underwhelming in my opinion.  There are a lot of cards that are extremely unlikely to happen and others that almost always happen.  The cards are supposed to create a sense of story and adventure, but all it felt like to me was randomly adding extra rules.  Gameplay is typical action selection but even that felt fiddly and overly complicated.  Although the character artwork and stands are fantastic, the rest of the presentation is meh.  I played three games with three different groups and we never even came close to completing the main objective before morale hit zero; I can't imagine what the hard objectives would be like.  I really wanted to like this game, but it just isn't for me.

First play(8-9-14); Took 2 hours with 4 players.  Went smooth once we got the rules down and we beat the scenario with 2 rounds left.  One of the few cooperative games that is a lot of fun to play and everyone has to really work together to win.  No one was the betrayer but I could see this game next to impossible to win if someone was.

RATING: 6
DoW's engaging structure, artistic design, and game flow sit on the top tier. With the apex in mind, the following comments are about the elements that drag it down from euphoric to earthly.

DoW hit all the marks for a zombie survival game but may be too easy on it's victims to be truly great.  The random events: "Crossroads* cards" do not do enough to make the lives of the living miserable.  

Let me put this into context: Zombie themed games should have less than a 50% win ratio to really be in line with the overarching theme of the genre.  But since that sells less units than a 60% win ratio then Plaid Hat decided to take the path of least resistance.

I wish the game was harder on a corrosive level, that it destroyed hope and killed favorite characters. I do not feel the urgency and dread that I do playing Dawn of the Zeds.  Never once while playing DoW did I think that the end of the world was here and I was a hopeless piece of shite floating in the mire.

I enjoyed the experience for the role playing, relaxed, coop atmosphere among typically competitive gamers.  This is a game I would play again but would not pick out of a crowd... even a crowd of zombies...


*Victory Point Games: Dawn of the Zeds, uses Fate cards far more effectively as additional random hindrances to the progress of the survivors.

Pros: best zombie apocalypse game out there. Really draws you into the feel of what a zombie apocalypse would feel like with paranoia setting in among players with the potential of the betrayer showing up. there is a constant need to balance for protecting the base and savaging for supplies and the need to sacrifice for the greater good. Or just screw someone over.

cons: even cards can be a bit tedious and difficult to understand. text on card is a bit too close together and makes it difficult to read. If a player has a bad poker face or can't hide his actions well, betrayer can be easily spotted.

Played once. May be bumped up to a 10.

I loved City of horror, however, this game may have killed that game from my collection.

Perfect balance of co-op and suspicion of others. The co-op aspect also makes the game very easy to teach to newcomers.

Also - plays quicker than I thought! Taught the game and did a full session in less than 2 hours on a "short" mission. Amazing! Set up and teaching took 45 minutes. Playing took an hour.

My first game took 4 hours...and that was after watching a game on youtube. There are a few points to the game that are poorly explained...or buried in long paragraphs in the rule book that makes it hard to find during play.

But overall it is a fun game. My biggest problem with it is I felt the creators tried to do too much. There are so many characters and pieces that, while it ensures variety and replayability, it almost detracts from the fun. It gets annoying reading encounter cards every turn and slows down the gameplay. You need an interactive group willing to banter and take risks...but it can be fun.

As a huge fan of zombie fiction even before the current zombie craze, I have to say that while this is a fine game, I'm not quite sure why there's so much hype around it. Our games are fairly cooperative, and our group's concensus is that the traitor element is either unnecessarily, rarely in play or even prohibitively difficult. The theme is strong, however. Only compliant is the flimsy pieces of paper the exterior locations are printed on

Enough story to appease the thematic crowd. Enough choices to appease the strategy crowd. Enough hidden information to appease the social deduction crowd.

Although Dead of Winter may not be perfect at all of these elements, it brings them together strongly enough to create a compelling game for all.

The zombies? That's just the visuals - this game transcends the zombie theme.

If you enjoy the zombie theme, enjoy cooperative games with a potential betrayer, and like games with a healthy amount of flavor text (Betrayal at House on the Hill), you would probably like this game.   While there is enough information on the cards from resolving the crisis each round to effectively narrow down the betrayer, it is best to have someone different (and random so it can't be planned for) each round lay down the cards, hiding the majority of that information, but displaying the card type at least.

Man, I couldn't stand this one. I'm sure it didn't help that I generally dislike Ameritrash and cooperative games, but even though I didn't have high expectations at all I still thought this was a huge disappointment. The fact that you only win if you meet your objective is problematic as sometimes the circumstances prevent you from meeting your objective so you have no incentive to help the other players win. My goal was have the most survivors and I never drew another survivor the entire time. This seems like playing Shadows over Camelot but saying that the knights only win if they also meet a specific condition, like playing the most grails or something. I honestly didn't like anything about this game. Although this sort of game play would be suitable for an RPG, this is listed as a board game so is rated as a strategy game.

I don't like cooperative games at all and this one neither. Basically in your turn you just roll dice. If they are high enough you will search for items or kill a zombie and if they are too low, you check if you can modify the result with food, if not you just empty the trash. And at the end you discard a card in order to avoid any bad scenarios for the group.
To me it was horrible to play this one especially since you have HUGE downtimes. And it is not interesting to watch the other ones play cause it does not effect your turn at all. 
I can't understand the hype for this game and I hope next time I play it I can modify my rating in the other direction

Still have yet to see competitive + co-op ever work out to be a good thing, though it at least *sort of* works here.  Traitors can hide a little bit because everyone always has the excuse 'I have to do this for my personal goal', but good players will out them easily enough or they will just lose because their goals are so difficult.

Several counter-intuitive, non-thematic plays end up being strong strategies.  Game also has the potential to proceed at a glacial pace.

Having trouble settling on a rating.  So far every game I've played has had to be a teaching game, so it's hard to really explore the game and kick back.  It really can be something special though.  Just the idea of hidden agenda's in a co-op I absolutely love.  It breeds contempt and paranoia and it's beautiful.

The gameplay can be a bit fiddly and sometimes drawn out when one person gets a ton of Survivors, especially if you are down to one survivor and can hardly do anything on your turn.  This is one of the flaws with the game I think, experiences can be very inconsistent from one game to the next depending on how the cards come out.

Players are working together toward one common victory condition — but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. Each player leads a faction of survivors, and must find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.

The most fun I've ever had in a nights gaming playing Dead of Winter...
Colony morale was low, time was short, food was low. And one of my friends was a filthy lying traitor. And a good one at that. All game long he'd been laughing in our faces. Finally, a mistake was made. He slipped up and played a card that was traceable. And trace it we did right to the Police Station, which he was the only one searching at. We all shouted at the startling revelation, and then we all lost because it was too late and the damage was done.
I've never seen the traitor mechanic done so well in a game. At one point I'd have given this game a 10, but it seems replay-ability does suffer a bit over time and it is a bit of a numbers game since you need to be aware of EXACTLY how many foods will be eaten and zombies added so you can play to those numbers specifically.
Also this is a heavy game so it's a game your group may only feel like occasionally playing.

The 2 things that really make this game great is the ever present theme and the innovative system of crossroad cards; the game system itself (as a coop with card management) is not super great but all the thematic tidings really make the game shine (secret objectives, characters personality, possibility of a traitor, etc.); 

[+] the Crossroad system! lots of characters with personality, scenario & story telling elements = very very thematic, very involving & tense game, pranoia induced by traitor mechanic; exile does not meen losing the game, sometimes it is really helpful.
[-] with 4/5p it becomes a long game; difficulty can be swingy (pure coop in normal is way too easy; a traitor in hard is way too hard for the good guys); the traitor mechanic does not work so well: the traitor just needs to wait and strike hard to tank the morale in 1 turn and there's not much you can do to prevent it... passing first player in reverse turn order is very weird (double turns)

+ Crossroads are cool, survivors are cool, dice and actions system is cool.

+ There are some interesting strategies with traitor but not that many.

- Fighting with zombies is pretty boring - you kill zombie 100% no mater what.

Lots of fun and balanced well -- not too easy, not too hard. The not-quite a traitor, but not quite altruistic, mechanic is really good.

The wrapper works really well -- I always feel cold and slightly desperate when playing this game, and it is one of the few board games in which I use a sonic background during play.  Wind sounds and zombie moans, with a backdrop of ominous music, help round out this experience.

While I'm not sure I would want to play this game on a regular basis, I did thoroughly enjoy our first play. In particular, some of the crossroads cards were quite humorous, and I had an "excellent" turn where I attempted to return to the colony, but I was bitten on my way back, and I ended up causing a chain reaction of glorious carnage among the survivors who, up to that point, had thought they were safe. And who doesn't love a dog who can wield a firearm?

The game seemed fine, but I was not really engrossed in it. Probably didn't help that I'm not interested in Zombies. It may have just been our scenario being too easy. Everybody won, no traitor and there was no tension. Decisions were obvious.

The crossroads cards is a neat idea. For us, most of the conditions were either immediately triggered or had no chance at all of being met, so it felt not as well utilized as it could have been.

IMO, The exposure die is a lame mechanism.

Didn't work with our group at all (four player and two player) with the Need more Samples scenario. There was significant downtime with multiple survivors, we couldn't discuss much to avoid giving away personal objectives, and it was too fiddly/complex for a fun traitor game.

The moral decisions/crossroad cards didn't really work for us. It seemed far too easy to make a vindictive choice - leaving children to die, etc. There didn't seem to be a real moral choice. We tried livening it up by not reading the full options - like Choose your own Adventure - but that often felt incoherent or confusing, not tense.

My current rating is based on first two playthroughs. So far I think it will work great as a shorter substitute for Battlestar Galactica (meaning: traitor mechanism, strategic planning and thematic games, also the crisis mechanism), but with a different setting, events and pace. I think it has a great potential, but I'm not sure of the final score yet. So far a "safe", solid 8, with a potential for more, will update after more playthroughs..

RATING: 6
So far not so good; I think we need to play more (currently 3 plays). Have had to refer to the rule book several times during play. Some things don't seem to make sense - eg a "2 food" card is worth 2 food to the colony needs but only 1  food to the crisis contribution. First 2 plays we got rules wrong which undoubtedly made game worse (eg we thought crisis contributions had to be one per character in play instead of per player). Also not sold on the crossroads cards - reading the story and offering the choice is great, but it feels like you should have to make the decision without having full knowledge of both outcomes; but if you played like that then the game would be even harder.
Also it plays long and we don't think we can ever play it at home on an evening again because of the playtime, which further limits it's likelihood of coming of the shelf.
We'll give it a chance...but...not sure it's for us...

RATING: 7
This is a nifty entry into the "semi-cooperative but there might be a traitor" genre. It does a nice job of forcing everyone to do things that seem a tad bit destructive, to achieve their personal win conditions. This sort of game has been explored quite a bit of late, but what makes this one special are the crossroads cards. They interject a ton of story into the game, as well as some gut wrenching decisions...especially if everyone is buying into the theme, which they should, to get the most out of it.

Like the best of zombie apocalypse fiction, the point this game tries to make is that the other people, the survivors...They are often the most dangerous monsters, not the mindless zombies. Focusing on those survivors, not the monsters, is this game's biggest strength.

I was surprised at how quickly this became mathematically predictable, and I expected much more from the crossroads cards. It's a good system, and I look forward to it in future products, however co-op games need to push far beyond the nested timer structure and betrayer dynamic as it's long past stale.

RATING: 6
A co-op game of survival in a zombie apocalypse.  Players control human characters that fight off zombies while gathering medicine, food, and tools.  The collective need is everyone's primary concern, but individual victory conditions and "crossroad" events provide more selfish opportunities.  A traitor player may randomly be included at the start of the game.  That combined with the random starting objectives, large number of available characters, random events, and die rolls makes for a very variable game where a fun narrative is spun.  But the choices in the game feel narrower than the menu of choices would suggest and there is a sameness after a while.  Be prepared for a longer game if playing with those who want to collectively discuss their moves.  An enjoyable social game even though I'm not much interested in co-op or zombies.

I'll give it to you the post-apocalyptic survival theme come through. But the game is just so flawed, without a traitor it's boring, and with one it's just waiting for him to blew up the place. It's worth it if you're really into the theme though.

You lead a faction of survivors in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world where most of humanity is either dead or diseased. A semi co-op psychological survival game. You work together toward one common victory condition, but must also each complete your own personal secret objective. One of you could be a betrayer, that works against the group. You make frequent difficult decisions that often have you deciding between what is best for the colony and what is best for you.

A fine game with a very fitting thematic flavour. I like the hidden agendas, they really spice up the experience and introduce a lot of suspense and social interaction to the game.

There was no traitor in my first game so it was really easy (too easy I'd say). I have to try it out again and see how the presence of a traitor changes the overall gameplay feel and difficulty level.

Looks great, plays great. A great game with excruciating decisions to make. Easy any intuative to play.

Some oh so painful decisions on those crossroads cards - a hoot.

A zombie game that's more about social interaction than about zombies. Our group loves the tension of trying to figure out who's crazy and who wants the group to lose. I find it pretty similar to Battlestar Galactica but it appeals to a different, broader group of people.

RATING: 7
The game CAN offer a very fun experience; I certainly had a blast, but mostly because I did a lot of research before bringing it to a table; I took very short turns, did not bother to optimize my moves, and made sure there was a betrayer (via false shuffling).

Overall, BSG is in almost every way a much better semi-coop game than DoW, except that DoW is simpler and friendlier for light gamers to enjoy.

The game feels somewhat incomplete in many ways, but the worst part is the balance. The secret mission cards aren't diverse enough, and don't scale well across different player counts or missions. It feels like the rules should include that you can win only if the rest of the players fail to guess your secret mission. It's unclear how to get around the issue of people blatantly pursuing their secret objective.

RATING: 7
thematic and story driven greatness. an experience as much as a game. anything holding it back is a bit of luck. searching areas for cards you need, and action dice flirt with disaster, but are done very well. They feel more like a challenge than a crippling force of chaos. Many actions don't care what numbers you rolled and the ones that do require a certain number you can still usually do once or twice. The location decks are balanced appropriately to theme and have their balance of items printed right on the board. If there's anything I hate it's that **** exposure die.

Since this has been all the rage since summer (currently rankes #17 overall) I naturally had to check it out. I think it's a fine game, though it is dependent on luck wheather it's rather easy, or wheather people die away because of the exposure-die. I found the story element to be nice, but not as overwhelming as everyone made it out to be. The crossroads cards are a neat thing, but: when having I choice we always picked what helped us survive, not what was moraly right. Even if I rollplayed this my characters, hardend by the apocalypse and intent on survival, would not have picked the moral thing to do. So really, in almost all of the crossroads cards you choose survival and everything else is not your concern. I personally didn't care as much for the semi-coop nature. I did not mind the traitor element. We had a traiter who was banned because he gave himself away. We won. Well, two of the three non-traitors did, because the third one was unable to fulfill his hidden objective. I told him, that I counted it as a win for him, because he did work towards the group objective with effort and even stopped crises, so why should he not win? Also, the hidden objectives are very different in difficulty. Anyways, nice game, but surely not deserving of a Top 100 spot.

RATING: 5
Very disappointing.  Thematically broken, for me, without nearly enough tension in the diplomatic/betrayal aspect of the game.  The zombies weren't terribly interesting, and the cartoonish aspects of the game (super dog?  store santa?) too much at odds with its desire to be taken seriously.  Sold it on without sadness.

Septmber 23, 2014: I liked my one play of Battlestar Galactica, but avoided playing it due to it's length, so when I heard that Dead of Winter was coming out and would play much faster, I was definitely interested, even if I preferred the theme of Battlestar. I've only played once, but there's definitely a lot of fun in this game, not necessarily knowing who's on your side and who's not. Then again, that same feeling creates a lot of frustration, so make sure you can deal with that.

March 5, 2015: The more I think about this game, the less I want to play it. It has a lot of interesting ideas, but the balance just isn't there and I'm not so staunch about balance (I love Cosmic Encounter for goodness sake). I think the worst part is that the people who have the most survivors get more survivors and the people that lose survivors get fewer survivors because they have fewer actions to search with.

Semi co-op zombie hunt. For good or for bad my group are suckers for anything zombie (Sigh). Despite all the zombie games in my closet, this is a must add.  Dead of winter does all the basic zombie stuff; complete the scenarios by going to locations, searching for items, and destroying zombies. BUT it adds another layer of depth which I love; individual player sub goals which cause a juicy conflict of interest within the main objective,  a crossroad deck that adds events in a very entertaining and exciting way through storytelling, a betrayer element which creates an immediate off balancing distrust, and a clever exile system for dealing with suspected betrayers that allows them to stay involved in the game. I also dig the noise mechanic, and the crisis resource mechanic for collecting the scenario resource which adds an unknown factor and a deduction element to ferreting out the betrayer.

This game is always so tense. Can be hard to teach newcomers sometimes, but once they start playing it all clicks into place. We've played so many games where no one wins because it's often so difficult to do your personal objective while not failing the main objective.

The cross road cards are great too and we always play them where the person has to make a choice without knowing what the actual reward/consequence is. Love it.

You can play this game short, medium or long, you can play normal or hardcore, you can play with house rules. There's so much fun to be had in this game, whether you are a newer player or a hardcore veteran gamer. 

No matter what your objective is, there are always several key moments/dice rolls in the game which are filled with so much excitement that you will surely remember and reminiscence. Crossroads cards are awesome, the characters are fun and varied and there might always be a traitor in the midst. Haven't yet tried the expansion, might get it from a sale later.

KS Backer - Arrived 21/08/2014

Solid, well produced game, but lacking in some regards in my opinion. the crossroads card doesn't really feel like a crossroads - when you know all outcomes before deciding what to do, it really doesn't seem to work. 

Also, the zombies to me seem kinda themeless - they could be wild animals, big hale stones, etc. and work just as well. 

And the frostbite/travel dice. I go out in the snow, and one of my characters can just die? wow. 

Just my opinions after a couple of games. There's no real desire on my part to get it to the table again at the moment.

I'm not a fan of Arkham, Eldrich or any of the Flying Frog games. When I saw this I was certain I'd dislike it as the style just isn't entertaining. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how streamlined and enjoyable this was and would consider picking it up. 

After a few plays, I've decided I prefer the full co-op variant. The game is already fun and doesn't need the extra gimmick. Besides, BSG does the traitor mechanic far better. Also, the game seems to really drag with more people. I vastly prefer it with 3 over 4+.

Even if you don't like zombie themes you may end up loving this game anyway, as I do. Zombies are a prominent feature but the game is really about surviving a post-apocalyptic winter with other clans of humans that you may not be able to trust, at least not entirely. And the cartoonish art and humorous elements make "Dead of Winter" more fun than scary.

There are some unique mechanics that are fun and fluid. The Crossroads cards in particular are a nice way to keep everyone involved. If your group doesn't mind a little card text reading to get into the flavor of a game, you're probably going to like this one.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I can not in good conscience recommend this game for 2 players.

I found the game simply an exercise in 'lasting it out'... not building any strength, nor gaining any ground, but just doing the same things every turn...either searching a deck, or moving a character to another spot, ect.

The crossroad cards were not effective through much of the game, and in fact felt disjointed from the game. Decisions on the crossroad cards were somewhat obvious for us both. No real drama at all.

There was little tension from the 'zombie' side of things since they were fairly easy to handle.

We had no reason to excuse the fate die. It was atrocious. Simply, "you might die, you might not" just because. 

I have not played this with more than 2 players, but my real qualm with this game is that it specifies '2-4' players right on the box, and this is really not a 2 player game in my opinion, especially sans the traitor mechanism.

Great game, however, The Longest Night is almost like an updated, expanded version that stands alone. They must be sleeved to be mixed as they use different colors for the card backs. Also the power scales are very different. Some characters just would not be worth having in the Longest Night.

While I adore the game, I would recommend just getting the Longest Night.

Review Date: May 2017

Positives: The production is beautiful, such an immersive game that captures the pressure every turn of the challenges facing the group. The crossroad cards add lovely flavour to an already good game and diversity for pleasing replay-ability. The traitor or not mechanic, whilst not unique is realised perfectly here. Co-op but with solo objectives, deliver team work and selfish goals setting all at the same time. 

Negatives: Some don''t like being a traitor and find it to hostile. Some are over the zombie end of the world theme. Some of the depth in the add on is needed for longer replay ability

Conclusion: Excellent game with a real deep immersive game style that you will remember long after the game ends. 

Score 9 if you can overcome the repeated zombie theme!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Zombies are no longer as entertaining as they used to be, and as such this may be the last zombie-themed game that I ever play.  I'm just plain burnt out.  Though if this one is really good, it will be the last one that I need anyway.  Right?

With its Crisis cards and traitor mechanic, the game is a clear offshoot of Battlestar Galactica, but I imagine that's common knowledge by now.  Thankfully, I think it's a bit shorter than BSG, depending on the scenario.

Criticisms and comments:

Having all players pre-roll their dice speeds up the game and allows for careful planning, but it also drains some of the tension from the game.

My biggest complaint, strangely, is that the flavor text doesn't appear frequently enough, but when it does it tends to be a bit too long. I also wish that players weren't aware of the possible outcomes of their Crossroads decisions, since it's more fun (Arkham Horror style) when decisions lead to unexpected and/or funny results.  That would make Dead of Winter less of a game and more of a story, however.

[i]Update:[/i]

I need to spend more time thinking about DoW, but I'm leaning towards the idea that the system is deeply screwed up. The semi-coop nature of the game, where every player - even the "good guys" - has his or her own secret agenda leads to seriously wonky behavior.

I usually find semi-coop games extremely amusing (e.g., Terra, LOTR dice-building game, Gloria Mundi) because truthfully they're social experiments that barely even count as games. The difference between Terra and DoW, though, is that DoW is a lot longer. Watching a game crash and burn after 30 minutes, to me, is pretty darn funny, but I've learned that watching the same thing happen after 2-3 hours is not much fun. Even if I'm the one causing the game to crash.

An interesting point, which has now been debated on BGG at length, is that a "good" player who can't win (i.e., their secret goal is essentially beyond reach) can tank the game in such a way that no one wins. Though this only makes sense if that player is convinced that there is no betrayer, since tanking the game otherwise could lead to "betrayer" kingmaking.

A valid justification for imploding the game in the face of certain defeat - in my opinion - is that it causes the game to end much more quickly, which in turn allows me play something else with my crazy friends.

I would probably like DoW more (as a game, not experiment) if it were genuinely an "us vs. betrayer" coop where, to win as a group, the good guys had to beat the main objective AND all good players had to achieve their secret goals. Though this would lead to all sorts of "secret information" problems, since players would simply tell each other what they needed to fulfill their secret (well, not anymore) objectives. Also, for this to work, the game would need to be fine-tuned so that the main objectives were easier to accomplish in the first place.

Anyway, I think there are numerous things that are wrong with DoW (balance, gamey play, general design), but it'll take time for me to sort them out in such a way that I can communicate them clearly.

Good game of the zombie invasion. The individual quest cards do make it more interesting than some similar games. There are lots of little things to remember but once you play a few rounds most of it makes sense.

RATING: 6.9
There is a lot of downtime when it is not your turn. It is necessary to keep each person moving quickly when they take their turn otherwise it can drag. The betrayer is the best part. So is are the crossroad cards. Role playing or hamming up the crossroad cards makes the game more fun. I played it once where the gamemaster made us come up with back stories. I have played it three times now. It is ok as far as Zombie games go. I think I like Zombicide better though. If only there was a RPG element to Zombicide and a MacGyver like function of being able to create weapons, the game would be really good.

Theme/Art:
I love both. The art is really good and the theme very immersive. It surprised me how dark the game is, some crossroads cards are really intense with cruel decisions to make.

Production quality:
No miniatures (but none needed), all standees and lots of token. The location cards could be thicker, but aside from the it's very good.

Replayability:
There are many crossroads cards, different personal goals, different team goals, different crises, etc. so replayablity should be no problem.

Depth/Difficulty:
It takes a bit to explain and to get all of it, but it's not the heaviest game I own. I weight it a 3/5.

Strategy:
Depending on you being the traitor or now you have to plan your steps. You have to avert crises, achieve your personal goal, and also achieving the team goal. And you have to kill zombies. A lot.

Luck:
There are dice involved and the crossroads cards are random and you don't know the trigger, but it's not too much dependent on luck for my taste.

Dead of Winter is a great game and depending on the mission takes between 30 and 180 minutes to play.

I really like the crossroads mechanism and the dark theme and if you like zombies, I recommend getting the game.

The only complaint I have is that during short missions one player can be lucky and do all the work while the others can't do much. But that only happened once.

RATING: 8
I love the atmosphere that this game can bring to the table. We've had some standup moments due to the exposure die, deciding the fate of characters and at one time a game even (woman needed to return to the colony for the win, but she turns zombie on us and kills another in the process dropping morale to 0).

The game requires some time dedication but I've always found that worth it. However, that does make it harder to get the game to the table in some cases.

One definite mark I have against the game is that it can sour people in tanking the game when they are unable to win themselves as a loyalist. Given that the rules say that you lose the game if you cannot meet your personal goal, people who are too focused on winning themselves sometimes justify ensuring everybody else loses as well by rationalizing it in some way ("that is what my character would do!"). It's more of a player mentality problem than really the game's fault, but as the game seems to facilitate this behavior it sours my view of the game itself a bit.

Looks more intimidating on the table than it actually is. There's some goofy rules in parts, but each player's turn is actually pretty straightforward. As it turns out, the hard missions are actually hard, we lost before round 2 was done even with some experienced players in the group. With the right group and setting, could be a fun experience.

RATING: 5
This is not really so much as game as a social activity.  As a game, I would rate this much lower.  Even as a social activity, it has a few problems.  It drags and takes much too long for what it is.  If it played faster, then it would be a lot more fun, but there is a lot of fiddling around with bits and a LOT of waiting between turns.  This is made worse by the fact that players take all of their actions at once.  Also, you kind of need to pay attention to what people are doing, to glean their real intentions.  That's tough, because it is so incredibly repetitive.  I expected a lot more space to explore, and to be surprised from time to time.  That never happens.

On the plus side, it does have a few novel mechanisms.  The traitor thing is kind of cool.  With the right group, this game could be really good.  But that is the thing with DoW which for me is at an odds with its popularity.  It just doesn't seem like it should work for every group.

Theme: I really, really expected this to evoke a feel like the "Walking Dead" show.  That never happened, not in the least.

As a game, it suffers from all of the usual problems of semi-coops, and coops in general.  If that is not your thing, DoW is not going to be that exception to the rule.  If you like social games like Werewolf or BSG, then this will likely work well for you.  So as a social activity, it's not bad.  As a game, lower my score by 1 to 2 points.

RATING: 6
Setup is annoying and I personally am not the biggest fan of cooperative games. That being said, this game does many things well. The zombies are never an acute threat, rather they represent the possibility of overwhelming enemies if left unchecked. The secret roles are usually good and make sense. But the game could be more streamlined.

RATING: 7.5
Engrossing cooperative game with potential traitor. The Crossroads deck pours theme into this game as it paints out scenarios that you must choose (typically) one of two options, much like a choose your own adventure book. I wouldn't recommend a traitor unless you're playing with 4-5. My only real grips is that after several plays, it begins to feel like the game of "go to location, mill its' deck". Still a solid game that I enjoy playing occasionally.

Very tense cooperative game set in a zombie apocalypse. Players have to survive and complete variable common goals while each player is at the same time trying to complete his secret objective, which might be betraying the rest of the group. This game is very suspenseful und the possibility of having a traitor among the players makes the communication around the table very interesting and the game a lot of fun to play.
Another thing that adds to the atmosphere of the game are the crossroads cards. The player does not know if he might be triggering the card by certain actions and therefore make certain events happen that might change the game completely.
Would definitely recommend.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First play was a bit chaotic, and the darned text on the Crossroads cards is so small we needed magnifying glasses.  If you only had to read them occasionally, it would be alright, but you have to read them constantly.  Downgraded due to that.  After a few more plays, we'll see if it is more acceptable.  I do like some of the ideas in the game, and the special secret objectives is fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I wish it had more scenarios in the box but other than that everything is pretty excellent. The crossroads system is interesting but considering how often my play group tends to forget to grab a card at the beginning of someone elses turn it's not as awesome for us as others feel it is.

RATING: 7.9
I really enjoy being the betrayer in this game. I suspect the social aspect makes it best with the full player count. It's limited as a two player game and I look forward to playing it most with 4/5.

People just don't seem to want to play this. Could be a contender for the trade pile if I can't get a game in the next 4-5 months.

I had the pleasure to play Dead of Winter at a small gaming retreat together with one of my best friends, who now owns the game. Its looks finally won me over, as the main boards, locations, and standees all look better on the table than pictures and videos do them justice.

The semi coop element breaks it for me. If I cannot win, I will certainly not help another player to get the win. In this sense you can end up with a whole bunch of people working against you completing the game's main objective. I prefer the game in full cooperative play, with the advanced side of the missions. I wish the rules told you to play this way until you master the gameplay.

A cooperative game must be difficult to win in my opinion, and Dead of Winter does a great job in this respect. This game is very difficult.

I love Dead of Winter. I love the huge amount of storytelling the game offers and the artwork is simply gorgeous. The crossroad cards are great, the atmosphere and the story just sucks you in. The possibility of a traitor adds to the tension and paranoia. You start to ask yourself why people had to make noise or why they're not cleaning up. There's small ways to sabotage the others during the game, you don't have to show them outright that there's a traitor. I actually think it's nice to have personal objectives, sometimes I think they could be a little bit more thematic, but it just shows, that everyone or every group has their own agenda, even if working together. There's not only the zombies to worry about. This game is my favourite of 2014. 


If you're into story-telling (and zombie) board games this game is a must-have.

Cool "meta-coop". Only game that truly solves the "alpha-gamer" problem that's present in coop games. The theme, although unoriginal, is well done and the exile mechanic can provide very interesting choices late game. Betrayer/crisis mechanic is a bit underdeveloped.

Really good immersion. I love the gameplay and each character feels very unique. I can feel that DoW is one of these games where I would enjoy a full co-op experience more than having a betrayer since it's so hard to win already. I would rate this game a tad higher but I would like to see if we can enjoy it to the same extend once all the missions have been played. Otherwise I like the fact you can use your poor action dice rolls to perform valuable actions. The exposure dice is really nasty!

played two games today with four players. 
wow, i like it very much, this is a great take on this secret mission, traitor, semi-coop gamestyle. i have played some others in this style but i like this the most atm. its somehow fresher, you can do more stuff even with bad dice rolls, the talking and taunting going on between players is phenomenal. the nice thing is, there is hardly a leader which commands the others for best effect as i encountred them in other coops. and! the game did pardon a completly chaotic in-charakter turn from a player. not sure if this was just this one time, but it was nice to have room for such an "outburst" without forfeiting the chance to win.

My friends who know my zombie aversion will probably be surprised at this high rating (the folks I gamed with were certainly surprised I was game to join in) but this is simply a really good co-op game which happens to use zombies as a threat.  I think having a general goal and personal goals is genius as it makes the game more tense whether the potential traitor shows up or not as everyone has at least one moment where they have to decide between losing ground on their personal goal and screwing over the colony.  The crossroads cards are pretty wordy, but I really liked the added story elements they added to the game... though I wish the results weren't read until after someone chose what they were going to do.  I know that sort of thing is there so people that have memorized the cards can't unfairly benefit... but it would be more fun not to simply be able to chose the better option for your situation.

So... its long and fiddly and gives you significant downtime... but I found the story and what other people were doing engaging enough that I didn't notice any of that.  All in all if you like co-ops... particularly find the traitor co-ops... and especially if you like post-apocalyptic survival themes... you will certainly enjoy Dead of Winter.

RATING: 8.5
This is by far my favorite co-operative game out there! Don't shy away from this game because it's a co-op. Think playing The Walking Dead on a board game. Each player starts off with two characters and other characters can be added during game play. Collect resources such as food, weapons, gadgets, and fuel to help the group and also to meet your own personal objectives. There's lots of twists and turns. There might even be a betrayer amongst the group! If you get exiled your objective changes too. Plays really great with 3-5 players. Can take anywhere from 2-3 hours to 4-5 hours if there are complications in the plot.

Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game of Horror Co-op RPG is rather simple to follow but people do tend to forget the crossroad cards, missions and their own secret missions during the heat of battle. The game is designed to fail the group specially with the Betrayal secret mission card on top of the already nearly unmanageable crisis every round. [I don't recommend to unbox and play right away with friends. The setup took the four of us over 15 minutes. By the time we are done, some of us already grew tired. And after the setup, It's very difficult to close the box flush with everything inside because the plastic stands are hard to put it on and off without bending the figurines and therefore took much space. This is the faulty design of the game itself.]

It's pretty mediocre game. The main flaw is a total absence of meaningful actions: move, search, attack, clean. That is all. Choice is almost always obvious. If you have played one game of Dead Winter then you saw every game of Dead Winter. The only redeeming feature is crossroad cards.

The only thing I didn't care for was the 'everyone wins who accomplished their objective' thing.  It wasn't bad, it just felt underwhelming when we all met our objective.  

Or maybe you could have some system of tie breakers.  most survivors, least wounds, etc'

DoW manages to paint a wonderfully believable and mature apocalypse, it's just too bad you don't get to experience it all that much. The main objective often dictates the game's direction too much IMO, while leaving little in the way of exploring the wonderful encounters and other scenarios that can happen. The main objectives can also be very unintuitive, such as sitting on the same two locations and depleting their item decks? That's not exactly what I would call "fun." Many of the main objectives can be achieved by moving all characters to where they need to be in the first round of play, then simply completing the necessary actions to win, with minor movements here and there. Many of the characters are relegated to the exact same set of tasks every round, such as the cook who can make food (and is an excellent defender of the colony as well). But this means that the player who has the cook must use 2 of their die every round just doing "upkeep," and they don't get to explore the game. At a certain point you have to wonder why that person even needs to "play" when you could have their character do what they're doing without anyone playing them at all. Without going overboard, I'll just say that DoW could do a lot more to give individual players options and make them feel like they are a part of the game, rather than making them feel like an action die drone, relegated to the same actions every round.

Fun enough and an interesting storytelling mechanic.  Suffers from the same imbalance problem that haunts Betrayal at the House on the Hill, it's just better hidden under multiple layers of mechanics.

Not helped by fun moves often being the opposite of good ones (calling is so much more powerful than killing, for one example).

Az első játékban egy aránylag könnyű küldetés mellé (zombikat kell ölnünk és mintát szerezni belőlük) még baromi erős fegyvereket is azonnal felszedtünk az első körben, így a 3. körben vége is lett a játéknak. Emellé még a DoW sava-borsát adó áruló-kártya sem került kiosztásra, így a végső értékeléshez és a játék további mélységeinek megismeréséhez elő kell majd még vennünk. Elsőre tetszik, de ha választani lehet akkor inkább Zombicide, bár tök más a kettő, nem szerencsés az összehasonlítás.

2 session with 2 players, and 5 session with 4 players.

Not recommended to play with 2 players, only if you want to learn the flow of the game. The 2 player mode is a coop game, but without a traitor it's not really exciting.

I had 1 session with 4 players, and it was really intens. We exiled the traitor on the last round, but couldn't save the colony. The traitor also didn't get his personal objective. So... We all lost :-)

I really like the suspense, nobody is to be fully trusted in the beginning. Expect alot of fingerpointing.
The "exposure" die is great, and forces you sometimes to take hard decisions: "I got bitten: Should I kill myself isntantly and be sure not to infect my fellow survivors, or should I roll again and risk to infect my fellow mates".

There's some storytelling involved, and gives extra flair to the game, but it's not the core of the game.
The Crossroadcards are part of the story telling aspect, and are easy to forget (it needs to be read before a player starts his turn).

In short: I like the game alot for 4 players, and will play it again!

I really like this game.  Playing the full version, there are so many ways to lose and win its a challenge for sure.  The individual missions (or betrayal card) has your every move scrutinized by your fellow players, and you really have to decide between your own goals and the needs of the group.  Even if you are the betrayer, your mission insures that you will need to play along most of the time to win, and sometimes force you to do things that appear counter productive to your fellow players when you are not.

Some of my thoughts on this game are in the BSG review. I love the crossroads cards, I love a lot of the theme. I love how HARD this game is. Having to complete a side objective while also working towards the main objective while ALSO working to not look like a betrayer is difficult to balance, and makes the decisions another layer of difficult. It's brutal, with a 1/12 chance one of your characters will die from doing much of anything of value. If anything, it's so difficult being the betrayer is almost too easy. I really like this game though.

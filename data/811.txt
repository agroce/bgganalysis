I remember playing this game when I was learning numbers. Played for "three of a kind" only, and I always tried to track where the little faces got mixed up. Anyways, that was a long time ago and now it just seems like a very broken game & quite boring even if fixed.

Before I realized that there was a whole board gaming world out there, Rummikub was one of the few games in my closet that would come out on family game night.  Though it's hard to imagine playing it again, it will always have a place in my heart. ;)

Most definitely a well established, classical game that pretty much anyone can play. It is essentially rummy with tiles, but with an important twist: you can re-arrange sets and runs to fit your needs. This makes the game a bit thinky - albeit not too much. So quite fun when in the right mood with the right folks.

Firm favourite in our house.  My wife's go-to game and requested almost every time we sit down to play something just the two of us.  We are pretty generous with the time we allow each other to work out our moves.  Simple observation, spacial awareness and working out/reworking  permutations.

This is... weird. If you get stuck early it is boring as all get-out to just endlessly draw tiles. And if you get a double of a color you can get screwed easily. I mean, I guess it's fine for an idle activity. Nothing special.

Simple set collection game with nice tiles. But before you pass this one by there is some real depth here. The rules that allow you to use other peoples tiles and swap things around endlessly to create some real brain burning situations. Mentally moving 20 tiles around on the table to try to make a play is not easy but pulling off one of those big moves is VERY satisfying. Neat family game.

Είναι ένα απλό παιχνίδι με tiles. Σκοπός είναι να ξεφορτωθείς πρώτος τα tiles σου κατεβάζοντας τα κάτω σε τουλάχιστον τριάδες (συνεχόμενα νούμερα με ίδιο χρώμα ή ίδια νούμερα με διαφορετικά χρώματα). Το ενδιαφέρον βρίσκεται πως όποιες κάρτες κατέβουν είναι πλέον διαθέσιμες από όλους. Μπορείς λοιπόν να αλλάξεις να πειράξεις τα πάντα αρκεί στο τέλος της γύρας σου να είναι όλα τα φύλλα σε τριάδες και πάνω.

Το παιχνίδι θα μπορούσε να παιχθεί και με 2 απλές τράπουλες αντί για τα tiles αλλά τα tiles είναι καλής ποιότητας και μπορείτε να το πάρετε μαζί σας στην παραλία. Οι κανόνες είναι απλοί και το παιχνίδι απευθύνεται σε άτομα κάθε ηλικίας. Άνετα θα το έπαιζα και με την γιαγιά μου.

Αν έχετε παρέα που γουστάρει τα χαλαρά τραπουλοπαίχνιδα (μπιρίμπα) τότε ρίξτε του μια ματιά. Εγώ προσωπικά το βρήκα πολύ ανιαρό

Not entirely sure we played it correctly, but it doesn't matter. Not too exciting, as everyone is sitting around hoping to draw one tile.

Mahjong einfach. Die eigenen Augen werden nicht besser und die Augen der Generation in der Familie, die gerne schon Romme mit Spielkarten gespielt hat, sind auch nicht mehr die Besten. Vielleicht lässt sich mit diesen XXL Steinen das Romme-Spielgefühl wieder aufleben (und damit vielleicht auch ein Hauch von Mahjong einfangen).
Beim Mahjongspielen schrecken die chinesischen Symbole und die Vielzahl der Sonderregeln neue Spieler schnell ab.

RATING: 4
fair enough game.  the rules are much simpler than they are presented too, it seems that basically any rearrangements of the board are cool as long as it ends with 3-4 tile sets or runs of at least 3 tiles.  i suppose the examples are instructive, but it could mislead people into thinking that they can only use certain maneuvers.  anyway, i'm kinda torn on whether or not it's better to just play with 2 decks of cards.  the game doesn't come with a draw bag, and the click-clack of tiles doesn't necessarily excite me.  there is something to be said for the space savings though.  played fairly well with 2.

RATING: 6
Rummikub is an interesting rummy game in that uses tiles.  I really like playing it, though I would complain that there's too much downtime in the endgame as people try to figure out how they can play all their tiles in one fell swoop.  Another complaint would be how a player can go for a long time without being able to enter the game.

Each 'game played' constitutes four rounds.  Two house rules make the game much more enjoyable (i) 1s and 13s can be joined and (ii) if a joker is part of three tiles of the same value, the joker represents either of the two unplayed colours for the purposes of exchanging the tile.  Also recommend that players can take any number of tiles up to 5 to avoid situations where thwey can't come down before another player comes out.

[b]Spiel des Jahres 1980[/b]

[i]Posted: 1/18/08, Rated: 6[/i]
{2P: 7, 3P: 6, 4P: 6}

[i]Rummikub[/i] could have been named "Rummy Tiles," or "Rummy-Jong."  It is a tile-laying game with many of the same concepts as -- you guessed it! -- [i][gameid=15878]![/i]  You must meld before you can lay off, and you are trying to create sets and runs of tiles.

In order to meld, you lay down a combination of tiles the sum of which must equal thirty points or more.  A run is three or more tiles of the same color whose values are sequential, i.e. r{3}r-r{4}r-r{5}r.  A set is three or four tiles whose values are the same, but each one must be of a different color: r{7}r-b{7}b-[color=orange]7[/color].  If you can't meld, then you draw a tile, and your turn is over.  The first part of the game can be frustrating as you draw, and draw, and draw, and draw until you have enough points to meld.

Once you have done so, then you can lay off by playing tiles onto other sets and runs.  Here things get interesting because you can "deconstruct" already-played sequences in order to rearrange them, split them, and ultimately augment them with your own tiles.  This portion of the game can lead to extreme analysis paralysis.  It's easy to think "I can play just one more tile if I rearrange all of the others!"  [i]You must play with a timer![/i]  Otherwise the game can take forever.  If you run out of time then you need to return all of the sets and runs to their original configurations.  Sometimes doing so is nearly impossible.

The game itself isn't very social, as you will want everyone else to be quiet when it's your turn.  It's only fair that you extend the same courtesy when it's not your turn.  You can try to plan your moves ahead of time, but with three or more players you can be certain the tiles you need will already have been used before your turn comes around again.  With two players, it's only [i]extremely likely[/i] to happen.

When a player places her last tile, the round is over and scoring commences.  In theory, players decide at the beginning of the game how many points must be scored in order to win, but in reality we've never played beyond one round.  [i]Rummikub[/i] is a creative approach to [i][gameid=15878][/i].  If you're a fan of the card game and its variants, then you'll probably have fun with [i]Rummikub[/i].

2/17/2014: Okay. I guess it's unfair to lower my score just because some people are assholes. I still very much enjoy playing this game with my mother when we meet for lunch. She always has some new variant that she and my brother have come up with. This really is a good casual game.

I'm actually lowering my rating on this game because of the horrible experience I had playing with the wrong people.  What some people call competitive, I am now calling abrasive.  When you think that winning a game is a sign of your intelligence, you are only going to enjoy yourself when you are winning.  That, to me, is not the best way to go into any game.

UPDATE 8/26/13: Do not play this with people who are overly competitive.  My wife and I played with some friends and they had their own house rules and I got mocked every time I referred to the rule book.  Not a fun game in those instances.  I feel that you should always play to win, but when that's the only thing that matters, it kind of takes away from the fun factor of playing a GAME.  Also, what kind of house rule lets you do three or four of a kind without unique colors?  I couldn't believe I had to argue that one.  Even after reading the rule in the book they still argued the interpretation.  Not fun to be treated like the "rule Nazi" simply because I actually UNDERSTAND the rules.  Not a couple I will be playing Rummikub with again.  That's for sure.

My wife loves this game. It's fun and strategic. It has a good enough amount of chance that it's always anybody's game. It's a perfect dinner time or before bed type of game.

Wow.  I like this game.  We used the timer as it says...it ratches up the tension.  I'm a fan of rummy games and I'm surprised I had not played this.  It can be chaotic but that doens't mean random.  The sets can change at the drop of a hat so you need to pay attention to see if it opens up anything for you.  Really, surprisingly fun!

More of an "interactive puzzle" than a game.  It seems to drag on too long. I can enjoy a hand or two of this, but that's it for me.  Unfortunately, to play to 100 points requires probably around 5 hands and that's WAY too much work.

A game I've played as a kid and now playing in the summer cottage on rainy days. Pretty good for what it is and it's great with non gamers and kids. You need to think in this game and not just draw a bunch of cards and roll a dice! However, this is also the biggest flaw of the game; it can lead to some AP, and considering the otherwise light nature of the game and the relatively short playing time, I don't like that.

I'm not a huge fan of Rummy, as I prefer the larger skill involved in playing Canasta (own hands, cannot play on others stuff) but Rummikub is a decent redux on traditional Rummy. I honestly don't understand why you would buy this game to play instead of just pulling out a deck of cards, but I would play either. In general, a purely average game, some interesting skills in breaking up the runs and such to get rid of your tiles, but nothing I would ever request.

Family favourite. Good quality components: Plastic tiles and player boards. Rules are simple so a great gateway game. Only drawback is when someone starts a hideously complicated turn, only for it to fail and have to unwind the whole thing. This always earns the victim lots of friendly abuse....perhaps that's a plus point for the game!

A solid and classic variant on rummy games.  In this one you've got to get a minimum opening meld, and then have the ability to play off other players' melds.

It adds the twist of joker tiles, which can be anything.  But if you later acquire the tile it's mimicking, then you can swap out and grab the joker.  Nasty!

Simple, light family fun.  Always worth playing more than once.

Similar to Rook this game holds a special place in my  heart and I will always love it.

Rummikub is a tile version of rummy with the twist that everyone plays on the table, and anyone can add to/manipulate any set that has been laid down.  If you manipulate the tiles, but end up having to put them back because your "plan" didn't work out, you get a penalty of losing a turn, and having to take additional tiles.  I like this game, and enjoy the mind puzzle of seeing how you can move things around on the table so you can squeeze one more of your tiles out of your tray and onto the playing field.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I really want to make Ticket To Ride type ticket cards for a more objective driven variant (longest run, All 7's, etc) then play with the 3-5 tiles face up including the draw pile. This is a game that my girlfriend enjoys so I'm going to try and Euro it up so she'll be more interested in others. :)

A good set collection race game where multiple players attempt to get rid of all their tiles. The game can suffer from AP but you just need to enforce the overlooked rules that each turn needs to be made in under 2 minutes and that any adjustment to table tiles that doesn't work out both result in drawing 3 tiles and losing your turn. Keeps the game at a sane pace.

One of may families favorite games growing up - we were big into rummy/set-collection card games.  A Spiel des Jahres winner!

Bonus for younger kids - don't have to hold a fistful of cards and the tiles are near indestructible.

Rummikub XP Mini 拉密 2-6(6)

RATING: 7
Rummikub is an excellent family game, playable by a wide range of ages. I was introduced to it by my wife's grandparents, and I was happy to be included in their family time as an early outside member of the clan. My wife and I bought our own copy and still enjoy playing it occasionally, and my 6-year-old has recently taken an interest in it, and is enjoying it, though I relax the rules quite a bit so she can concentrate on simply figuring out how to make the different sets and combinations. 

Yes, there are many variants of this type of game played with cards and colorful tiles, but the tactile element is great and I have no problem pulling this out for a few rounds. There's nothing wrong with enjoying alternate versions of your favorite rummy-type game, and I have never been bored playing this, seeing as how there are always combinations to be worked out on the table while you are waiting for your turn, and there are always rule and play conversations to be had, as well as the occasional ribbing you can dish out. Ignore any curmudgeonly low scores of this.

Expect an entire afternoon for a game if you're playing against an excellent player.  Excellent game.  I just need to find my copy of it.  Bought another copy and played it vs. Mr. Billington.  Fun, but I think 3-player is better than 2-player.

I wanted to try a couple of games in their collection that I've never tried. I always see Rummikub at the thrift shops. It is pretty much like playing Rummy (with the melds) and Mah Jong (set collection). Quite a bit of luck when it comes to drawing tiles, and some of the melding by the end really hurt my brain, but overall it was a nice game. I'm sure it plays differently with more players. Probably more fun but a bit more chaotic too.

Although it's a copied concept (a card game was first) Rummikub gives a lot of fun and brain workout. Actually if you play it seriously it can be a real brainburner-filler (nice oxymoron).

Unfairly disregarded this as a mindless diversion in the same vein as Mexican Train dominoes. Then a friend forced me to sit down for a play. With sharp players, this is a serious game. Played with a one minute timer, it adds tension and even a bit of tile-manipulation dexterity. I vowed to pick up the next decent set I came across while thrifting, which took less than a week: Pressman Tournament version with crystalline tiles, 98 cents.

I like this a lot. It may seem like there's a lot of luck, but as with most Rummy games, play against experts and you'll quickly see that skill totally dominates. The ability to rearrange melds on the table is key, and makes it much deeper than most other games in its family. Unfortunately it's not easy for people with color vision deficiencies; the manufacturer could and should fix that easily.

One of our favourites as kids. We felt so smart when we pulled off a particularly intricate manipulation. It appealed to our mathy side. As a bonus, with its chunky tiles it's indestructible and entirely outdoors-compatible ([thing=2655][/thing] fills that niche now).

I did acquire a nostalgia copy in adulthood, but have barely played it. The manipulations are still very satisfying, but the drawn out and luck-dependent end game is sufficiently annoying to sour it.

However, for now, it stays in my collection, just in case my daughters grow to love it too.

Hm, let's give people unlimited time to completely rearrange ALL the tiles on the board, to where they might not even be able to fix it again so the game can go on. A worse game in every way than regular versions of rummy, so why have all this weight rather than a deck of cards?

A fun rummy-based game because it makes set creation and replacement a bit easier on the tableau.

Holding your "cards" is awkward because to do so requires a tile rack, but once the cards are out, they are easy to manipulate.

I've always liked the bold Helvetica font and the weird orange color of the orange/yellow set. The blue, red, and black are solid pure colors.

This is a fun game for people who like puzzles and numbers (which includes my wife and I). There is very little strategy, other than perhaps holding tiles back from time to time. The entire trick is to learn how to manipulate the tiles on the board to make plays. I have been playing since the 80s and the first time I played with my wife she was slightly caught off guard by some of the creative ways that you need to manipulate the tiles. If is sounds like your thing give it a shot. I will say the components are complete garbage in the current mass market edition. I wish they would release a high end version with decent components.

Rummikub is a solid game that provides a decent rummy experience. Very tactile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rummikub is much like its card counterpart, Rummy, only with tiles.

The game is a simple in its concept where numeric tiles in serial order and suits are eliminated from a players hand. The first player to reduce their hand to zero wins the round.

It's an easy game to pick up and play. However, with less experienced players such as myself, the rearrangement of tiles towards endgame becomes a bit convoluted. While fun, I cannot endure many consecutive rounds in a row.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I enjoy this game.  My parents' friends play this all the time and I'll join in.  The game is a pretty challenging mental exercise if you follow the rules about forcing people to draw a tile when they move tiles and then realize they can't make a play.  Unfortunately, most of the folks I play with don't follow that rule, which leads to situations where a player moves all the tiles around then can't remember how to put them back.  If you want to see if you like this, it can be played with decks of cards, although I vastly prefer the tiles both for the minor tweaks to gameplay they offer and the tactile pleasure of the nice plastic.  My biggest knock on this game is that if all of the people at the table are sufficiently skilled, it is basically an exercise in luck of the tile draw.  There also tends to be tons of kibbitzing, but thats probably a local issue.

Not a fan. The two player game is especially dull. Takes a long time, has potential for players to ruin the game by forgetting how they originally placed pieces. Oddly enough, even suffers some anlysis paralysis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fairly easy to teach to new players because it's similar to popular games like rummy or even mahjong.  But it can tend to drag because any and all sets on the table can be re-arranged as long as you add a tile from your hand to the new arrangement.  Probably a good idea to have a 2-minute time limit for each player's turn.

Rules note:  Only once a player has played his initial sets of 40 points, he is allowed to add cards to previously existing combinations on the table.  He may add them immediately after he has come out with his initial independent 40-point plays -- he doesn’t have to wait for his next turn. 

Confusion about the Jokers:  Some rules say that the Joker is given a specific value, but that might be hard to remember.  Another rules variant says that the Joker can be any legal value that makes the set makes sense.  For example, if there is a set blue 4, joker, blue 6, then obviously the joker is blue 5.  But if there is a set of yellow 4, red 4, and a joker, then the joker could be either black 4 or blue 4.  This matters a lot if you are replacing the joker by a tile from your hand, or if you are simply re-arranging a set that includes a joker.

After giving this a few good playthroughs, I realized we were definitely missing out on our first time playing.  There's a lot of luck, but the numbers manipulation it takes to do well can definitely involve some solid strategy.  Since each number can likely be used in 2-3 different ways at the end, trying to piece together the puzzle is pretty interesting.

It does get stale being so luck-based after a while, but it's a lot better than I remember it being.

This goes to show how much of a newbie I am.

I played Rummikub some five years ago cold, that is to say I never saw the game before. We were playing with somewhat seasoned players, and my wife and myself were the beginners.

It was very hard to "get" the game in that session, I was intensely concentrated and sweating profusely, just from the game. Everyone was having a lot of fun at my expense and at my concentration.
Of course we lost, but after that session I went out and bought the game.
My wife and I played until the game "clicked". Next time we played with these other players, we beat them soundly, and of course it wasn't as intense as before. We had also beat the game.

I have a "Deluxe" version that comes in a wooden cabinet box with wooden racks and a sand timer. Very nice. Unfortunately the game-play is a little bland and basic, as well as prone to occasional brain-burning slowdown as you try to figure out where to put your tiles, sometimes with the inability to play for many turns. Still, it's a fun little game for the most part, in that classic card-game sense with the twist of melding flexibility. I must admit it's quite satisfying to have my crazy plans that mess up all the sets and runs on the table occasionally work.

Ideal Players: 2-4

Description: A rummy-like tile game. Play off others' tiles, and try to get all of your tiles onto the table.

Pro: Simple, quick, and easy to play. The basic pattern matching game type. Drawing tiles from a bag is fun. Rich traditional family game.

Con: Very little complexity, strategy, or theme. Tile draws make the game somewhat random.

Timer is a must...otherwise, it devolves into a game with a great deal of down time as the tiles change so much during everyone elses turn, it does no good to watch them.

Also, the scoring mechanizum is poor.  Whoever wins, gets positive points equal to the sum of all played tiles, while everyone else takes negative points equal to their remaining tiles.  After one player wins once where someone has 50+ points left (happens way more often than you think due to the meld rule), they create an insurmountable lead.

***Looking for the "Club" edition - the one with the big, chunky, stand-up-on-their-own tiles.***


I used to play this a lot before i was introduced to "Euro style" games back in the late 90's.

Still enjoy the pattern matching element as a puzzle, but finding other players is a chore.

Needs to be played with a timer otherwise some players take forever to achieve nothing, simply moving all the pieces on the table around!

They changed the rules since the 1980's and the new rules make the game much less strategic.  Unfortunately, no one will play with me using the old rules (less easy to move jokers or split tile sets with jokers in them) since then is about controlling the board rather than lucky draws.  With the old rules, this is a 6.

Rid yourself of number tiles (1-13 x 2 in four colours, plus two jokers) before your opponent does, in groups/runs of three or additions to already played sets. This one is easy to learn, requires some puzzle skills, and is a good game for the whole family.

BIG PLUS: easy to grasp, all ages, can be played for points/money
MINUS: plastic domino tiles gain weight in these numbers, making the game not fully portable
BIG MINUS: tile stands are weirdly built and break or tip over mid-play

Rummikub is classic.  I can remember playing time after time every time our family would get together.  I no longer own the fancy version we used to with the heavy tiles and large case, but bringing out the plastic one is still pretty fun.  One of these days, I'll need to track down that old classic case, if only for the posterity.  Oh, and it was nice to reunite with the creepy smiley face joker tile again.  More nightmares for me.

I came into this game with extremely low expectations, but came out of it pleasantly surprised. Definitely more engaging and challenging that plain ol' Rummey. It's strictly a numbers game where the key is being able to visualize how to rearrange tiles on the table to enable you to play more from your hand. Sort of like a puzzle game with numbers. One of the "good" classics.

I would never pull this out myself, but would happily play with nongamers if they suggested it.  This is a game in which the downtime is negligible because I spend everyone else's turn pouring over the potential placements.  I end up thinking quite a bit in this game.  I guess it usually comes down to luck of the draw, but it's still a good game that doesn't last too long.

It's bland. It's inoffensive. It's white bread. It's just Rummy with tiles. Not bad, just not great.

It's a game of lucky draws. At the end you can sometimes get away with a lot of tile manipulation to make the draws back up.

But it is a very easy game to teach and play. As such a pretty good game.

Rummy derivative with shared melds that can be rearranged and completed to form new ones. Can be played with two decks of cards and two jokers, but the tiles are probably better suited for moving melds around. They should rename this Permutation Station and give it a space empire building theme because I figure a lot of people would lap that right up.

This is actually Travel Rummy-O, but the BGG database doesn't apparently have an entry for it.  It wants to call it Rummikub.  Go figure.  Anyway, this is simply a small travel version of Rummy-O.  It has a little drawstring bag you can put everything in and has tiny, cute tiles and stands.  lol

RATING: 2
could be played with two deck of cards.
Should use timer for turns. (30 seconds and then you have to do something) if you have done something you get an additional 20 seconds (after that again 20 seconds is all you got)
Or check out tournament rules.
It gets a five because the fun is highly dependant on the other players. 
It has scored as high as a 7 but sadly it has also been a 3.

Edit  revisited this and boy is it bad.
Each and every tile laying game is much better than this.

I like Rummikub, mainly because Jake and Jennifer are always willing to play it. It's a good little puzzle game of numbers. I would say this is good for people on the very fringe of the board game world, that are used to playing standard 52 card games or something along those lines.

RATING: 8
If my life goes well I expect to be playing Rummikub in some country mansion while being served fine cheese and port by waitresses who look like Kate Middleton.  If it goes badly I expect to find myself disappearing for days in some Rummikub den in the deepest darkest parts of East End London.  The evidence so far suggests it will be the latter because Rummikub is an intoxicating but cruel mistress who you can lose days to.

Once you understand that there is a small set of rules or logic, familiar to anyone who has played Rummy, and that practically anything can be done if you dont upset or break that logic then you realise that you have incredible freedom in your moves.  That freedom can be dangerous as it will either inspire or destroy you.  After your first few rounds you will be constructing the most complex of manipulations or raising a fist against Lady Luck as you just need one specific piece to get out.

A great game which I always feel is slightly out of its time as I imagine it being played in the card rooms and parlours of Victorian England.  Highly recommended and noteworthy purely for the freedom the game allows.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.8
Rummikub is a melding game that is basically puzzle-solving, with some very limited elements of interactive strategy.  It falls into the "pleasant, short-duration family game" category, which isn't a bad category at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Rummy on steroids. Given a tray of tiles, your goal is to empty your tray by forming, adding to, and even breaking up and re-forming "melds" of tiles in either straight flushes or several-of-a-kind. Very deep in the manipulations possible, but retaining a very high luck factor, especially in the early game. A spill-proof game, suitable for after-dinner play.

I played this a lot with family growing up, but I've drifted away. A whole lot of the game is managing the spatial puzzle aspect of rearranging the board to be able to play your singletons. There's also the luck of the draw -- I don't think it's too bad except for occasions where a player just can't manage to reach the threshold to lay down initially. I'd suggest amending that condition to "30 points or at least 7 tiles"; that would probably do the trick.

Best with 4 players. Great game to keep your mind active.
Advantage does go to people who are stronger at math/logic.
Lots of random luck when it comes to throwing out your initial set that must total at least 30. Sometimes you'll have games where one person can't even put out their first set until near the end of the game and this blocks/delays the other players because this person usually ends up holding the connecting numbers the other players need to use up their tiles.

I've played this pretty much as far back as I can remember, I'm sure this hit the table for me shortly after Candyland. My mom is a huge fan. I love trying to work out ways to manipulate the currently melded tiles so that you can drop huge amounts yourself.

You have to ask... why not just play Rummy (the card game)? We have Rummikub as a gift from MIL but we've hardly broken it out except when she visits.
Tiles have a great tactility but the colour choices are weird; dark blue and black???

Of the more classic games, this is probably my favourite. Offers great opportunity for fancy thinking and cool moves. Generally, the fewer players the better just so there is less downtime and fewer of those moments where that perfect move you figured out becomes unavailable.

Played 14+  times. 
Last play was on Jan 13, 2008 

This game is okay.  I'll play it because My friends and husband like, but I'm rarely the one to suggest it.  

We played it three different ways last night.  First we played it with the official rule of you must have 50 points to meld.  That ended up causing two of us to have to pull and pull before we could finally go down.  When the second of us (not me) did finally meld, he was able to completely go out and win.  That made the game not so much fun.  So we pushed the meld amount down to 40.  We had a similar problem but this time the person that had to pull and pull couldn't go out but the person after him could because he had put so much on the table in one turn.  The final game we used on 30 points to meld.  That game seemed the best because we all got quite a few turns and movements in before the game ended and it seemed more like it could have been any bodies game.

Since my friend has this, I don't need to buy it, and if she brings this game, I'm IN!  It has set collection & it's so easy to play and doesn't take too long.  After each play I want to play it again.  There's a local Japanese Rummikub group near me (hehe I might be the youngest non-Japanese speaker), I might go join them!!

Played that game a lot while camping or outside, beside a pool. Plastic pieces don't fly with the wind. Some strategy, you have to plan many moves ahead since you can modify what's on the table, to be able to put your pieces. If you like games like phase 10 and jok r rummy, you should like that one better, you don't have programs, but you have to empty your try and the better vision you have of the board, the better chance you have... Great family game.

Game in a Nutshell: A passable game of tile rummy.

Played as: 4 player

Pros: My favorite game growing up and one that should be good with kids. Easy due to familiar rummy mechanics, mostly fast moving. It's a puzzle that evolves as the game progresses.

Cons: The initial get go of the game lacks tension is ultimately not that important. Whether you draw the tiles you need to lay out right away is a none factor since eventually you will lay down and only then will the game start. On the flip-side, if you're the first to go down, it gets a little slow waiting for other to lay out so you'll have something to play with.

Best Use: One to play with grandma since all grandma's know rummy and chances are they already own the game.

After 51 plays. I have a game partner who loves it so I've played it a lot despite disliking it. 

An advanced (although by no means new) form of Rummy, with excellent components (I played the "big numbers" version). The big clackety bakelight tiles are great. 

This is the kind of rummy where you play sets and runs to the center of the table and then both players can add cards to them and rearrange them however they want so long as the table contains only complete sets and runs after the arrangement. 

As tiles build up on the table, there's a combinatorial explosion in ways to rearrange the tiles, which might lead to too much analysis paralysis for some. It feels like trying to make a complete set of words in a scrabble rack with 30 tiles in it, with no tiles leftover, on each turn. 

Sometimes I think I enjoy the mentally taxing ending (I love to think so hard I get dizzy), and sometimes it annoys me that the game is so backloaded. 

Also, there is very little strategy. There may be some choices about when to hold back tiles that you could play immediately, to deprive your opponent of more on-board tiles to rearrange, but it's hard to tell because the probabilities that you'd need to know to figure it out are very obscure and I'm nowhere close to understanding them. 

A big problem is that the wild tiles are much more powerful than the others. If you get a wild, you should always hold onto it until you can use it to go out and win the game. If one player gets a wild (or two), and the other doesn't, the latter has little chance to win. That's really stupid. So stupid we now play without the wilds.

02/06/2013: Rummikub is very similar to Challenge Rummy (also found in my collection).  It is a set collection game with tiles that are played in a common area on the table.  Any player can use a tile you have played as long as a valid set remains at the end of the turn.  We have a newer addition of this game, and I find that I really love the tiles.  Not sure why.  They aren't anything that special, but something about the tactile-ness of them is very appealing to me.  Maybe I'm weird, I don't know.

This is a solid family game that can be played with anyone familiar with basic card games.  For now, I have listed this game one notch higher than Challenge Rummy, but I think that's mostly due to the components.  However, after writing these mini reviews, I think I may like the rules better in Challenge Rummy.  In Rummikub, I've found that you can get stuck without playing for several turns to start the game because of the minimum point requirement for your first play.  That can be very frustrating.  And, I think Challenge Rummy plays a little faster as you discard a tile every turn.

I want to try playing the Challenge Rummy rules but with the Rummikub components and see what I think.  Stay tuned...

-Looks incredibly boring
-Downtime

It's okay I guess. It does lead to a lot of analysis paralysis though, and once you do get really good at it, there's only one decision that can effect your outcome of the game, and that's "should I play my (wild) tile now or later?". Otherwise, there aren't really any decisions in the sense of "should I do this or this" but rather "can I actually do anything?" Also, endgame is kinda meh where you have to wait for the others to finish.

Lastly, it looks extremely boring. Not something people walk past by and ask if they can join. That's not the image I want to create for this hobby.

RATING: 6.1
Not much different than several classic rummy variations, but the game is definitely diverting enough, capable of serving as a pleasant a social activity. There are some potential pitfalls. There's the possibility of analysis paralysis... the rules suggest a two-minute time limit for turns. Also, players might try a Scrooge strategy after getting their initial melds out, playing only enough tiles to avoid taking on more and hoarding potential plays on their rack (and thereby limiting opponents' options). Still, fun for what it is.

[i]I honestly don't know what to say about this tile version of Rummy. It adds some interesting twists to basic rummy since you can use jokers and switch tiles from melds that have already been played as long as you use all the tiles. 

I only played one time with my buddy Mat (This also happens to be one of his favorite games). I enjoyed it, but I feel like a game this simple is all about nuance and I just don't have the plays to really judge how much I like it. I want to play with my wife and get her reaction, she may love it, but I could also see her suffering from major AP.[/i]

I expected this game to be dull the first time I played it, but found it to be very fun.  Admittedly, it can be very slow going at the beginning and--worst case scenario--the game can end before some players have ever even gotten out on the table.  I really like the challenge of finding ways to rearrange all the existing sets in order to get rid of the tiles in your hand.  (4+4)

Rummy. With tiles. I like the idea that you can twist existing melds on the table in different ways to wrangle new numbers out of your hand and into the new melds. But it's still Rummy ... not that exciting. It can be a decent spouse / family type game for passing the time, but it feels that if everyone's doing the meld wrangling passably then it generally devolves to who draws the lucky tile at the end to get their last tile out and win the round. And we only ever play one round, as there are other better games out there, so that defines our winner.

Thinking about the best arrangement of tiles you can make is interesting, but still quite easy. I find that the best move is usually obvious.

The tiles are of nice quality in the version I have, and the trays are okay. It has a tactile appeal hearing them clink together as you sort them, etc. Good to play with your 80-year old grandmother, while drinking tea/coffee. Kind of like dominoes. Reminds me of long trips in the Winnebago as a little kid with them.

Rummikub, which is essentially rummy with tiles, was one of my favorite games in college. My roommates and I played tons... plus I've brought it to family functions where it has been well-received.

A good game in that most people already know how to play rummy, so the rules are easily explained. But there's still a lot of challenge, especially as you start shifting multiple tiles around to make new runs and melds. 

One of the few games that my extended family really enjoyed.

An Israeli number game with mechanics similar to the card game of Rummy.

* Spill/wind proof components can be played anywhere. Park bench, bar, floor.

Cons:
* Slow to get things moving.
* More about pattern matching than strategy.
* Very prone to AP. It's a different type of AP than you'd get in a strategy game, but it can still take a long time.
* The end-game often comes down to luck of the draw.

I don't know if we'll ever play the actual Rummikub rules, but the tiles are useful for playing any game that needs up to two decks of four "suits" (colors) from 1 through 13 (Ace through King).

With two sets, you could use the tiles as the towers in Babel. With some way to mark up the tiles (colored electrical tape, paint), you could make eight different suits and play Battleline. Just nice versatile tiles.

Turns out I was wrong. I've now played this game three times and loved it every time. I think it will replace Rummy as our go-to game for people who scoff at board games but like to play cards.

Speaking of Rummy, while playing Rummikub we came up with a new way to decide if a game is worth purchasing. It has to be better and more fun than Rummy. While that may seem like a low bar, I've been playing and enjoying Rummy off and on for over 25 years across five generations. I put a few more of my games up for trade after setting this new bar.

== 2013-05-02 - R: 7.5

My wife and I have played this game at least twice a week for the last month. My brother and mom are both hooked too. I know it's not a game of high strategy. I know there's a ton of luck, especially at the end. I don't care. We enjoy it for what it is.

If my wife and I both get to our last two or three tiles, we'll help each other. This is where the AP kicks in and we find it's more fun to work together to find clever ways to play a tile than sit there waiting for the other person to give up. We know it's "luck of the draw" at the end and we don't care. The moves are fun to make.

== 2013-06-02 - R: 9

Have to bump this to a 9. My mom just visited for a week and we ended up playing at least twice a day. This is currently my wife's most common request and I never feel like turning her down. The quick setup and trash talk really make this a great game to break out with a couple of gin and tonics (and you don't have to worry about the drinks damaging the game components!).

rummy variant that is played with tiles instead of cards. I'll have to admit that the tiles do lend the game a nice aesthetic quality. some strategy here, but still as luck based as the card game. o.k. game to play with people who don't like anything heavier than monopoly. pretty freaking boring though.

Rummy-like game with tiles instead of cards.  Lay down tiles in sets/runs.  try to get rid of all your tiles first.

It's a classic and surprisingly engaging for what it is.  Good family game.  Competitive, but facilitates conversation.  Recommended....especially becuase you can walk into Goodwill and pick it up for a dollar or two.

Main question is how is it pronounced?:
1) Rummy-cub
2) Rummy-cube

Rummy with tiles. In a single move you can remodel the whole board; and as the game progresses the number of possible moves that could be chained together to enable you to use one or more of your tiles skyrockets -- and this is where the strategy comes into play.

I really don't know what possesses game companies to release their own versions of games which can be easily be played with public domain materials - in this case, 2 ordinary decks of cards. Actually, it's probably because there are enough people like my wife, who not only bought this but declares that it is one of her favourite games and somehow that it is miles better than playing with a deck of cards, that they make money out of them...

Well, I've never much liked rummy anyway - and this is a hideously AP-inducing variant. (So much so that, when I play with my wife and her parents at Christmas - the only time I'll consent to playing this - we put a time limit on turns, and for once it's not just aimed at me.) I also feel that the game is near-broken because I'm sure it's never to your advantage to be the first to put something down on the table - but if everyone follows this strategy, the game never even really starts! (Luckily, my wife and in-laws don't follow this strategy.) Oh, and unless you play thousands of "hands" in a session, the winner is hideously luck-dependent, due to the "one player scores huge, the others get screwed" scoring system.

But it's OK once a year for a few games, hence it just about gets up to a 4 rating.

I love this game. I also love when you get half way through rearranging the tiles as part of your grand plan... then forget exactly what came next. The moment of confusion, followed by panic.

It's the same as rummy, but you can move the public pool of numbers around to play from your hand. I grew up playing this one on family vacations, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It opens up as a fun puzzle later in the game. I'll still play this with my non-gamer family if an opportunity arises.

I would always play Gin Rummy or Mah Jong over this.  Too much down time trying to figure out how you can permute what's on the table, and since what you play doesn't matter score-wise, there's a lot less scoring strategy than Gin Rummy.  Mah Jong does the whole tactile tile thing much better, and plays fast.

Rummikub is (supposed to be) a fast-moving tile-laying game where you build runs and groups of tiles that make satisfying click-clack noises and are hard not to bite down on every once and a while. This is a classic that is still fun. Good with two, better with four.

The tiles are more convenient than cards, but it's still a fairly shallow rummy game at heart. A good game for when conservative relatives with poor eyesight drop in. The 'minimum score to open' rule guarantees that at least one player will have a bad time. 

Heed my words: get a mahjong set instead.

The game is alright.  It can be fun to try to puzzle out how to get all your pieces out.  That is until you find out everyone in your group is not planning ahead and is taking forever on their turns.  This game is pretty AP prone for a lot of people.

After that it is basically a game of chance.  Hope that you can draw that one tile that you need.  That or wait until you are one of the last people to start playing your initial tiles, the last player has the most to work with and can often times almost go out right away.

Rablórömi műanyaglapkákkal. A rablórömi sem volt soha a kedvenc játékom, így ez sem lesz az. Nagynak érzem a szerencsét, hogy ki milyen 14 lapkával kezd és tulajdonképpen a szerencsésebb, jobb "szemmel" rendelkező játékos nyeri a játékot. Sokat kell benne gondolkodni, főleg a vége felé, gondolkodós játékosokkal sok lehet a holtidő is. A francia kártya olcsóbb, ez a játék csak a tartóssága miatt jöhet szóba, bár helyet is többet foglal.

For a Rummy variant it is actually pretty entertaining.  Once everything is out on the table, the game becomes a nice brain teaser.  It's fun trying to solve the puzzle of how to rearrange everything.  It's engaging in a Free Cell kind of way.

If you have played Rummy then you can play this. Only learning curve is remembering that your not trying to get points and the field is open to each to play off of.

Bought it for a buck at a thrift store. When I read the rules, I thought "wow, rummy with tiles... and the exciting twist here is..." EDIT: Now that I've actually played it, I see the twist; but I'm not the best at pattern recognition so I'm not sure it's for me. Also, I got hosed on initial tile draw and had to draw for at least five turns before I could start playing.

this is a steady number game that is kind of like dominoes. Just match your pieces in sets of different colors or runs of the same color of at least three or more piece. the only drawback and thing to avoid is not trying to shift the sets around so much you cant remember how they went if you cant do it.

Perhaps there is more to this game than I originally thought. We got a new version, semi-recently and re-read the rules. The switching about of tiles from set to set can add interest and skill. (The skill really comes from one's ability to recognize patterns and move tiles about in your head.)

Rummy with tiles. The physical nature of the tiles being set out in front of the players, along with the ability to break up and rearrange melds makes this a more puzzly game than playing rummy with cards, where one can only add to existing melds.  Some of the thrill comes with totally rearranging the table in order to get that last tile off one's board.

Rummikub is my wife's family's favorite game. It gets played all the time. It definitely takes a certain visualization skill to be any good. I remember the first time I played it with my then girlfriend and her grandparents I lost every game. Now I can hold my own. The tiles make it a decent game to take to the pub. Pick it up at Goodwill for a few bucks. It's the only Spiel des Jahres winner I own that never advertizes itself as such.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting rummy game where going out is made more challenging by the addition of a card -- excuse me, tile -- to your hand each turn you do not manage to play one.  But the real fun is in getting to change around the tiles in the melds already on the board.

This game is one of my mothers favorites. Because of this, I have avoided it ever since, only picking up a copy when I came across a perfectly conserved 'Deluxe' edition from my own birth-year for €2,-.

Why? She would spot a vague opportunity and started to rearrange EVERYTHING on the table at least twice, only to find some pieces missing for her perfect solution and totally unable to put everything back as it was. Horrible experience to see a potentially interesting game being destroyed by watching in anticipated horror about what would happen. 

Looking objectively to it, it remains actually a quite decent game even to this day. Components are really nice, rules are easy enough to explain and you can setup in no time. Of course, there is just one form of tension and no 'big finale' keeping this game from being really good.

But it is a classic as Scrabble, Chess and Monopoly and hence, will stay.

Like most Rummy games, this just doesn't have any depth to it. In addition, slow starts where you have to draw 10 or more tiles before you can make the initial meld are not uncommon, making the start of the game pretty boring. And finally, the scoring system makes no sense, as it forces the outcome of any series of games to be pretty much random.

It only gets a 3 because I play it with family who happen to like it.

The epitome of tile-based games, Rummicube is best with 3 or 4 players who think they can play the game strategically.  The tiles you draw determine the course of the game primarily, but an awful lot of who wins is decided by what you play, when you play it, and how you play it.

A fun game that takes a good eye and a bit of luck.

In the end, it gets tedious to me.  It is one of my wife's favorite games, although I get tired of losing. ;)

The big general stock of tiles in the center that can be rearranged really adds a huge element to the game and I'm very entertained by moving stuff all around and mixing things up. 

UPDATE: Now I play this game more with the kids who enjoy it way too much...meaning I play it more than I'd like...the game has terrible down time with APing players and really makes the experience not that enjoyable for me.

I bought a newer edition of this game because we loved playing it as kids. I wish I still had the original edition, as it was made better, but the gameplay is still fun. This turns rummy into a board game, and makes it easy to arrange plays before placing them down for everyone to see.

A group favourite where you lay down runs of the same colour or sets of different colours, that can then be added to/taken away from. You can have a lot of fun thinking how to get those last few tiles down and making some interesting manipulations on the board - the game does come down to creativity at the end.

It's a good social and mind game. Playing Rummikub can effective train people at mental shuffle and re-organization. The choices of playing tiles keep growing as the game progresses. The guessing of opponents hands and prediction of their plays are necessary skills for being a veteran Rummikub player.
Many people tend to have paralyze analysis. I would always prefer playing the tournament rules which times the game with 1-minute turns.

I got this game for Christmas as a child. I loved playing gin rummy with my mom and thought this would be a fun alternative.  I could rarely get her to play with me. She preferred cards to board games. A few years ago someone brought this to a women's retreat and we played for hours! It was so fun.  I bought my own set and this has become one of my favorite family games.  I mostly play with my mother-in-law and kids, but take it to game nights as well and usually find people willing to play.  The lady I played with had modified the rules a little bit for her family and it makes it a lot easier.  Instead of playing your tiles in front of your rack, we just play everything out into the center of the table.  We keep a column of matching numbers and a column of runs.  It's much easier to see potential plays when the tiles are all together like this.

One of my friends has this game and loves it for nostalgic reasons, which means that I will play it now and again.  It's tricky to try to see all the moves that might allow you to get rid of your tiles, and that's the good part.  The bad part is that there's still a lot of luck in trying to draw tiles that you can get rid of in the first place.  The game is fiendishly simple, which makes it appropriate for non-gamers.  Fun enough, but not something I will seek out.

Totally abstract game, which might be more interesting with some theme, but on the other hand this is an old classic game. I have played eight times and I'm quite sure I can't do very advanced moves, but I like to play it every now and then.

Updated after two more plays and almost six years. Abstract game, where downtime might get quite high, you can plan your moves, but the previous player might mess up the table, so you might need to rethink everything. Okay game, I wouldn't suggest it, but I might join a play after considering other possibilities.

For whatever reason, I prefer Rummy with cards.  This isn't a bad game, but they tend to run long, and more than one game of this has gone until the very last tile is drawn.  It just doesn't have the same kind of tension.

This is barely a modification of rummy. The tiles are equivalent to two standard decks with two jokers. One can re-arrange tiles in sets and all sets are held in common. The object is to go out first.

This game could be played with two decks of cards but the tiles could be useful.

Tile version of rummy. One of the first family games we played many hours at the cabin where I realized the great joy, interaction and shared challenge that board gaming brings. My aunt would drive us crazy changing around all of our areas trying to figure out a way to go out only to get things hopelessly screwed up. I can hear my Uncle now. "Don't play until you see it"

RATING: N/A
Based on the traditional middle-eastern game of Okey. Similar to the Rummy that you play with cards - you try to get rid of all your tiles by forming numbers into runs of 3 tiles or more, or 3 to 4 of a kind. The colors of the numbers on the tiles are like card suits.

I love this game. It's essentially a rummy card game with domino-like tiles instead. Great for 2 players, but also with 3 and 4. You can take your time, and it doesn't take a lot of thought - just luck and a little imagination sometimes. There's not a lot of player interaction, which can either be a plus or minus for some. I would imagine it would be a good break from interactive games if you were having a game night and wanted to throw this in the mix.

Childhood favorite. At least once a game, someone tried to go deep into some play that rearranged the whole board, only to not complete the play and not be able to put the tiles back to a legal arrangement.

This game was huge in Taiwan during my visit there, almost a staple at every gathering I attended.  I'm at a loss as to why it is so popular, but I guess it has something to do with the fact that it is easy to pick up and play.  I liked it ok, but then again I wasn't exactly a fan of the card game version Rummy, so I can't say it will be something I'd ask for very often.

Update #1: LOL, a light bulb just went off in my head.  Rummikub is very similar to Mah-Jong, and that is the reason why it is so well liked by the Chinese circles.  I wonder why that didn't occur to me earlier.

Simple game, a little bit boring after some times. I think there are more interesting games that require the same amount of time to be played.

If you like card games, especially rummy, then you will love this variation!  The components are very nice and functional, especially in the deluxe edition.

The start of the game often feels a little nebulous, as you look at your mess of a hand, and decide what to do with it; however, as the game progresses, the mind races, looking for hyperactively cascading combos.  It's that search for opportunity that really makes the game.

--Got this for our wedding from an old boss/friend.  Some of the tiles went missing after we let Eric play with it.  I later replaced it.

It has seen a lot of plays.  I would have to say that it isn't very deep or engaging, but the durability means it is a good filler for outdoor events.

Luck based, certainly. But really very enjoyable provided you are able to start. When you have lost before starting the game it is rather frustrating.

Intriguing gameplay ensues when someone decides to rearrange the entire table to rid of a few pieces.  A very good game for groups with varying skill levels.

After 2+ Plays: Finding the right moves seems to come from trial-and-error more than an understanding of strategy, which isn't much fun.

I have a lot of good memories with Rummikub, but I played so much of it in my early adulthood that I don't think I'll come back to it anytime soon. It's abstract enough that older adults can/will actually take it seriously as it's reminiscent of traditional games. Could also be considered as a gateway game as it introduces basic mechanics found nowadays. Should always be played with 3p+.

Played this a lot a few years back,have kinda forgotten about it now.It's a fun game but quite similar to many card games,which are more popular in my game group so we play those instead and we tend to forget that this game exists.

*Rating based on one play.

Too abstract for my preferences.  Doesn't really capture the feeling of a city building game.  Nice component quality, but the game is HEAVY (in physical weight).  The blue and purple zone tiles are difficult to distinguish (the blue looks like a dark purple while the purple has more of a reddish tint).

When played with 4 serious gamers, this game shines. The 3 completely different phases with intertwining influences on each other, plus the role cards, really make for a varied and interesting game.

The components are great as well. Big, thick, chunky cardboard tiles, wood stars, big wood bidding chips, and wood height markers.

Kickstarted

Initial Impressions: Light game that feels like Alhambra, but significantly more luck driven.  In Alhambra you can at least pick the tile that you want via auction and your personal board isn't directly influenced by the other players actions.  With Sunrise City, especially in 4 player the number of ways that the board can be altered with 3 other players is significant and can be described as "chaotic".  (this effect is apparent also in Alhambra, but more noticeable in Sunrise City).  

To me this is an abstract implemented with a strong theme.  However, philosophically and practically, I think virtually every abstract game needs to be played 2P.

Good: Great (thick) components and great art-deco artwork.  Interesting game play choices with two distinct phases that influence each other (zoning/construction).  Great integration of theme/gameplay (building up and changing the zoning).  Role cards are unique and add to the variability of gameplay.

Bad:
Drawing bad tiles, in particular low doubles (red/red, for example) can't really be mitigated that much, especially if those community tiles aren't available.  Random nature of the turn order based on lowest # then clockwise.  May implement a house rule to say that play order is based on ascending role number instead of lowest + seating order.  Fiddly mechanism to score "benchmark" stars, which can cause some AP.  Role cards seem drastically different in power (even when played in the appropriate round), and although the drafting mechanism minimizes impact, it still can be pretty bad.

First game: Played a 4P game and it seems like it was a bit too random and also too chaotic for 4P.  Will need to try it again with 2P or 3P.

I like the building aspect - you have to think up as well as out.  You also have to stay a few steps ahead of yourself as you try to aim for exactly 10 points in order to get double stars.  Very unique and brain burny game.

Clever Mojo Games delivers the goods in this title.  Components are very well done.  The box is chock full of stuff (and hardly any air).  Game play may be lighter than some may expect, but it can be deceptive.  While mechanically straight forward, there is ample room for player control of the outcomes.  The revolving score track and scoring mechanism are unique and interesting.  So much so that game play will quickly be driven to achieve the double-star by ending exactly on the star (10) spot.  Doing so is a combination of good planning and a bit of luck.  The luck comes from the player interaction and the role cards.  Some cards give extra points whenever any player does a particular thing.  These extra points are welcome, but can be hard to plan for and obtain the double-star.  In fact, the various ways that extra bonus points can be scored are quite numerous and remembering all of them during play can be a challenge.  Strategies for better play emerge with repeated plays, as does keeping an eye on the scoring options.  Overall, the game play is quick and games are likely to end close - even if during play it won't feel that way!  A solid addition to a game collection and another win for Clever Mojo Games.

One of the most fun and under-rated gems in my collection. Particularly good at 3 players. The puzzle of scoring multiples of ten exactly, as often as you can, is brilliant and each phase of this game is interesting and enjoyable. The expansion adds a lot of random, but that can be nice as a change as well as for playing with less strategic players. Great game!

I was prepared not to like this game based on BGG comments, because I typically prefer strategic games rather than tactical games.  Instead, I found Sunrise City to be quite charming.  It is a fun city-themed tile laying game that is all about trying to get your score to hit multiples of 10.  I played a 3-player game, which may be the best player count, because it keeps the game moving.  To me, the game felt similar to 3-player Carcassonne (with the exception of scoring).  You are impacted by the randomness of tile draws and must react to the tiles that opponent's play.  You can have a general plan, but it is usually not worth it to over-think the game until its actually your turn.

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
Super nice production.  Super thick tiles, and really nice wooden components.  Did not like the scoring mechanism where if you score exactly a "10", then you get 10 bonus points, since you have very little way to manipulate the tiles you get (and what gets put on the board you have very little control over).  Wouldn't mind playing again since it plays pretty fast, but not something I would probably request.

I love games where the theme is city-building so this was very high on my wishlist! I like the variety in roles that are used during the game and the way zoning is handled is interesting. The art (though extremely well done) doesn't easily lend itself to making your "city" look much like a city, however the thickness of the tiles really do! These tiles are THICK, which makes your taller buildings really seem to tower over the smaller ones. Loved that about it. Gameplay is pretty intuitive and the game stayed pretty tight even though it seemed like one person was wayyy ahead.

RATING: 5
A half-way decent tile laying game that offers something a little different than other tile layers.

Players will have a "hand" of both zoning tiles and property tiles, which require various combinations of zoning to play.  The game lasts three turns, each of which is essentially played in three phases. 

1) Play zoning tiles.  Very simply, you play zoning tiles to the map, trying to lay them so that they best match the property tiles in your hand.  You have to match up terrain features when playing them, as some contain water or roads that must connect to other water or roads.  You score points for laying like-colored zoning areas together.

2) Bid on land area.  Players go around and around bidding tokens, giving them the right to play land tiles there.  At the end of this phase, the top token on each tile will have the right to build there.

3) Place property.  Place your property tiles on the board, matching the color of buildings to the color of zoning tile.  Each property tile spans two zoning tiles, so a red/blue property tile must lay on adjacent red and blue zoning tiles, for example.  You must own the rights to at least one of the zoning tiles covered, and you score points for the property tile, plus bonus points for each half of the tile placed on zoning tiles which you had the rights to.

There are also a few other twists, such as each player getting to play a character card each turn which breaks the rules for them.  They have all kinds of different effects that help the player or hinder others.

There's also one really wacky scoring rule that I didn't really like.  In Sunrise City, players get one Victory Point for every 10 points scored in the game.  There is a scoring track that goes to 10, and each time you wrap around the end of the track you get a VP token.  The wacky part is that if you land exactly on the last space of the track, you get TWO VP tokens, causing players to play sub-optimally in order to land exactly on that space.  Additionally, you might throw someone two points if they're one space away from the end of the track to ensure they only get 1 VP instead of 2.  I dunno, seemed like a wacky and unnecessary rule.

In the end, you get a neat little tile laying game that's sufficiently different from many others, but still lacking any real fun or excitement, and marred by a wacky scoring system.  I'm usually into city building type games, but this one was pretty underwhelming, although still alright to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is almost amazing.  There are a few things that hold it back though.  The mechanic that gives you extra points for landing on the star is clever, but I think it is way too powerful.  There are many times that, even with perfect planning, unwanted points will ruin you, while someone else gets lucky and gets twice the points as you.  It is really fun though, and interesting to think about if you want as many points as possible, or a specific amount of points.  Maybe it should just give you a half star instead of a whole one.  
Zoning is boring.
Some of the roles are now particularly exciting either.
Building is great.  I love the thick stacking pieces. 
Overall, good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Only thing keeping it from a perfect score is the weird scaling.  The out-of-the-box rules work great for 4, fine for 3, but are a little flimsy for 2.  Otherwise a fantastic game! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The art, both the buildings and the role cards, is absolutely gorgeous. I love it. As well, the tactile feel of this game is incredible. The chunky building tiles are pleasing to hold and manipulate.

However, playing this with two players, was very disappointing. The bidding phase was completely broken as the second player could simply bid on whatever the first player did. Even the optional alternative bidding rules aren't great as they really just translate to first player gets three spots and the second player gets four, and if a player has the mayor, then the bidding phase becomes broken again.

It's possible that the bidding phase would be more interesting with three or four players, but I have trouble seeing it because I would expect that the bidding phase would be used to block the leader from having access to new construction sites.

The other problem I had with the game was that, in theory, the game wants you to plan for how to get to a multiple of ten score, because then you score double points, however, because there are so many ways for an opponent to give you points, planning ahead almost never works out. On the flip side, giving your opponent points isn't always good and you have no way of knowing ahead of time if giving them points helps them or hurts them, making decisions on that vector feel very random.

Clever mechanics, direct player interaction, big chunky pieces and city building.

A nice tile laying game that has more strategy than it would appear at first. The combined mechanics of having to develop the land before being able to lay down the buildings, the role cards that change the rules and the star/double star scoring system allows for a game that has a good amount of depth in a simple game system that plays fast.
Recommended.

Too early to really tell, but I like it so far... if the scoring system didn't scream tactics-think-on-the-fly-dummy! enough, the role cards are there to emphasize it even more. I can see this being an AP sink with certain players (I might be one of them).

Do not own.

A tile laying game with hints of Glen More with its rivers and roads/paths, but they are very different games.

What I liked most about the game is the 3-D effect of the buildings.  The tiles are thick and as floors stack, a nice dimensional city rises in front of our eyes. The tiles unfortunately are not holding up too well since the paper is separating.   Nice wood disks though. 

Zoning and the direction of building is a nice thematic touch. Role cards add interest, but the strategy and jocking of the game revolves around the scoring mechanic. 

I would be more enthusiastic about buying the game if the tiles seemed sturdier and a little easier to read--some important graphics on the tiles are so small they are difficult for everyone to see, especially since the city might "grow away" from some of the players.  The tiles had such an unfinished look, and such a home-computer-printed-and-then-glued-on look that I mistook the game for a prototype.
Lasts less than an hour yet seems a little long for what it is--repetitive.

This game feels unique and innovative, yet familiar. The tile laying, city building mechanic commonly used in games like Carc and Alhambra combined with a novel bidding system and a very cool point control mechanism makes for a great total package. Without the point jockeying/control mechanism, I think this game would be pretty flat and uninteresting. Just thinking about playing the same game while only trying to maximize score sounds like quite the yawner, but the seemingly simple mechanic of trying to land on exact point totals adds levels of depth, strategy, and especially fun (provided there isn't too much AP in the group).

An odd little tile layer, where you lay district tiles first, then bid for control of those that match your building tiles and finally build. You can tell that this is a Kickstarter game, the role cards seem poorly balanced, you can't prevent the player to your left outbidding you and each player's hand of tiles is hidden, so you can't tell whether you're helping or hindering the next to play. This together with the bonus for reaching a multiple of ten points means that luck dominates the outcome in a game with little to recommend it.

What was initially a very negative view of this game changed dramatically once played.  Although a city building game (which I'm not a fan of), Sunrise city is a very slick and thinky game using quasi-area control (placing disks), locking in location selections, unique role-card powers, and point grabbing.  The city builds upwards very quickly and it is easy to block out areas with strategic tile placement.  It is a clever strategic game that is very simple and quick to play.

Extremely poor visual design.  Many details that will significantly affect the play of the game are so visually obscure (plus/minus points from certain community tiles, colors of community tiles, water...), you just have to make a mental log of them as you play, because NOTHING will simply jump out at you.  Quite awful,really.

Also do not like the bidding mechanic.  It gives far too much power to the person going last.

And the theme does not come out at all.

This is an early rating (8) after a single play. We played a 3 player game and I found it a very fun and interesting game. The bidding mechanic and role cards seem like they will help the replay value of this game. My 12 and 14 year old daughters both enjoyed our first play of the game. More later, I hope!

After a couple more plays, I have to bump my rating a bit (9). We have finished each game wanting to play another. There is a good bit of luck involved but there is plenty of opportunity for tactics as well. Long term strategy is difficult, but each turn of the construction phase is a test of maximizing your points while limiting your opponent's. Even in a 4 player game, there is very little down time. By BGG standards, I have a small collection, but the components of this game are the best I have seen.

Not a bad game, and a pretty clean design (despite all the dust and grime on the physical components in my copy), but it's not all that engaging to me, either, and the two-player game is, to me, pretty dull as-is, in part because bidding (a key element of this game) is just not as fun or tense with two players. I'd give this game a 5 for two players--there are simply much better two-player games out there--and a 7 for three or four players, leaving me with an overall 6.

Sunrise city is a mixed bag for me.  I love the idea of city building games, and have wanted the "SimCity in a box" experience for a very long time.  Sunrise City's zoning decisions and vertical building system (using some of the most insanely thick tiles ever) make me want to love this game - but I really don't.  I do _like_ Sunrise City well enough as enjoyable tile/domino laying game with an unusual scoring mechanic that encourages careful play (every 10th point grants a victory point but if you land on the 10th point exactly, you get an extra bonus VP).  Unfortunately, I leave it not feeling at all like the game I just played had anything to do with building a city.

This game is gorgeous.  Great Miami Art Deco style, really high quality pieces, and a fun core mechanic (building up with nice, heavy, thick building tiles).  The bidding process is a bit frustrating, and the need for mental math is pretty constant given the nuances of the scoring system, and that does make the game a bit AP prone.  Which is weird, because one of the oddities of the bidding process is that it often turns out that all that AP was for naught. But once you realize that the game plays more randomly than you expect at first, and realize that flexibility and in-the-moment optimal plays are more important than long-term strategy, the game gets very, very fun. I think a few of the more negative reviews of the game read like they were expecting one thing and then, upon experiencing something different (more random), lamenting it. That doesn't match my experience.

And like Carcassonne and other tile based games, you get that special pleasure of constructing a unique landscape (or in this case, cityscape) each game.  Personally, I love looking over the city's configuration come the close of the game.

Played once, 4p.  Pretty good city building game.  Not sure how I feel about the double star mechanism (you acquire pseudo points as you build the city, and each time you get 10, you get a victory point; if you land at exactly 10, you get two victory points).  It is very difficult to plan these double star moves, and others can easily screw it up or set it up, often not by design.  But, the strategy requires more than one game to understand.

Don't need to buy this one.  Happy to play a friend's copy from time to time.  Combination of special role cards, zoning placement and auction, followed by building up of buildings on the city which scores the most points.  You generally try to be exact on landing on 10 points to score two stars instead of going past 10 points and only scoring one if possible.  Perhaps too much calculation/AP in a fairly simple game?

This is another Kickstarted game and it shows: gorgeous, lavish components and all kinds of extras, supporting an okay game. After some tussling with the rulebook (which of course didn't have rules for the bonus KS tiles) we got going and had a pleasant enough time with it. It's a perfectly fine game, kind of light, kind of random, plays quick, but it's also not particularly captivating. There's also a weirdo scoring thing that doesn't really serve any purpose other than to wonky things up a bit.

After more plays I am totally in love with this game. I have not yet tried drafting the cards because we always have some beginners in the group. But they pick it up. The tactical nature of the game is something I really like (which can lead to AP) but as long as people watch what happens and continually assess their options it should not bog down too much. It has become one of my go to games.

This game emphasis on getting exact 10 points through accumulation, which is quite anti-climatic. We also found the game to be a bit too less control for 4 player game, though it's likely less likely to happen but more brain-burning in a 2-player game.

I thought this was going to be a really easy to teach and play game.  New players have no idea how to draft the roles at the start of the game with any real strategy, understanding how colors don't always match (blues/purples are a bit off) and the difficulty it causes them with the community tiles can be frustrating (+1, -1 in areas surrounding).  Because of the visual appeal and game play length though it still is a decent game.

Really enjoyed my first play. Certainly enough to buy it. However there are a couple of issues which need resolving.

1) The icons on the tiles are plainly too small. This is a problem. The colours save the day but I would have preferred larger icons. 

2) If you pull all single-building tiles during a round, your options are quite limited. I will play in future with a mulligan rule allowing the player to optionally discard any or none of the 4 single-building tiles, shuffle the discards back into the pile, and pull replacements. 

Having said this, I really like Sunrise City and will look to obtain a copy as its well made and quite different, and a lot of fun.

Once I get myself a copy, I will do a review on Boardgames in Blighty

Sunrise City is an attractive city builder with well-crafted components and unique gameplay. 

Unfortunately, it has one fatal flaw: During setup, players are required to choose city official cards whose abilities have a drastic effect on their scoring and therefore strategy. For new players without a grasp on Sunrise City's play and a foreknowledge of those cards synergy, choices they made before the game even began can hamper their performance all game. Not good design.

I was convinced (forced...) to play 3 times before writing this comment. Three full games, reading and re-reading the rules to be very very sure that it works as we played.

Well, the roles are slightly unbalanced, but never give you so many points, do not bother thinking so much on them. The draw of building is ridicously unbalanced, you can get 0+1+2 buildings, while another player gets 4+8+4 buildings!
The Zoning phase is worthless: you do not know what your opponents have in hand, you do not know who will bid on what, the impression is that it is equivalent to putting the zones randomly.
The Community Tiles.... rarely appear and were ignored.

What, however, spoils all your strategy's efforts is the "star mechanics". You do not need to score points, much better looking for that damned "double star". Ok, you can wisely use the black pawns to adjust your target towards the double star, but everything is reduced to a mere calculation.

Last but not least: little bug in the game. I decided to choose a zoning direction where no zoning was possible since it was all surrounded by river. Rules says that in order to place tiles anyway all players must concur, well I didn't and zoning was blocked. [ok, ok, after a brief discussion I agreed to change direction...]

Summary: too much luck, no strategy is possible, setting is poor, many elements seems to be "much ado about nothing"

An instant classic. Nice gameplay. Classy retro look and feel. Easy to learn and teach. Nice thick tiles in order to count "floors" of buildings. Not exactly Sim City, but moreso a 3D dominoes-ish game. Many ways to score points. Role cards keep things fresh. Much much replayability. I can't wait to try the Nights expansion!

Warning: learning curve because the rulebook is a mess. Do find the FAQ.

Casual Game !! Family Game !! Church Group Game !!

2 player game needs a variant besides the bidding one mentioned in the rules. We prefer the 6 zone tiles and 6 builiding tiles per round. We also start the game out with 7 roles each, and with every draft pick we also pick a role to remove from the game.

Rulesbook needs a reworking incorporating clarity on scoring, usage of the word "orthogonal", and incorporation of the mini-expansion available via the kickstarter. The player discs need graphics to assist people that are color-challenged. Zone icons need to be larger. Zone colors blue and purple need to be more distinguishable from each other.

Good city-building game.  I like having the different roles for mechanics.  There is a lot more flexibility in later rounds for your buildings.  I like its vertical aspect as well.  Plays fast.

I was looking for a little more, though.  In a city building game, I would like to see more different types of sectors.  I'd like more functions of these cards.  Also, one has to know what the roles do in starting out.  I also didn't care for the "gain two stars" for landing on ten points mechanic.  All of these points, however, are minor and it's still a good game.

Short tile laying game where you are trying to get to sets of 10 points whenever possible, while trying to stop your opponents from doing the same, creating a fascinating incentive to score less points than you can sometimes, while perhaps scoring extra for your opponent to stop them from hitting exactly 10. The player powers feel tacked on, and there isn't much strategy to where you are finally able to play tiles because there are so many variables and so much happening between your turns.

Sunrise City is a game wherein you are.. I think contractors trying to be responsible for building as much of the city as possible. You first draft for cards you'll be using to give you abilities each round and/or dictate priority in the round. Then you have three rounds of construction. First you add new components to the city limits (from a small hand). Then you add bid tokens to get the rights to earn points by building there. And then you start building stuff. You get an amount of points as dictated by the portion of the 2x1 buildings, and can get additional points for building at certain heights. If you earn exactly ten points you immediately earn an extra ten points, so timing is key to winning. And that's about it. You block other people's moves, try and optimize your scoring, and... the end. The game's mechanics are put together fine, and the components are robust as they could get, but it's overall sorta boring and dry. Not a bad game, but like a lot of the stuff out there, there's better stuff to play always available.

Sunrise City depends heavily on it's scoring mechanics to stand out from other similar games, however, said mechanics just happen to be highly enjoyable. You have to be able to abandon your strategy at the drop of a hat because every turn the board is going to change and there's a good chance your opponent's will give you just enough measly points to ruin that perfect 10 you had set up. The role cards also help spice it up a bit, giving you a special advantage rach round and changing the first player, which can be very important. Overall, Sunrise City is a pretty simple ride, but it never outstays it's welcome and provides a nice alternative to certain games that certainly don't have as much charm.

After one play: Entertaining, and I'd play again. There's an oddity in the scoring, a way to gain significant bonus points for a fiddly feat that seems to depend as much on luck as cleverness. While an experienced player will undoubtedly do better than a novice, I worry that the reward for the feat is too high, given its semi-random nature. Or maybe I just haven't played enough to see the subtleties. That aside, the rest of the game is also more luck-dependent than I usually prefer.

While playing this game I quite enjoyed it, but something felt... off. Reflecting on it, I think my main issue with it stems from the double scoring mechanism. Even though this game is about building a city, it's really all about getting exactly 10 points at a time- not about building or zoning, but manipulating your points to get that exact score. The double scoring mechanism in this game overwhelms everything else and makes what looks like a fairly thematic game feel gamey and abstract. It's all about maneuvering and lining up to land on that one scoring spot.

I wonder if the bonus was less pronounced (say you get a bonus chip, and every 2-3 of them at the end count for a point...) if it would feel less abstract and gamey and allow the theme to shine through more. Right now the scoring track, instead of simply keeping track of your score, becomes the focal point of the game instead of the city that you're building.

As for the other mechanisms in this game... none of them are bad; I like the actual tile laying aspect in this game. However, I find myself wanting to tweak how several of the elements work, which isn't a sign of a great game; several things just didn't feel right, like they hadn't been thought through well enough. I didn't really think the zoning phase added much to the game- it's not real exciting. And the bidding phase seems a bit odd- punishing the start player and, with the way the turn order works, it can unfairly reward the last player just due to where he's sitting. It seems like turn order should follow the character numbers- since they appear to be related to relative power- not simply go clockwise.

--Jun2012-- Possibly overly grumpy on my part - but there seemed to be a dramatic skew provided by the draw of role cards (Yes; they're drafted, but some are much stronger than others.) Zone tiles and Building tiles.  In theory, over enough games, those factors will even out.  But in any one game, it seems possible to be eliminated by those random factors.  Which, again grumpily, sounds like [color=blue]Euphrat & Tigris[/color]:  the difference for me is that I'd not had anyone pretending that [color=blue]Sunrise City[/color] was the best thing since...  I'd be willing to play again:  and if a player was out of contention through no fault of her own in only rare instances, the game might rise in my estimation:  I can't claim to have done the statistical analysis to claim otherwise.

Just one play and I liked it. The bidding does skew towards the last player, but then you have an element of control on that by keeping cards of higher value; besides, it doesn't make a significant difference. The landscape changes enough to make planning difficult in the 1st phase (of three); the latter two phases are a little easier as there are many more options from previous building.
The target of exactly 10 points each time you rotate around the score chart makes for some interesting play - try and take your opponents past 10 while trying to hit the 10 yourself. 
The minor downside is that the theme is muted by the scoring mechanic and although the tiles are chunky (and I mean CHUNKY) they did not need to be 'real bricks'!
The colours are not very strong either which, in bad light can make blue and pink look the same.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I just do not like this one.  I really do not like the bidding phase, because I feel like it really, almost unfairly penalizes players early in the turn order.  They have to hope no one else wants their zoning tiles.   I know that player gets to build first, but if the needed tiles keep getting sniped that is a problem.  In a 2 player game, bad luck is a big issue.  The first round can almost be a waste if the random zoning tiles happen not to match the colors of the randomly dealt buildings.   The scoring system feels novel, but it is more annoying than anything.  Scores in this game are really tight, so getting those extra points by landing exactly on ten makes a huge difference.  It is fun to figure out how to do that, but sometimes the math just does not work, and it can be annoying to fall behind just because it was not possible to get bonus milestone markers that other players had available to them.

Really enjoyed this tile laying game. Special role powers keep the game interesting. Scoring mechanism is a bit odd but understandable. Not something that I would always want to play but will definitely play from time to time. Components are really thick and heavy. Really good job on production.

Works well with 2 players, also great with 3. A much better game for playing a second time.
Slight drawback is the indistinct colouring for the blue and purple zone tile, which also don't properly match the building tiles.

It's a solid auction/tile placement game, but I think where it really shines is in trying to time your benchmarks so that you can get effectively an extra 10 points.

Neat tile-laying auction game with VERY thick tiles ... nice production! Quick, light; too much so for me, really.I would certainly be willing to play the game again, but I don't think there's anything that stands out enough to justify adding it to my already too-huge collection!

--- Summary ---
At the start of each round, players are dealt role cards, which they draft. At the start of each round, simultaneously choose and play a card. These  are in no way balanced, but give players interesting powers or rule changes as well as determine starting player for the round.

Each round, players get a hand of tiles which show 5 different types of zones (commercial, residential, etc.). In turn, players add these to the city grid, possibly earning points for tile placements. Next, bid on zones using their 5(?) bid chips. You may bid over other player's chips, unless they have 2 of their chips stacked. After all bids, players take turns playing tiles onto the board, at least half of which must cover your own bid chip. Players whose chips are built over earn points. You also earn points based on the tile played, possibly with bonuses given for ever odd-numbered floor (1 or 2 pts).

All points are tracked on a 10-space track; every time you loop around you get 1 VP token (star), but if you land exactly on the last spot you get 2 VP tokens.

After 3 rounds, the player with the most VP wins.

This game reminded me a lot of Ginkgopolis, first players take turns laying zoning tiles that dictate what type of buildings can be placed there.  Then each player bids on which of these zoning tiles they would like to build upon, and finally players place building tiles on either the zone tiles they bid on or on the second level of pre-existing buildings.

There's even more nuance to it than that, you can build on other players' zones if you own a zone adjacent to it, each player has hidden role cards that give them special abilities during different phases, and my favorite mechanic in this game, players who score exactly 10 points get 2 stars instead of 1 which is this game's victory points.

All-in-all this is a very good, very well-designed game with a decent amount of depth and lots of room for interesting decisions and gameplay.  And the components are outstanding, probably the thickest tiles I've ever seen in a game which is even more impressive when building tiles are built on higher levels giving the game board a 3D effect.

Definitely best with the full complement of 4 players and not at all good with just two.  The number of decisions is just too few with only two.

The tiles for this game are amazingly thick and sturdy, the art is extremely pleasant, and the whole thing has an original Sim-City retro feel about it. Add in a twist to the scoring, and it's just a very satisfying experience, win or lose.

A neat idea, building upwards as well as outwards on the board. Played incorrectly the first time, so will need to play it again and see how much the correct rules increase the strategy.

Lay tiles, then 'bid' to control them and then lay tiles which match the coloured tiles for points. The having to score sets of 10 points for double stars is an interesting idea but I wonder if this just makes the game more luck of the draw dependant? I wasn't overly captured by it, but the fact that I couldn't decide whether it was best to go first or last in turn order makes me wonder if there's more here than I got on a first play.

I do think the cards might just be some random 'stuff' that happens to make the game less solvable and more chaotic. I'm not sure they really added to the game and some seemed infinitely better than others...

I might be missing something here after only one play, but I didn't see a whole lot of fun coming out of this thing.  It was kind of meh, and it's heavy and takes up too much space for meh.  I'll give it another few plays, but I just don't know about it.

Suburbia might be a better option for the same sort of feel, not sure how it handles different number of players though.

Sunrise City is much more clever than I was at first expecting. It contains a pleasant system of interlocking mechanics that, thankfully, strays (at least a bit) from the traditional point-accumulation pattern. While, yes, everyone is trying to accumulate points, the game emphasizes *precise* scoring. What's the difference? Let me explain.

Players gain points by placing tiles onto the game board (i.e., "city"). Whenever a player accumulates 10 or more points, he gains a star token. At the end of the game, the player with the most star tokens wins. However, as a bonus, if a player can make his score equal to exactly 10 points without going over, he gains two stars instead of just one. So it pays to plan ahead, sometimes even holding back on scoring opportunities so that you can score exactly 10 on the following turn. This mechanic, combined with the bidding and placement rules, makes for interesting gameplay.

The downside to all of this precision, however, is the potential for downtime. With AP-prone players, the need to score exactly 10 points can often bring the game to a halt as everyone considers all possible plays. As with any optimization games, a plethora of options can work against the desire for speedy play.

My other criticism has to do with the narrative arc of the game, which seems a bit flat. The game is played out in three rounds, each one nearly identical to the previous, and with little to no room for planning in between rounds. The city grows, and each player receives a different special ability each round, but tile placement is largely the same exercise in optimization.

All in all, though, Sunrise City is a well-implemented, lighter point-optimization game. Repeat plays will tell me if my criticisms are ill-founded. For now, I would gladly play again.

Some interesting mechanisms, like the double score for landing on a star.  Luck luck luck as far as tile laying opportunities.  Other than the strategic play for double star points, most of your play is luck because you never know what the other player will play.  No tactical or strategic planning,again, other than the star mechanism.  I think there are much better games out there.

Well. Played it twice and it's pretty obvious that this isn't really a "game" per se. It's more of an activity. 

The role you choose? Doesn't matter. 

The spots you bid on? Doesn't matter.

Trying to make sure you land exactly on the star to get a bonus star? Nigh-unto impossible and not really worth it.

Pros:
Chunky cardboard! (That's kinda rough and seems like stickers put on a cardboard box)
Role selection! (That barely has any impact or importance in the game)
Fun strategy! (Not really any room to strategize) 

Cons:
Look at the parenthesis.

This is not a family game. It is gamers game. the rules are simple but the game has a lot of different things going on. You need to play the game a couple of times before it starts clicks to you. It is well designed, but there is randomness. A good game overall.

For what is a fairly simple game the rules are very poor, with key points neglected or explained incorrectly (the way you are apparently supposed to score is not how the rules imply it should be done). Even with all that ironed out the game isn't that interesting - very random, and the huge bonus for hitting 10 points exactly is really, really dumb.

Abstract AND random.  Not a combination that makes for a good game.  I love many abstracts (Taluva is a favorite) and I love many random games (Adventurers).  This is a game with tons of bling and I so wanted to like it.  Sadly, have to give it a thumbs down.  Perhaps good for non-gaming families.

Not my type.  Based on 1 play

I thought to place Zoning tiles in a manner that might match colors of the Building tiles in my  hand.  It turned out fruitless.  

I had no perception that my bidding to own Zoning tiles came out anything other than random. I have no idea why others topped me, I often could see  no use for what was left.

The experienced players did know how to gain the bonus advantage for higher floors, but mostly I felt that the printed point values on the Building tiles I was dealt then defined the points that I scored.

Just generally I have a dislike for the random "special powers" concept. Everybody has a different card that can disrupt my planning. As a beginning player I don't want to invest in memorizing all those cards to gain equal footing.

Good, interesting game with very nice components. Fairly simple although there are quite a few rules. Several layers of mechanisms to fit together for the most efficient scoring. Innovative scoring mechanism where you get 10 bonus points for hitting every 10 points exactly (effectively doubling those 10 points), so unusually you do not always want to maximise your regular scoring and you can screw opponents over by giving them points. A real puzzle to match up the different phases to maximize your scoring while hitting the exact 10 points again and again.

Despite the SimCity theme this is not a development game, but a fairly abstract tile-laying game. However, the theme makes sense of the rules and makes the game play fairly intuitive.

Initial rating a 7 for the game play plus 1 for components and originality, but expecting this to increase with repeated plays if the game play holds up with better understanding of the layers of mechanisms.

Played again. Rating increased to an 8 for the game play. Other players' comments: "very good", "the best new game I have played in a long time".

In the tile-laying game Sunrise City, players build a city with zone tiles, bid for control of those zones, then place building tiles on the city zones to their best advantage. Each round the players use role cards to grant them special abilities in the various game phases. Points earned during play move score tokens up a ten point track. Players score one benchmark token if their score marker overshoots the star at the top of their score track but earn two benchmarks if their token lands on the star by exact count. So, Sunrise City is not a race to score the most points, it's a contest to grow the city in a manner that will earn you the right number of points at the right time to maximize your benchmarks. After three rounds, the player with the most benchmarks wins.

Thick tiles with very attractive colors. The community tiles need a thicker line of color to determine their color. The rules are easy to understand but the scoring rule (stop on a multiple of 10 to gain an extra 10 points)and the personality cards (think leaders in 7 Wonders) make the game.  Plays quickly but AP players may struggle a bit. Well worth trying.

After 1 Play: The "bidding" system in the zoning round just does not work for me. This also features a compete for start player then go clockwise mechanic, which always bugs me. Technically this was a prototype, but the rules seem pretty final to me.

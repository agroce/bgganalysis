This actually exists.  It was perfect for my Loopin Louie playing family because there are 3 of us.  Playing with 3 on the original is odd since one person gets an advantage.  With Looping Chewie the 3 players are spread out...and its Star Wars so it was a no brainer.  I just wish it was a larger version like the original Looping Louie.

This dexterity game is a lot of fun for kids.  Although only 3 player, it is fun to see Chewie flying around knocking over those storm troopers!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Despite the theme appeal, Loopin'Chewie is worst than Loopin'Louie in every other aspect. Loopin' series plays better in more players, and Loopin' Chewie you can only play with 3 players. In every other aspect it is a fun dextery filler to play in 3 minutes.

Only three players is a bummer, and I feel like the motor isn't as powerful, but it is sturdier than new Louie. Old Louie is still the best.

I've never played the original, surprisingly, but I bought this version for my son who likes Star Wars. It's a reflexive dexterity game where you're knocking the Millennium Falcon around to avoid it hitting your Stormtrooper tokens and knocking them down into the discard slot. A bit repetitive but fun for kids and to introduce new people. Seems it should play 4, but plays only 3 (you can rig it to play more with multiple sets and a third party add-on you can purchase, but I doubt I'd ever need to).

Basically Looping Louie for 3 players with Chewbacca in the Millenium Falcon in place of Louie. It's a nice way to play the game with 3 players. Chewie seems to fly a bit more steady on the decline thatn Louie does, but mostly they seem very similar.

Hilarious fun.  Everyone's talking trash and cursing Chewbacca, throwing shade.  Then you connect with a magical hit that causes Chewie to perfectly nail an opponent and you realize there's some actual skill here.  

I wish the motor was slightly faster and we could play four player, but it's still a great deal of fun and unlike any other dexterity game.

Loopin' Louie for three players.

RATING: 7
Obviously the Star Wars theme is going to appeal to a whole lot more people than the Stop the Pigeon cartoon vibe that emanated from the original. There is no mistaking the fact that there is a whole lot of fun to be had here but if you aren’t bothered about the theme or want to play with four then you would be better off grabbing a copy of the original game. Personally the three player set up suits us fine and I believe that you should never miss any excuse to yell out your favourite Star Wars quotes- “This is Red 5, I’m going in.”

Same game as Loopin' Louie, but designed for three-players and with a Star Wars theme, of course!  :-)  Quite fun, even for adults, but I did think that the original Loopin' Louie might be a hair better.  I am not 100% sure if it was just because of the option for a fourth player, or if the motor was a bit faster.  Regardless, this game was fun, as well.  :-)

RATING: 5
It's 3 player which gives an advantage to the person on your left against you. If they play perfectly, there's not much you can do.

That said, I play with my kid only and that allows him to actually beat me sometimes because of the handicap.

Not a "real" game but it gets my 3 year old to understand sitting down to play a "board" game.

My boys (6 and 4 and love Star Wars) love this game. Immediate top 10 list for the 6 year old. 

I generally moderately to strongly dislike dexterity games and am pretty horrible at flicking. But I'm not half bad at this, and irrespective of that, this is a lot of fun, and probably my fave dexterity game to date. 

I especially like how if you hit too hard you can take out your own stormtroopers, which helps to balance it a bit. More about finesse and tricky moves, and when you get it just right... brings you back to see if you can do it again.

Fun.

Jeder kennt wahrscheinlich Looping Louie aus der eigenen Kindheit. Nun, diesmal eben mit Star Wars Lizenz, anstatt Louie ist es nun Chewie und man kann zu Dritt spielen. Funktioniert bei Erwachsenen mit reichlich Alkohol immer noch. Für 1-2 Runden. Danach ist aber auch gut :-)

This is Loopin' Louie but only for 3 players and the Star Wars license is applied. 

I think the Chewie piece is well designed, possibly better than Louie, but for me the arm unit that holds the discs is not quite as robust and too many discs fall down simply from hitting the see-saw flipper' thingy. 

Good for what it is but I'll stick to Louie.

The player count is a mixed bag, it's actually nice if you only have 3, but loses an entire "shot" as the area across from you takes a certain amount of force to hit that is different than the other (left/right) positions. I got 2 Sets for 6 player action, I've not tried that yet.

I genuinely adore Loopin' Chewie. Our adult games club has found it a hysterical game to finish on, after playing heavy games for hours.

The physics of it is brilliant, with the oddly-weighted millenium falcon spinning and sometimes lingering in the air entertainingly. It becomes a real skill to make it divebomb your opponents in the right way and you could never perfect playing it, which is important.

Don't believe people who says it's just like Hungry Hippos - I doubt you'd win this if you just frantically bashed the button.

This and Spyfall are the only games that always make me want to play again as soon as they're finished. Even the excellent Codenames doesn't quite do that for me.

RATING: 7
It's not the utter genius of Loopin Louie, but it's still a pretty good 3-player approximation.  The looseness of the manufacturing adds a strange motion to chewie that potentially takes too much energy out of the bounces, and the player are (of course) spaced further apart.  The result is that back shots and double bounces are both much much harder, making seating order even more influential.

But the 6-player fan-made variant for combining two sets is great.  Play in teams with the person across from you and the overly difficult shots vanish, replaced by a range of interestingly different skill shots and strategy/politics.

3 player: 6/10
6 player:  8/10
for reference, original Louie is 10/10 in my book

initially bummed about the three player 'limitation.' But found I am usually only playing with my kids so three is better than trying to play on the 4 player board of Loopin Louie. Plus the extra distance between players slightly tweaks the gameplay. I wish Chewie's pendulum action was as good as my old thrift copies of Louie.

I initially was not wild about the loss of the fourth player but the arm spacing is actually better.  I feel like Chewie's balance is a bit more fun than Louie ever was.

It's cool, because it's Star Wars and has Chewbacca, but it's poorly made. The Falcon wobbles all over, the player arms only loosely connect into the base, and so the experience is much less satisfying than the original Loopin Louie.

Not as fun as Loopin' Louie but absolutely essential if you want to play with three people. I can't quite put my finger on it but there is something "off" about the physics of this game.

The plastic is cheaper and the Storm Troopers aren't knocked down as easily as the chickens in Loopin' Louie.

Similar to Loopin Louie, but the plane seems to fly lower, and you can just hold up your paddle most of the time and not get hit.  It ends up being less satisfying or interesting.

The original Loopin' Louie (especially with the Salto Sammy mod) is a great hit with my family and friends. Played Loopin' Chewie at Essen and it feels as though there's no weight in the Chewie model at all. "But it's a kid's game" I hear you shout. For the record Loopin Louie is a fun game that can take a hammering, Loopin Chewie just feels like a cash-in that would break if played with too hard. The 3 player aspect is just sickly icing on an overdone cake. If you're going to buy a version get (one of) the original(s).

No point in getting this over Loopin' Louie. Unless you don't own the original, you're a Star Wars fan and you'll never want to play the game with four players (as this is three players only, compared to Loopin' Louies player count up to four).

However, if all that applies to you, the gameplay is identical to the Loopin' Louie, which is one of the best kids games out there, so you can't go wrong on this one.

3 Player only themed version of loopin louie. Main concern apart from the lack of a fourth player is the motor used in this. I have read many reviews of the motor burning out within a few plays as it's low quality. I bought this new for £4 so if the motor does go I will spend a couple of quid getting a new one and wiring it in. Seems like a lot of messing but my nephews love it so worth it to me :)

This Star Wars themed update to Loopin' Louie is alright but not what I was hoping for.  First, I was sad to see that they moved the player count down from 4 players to only 3 players.  Then for some reason (not sure if it's just my copy or what) my "chewie" (in the falcon) doesn't always actually hit the stormtrooper disks which means sometimes he's just flying in circles and it doesn't matter if you time the "bump" right or not.  It was a fun idea but I fear it was maybe rushed to market and trying to save on money (by only having bits for 3 players) and as a result it's not as good as the original.

Purchased this for my brother last Christmas, as Loopin' Louie was a childhood staple of ours and we're both lifelong Star Wars nerds.

It made for some fun, nostalgic games, but it's a bummer they reduced player count from four to three. Not only does the game support fewer players, but two-player games are now far less balanced.

[thing=173341][/thing] is a retheme of [thing=327][/thing] and plays exactly as this one: is a super light dexterity game in wich players defend their area (chips) by pushing a button and making the ship go up, sometimes, really up, enough for it to flip and dive right back at you!

The game has a mechanism, moved by batteries, that makes the airplane always keep going. The buttons make it elevate, and, thus, avoid to hit your chips. If all your three chips are hit and fell, you're out of the game. The winner, of course, is the last player with chips left.

If [thing=173341][/thing] has some sort of depth, it is hidden from me. I can see, however, that, as dexterity games go, timming and strength count a lot. You can learn how hard (or when) you must press the button in order to achieve some effect. This is the depth of it.

But I did enjoyed it, because it provides a fun time while it last (though it can drag a little when only two are left playing). Overall, no better than [thing=2452][/thing] or [thing=17329][/thing] regarding dexterity games, but it do have more bling and sure the kids will like this one way better.

Defend your storm trooper tokens from being knocked down a slope by Chewbacca flying a Millenium Falcon attached to a spinning plastic arm.

Haven't been particularly impressed with this one so far, none of the children I've played it with have enjoyed it. By contrast Rhino Hero, Jenga and Dobble have been hits.

I don't understand this version of Loopin' Louie. Why only 3 players ? Whay has the weight of Chewie been change so much comparing to Louie ?

As a result, you can only play at 3 ... comparing to 8 with a little hack for the Loopin' Louie version ... As a result, Chewie can stay 3 full turn in the air ... as if it was a feather ...

We don't even finish our play ... Get the original version ... not this bad copy ...

RATING: 7
* Fantastic party game that plays surprisingly fast.  Artistic skill has more of a benefit than other drawing games.

A must own game - the hilarity that ensues in this drawing game is bar none.  Needs an expansion.

Pictionary on steroids. The upside, you get the most points from guessing other peoples drawings so it's okay if yours is not that good. The downside, I've played it so much I know what all the cards are.

RATING: N/A
Party game.  I have found that people who usually cannot draw very well end up drawing some of the most clever and/or funniest scenes.  I prefer this game to Pictionary.

Everyone in my party game group really enjoyed this game, including myself.  It was really fun drawing and then trying to figure out what everyone else drew.  Since you are always drawing or guessing someone's drawing, there is no downtime as there is in pictionary.

The best drawing game around to my knowledge

RATING: 5
Decent enough party game, but the player interaction is very low until the end. Also, the game changes a lot over the range of players. With 4 or fewer players, there is more emphasis on making a good drawing. With 7 or more players, there is more emphasis on guessing what the other players have drawn, and this could lead to competitive players intentionally making lower quality drawings to prevent others from guessing correctly. So it's probably best with 4 to 7 players.

The best drawing party game around. Way better than Pictionary or Cranium. Fun even for those of us who have no artistic skill at all. ZERO downtime and lots of zany card combinations make this one a must-own. This is one of the few party games I prefer with less people rather than more, actually. That way you get to play three rounds without things bogging down and the game going on too long. NEEDS an expansion.

MUCH better than Pictionary!  You must draw the who, what and where, all at the same time, making a whole scene for the others to guess.

If people play by drawing cohesive whole scenes it is a lot of fun.  If they just draw three separate elements, it's pretty lame.

Think of it as a more advanced and creative Pictionary.  You are give 3 cards-a who, a what, and a where and are then asked to draw it!!  Everyone draws at the same time and the peopl try to guess what your aimless scribbles are (the who, what and where) when you are trying to dsraw Maddon and someone guesses Ethel Merman YOU KNOW it's a winner! if you like pictionary YOU HAVE to track down this game!

This is a pretty funny party game where one's inability to draw well is not a complete liability.

RATING: 8
Pros: This game can be really funny, regardless of your art skill.
Cons: It's VERY exclusive to American culture. Even Canadians, Brits, Saffies, Kiwis, and Aussies "in the know" could struggle. Also, once you've played through all the cards, you kind-of know what the potential cards could have been. So after about 5 plays through, we (the owners) have an unfair advantage.

Silly deduction game that derives a lot of it's fun out of people's ability and inability to illustrate their answers. We play without cards where everyone writes down one who, what & where and they are mixed up dealt out. I think I would always prefer it because you can make some silly answers.

My favorite party game. This scratches the same itch as [gameid=30618], but everyone is involved the whole time, and there's an actual game here.

Allow players to doodle triptychs until everyone gets the hang of it.

Try starting the game with a round of writing slips for the Who, What, and Where items.

Hilarious drawing game!  It really needs expansion decks and/or custom cards though.

RATING: 7
Okay, yes, it's a party game, but this can be a huge blast.  Excellent memories of trying to decipher a drunken friends scribblings and then discovering there's a strange kind of logic to it after all.  Only detraction:  not enough cards (you end up less surprised).

I like art games, so really enjoy this. A few of my friends don't like drawing games, unfortunately, so we don't get to play it as much as I'd like. Still, when we do, we all always have fun making fun of each others' drawings.

Play iSketch instead. Friendlier to the pop culturally impaired; friendlier to the bad drawers; friendlier to the guessers: friendlier to you.

February 10th, 2010:
Rating lowered from 4 to 3, which seems appropriate for it. This game just doesn't work at all -- there's nothing to keep you interested while everybody's drawing, and it's just too hard to draw something that can be recognized more than 30% of the time. Really, really not a good drawing game. Again, play iSketch -- or Pictionary.

If you like Pictionary, this could be called Pictionary Cubed.  You randomly combine a who, what and where.  Played this with an office of geeks, and there were some very clever drawings.  But the game lacks a mechanic to make it sustainable fun.  This is one of those games that a fun group would have fun doing, but a dull group will find plenty to dislike.

I love this game! You have to draw crazy scenes and other people have to guess them. I drew Mr.T Performing Surgery On The Subway and another guy drew Martha Stewart Breakdancing in Prison. Even though I stink at drawing, it was hilarious. Great for a party!

This game has the potential to be fun, but the people, places and actions are just WAY too hard to draw most of the time.  And yes, I realize the inability to draw these complicated pictures is what is supposed to be so amusing, and can in fact provide a good laugh; however, it gets annoying and starts to suck the fun factor out when you are trying to draw the impossible every single turn.  Telestrations is so much more fun and a laugh riot!!

This game plays better than pictionary for people who aren't artists or teams that don't have some sort of psychic connection.  Too few cards, though!  After a few playings someone will recognize most of the components.

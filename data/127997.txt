Play with the variant with the most thumbs on BGG before passing judgement. (Very underated game) I like dividing up the tiles into 2 stacks (singles vs doubles) and give each player an equal amount of each stack.

Looser and faster-playing than I expected!  Great depth for playing time.  It's a little early to say that this is a great return-to-form for Knizia, but it is quite a good game and fun to play.  Sure, it shares some elements of [b]T&E[/b] and [b]Ingenious[/b] but it feels like neither of these.  It's almost a racing game.

Initial rating, based on playing once. Lovely presentation, swift-playing. Luck plays a pretty large role, though (it's mostly smoothed out over the turns, but the immediate win condition when placing your last pagoda means that it can determine the winner), and I don't see this having a lot of replay value.

RATING: N/A
A visually appealing abstract with luck Knizia game. The game is quite simple but also engaging because of the race that develops between players. Overall, I enjoy this game and suspect that many family gamers will also.

That being said, the double-color tiles are stronger and benefit whoever draws more of them. Thus, every win seems tainted by the variance/luck in the game.

RATING: 5
Első pillantásra elég egyszerű kis játék, de azért (remélem) ennél több van benne... A szerencse nem kérhető számon egy 10 perces parti után, de mégis érdekes, hogy amikor mindig duplát húztam, akkor ész nélkül lerakva is simán nyertem. Ha pedig valaki sose húz duplát, az esélytelennek tűnik. 
2 fővel viszont egész komoly mélységei is lehetnek, és gyanítom hogy ott legtöbbször a jobb nyer.
Nyomokban a Tigrisre emlékeztet (konfliktus pl.)
A játék vége megoldás kicsit suta, és igazságtalan is?!
Gondolkodtam a kevesebb pontszámon is. Nem rossz játék, de valahogy nem elég kiforrott.

Played as a prototype in the 2012 Festival Internacional de Juegos de Córdoba (Spain)
 
Knizia creates a quite good tile lying game which has some elements that remind his masterpiece T&E.  Much simpler, but quite elegant and efficient.  A race to build pagodas and take the control of some cities to be able to build more pagodas (building them all gives you the victory).  Really enjoyable if you are into such kind of abstracts.

UPDATE: Played the real final version.  The game is really nice, and plays very fast and smooth.

A Knizia abstract that is very simple in rules, but creates tough choices and thinking ahead... like a good abstract should. Players attempt to drop all of their pagodas by smart placement of their tiles which each have two squares of the colors in the game (there are 3 colors in the game). Taking control of villages and taking over other players' provinces with major provinces is the key to the game. I probably won't play it again, but could one day if the opportunity presents itself.

Gorgeous map, very nice pagodas, and top tier tiles, but the theme is definitely pasted on.  Could've easily been early Roman empire instead of Chinese hinterlands before the Qin unification.  Like all R&R games it's easy to teach/play, but like all abstracts can lead to AP and it's very dry.  The Duke is the same price most places and is easier to get to the table, but this is a nice family abstract if you need one that plays 4.

Suffers from the exact problem I feared: you have to constantly not set up the player immediately to your left by leaving a 2-space opening to the next village. 

Seems quite simplistic, but maybe a family take on T&E? Might involve a bit too much 'counting' every turn. 

The real question is, if you have Tigris and Euphrates and Kingdom Builder, why would you need this game? Probably will buy the iPad version if it's reasonably-priced.

Interesting light chess-like game.

I've managed to play it once, and I think it's best as a two-player game. With more players there's too much of a chance that the outcome is affected by a less tactical player, instead of by the one who plays best.

Reiner's stock has fallen so much that even I wasn't expecting much from him when I laid the game out to play, and two, while comparisons to T&E are unfortunate, as they raise expectations, they aren't completely misplaced.

This is not T&E light. However, there are a lot of interesting little tricks and power struggles that can take place with this tile laying game, not unlike T&E. It is also a rather aggressive game, not unlike T&E. It does, however, play out much faster, and it is far easier to explain to people. Although it may take some a game or two to see all that you can do to each other with those simple rules (it is not as straight forward as it seems).

Further play has received a world of threats, parries and feints that force the other player to respond instead of furthering their plans. However, with two players, that is really only seen on the bird board, the lion board is too tight to do that on. 

Actually, the lion board felt too tight to do much of anything on, it seemed to just be lay a double, score a village, then the opponent does the same thing. Very little room for creative play.

What keeps this game from being a ten is the double tiles. Double tiles are no brainers to play, not all that much fun, and if a player gets more than another, it makes them hard to beat. For two players, I play with the variant that each player gets their own identical stack of tiles before play begins.

RATING: 5
I don’t agree with those who claim that this is ”Tigris & Euphrates light”. There are some vague similarities, but I honestly don’t think you can compare the two games. Yes, there is some interaction and you can remove other players’ pieces, but that’s it. The scoring mechanism is vastly different as are the tiles you are laying down, there are no leaders, monuments or catastrophes etc. If I hadn’t heard about the connection before, I probably wouldn’t have made it myself… Now, Qin might of course still be a good game on its own, but to me it was just too simple and not fun. I guess the good part was that it plays very fast which is a plus, and while I’m not going to refuse to play it a couple of times, it’s certainly not a game I would actively seek out. 

The main reasons are that it’s a too simple game and that the double tiles are too powerful compared to the tiles which have two different colors (and the player who only drew double colored tiles except for 4 in the entire game did win in a convincing way). Sure, the two different colored tiles can be handy in situations too, as sometimes you don’t want a double time, but we all thought the double colored tiles were stronger – and “luck of the draw” is not a great mechanism…

Very good tile laying game that has just the right amount of strategy for a relatively quick game.  Played well with my 8 y.o. daughter - we began with open hands so she could get the hang of the game.  I think another good variant for playing with younger kids might be to have the adult draw a 2 tile hand while having younger kids draw the usual 3 tiles.
Fun on the iPad too!

RATING: 7
T&E light? Maybe, maybe not. But it is a tile laying game with different color tiles (although each is actually two colors stuck together, like Ingenious), and making enlarging blobs of each color. It's probably more similar to Ingenious than T&E, but it works for me.

RATING: 4
Qin turned out to be something of a disappointment on the first play. After having read the rules I [i]thought[/i] I was dealing with a game with recognisable elements borrowed from Knizia's undisputed master piece Tigris & Euphrates. There was area control, simple conflict, and tiles; in addition there was a Taluva-like race element which would drive the entire game. Certainly not a bad heritage!

But while playing the game, I noticed that the conflicts which would provide a lot of the bite were rather rare, and difficult to set up, too! Some elementary math quickly confirmed that players will not easily go out of their way to attack each other, turning the game into a rather boring snoozefest of quickly building off your pagodas and only, [i]only[/i], interrupting this process when you can easily increase the relative point distance between you and another comptetitor. There is little sense of lying low and then attacking in force, or creating beautiful long-term patterns: it is all build-build-build-briefly fight-build-build-build. I found the proceedings rather boring, to be honest.

Now on the other hand the amount of conflict is probably just right for more casual players who don't want to be shown every corner of the board; and that would mean that Qin is simply not conceived for the type of gamer I belong to. But to be sure I'd need to play a few more times: it's notoriously hard to be sure with Knizia, as victory conditions in his games have a nasty way of creeping up on you. So while I award the game a low rate, I am more than willing to be corrected on the matter. It is also not a [i]bad[/i] game persé... But it's simply not for me, and that means that the rate becomes small. Perhaps somewhat undeservedly so.

Components: Attractive board, and fun details on the tiles, with a few different designs per color. Sturdy, stackable pagodas.

Experience: Tense and fun. It feels a bit like Othello in that I try to command the center without exposing an edge that my opponent can use to race to a village. It's tough to know when it's okay to remain small, or when I need to become safe, and then if I'm safe whether I should grow or not. Lots of great tactical plays.

Largely derivative of Tigris and Euphrates, which is one of my all-time favorites.  In both games luck can be a factor in who wins.  But in Tigris the game is longer, your hand is larger, and you can choose to draw new tiles, all of which lessen the luck factor.

Here, the game is short and you only draw three tiles, leaving luck to predominate too much for my taste.

Qin is één van de Essen-releases uit het rijke lijstje van Pegasus. Een Reiner Knizia daarbovenop, dus het belooft één van de lichtere, snel speelbare spellen te zijn. In Qin ga je puzzelen met tegels om te proberen jouw pagodes op het bord te krijgen. De speler die er als eerste in slaagt om al z'n pagodes weg te spelen, wint het spel. 

Als je aan de beurt bent, neem je één van de drie tegels in je hand, leg je deze op het speelbord, plaats je eventueel een pagode en neemt een nieuwe tegel. De tegels zijn rechthoeken die bestaan uit twee gekleurde vierkanten in alle mogelijke combinaties met de kleuren rood, blauw en geel. Als er door het leggen van je tegel volgende situatie ontstaat, zijn er gevolgen aan gekoppeld :

- 2 of meer vierkanten van dezelfde kleur aan elkaar grenzen = opgerichte provincie --> plaats een pagode
- extra tegel(s) aan een eigen provincie aanleggen
- vanaf het moment dat je provincie uit minstens 5 vierkanten bestaat = grote provincie --> een extra pagode op de vorige plaatsen
- als je provincie grenst aan één van de voorgedrukte dorpen op het bord --> plaats een pagode op het dorp
- indien je een grotere provincie aansluit op een dorp neem je het dorp over --> plaats een eigen pagode op het dorp en verwijder de pagode die er stond
- indien je jouw provincie aansluit bij een andere provincie(s) van dezelfde kleur, neemt de grootste provincie de kleinere over --> verwijder de pagode(s) van de kleinere provincie(s)

Zo gauw een speler al z'n pagodes kan inzetten, wint hij het spel. Indien dit niet lukt en alle tegels zijn opgebruikt, wint de speler die het meeste pagodes heeft ingebracht.

Players are warlords in medieval China, trying to expand their influence by acquiring land.  Players take turns to place one of their land tiles, from a hand of three, out onto the board.  Tiles are similar to dominoes, having one of three colours on each half.  They must be placed adjacent to existing tiles.  A pagoda is placed on tile groupings of two or more, and a double pagoda is placed on a grouping of five or more - and is safe from conquest.  Neutral villages, and neighbouring pagodas, may be swallowed up by surrounding, larger areas.  First player to place all their pagodas wins the game.  Simplistic, but not simple to play, Knizia tile layer.  Distinct whiff of several games here ... Eurphrat, Samurai, Einfach Genial, and so on.  And the goal is simple - get your pagodas out faster than your opponents.  Clever, and tricky.  Early indications are it is very good.

Idea
Win by placing all your pagodas on a map.

Mechanism
play 2 square tiles on a map. Each tile has 3 colors. If you form area of at least 2 same color place pagoda there. Fight others by conquering their pagodas by joining bigger area to theirs. Also conquer neutral cities by having more pagodas around them. 

To whom:
Strategy of placement is important. Game is still quick. Easy to learn harder to master.

One of the simplest games from my favorite designer: matching colors using dominos-eque tiles. I'm sure this gets more negative for the randomness of tile draw (you can do phenomenally well if the tiles are good to you) and the simplicity of the strategy.

That said, I find this an absolutely excellent game for a newer audience. Your pagodas give a nice vertical feel to the board and the result is always satisfying to look at. Rules are easy enough to explain, but complex enough to intrigue newer people into the hobby.

Enjoyable plays with 2. Short and light yet satisfying, with a pleasant information horizon. Mostly tactical, but you can take risks by planning ahead to merge provinces, take over villages, or ignore threats by others to do the same. You may be able to see your victory before it officially arrives, which can make for a less dramatic climax for the winning player.

This is my favourite racing game (so far). First to build all of their pagodas wins! It is easy to learn and easy to teach to new casual players. The board is double sided so you can choose what landscape you are in the mood for, which I frankly think should be used in a lot more games. You normally stack tiles at the side of the board but I mini pimped my copy with a Chinese symbol bag to draw tiles out of. We loved it so much and played it so frequently when we got it that I also got the extra board expansion. 

The more you play, the more you realise there is more than meets the eye. I was able to win several games drawing mostly single [two different colours] coloured tiles. It's about clever tile placement and hand management. I also managed to lose some games drawing double colour tiles and becoming overconfident. So the double colour tile is not necessarily that powerful. The ratio is approx 50% of single/double which may be more valid in 2 player games. You always need to watch what your opponent is doing though, and your goal (if not placing pagodas yourself) should be to capitalise on villages they are ignoring and return their pagodas to their hand. An excellent strategic, tactical, area control, racing, tile placement game for 2!

Elements of T&E, Ingenious, Acquire, but much lighter than T&E.  Has luck-of-draw through tile-drawing.  Concern about imbalance: are same-coloured tiles much too strong in comparison to the dual-coloured tiles (though perhaps less an issue on Lion side of board)?  Also seems most chaotic/luck-driven/tactical with four players, and perhaps best with less players.  Can try the iPad app first to see if it's your thing.

Gaming: This is an underrated game. It's definitely abstract, but the art and components are great, and the gameplay is deceptively easy.

The strategy changes depending on the number of players and their tactics.

3x 2-players

The good doctor comes back to his early successes. After a few good games with numbered cards (the lost cities/colossal arena/schotten-totten family), a new rather nice game with tiles. Indeed Qin game clearly belongs to the same series of designs as Samurai/Genial!/T&E. It is simple, fast and actually enjoyable. A nice filler game.

Very simple abstract, reminds me of a simplified Tigris and Euphrates (One I didn't like!) but I really like Qin.

Gameplay is simple (Play a tile) but the strategy is to look for opportunities to attack territory whilst defending your own.

As is typical for Knizia he combines several elements from other games of his to create something similar yet recognizably different. In this case, there is a little bit of Tigris & Euphrates, some Rheinländer, and a sprinkling of Topas.

The result is a fast-playing tile-layer that is much closer to Topas than T&E. While conflicts do exist they are fairly rare and hard to set up. The game is mostly a race to connect the various villages on the board, and how well that works depends on the tiles drawn. A family-compatible filler.

This is a surprisingly easy game to learn. Once you learn it, then playing it is kind of chess like. You build provinces and merge them, or take over smaller provinces of your opponents. You conquer villages or take over opponents villages. The little plastic pagodas are neat.

I like it. Medium heavy euro in the old RK's fashion.
A little bit of T&E and Ingenious mixed together.
The funniest thing is that RK created a game with a snowball effect that stops not only opponents of the snowball creater, but can also be used against him!

Ninteen plays. Qin is an excellent thirty-minute game, one with rules simple enough to make it suitable for playing with the family but interesting enough to make it worthwhile for gamers who want something short and relaxing. Each turn the player must place one colored tile on the board from his hand of three; groups of same-colored tiles become provinces, and the player that creates a new province claims it with one of his pagodas. The goal is for a player to be the first to play all his pagodas to the board, and this is accomplished by creating and expanding new provinces as described and annexing the neutral villages. In some cases larger provinces can take over opponents' smaller ones, adding another element of tension and interest.

Some have criticized the game as being too luck-driven, as it is clearly better to draw tiles with matching colors than it is to draw tiles with two different colors, but this, I think, is part of what makes the game interesting. To play intelligently, players need to find or create opportunities to play their mixed-color tiles advantageously and save their doubles for the higher-stakes moments. 

The board comes with two sides, the “bird” side and the “lion” side. The bird board is wide-open with only 11 villages, and is probably the best option for a four-player game or a strategic one. The lion board is more constricted, with 19 villages and several lakes, and so will be a faster game with perhaps a little more luck involved. There is also a double-sided expansion board available. 

Overall, I would recommend Qin highly to fans of Knizia's other short family abstracts such as Ingenious, Through the Desert, Indigo and Callisto.

RATING: 6
Qin is an area control abstract where players expand provinces of a few different colors. Anyone can control any province, but the larger one will absorb the smaller. Whoever places all their control pagodas on the board first is the winner. Qin plays like a more abstracted and simpler Tigris and Euphrates. Absorbing areas is fun, and the game keeps it interesting by having five-tile areas safe from takeovers. This makes the contesting of areas constantly move throughout the board as the game progresses. Double-colored tiles can feel a bit strong, but distribution of tiles is about 50/50 between doubles and singles. The randomness here rarely feels unfair. Qin is light and pleasant. A fun abstract.

I might overlook something here but for me, the dominant strategy seems to be to draw as many doubles as possible.  Therefore: nice & easy game but far too luck dependent for what it seemsto be.

RATING: 7
There are a lot of options and decisions to be made in Qin in a very short time frame of 20 – 30 minutes.  This is a hallmark of most Knizia designs, and he doesn't disappoint in that department with this new creation.  What keeps the game from being brilliant, however, are three main issues:  

* Overly powerful "same color" tiles that are drawn randomly
* Players do not always have an equal number of turns
* The "weak player" syndrome, which can unduly benefit the player seated to his left.

Laszlo Molnar of Italy has suggested a solution to mitigate the “luck of the draw” issue, giving each player a deck of tiles containing an equal number of the powerful “same color” tiles.  Giving each player an equal number of turns also seems fair.  However, as mentioned, I am surprised these issues are present in a Knizia design.  They may prove to be game-killers for some, but will likely be disappointing to many.  For those disappointed, I recommend trying Molnar’s set-up variant and tinkering with other possible solutions, as the game is worth the effort.

RATING: 6
A typical small game from Knizia: almost completely abstract tile laying, pretty quick, with very simple rules. In that sense, it reminds me of his own "Genesis", but while that used dice to limit the tiles that could be played, "Qin" uses the more common hand of tiles. Also, it has a simpler victory condition: be the first to build all your pagodas. The tiles are like dominoes, with two squares in any of three colors. In you turn, you just place a tile, resolve effects of that placement (usually building one or more pagodas) and draw another tile. The game works smoothly, but maybe it is just a bit too simple, with too much luck in the tile draws (doubles are strong). It is a fine game as a meatier filler, but I don't think it deserved the big box treatment from the publisher.

Played at Salt Con.  Very quick tile-laying game.  About as simplistic as tile-laying could be, perhaps too much so.  Reminiscent of several other Knizias, including Through the Desert, Tigris & Euphrates, and Rheinlander.  It didn't feel that fresh and the double tiles seemed frankly unbalanced.  But even with that, I have a suspicion I may end up really enjoying this game if I play it several times.

One of the better Knizia games I have. What can I say? All the good traits (and bad ones) about Knizia are at present right here in this game.

I do love this game, also in a league with Alhambra in that it's an easy game to bring to table with almost anyone.

RATING: 7
Qin is a Knizia tile-laying game, focusing on placement of area-control tokens, "pagodas", on a square three-color grid of played tiles.

While some compare this to T&E (tile-laying, area-control, square grid), and others to Samurai (numeric based area-control, tokens), and some even to Ingenious (color-based grid, two-ended tiles), I see it as just another inversion of the tile-laying concept from our Ingenious Dr. K., taking us Through the Desert to the Kingdoms of China with Qin.

The concept is that placing two-blocks together creates a controllable territory, and  player can place a 1st pagoda. Adding to the territory to a size of 5 makes it a major territory, and a 2nd pagoda can be added to the 1st. Merging two territories is also possible, either friendly or unfriendly, but a Major territory is also safe from takeovers.

An unfriendly takeover removes foreign pagodas, providing some interaction.

There are also some neutral villages on the boards, which if unclaimed can be annexed to territories they abut, and a pagoda added.  If a village is surrounded by more foreign pagodas than friendly then the pagoda is replaced by the sieging player's token, another interactive play.

The 1st player to place all their pagodas wins- so straight area-control is not the goal as much as strategic placement, much like Knizia's other tile-laying games, but not rewarding players by set collection or connection as much as by control tokens that remain in play, which seems different enough from other tile-laying games that it is a fresh take on tile-laying.

Because the scoring is simple- a single track count of pagodas in play- it is not as deep a game as the other ones mentioned where multiple sets come into play, or tile scoring in multiple directions occurs, but that is fine to me.

I am very much a fan of Knizia tile-laying games, and this is a welcome contribution to the mix he has created.

(Rating based on iOS only.)  An area-control abstract, made particularly interesting because instead of building up points for large ares (a la Rosenkoenig), it's a race to get rid of pagodas.  Scores are apparent and defeat is instantaneous.  On first plays, luck of the draw isn't a problem.  There is strategy in figuring out good plays (sometimes just defensive) for the non-double tiles and when to use the doubles.  True, sometimes you might have all doubles and that's a nice feeling, but use them well because you'll have to weather other points in the game when your hand is less strong.  Challenging and quick.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (April 2017)

As soon I realized Qin´s designer was Reiner Knizia, my desire to play the game plummeted. It´s been years now since I liked one of his designs and Qin is no exception. I didn’t like the game.

The rules are pretty simple, you can explain them under 4 minutes. Playtime is around 40 minutes with 4 players.

The game´s component and art are ok. 

Qin is an abstract game with no theme whatsoever (as is usual from Mr. Knizia). Abstract games aren´t my cup of tea although there are exceptions.

The decisions needed to play the game aren’t very hard, but they aren’t too obvious either. Qin has some depth but I don’t think I will explore it further. When is your turn you have to place a tile in the board trying to place more pagodas than your opponents, still the game is way too simple for our tastes. 

Tile laying is perhaps my most disliked mechanism.

Luck plays a relevant role in the game (a minus for me). Also, it seems the tiles that only have one color are much more powerful than the other ones. Due to this, it is perhaps played as a two player game, but in that case, attacking would be scarcer.

I’m surprised R&R Games publish abstract games. At first I thought they only published party games, but then they published the excellent Mombasa, so I guess they now publish any kind of game.

Bottom line, Qin is way too simple for us, I was bored by it. It is reminiscent of Tigris & Euphrates but a lot lighter. I believe the tiles are unbalanced and it has way too much luck of the draw. In general, I don’t like abstract games nor tile laying games so I dislike Qin, however, it could be a good game to introduce new gamers to our hobby or to play with the family but I will sell my copy of the game ASAP.

A perfectly cromulent effort from Knizia that works well, but doesn't come close to surpassing its most obvious cousins like Through the Desert and Tigris & Euphrates. I'm not generally a fan of tile-laying games, and I dislike how powerful the single color tiles seem to be.

I do really like how the game was made simultaneously available on iOS and in physical format. I hope that this results in increased sales. In this era of boardgame publishers shrinking away from risk by using kickstarter, I appreciate the extra effort put forth up front on this game.

This game is pretty easy to learn, but pretty difficult to play well until you've tried a couple of times.  Double tiles are much, much better than singles.  Make sure you shuffle them well.

it's pronounced kin, not chin. As in "kin domino". Board should be modular. Rules: 2+=1 pagoda, 5+=2 pagodas and permanent; goal is to get rid of your pagodas.﻿ Build to villages to get rid of your pagoda and defend/surround that village.

played once, the idea is nice but it doesn't go anywhere. It's just bland. Would not care to play it again, but perhaps I'm missing something.

I think it's really fine for what it is: a short and light "gamer filler" or "family strategy game" that is pure Knizia: Acquire-like merging, Samurai-like influence over villages, Ingenious-like double tiles and some very light T&E feel.

Qin has fast become one of my favorite games of all time. It's essentially a lot like dominoes, except with only three colours on the tiles combined with an area control aspect. It's easy to teach and fast to play. 

I love the tactical nature of the game and how the players have to adapt and react to the ever changing gameboard. I love how all players are all involved all the time. Everyone is watching what others are doing in the hopes they can capitalize on their moves or mistakes. I love the area control aspect of the game, finding efficient ways to create bigger provinces and making sure your small provinces can't be taken over. 

Finally, I love that it's a race which rewards efficiency. A fantastic game by Knizia that has made me want to play his other abstract games.

This is a really fun family game. It has about the same fun, rules simplicity and toy factor as Through the Desert or Ingenious. The problem is this is 2013, not 1998 so the good Doctor's designs are not as highly regarded as they used to be. 
The luck factor of having the tiles with just one color can be very powerful, but the same could be said of the double auction card in Modern Art, In Modern Art that card doesn't ruin that game, so I am not sure that there isn't a way to overcome the more powerful tile in this game. It just may take some time learning the game better to accomplish.  Unfortunately, with the the plethora of releases these days people don't spend as much time exploring games as they used to.
Personally, it reminds me of why I started playing designer boardgames about 10 years ago. My favorite games pack a lot of meaningful decision into a tight 30-60 minute timeframe and have a ruleset that can be understood in 5 minutes  Qin fits that description very well.

This is a pleasing balance of simplicity, speed and just a little bit of agression. It's a cross between T&E and Samurai with all the (many) awful bits of Samurai removed. Review of iOS version here: http://www.gamezebo.com/games/reiner-knizias-qin/review

You immediately recognize that Knizia is behind this. It's quick to explain and yet it's deeper than it appears on first glance. The luck factor might be just a tad too high for a game this abstract.

RATING: 7.5
Nice, classic type of abstract euro. It's my favorite area control game to play when Small World isn't an option. Very quick with 2 players. It's bit dry looking but at least the components are good quality. Very "classic" type of Knizia, it's super fast to learn, but you can get pretty deep into it if you want to. Double-sided board is nice touch.

2-Player Comment:
* Qin works well with two. Abstract fans will probably prefer it that way.

Tentative rating. This has an 'older' feel than most current games, reminding me of games of the 90s and early 2000s including Knizia's other games such as Samurai (which I like much more, I think). 

It actually feels a lot like a simplified, refined Carcassonne, but without same the charm. 

I haven't played with the second board, but I would like to.

I actually liked this one surprisingly much. Sure, it's very basic and simple Knizia and therefore nothing we haven't seen before, but I enjoyed the simplicity, the visuals and the feel of the game.

There is a huge luck factor, since you pull the tiles randomly and the double-tiles are way better than the other ones. This probably puts off most more serious players, but I was okay with it, I prefer games to have some luck. If Qin DIDN'T have the luck factor, I probably wouldn't like it at all, because I simply lack the logic oriented brain to win in totally abstract games like this one.

Plus you can play the game with a variant, in which you draw SIX tiles instead of three. This will mend the luck factor some.

RATING: 6
Very cool abstract game. Sort of feels like a mash-up of Acquire, Dominoes, and T&E. If you like any or all of those games, it's safe to say that you'll enjoy Qin as well. The game is pretty straightforward, but I like that there is a lot of room for creative play. Just make sure you play with the full player count. Otherwise the interaction just isn't where it should be. I also prefer the dragon side of the map as opposed to the bird side, but having two different maps out of the box is great. I think I would like this game even more though if there were modular tiles that made up the playing area. 

The luck may be slightly higher than I would like, but it's about on par with Tigris and Euphrates, for the most part. It just really sucks when you end up with a hand of three identical tiles. I almost wonder if a variant where there are 2 or 3 on offer would help mitigate the randomness to some degree. Either way, it's quite pleasant to play, and it can range from confrontational to solitaire-ish depending on those playing.

---Preliminary thoughts---

A Knizia abstract fast game at its core.

Tile layer with some easy strategy game that can work well as a gateway game.

It gains more randomness with more than 2 players, because your areas are more vulnerable to being taken over.

You must constantly create new areas in order to win, that opens many ways for rivals to take over your areas.

I don't see any potential interest for a gamer, besides the first few games.

We will start this at a 7. It did not blow me away as many Knizias have, but a lighter version of T&E should be able to get some table time at least.

Updated to 7.5. I'm really liking this, especially with 4. The game has a similar dynamic and pacing to classic Knizias like Battle Line and Samurai, where early setup moves pay off with thrilling finishes, when every move counts. I just had a newcomer beat me in a duel where I would have won on the next move, but a clever play allowed him to upgrade to a major province and steal a city in one and leapfrog to the victory. Lots of fun.

And updated even higher. Tough to think of a tile-laying game with this much conflict and interesting decisions that plays so quickly and with such a small rule set.

Aaand higher. I was able to eke out two victories after bad starts and with people ganging up on me, and it was absolutely thrilling. This is a classic game in the making.

Very neat abstract game. It's fast and it's simple. After two plays I'm not yet sure how tactical it can be but it was very thought provoking on the second go already so am very much looking forward to playing again. 

I'm really starting to like this game. I wonder how I'll feel about this after a few more plays. I'm really looking forward to playing this with players who will take time to think about their moves. Tile laying is really important (orientation and colour sequence) so am really looking forward to playing this more often.

This tactical abstract somehow combines Dominoes with Tigris & Euphrates.  It's a filler, and it definitely reminds me of a lot of abstract mobile phone games that are coming out these days (which is probably a goal, since it was co-released on iOS).  I guess it's neat if you're into that sort of thing, but it wasn't deep enough for me.

A game I have wanted to play since I first read about it in Spielbox a really long time ago. I like abstracts and I like dominoes. It sounded cool. It is a very fast abstract too and that is always a plus. You have to try and block others from better larger area controls and you want to get your temples down do you try to over take other regions. It is a nice abstract and I would play it more if Dan brought it around more. I quite liked it and would try to pick it up in a math trade.

A surprising bit of fun.  Super easy to explain, fairly quick to play (first game was about 40 minutes with four players, three of them were new), and full of difficult decisions.

Not sure if I'd be interested in a longer game (with the "tough side of the board") though...plays well enough as a mid-weight filler.

RATING: 6
Some comparisons had been made to Tigris & Euphrates but they turned out to be mostly cosmetic. It's a far lighter game in which you try to create areas of one colour, connect them to villages, and possibly swallow up your opponents' areas by merging them with yours. It played in about 15 mins and was fun enough, but not enough game for the box and price to pick up. An app version came out at the same time, and it seems tailor-made for that, but sadly it's iPad only.

(comments after a single play)

Pros:
* Very quick setup (especially if you use a draw bag for the tiles).
* Four different board configurations for variability (if you have the Toad/Dragon board).
* Quick and simple. The rules can be explained in a couple of minutes.
* Played very well with two
* Lots of player interaction and direct attacks that don't feel spiteful.

Cons:
* Luck of the draw can have a huge impact at crucial moments. On the plus side, we felt that both players had an equal share of bad luck and it's not like your long term plans can be foiled - because you can't really have long term plans in this game.

I played a demo of this at BGG Con and immediately bought a copy. Qin is a simple, strategic color matching game with some area control aspects that scales well for 2 to 4 players. After several dozen plays, I think 3 players is probably the sweet spot due to more competition with turns still coming around quickly, but it's still really good with 2 or 4.

The strategy elements end up being much deeper than you first expect, and the game gets more and more competitive with each play. Even after playing this way too much, I'm still enjoying the game and highly recommend it.

Still, I'm only rating it an 8, because the game doesn't have a huge amount of depth or variation. There are two different game "maps" on which to play (one of each side of the board), and both tend to have the same general progression of play. Players of more traditional strategy games will really enjoy this, while people who are more into Eurogames or high theme Amerigames probably won't. Still, this is a favorite at my house, despite some of its minor shortcomings.

Better than Carcassone. Tangibly more tactical. The positioning of the tiles to block or hinder other players and improve your own prospects, the expansion and overtaking of provinces, and the jockeying over cities all lends a great depth to the game, more than that's available in Carcassone.

Tournament rules (equal tiles for players, no random draw)  make it very strategic.

very incremental progress each turn means that (a) there is a noticeable first turn advantage, and (b) you simply cannot recover from a mistake or string of bad luck.

30-05-2014. Rated after 1 play. I typically do not enjoy abstract boardgames, and instead enjoy highly thematic games. Qin is really abstract (although it has some theme pased on), but I do enjoy this game quite a bit.

The game resolves about playing tiles with various colors, to build areas of one color. Once you have an area, you put in one of your pagoda pieces to mark it's yours. In the game you aim to get rid of your 15 pagoda's (more with less players) by getting area majority either by building new areas or taking over opponents area's by connecting your larger area with their smaller area (not counting the connecting piece). If you connect to one of the villages pre-printed on the board, you can mark them as well with one of your pagoda's when you have most pagoda's connecting to that village.

Interesting entry-level multiplayer abstract. Nevertheless too much dependancy on lucky draw: if you don't get those single-colored tiles, you have absolutely no chance at all to get rid of your pagodas let alone to take over a village- one half of your two-colored tiles will serve most certainly as an opportunity for the other players.

Qin --

We played on the busier side of the board.

This is the type of game which falls squarely into Rich's bailiwick — area influence, conversion, and control. The game has rather pretty and varied artwork, but it does little to camouflage the game's fundamentally abstract core.

I normally detest abstract games, but Herr Knizia understands the value of limiting a player's choices. There are only three tile colors, and tiles can only be placed next to existing colors. The limited possibilities allow a player to choose quickly, and the limited number of pagodas prevents the game from outlasting the players' interest.

Tigris & Euphrates 'lite' set in ancient China. Each turn, players chose one tile from a hand of three two-space tiles (of varying combinations of three colours) to place on the board. Anything that forms two of the same colour creates a 'province' and allows players to seed a Pagoda on the tile formation. Another way to place a pagoda is to get same-coloured tiles adjacent to a 'village'. This allows you to place a pagoda on said village. First to rid themselves of all the Pagodas wins. 

Of course, in Tigris style, you can 'war' by connecting more of the same coloured tiles to another lot of your opponents'. You then create an untouchable 'major' province and get to plonk another pagoda down.

Very tactical in nature: all about letting your opponents get you closer to the villages so you can swoop in and about not giving away chances for opponents to form provinces with errant placement. 

There's some spatial/colour recognition required and no doubt some will 'get' it or 'see' it better than others. Want to win a game of this? Play against me. :-)

The iOS version is superb and might well make the boardgame redundant.

Knizia új absztrakt játéka. Minden körben három elemből választva városokat építünk 3 színben. Ahol kettő vagy nagyobb város alakul ki egy színből, rárakhatjuk egy épületünket. Kiemelt részt elérve, annak a négy oldalán legtöbb befolyással rendelkező szintén lerakhat egy épületét. A cél minél hamarabb letenni az adott számú épületünket a játékban. A játékkal annyi a gond, hogy a lapkákon mindig két épület van és vannak lapkák, amin mindkettő egyszínű, erre alapból le lehet ugye rakni egy épületünket bárhova is rakjuk, ez nagy előnynek tűnik. 4-en játszva erősen királycsinálós lehet. Egyértelműen ketten lehet a legjobb, de legszámolósabb is. Kniziának úgy érzem lefelé megy jelenleg az útja, ez a játék nagyon nem jött be most.

This will likely rise. I'm pleasantly surprised by this game. I brushed it off when I first heard of it around it's initial release. It looked like a dumbed town T&E. I came across it again recently and purchased the iOS app.

It's everything I love in a filler game. There are interesting choices to make and it doesn't overstay its welcome. There are low rules-overhead, no end game scoring, very little take down/set up time (I assume, judging from the app and pics). 

I think of this like a race game. First to place all their pagodas wins. More often than not, you will be placing one on the board each turn. If you're lucky or clever, two. You can attack your opponents thru mergers and taking majority for villages. The back and forth of the game is really fun.

I look forward to playing this more.

2 plays

The double-tiles are extremely powerful since they allow you to immediately place a pagoda, and to extend your province to connect to another smaller province. The luck of the draw in the basic game can be huge. A nice variant to reduce the randomness: give each player the same set of tiles and either they arrange their personal decks or randomize their own decks. I'd prefer the latter, since I don't know the best way to stack the deck!

It's a good game, I suppose, but it's just a bit too abstract for my tastes. 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board is double-sided, with an easy side and a hard one. It shows a grid of squares, with 3 colored squares (provinces), and several 1-2 square villages. There are 12 copies of each tile, which show either 2 of the same color or 2 different colors. Shuffle all the tiles and give each player 3. Players get a number of pagodas based on player count.

On your turn, play a tile then draw a tile. When playing a tile, must play it adjacent to a colored square already on the board. If you create a 2-square area of one color, place your pagoda on it. If you grow an area to 5 spaces, the owner places a second pagoda there and it is save the rest of the game. If you connect to a similar-colored region with fewer squares, the pagoda there is returned to the player (sort of like Acquire acquisition) -- double-pagodas are, of course, immune. You may not connect provinces of equal size and same color. If you connect province to a village, place a pagoda there (if others connect later, the player with more pagodas touching the village controls it and places their pagoda there).

The first player to play all their pagodas wins. Otherwise, play until all legal plays done, then player with fewest remaining pagodas wins.

A very Knizia styled game and, as always, it's a very well balanced game with lots of abstraction to deal with.

Clever, fast paced and fun.

I don't know how to play it actually but I like it either way. I must give it a deeper thought sometime in the future.

A simpler Tigris and Euphrates. It's fun. Don't know what else to say. I'm not the best at it but I still enjoy the challenge of competing against others in this style.

Quick tile-laying filler. Players take turns placing domino tiles in order to create regions of 2+ tiles of the same colour, which can be claimed with a pagoda. There are also super-regions (5+ spaces), neutral regions to capture (most adjacent pagodas) and rules for combining, absorbing and capturing.

It's simple and plays very smoothly and quickly the luck factor of the tile draw can be frustrating. In particular, the tiles with two spaces of the same colour always very strong.

Not a deep game but a very good filler.

This has a slick simplicity that is very appealing and very typical of many a Reiner Knizia game.  Played and enjoyed with 4.  Curious to see whether the game with 2 feels like it has to be more carefully controlled.  P.S. Several games later, I'd say 2 players is fine but I like the game best with 3.

RATING: 8.5
Quick, relatively light (but not super easy), basically abstract game. Very nice as a family or gateway game. I like that it has some "take that" play to it, but it's a minor feature and having it done to you doesn't set you back significantly as in other games. I look forward to playing many more times.

An old-school tile-laying game from Reiner Knizia in the grand tradition. The box features some colorful Chinese characters standing before a big pagoda, but let me stop you right here -- if you're looking for theme, forget it. As with most of his titles, it's game first, theme...whenever. And for that I am delighted. 

I see many have said this is Euphrat & Tigris light, but other than the fact that you lay tiles in both, I really don't see it. It's more a clever combination of Ingenious and Samurai.

Qin is a fast, tactical tile laying experience pumped with addictive replay value you find in app games. If Knizia only stuck to these small, thinky gems I would be content.

Like everyone else, I saw this and had hopes for a medium weight Knizia tile-laying game. It's actually pretty light and played in about 25 minutes (with 4 playing quickly) but it just didn't seem to do [i]quite[/i] enough to justify picking it up.

That said, I don't think it is particularly luck dependant; certainly not to the extent it probably seems on a first play.

RATING: N/A
Szabály alapján Tigris light vagy absztrakt Carcassonne-nak éreztem. Mindenesetre benne vannak azok a fura tiltó szabályok, ami miatt szerintem a Tigrishez áll közelebb: nem szabad összekötni két olyan területet, ahol döntetlen lenne az eredmény.

Szerintem elég konfrontatív a játék. Magas az interakció és térképen zajlik a csata. De azért még kell játszanom a Tigris-el is, hogy Tigris light-ként emlegethessem. 

Megvan benne az a tipikusan Kniziás érzés. De a csata komoly, az biztos hogy nem beszélhetünk békés egymás mellett építkezésről. A tábla elég hamar beszűkül annyira, hogy egymásba akadjunk.

A light-ság talán csak a lapkahúzás szerencséje miatt van. De egyenlőre még nem tudom, mennyire befolyásolja ez a játékélményt.

Un abstrait qui reprend une portion des idées de Tigres & Euphrates, mais qui semble manquer de profondeur. Les conflits ne sont pas facile à générer et ça mène à une simple course pour se débarraser des ses pions.

Overall, Qin does seem like it evolved from a number of games, and does show it's lineage to E&T.  It's a much lighter game, and does play fairly quick again AI on the iOS version.

For tile placement, because the game is a race to play all of your tiles (15), there is a struggle between trying to strengthen your areas for defense at the cost of not adding a pagoda during that turn.

After playing around 20 games, it does appear to be a disadvantage to going first, at least on the 'starter' board.  Since you can not reach a village on your first turn, most of the time you're opening up a village takeover for your opponents on their first turn.  This does seem to have a cascading effect for the next few rounds as the middle villages are quickly occupied.  Maybe not a design flaw, but will try the other board and see if this is still an issue.

Update: After many more plays, this game is turning out to be basically a luck-driven, king making fest.  No where near the strategic level of E&T and other Knizia classics.

So simple, it's elusive:  either increase your territory, or deploy more pagodas.  But which play makes which event happen?  This is tile-laying at it's most approachable, and Qin makes a fine family game, but someone always gets the two benefits backwards.

RATING: 8.8
The high score is due to my children.  This game is a hit in our house.  They love to play it.  And since I have 3 daughters....I can play it with all of them  ;).
The fun is that I can search for deeper strategy ( but still let the children win :p)...and on the same time, the kids seem to pick up strategy pretty fast.
So If I would have to rate it for my own , it would score a little lower, because it's not 100 % my type of game.   But since the game offers the whole family fun, I'm obliged to give it a family score. ;)
The graphics are nice too...

Not quite sure what to think about Qin yet. Likely requires a few more plays but the initial play was just ok, perhaps even slightly disappointing given my expectations for Knizia's work. The game itself is light and extremely tactical. With 4, the game flows quickly and there is very little downtime. This should normally be considered a plus, except that the game lacked tension.

 We played the Lion board which was supposed to be the advanced board but the game felt almost solitaire-ish. Sure, you can merge provinces but that hardly ever happened. Every player seem content to build "upwards" on their own little column and scored villages all by themselves without too much overlap. It felt that the advanced board had too many villages and thus, an easy way for players to place two of their pagodas in a turn when they formed a province. No one was forced to engage in conflict via mergers and the most interaction came from block or cutting off other player's paths. Given that the villages are larger and the numbers are fewer on the basic Phoenix board, I would think that that basic board would actually be more competitive. 

Given my love for Knizia's designs, perhaps my expectations were too high going in. I certainly think this game is light and family-friendly, but not sure if it will have staying power. I am not about to throw in the towel just yet.

Commented after first play. The game is totally abstract, the theme could be whatever and would not change the game at all. But the game is a clever tile game, where each player tries to expand his own colored areas and block others while trying to capture the villages on the board. Simple and fast game, but nothing special. I can play again, but I don't think I would buy this.

Now that I've played several Knizia games I'm noticing they're all very similar. Not a bad area control game; low investment to learn and plays fairly quickly. Probably better with more than two players for maximum interaction on the map but not terrible with two.

Finally, Knizia at his best again. 
I love this game: clean, simple, deep, fast, a lot of interaction, many things you want to do, a hard decision to decide which one to complete. i truly love it and immediately bought it, against my religion of "wait for lower prices".
Honestly, i can't understand how this game is so underrated.
The only problem i see is that maybe in 4 players you will not be able to control the situation too much. In three players it was perfect. great game!

Rating 5 as a 3 player game. Too high amount of luck for an abstract game. Kingdom maker problem: A bad move of player A gives player B the win, and player C can't do anything to prevent it. I was told by others that it's better with just two players.

Rating 7 as a 2 player game.

Quick filler with colorful components, and the rules can be explained to newcomers in under five minutes. That pretty much pushes all the right buttons for a game in the family category. Pretty decent, but not spectacular. It doesn't strive to be.

While calling this Tigris & Euphrates light is probably stretching things too far... it is a nice light confrontational tile layer.  In fact, I enjoyed it even more than I thought I would and would like to try it in a regular rotation with some of my other favorite tile laying games... especially if I can pick up some of those promo maps so there is even more to explore!

Rákattantunk. Pörgős, gyors, egyszerre több is lemegy belőle alkalmanként. Ketten is ajánlott, de 3-4 fő az igazi a falu visszafoglalás miatt, igazi szívatás jöhet úgy létre. A haladó tábla még keményebb, ott rendesen "kaszabolás" folyik. Tervben van egyszer a kiegészítő (két) tábla  megvásárlása is.

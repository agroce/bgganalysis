A "must", Flat Top is the top to understand carrier warfare in 1942. 

During a longtime, I was an owner af the avalon hill edition (worn out!). I was able to buy an earlier battleline version, and, surprisingly, I find its game components by far superior for the counters and the map. But the avalon hill rulebook is better than Battleline 's one, for some refined rules
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This has always been my all time favorite WarGame.  This 2 player carrier battle game was one of the first to implement "fog of war" type rules, which required players to actively hunt down carrier groups before you could send out strikes to kill them.  Awesome game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It has its moments, but it takes an age to set up and you have to ask if the time to read the rules, get to know it and become good at it is worth it.  So, IMO, the law of diminishing returns comes into affect heavily with this game.  It's not a bad game as such, but I'd much sooner play Midway or any of the simple-middling AH games, or an SPI (like Seelowe) that's on the hard side of average.  That's why I've only played this game twice.  On the other hand, if you love massive complexity and naval games, this may be for you.

South Pacific carrier WW2 game, not Midway, 1942, US versus Japan.
Did I love this game, and so did my friends.

Very detailed.
Highly recommended.

Almost the perfect game when run blind by a competent game master.

The best, by far, of Pacific carrier warfare games.

RATING: 9
Never I have played a game where there is so little on board and so much more underneath it.

The hidden movement of your fleets and to scout for the enemy's fleet, conducting air strikes and marine landings had never been so tense.

Every bomb that falls and hits a target is so extremely satisfying that I do not feel the time went by.

Agreed, the game takes 2 days to complete a scenario, but I was too tense to even have a good nite sleep before I launch those planes again!

Capolavoro. Non ci sono altri aggettivi per questo gioco. Il movimento nascosto rende questo gioco favoloso. Se poi giocate in Team il divertimento è doppio. Uno tiene le basi e l'altro le portaerei ... e vedete voi come darvi delle regole per comunicare senza che gli altri intercettino i messaggi. Per assurdo ho giocato questo gioco anche con persone che mai avevano fatto un wargame e sono state entusiaste. Il problema è che avete bisogno di uno spazio su cui lasciarlo perchè difficilmente lo finirete in una serata. Compratelo!.

It is a nice game, with the original Battleline version that is better in the rules than the AH one, since the AH designers almost deleted the rule on fuel and changed to give it almost no meaning.
If you play the Midway scenario disregard the map on General and use the map from C.V.
As game is perfect in a game mastered version. I had the pleasure to play under a game master and to act as a game mastered. Among the games that I had the pleasure to game master there has been even an Indian Ocean Raid.

Fantastic game.  The entry description says it's complex, I disagree.  It appears to be complex at first encounter, and it has a steep learning curve, but mid-way through your first game you'll find it all works well and it's not difficult.  I play it without consulting the rules at all anymore, and there are precious few wargames that allow that!The game models carrier warfare really well.  You'll sweat over the same decisions the real commanders faced.  Requires some time and effort to play, but shorter games simply eliminate many of the decision points which are so much fun.

My first ever war game, played at the age of 11. Started a fascination for the Guadalcanal campaign and F4F wildcats. There are two versions of this - one the 1977 Battleline version (green & yellow counters) and one the 1982(?)AH version with red and yellow conters, a slightly bigger map (Kavieng is onmap) and some extra rules, although  some of the scenario variants that the 1977 version had aren't there. I personally think the mechanics are not overly complicated - but I play ASL, whistling death and World in flames. The key enjoyment factor is hidden movement with seperate smaller paper maps to plot in pencil the movement of your task forces. There are some additional command and control rules on web-grognards which look realistic and fun. It is an excellent game but it has some weak points - the combat tables are based on numbers, wheras historically small numbers of fighters with altitude and surprise could hit bomber formations and dive away before the escort could intervene. Although there are 'high' and 'low' altitudes  in the game, you can't intercept if at a different height. The submarine rules are poor as well - subs are automatically detected and attacked first before they get to attack. But still one of the best.

I enjoyed this game.  Love the fog of war aspect - where the h*** are the enemy carriers?  Yes there is a bit of record keeping (task force movement plotting, fuel for planes on patrol, etc...) but therein lies part of the fun, if you can believe it.  You are managing fleet assets and how to deploy them.  Nothing is more fun than spotting the enemy carriers and having a strike force ready to launch.  Suffers a bit from "whoever is found first loses", but that mirrors the reality of WWII carrier battles.  Definitely a simulation - nothing gamey about this.  We had a couple of rules issues regarding when we had to reveal hidden units, but ultimately we figured it out (mostly).

An all time AH classic.  Recreates the tension of limited or non-existant knowledge, where the success of your search planes can mean the difference between stunning victory and ignominous defeat.  Working on a plot system with only search planes and known units on the map, all manuvering is done on plotting maps and strikes are launched and must return based on the same.  I don't ever recall having a game where I felt completely in control and can well remember the sinking feeling when the enemy strike force comes into view and all my stuff is sitting fuelled and armed on the deck just waiting to be blown into the next world.  Constantly dream of trying to play a double blind team game with this baby; one day....

If you have the time to play, then it's a very good simulation of carrier warfare. It's also good as a club game, with 3 or more players (2 teams and an umpire or umpires), which can really emphasise the need to gather intelligence and the fog of war aspects of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
An awesome, double-blind game of carrier warfare in the days just before and just after the American landings at Guadalcanal, Flat Top is a Battleline Games classic bought by Avalon Hill. 
The ideal game has an American and a Japanese player, and an umpire to keep the game truly double-blind, but the two-player game still works fine. 
Scenarios can get a little pro-American as the timeline progresses but are still winnable by the IJN.

Playing double-blind, with two teams facing off, is a really engrossing experience. Use two games set up in separate rooms and a gamemaster/moderator handling the hidden aspects. Also there is lots of stuff to track so dividing the responsibility over a team of 2-3 players is nice. Works great with only two players and one board also but the additional bookkeeping detracts from the experience.

This game would cost at least $200 today.  I know it can be a beast but if I can't find a gamer to try this I will just have to just move!

An excellent Operational Level simulation of Carrier combat!  Every turn is ONE hour, and you need to micro manage your forces down to the single PLANE.  Capital ships are named.

Don't be frightened by the "High Complexity" rating this game has, since the rules are intuitive.

The mapboard is nice, but the spotting rules are a bit odd.  Best played with a GM (i.e. 3-players).  Lends itself well to PBeM!!  :)

The "ultimate" WWII Pacific carrier battle game. Playing this game really gives you the feeling of commanding naval task forces. Lots of detail makes for a very involving game, one in which you will truly bemoan the loss of key ships and aircraft. Rules are not complex, just lots to do - plotting task force moves, developing air search patterns, readying and arming strike planes, tracking ranges and flight times, etc. Every wargamer should play at least once!

played twice. quite possibly the most detailed treatment of carrier warfare produced. The fog of war element is modeled very nicely though though the massive amount of detail does make the game cumbersome. Still, if you want to find the enemy task forces you must use resoures to scout out where the enemy are before you can send out a strike.

EXCELLENT! One of the most enjoyable games i have ever played. Instead of traditional double blind mechanics, players move task forces by drawing on a duplicate small sized map and will only place counters on the main map once ships and task forces are searched and found. Simulates 3 major carrier battles in and around the Solomon Islands.

Rating this one is tough. I tried this once with a friend of my, and we took seven hours to do a single scenario. At the end of it, my brain was fried.

Fantastic 'carrier' game. Very in depth, not for the feint of heart. 

Battleline Games created the original version of Flat Top, which I own. Avalon Hill later purchased Battleline Games. AH sold the Battleline version under their own logo for awhile, then later revised the game for themselves. The Battleline Games version has fewer counters (800), while the revised AH version has many more counters. However, I dislike the counter colors chosen for the revision of the game.

Neither version of Flat Top is quite as good as their 'little sister' 'C.V.' by Yaquinto Publications.

A game I would love to have in my collection, although the playtime it would get is severely limited. Play is quite bookkeeping-intensive, and the double-blind system doesn't improve on speed of play.
 
It is great fun catching the japanese fleet just recovering its CAP, with the combined weight of two US carrier air groups, and that's the crux of the game for me; the surface battles doesn't hold the same appeal for me.

In the early 80s this was one of the top rated games on WWII naval warfare... and so i felt the urge to get it... when i opened the box (1981 ed.) and saw all the logs, charts and tables i realized it wasn't for me ! This utterly complex game ends up with much more management (each turn is divided in ten phases!) than war itself...

I had the old Battleline version (with the striking box cover art) for a long time, and played it over and over. It was one of the most remarkable wargames I'd ever played. The AH version is essentially the same with some rules cleaned up, and perhaps a better map. I bought the AH version years ago when it was on sale, but it is not punched or played. Back in the day, I would have rated this a '10' -- it's a great game. But it's really more trouble than I really want to go through nowadays. There is a fair amount of bookkeeping, and it's moderately complex. A landmark design, though.

RATING: 7.5
Long hours of planning, plotting and searching climaxing in a couple of turns of savage combat when US and IJN carrier groups exchange strikes. 

The game is old (almost 40 years!) and would need some more rules to add realism: air groups fatigue and wear and tear isn't simulated (you can have all your planes flying CAP the whole day) and the reconnaissance can be unrealistically micromanaged. Also, a referee would add much more realism.  Still a classic, though.

Brilliant game in that it evokes a tension within the player that is rarely seen in gaming. Nothing prompts this more than launching your grand air strike, only to find out that what you thought was a fleet is nothing more than a destroyer flotilla and then suddenly realising that you have absolutely no idea where your opponents carriers are. 
The requirement to plan, be patient and take risks at the right time are critical to victory. The game plays very well face to face.

This game is probably only moderately complex, however there is a LOT of bookkeeping. That said, if you can put up with this aspect of the game it is great fun. The number of options open to you are huge. There's a lot of space to hide in so the paranoia aspect of locating your opponents forces plays a significant role.

I own three copies of this and have run my first fully double-blind GM'd game, which was an even more rewarding, though even more bureaucratic, experience.

This game is very time intensive in terms of setup and playing. The administrative aspect is another detraction. Sometimes I feel I need a staff to monitor locations of both players&#039; air formations and task forces, plane readiness status, plane fuel situations, etc. What more than makes up for both of these negatives is the uncertainty. You can&#039;t be sure when or where (or from where) you may be attacked. The scale in terms of time, units (except submarines), and distance is exceptionally balanced. With a gamemaster, this game can be virtually perfect.

Big,  mounted maps give a sense of the vastness of the ocean.

The units are piddly small and practically illegible.

While the aircraft handling and search systems are good, combat is completely bland.

When you have spent a couple of hours finding the enemy, what you want is the final battle to be epic- in FT, is a couple of die rolls, and that's it.

Very complex game that is hard to teach because of the hidden movement mechanic. The latter is what makes the game very fun due to the "fog of war". Huge amounts of counters requires proper storage or the game is very long to set up. Biggest flaw is size of the board (huge) and the frustrating sheets that are supposed to keep track of the compositions of air groups and altitudes as the spaces provided are too small and the stacks of chits keep toppling over. If anyone ever wrote a companion app for this game, it would be an awesome experience.

Fantastic strategy game.

A good challenge. A bit fiddly with the orders, but I prefer that to simplifying the game and dumbing it down too much. Got a lot of play in my student days when there was more time available, but it falls under the category of dated games that just run too long. That's a pity because if there was some sort of streamlined system where Catalinas didn't have to read out each hex they're entering and wait for the opponent to see of they have spotted a fleet before moving onto the next individual hexes with the next recon plane, then this would massively reduce the game time.

I really got a kick out of the different plane types and playing them to their advantages and disadvantages, while juggling the whole shebang - there's noting worse than finding the enemy fleet and having the bulk of your planes with potential the range and firepower returning to base. There was a knack in keeping all your balls in the air. Gosh, even thinking about it reminds me how enjoyable it was, just too long. Highly recommended if you have the time and play it at a good pace.

I always thought the night landings are a bit harsh and added a touch too much to the planning requirements because you just had to have your planes land before dark - on a carrier sure, but there was no distinction between landing on a well lit concrete runway in Townsville or a bumpy poorly lit dirt strip on some island somewhere. Sure it gave the enemy the chance to disappear overnight, but I wasn't convinced it rang true or was totally necessary for gameplay.

I have both the Battleline and AH versions now. It is a great game for playing WW II Pacific carrier task force operations. Although it's now pretty old, play is only enhanced by online play possibilities having a GM using say Cyberboard, VASSAL (I see there's a link to the module here above), etc. There are various ways of extending play to Midway and Wake Island. CV by Yaquinto was designed to play this system by Craig Taylor for Midway, The General also had an issue including variants for Flat Top covering Midway and Wake Island with maps for those.

A complex wargame. The complexity lies mostly in the "double-blind" system, not in the rules themselves which are more medium. Premium is on search and micro-managing status of air groups. Die-rolls in combat play a very little role, but a lot of combat "punch" comes from manoevering and decisions made prior to combat, which works very well in this game. Also possibility to create "what-if" scenarios because of the additional counters. In my experience far better for solitaire than FtF, even though the "double blind" importance ought to make it impossible.

Used to have this game, but it got water-damaged in storage during one of my many moves. I couldn't salvage any of it, unfortunately.

Two battleline copies. I hesitate to say it is my favorite game because I have never finished a campaign. I just don't have the type of gaming buddies that dedicate the time to it. I still highly recommend this game for the serious war gamers. You know who you are...

This game has all the potential but execution is not solid. Tried several times and gave up. 

I really tried to like it and think that someone should redesign Flat Top and bring it to current century.

Prefer the Battleline version. Great game, great experience. Load those Bettey's with torpedoes, hunt American carriers.

Sadly dont get to play this any more - lack of opponents and time.  Wonderful strategy and the 'fog of war' element makes it, especially if played with a referree.  Love to PbEm if anyone's out there?

The concept is great but you have to get full value playing this with 3 - 1 as referee using hidden units. Can be very long and frustrating finding the opponent with this method on such a huge map

Good game and among my favorite subject areas.  I did some game-mastering of this by pbm long ago.  I also regret that those petered-out before conclusion...more due to me than the others.  My apologies for that to those gamers.

Great two player game.  Although complex in nature, if you love hidden movement, carrier operations, weather effects on these operations...then this is your game.This game beggs for a reprint and moderization of the counters...

Haven't played this anywhere near as much as I'd like.

Aug 20, 2009: Finally got some F-t-F time in on this (Coral Sea). Enjoyed it very much but the rules are a bit of a chore when you're first starting out. Also, not all of the player aids are as complete as they could be...small fiddly things like not having the AA BHT noted on the BHT table and not reminding you what happens on the BHT dr. You pick it up eventually, but it's not so smooth for the beginners.

Use to love this game. Very slow wargame of WWII Pacific Theater. Uses hidden plotted movement to keep fleets hidden. Would play _tons_ better as a computer game.

Picked this up when my Pastor moved years ago. He never played it... he served in the navy in the late 70's or 80's - told some great stories about refueling during heavy seas and a mistake by one of the commanders that almost led to a collision with another vessel causing some of the crew to cry in fear literally (cammander was demoted and reomved from vessel)... good stuff. Anyway - this game needs a home were people will play with it... it is neglected here.

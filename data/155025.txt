RATING: N/A
Nicely put together and easy to play. Well themed and great to learn Polish history from but there's not much to it. Fun in the negotiation and backstabbing but the replay value just isn't there.

RATING: 6
You can't tell if any of your moves is a good one or a bad one. You can never know for sure if any of your choices will be successful or not. Therefore, interaction between players is mostly random and not planned. Still, it's not a bad game to play occasionally.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Has the same feel as Martin Wallace's God's Playground, but without all the fiddly rules. 

Can't win the game without the help of your Polish buddies. Every player must keep ALL players within a winning distance til the very end. If any player(s) has too strong of a board position, then the others will let Poland burn and all will lose.

entra en coleccion 11 enero 2016. Juego de mayorías con una mecánica repetitiva. Bonito diseño con recreación histórica de personajes, pero que en mi opinión, no consigue meterte en la ambientación.
Juego que podría entrar como moneda de cambio para juego de real interés.
vendido en octubre de 2016.

RATING: 2
History-themed game about Polish history. Cards represents family resources which in blind bidding compete for offices, law and fight against external foes. 
Nice quality of components, rules are generally well-lined. 
Game isn't working in any combination of players (after 15 plays): 
2 - boring and predictable
3 - best combination
4 - mostly one player is on hard edge to get something useful in bidding
5 - chaotic and unpredictable
Major problem in this game is that we cannot plan any viable strategy in games with more than two players. Some Parliament cards may be not draw in all game long, same as Conflict cards. Our only tactics is based on "now and there" with no chance to predict outcome.
All in all - rather crap. Won't play this ever again.

The board is way too big and the iconography is slightly confusing. However, the mechanics are so tight that it's worth it.

RATING: 3
Equal parts dull and frustrating. No desire to play this again after the demo I received. The game is just round after round of blind bidding where the loser gets nothing but expends their resources. Just a waste of trees.

RATING: 6
Simple game with a very heavy theme (heavy=very influencing). A game of bluff, competition, influence and control. Theme is such a strong factor in the game, that it influences decision of the players (making them irrational - benefit wise - meaning, people want to protect the country instead of getting more influence).

Very good production quality - all components used in the game - are wooden (TreefrogGames calls such games "limited edition").

At the end of the day - it's a rather simplistic game. Expansion is delayed for another year...

Rinse-wash-repeat game with area majority game with levels of cooperation and competition...very hard to put your own interests below the national needs, great levels of fuckery.

Piękna mapa, interesujący temat, ciekawy aspekt wymuszonej współpracy, ALE nudna i żmudna mechanika nieustannej licytacji kartami psuje wszystko. Zagrałem raz w 4 osoby, miałem dość. Więcej nie chcę.

Have played this as 2-player and 3-player so far.  Everyone has enjoyed the game and we look forward to more plays and trying it with four.  After our first play, the following weekend we played God's Playground.  I prefer this since it has the penalty that all may lose (as in Republic of Rome, no coincidence here) if Poland's enemies take too many regions.  Plays quicker (as intended) and captures the theme well.
UPDATE: Have now played twice as 4-player - game well received.  Looking to try as 5-player.

RATING: 3
It's a longish area control game, with a huge load of cards that have looooaaaaads of text on them.. and no real easy decipherable iconography.
This could've been streamlined a lot! Then this might have become playable for a wider audience. As it is only some history afficionados will take the time to play the game several times in order to get behind the strategy.. but even those will give up eventually for lack of other players.
Pity because one can see that this is a work of love.

RATING: 4
Game theme, graphical design and wooden materials are strong points of this game.

Now about weak points. Low gameplay control, based on 12 blind biddings. The more players - the less control. Strategic planning hardly possible. Basic "resource gaining" capabilities are equal for all players during the whole game - assets you own or gain basically are not influencing your abilities to gain another resources or achieve Your goals. Game provides different user experience depending on the number of players (scaling issues).

After few plays nobody in my group wanted to play it again.

Conclusion: Try before you buy.

Zero control.  Such a pity considering all the flavour present on all kinds of cards... :( :(

TRY BEFORE YOU BUY.  This is mostly blind-bidding game with - again - zero control. 
You have been warned.

I recommend 'Sigismundus Augustus' set in the same period.  'Boże Igrzysko: Magnaci' is not even near its league.

Hmm, in the Spiel 2014 overview they say that they wanted to make something simple than God's Playground by Wallace. Something more for families... Also I'm not really a fan of managing a hand of cards with simply numbers from 1 to n, as in El Grande. Guess I will pass.

RATING: 10
The best game about history of Poland. 
Very strong interaction and little control - not for optimizers, but for politicians. 
If you like the spirit of GoT, and you want to end a game in 1 hour, you should try The Magnates.

Good game, easy rules, fast play, little to no downtime, negotiations - highly recommended for all Game of Thrones fans who cannot find enough time or fellow players. Works great even with 3 players (with 2 is still ok, but somehow lacks tension). Bonus - this game has beautiful components.
[edited] - after another 2 player game I highly recommend poople play with no less than 3 players.
[edited] - bought Forbidden Stars and fell in love with it. Not much time for other games, so this one has been sold.

After Race To Rhine Phalanx gives another CLIMATIC EURO (which becomes their trade mark). Beautifully designed, full of historical flavor can be summed up as "Games of Thrones the Board Game" light. Area control mechanics with lots of bluffing and some cooperative elements (conflict resolutions) makes this game enjoyable both for strategists and casual players alike. When you are interested in Eastern Europe history of XVII century You just can't miss this game, if you're not there is enough game inside to play this one without minding historical background.

Only have one play in so far. We all went down in flames for not dealing with the invasions. This game was a lot of fun it took a few turns to figure out the balance, but by then it was too late. A lot of interesting moments with the card flips on the bidding. Really looking forward to playing this one again knowing what I know now.

One of those "defective semi-coop" games (i.e. why should a player who's losing cooperate if it makes someone else the Big Winner?) which I'm normally not so into, but Magnates is about a historically interesting subject, with lots of good historical event cards and beautiful art and components.

Note: I helped with the rules text.

This... did not work for me. Even reading the rules it felt incredibly themeless; (all pay blind bidding) for roles, then for cards, then for defending regions. In my 2 plays we have tanked the game both times because 1 or 2 players have clearly been far ahead, so there's no reason for the other players to prolong the game. Also, I usually love blind bidding games, but here for some reason it really annoyed me. 

I'm yet to find a semi-cooperative game that works for me or for my gaming group. Some of this might be an issue with a 4 player game, but I don't honestly know that I'm enthusiastic enough to try with 3 which might be the optimal player count.

RATING: 7
This game is a sort of re-imagining of Martin Wallace's "God's Playground".

I think this is compelling. Simple, but with some subtitles to it. I believe the neologism to describe the player interaction would be Coop-etition, since either 1 player wins or ALL players lose. I like that dynamic quite a bit. You want to work together enough to not get Poland invaded and partitioned, but you also want to do as well as you can individually and see your opponents fail. Fine line there. Captures the history really well.

Also, an absolutely GORGEOUS production. Really nice components. One of the best value games I own in that regard. Kudos to Phalanx Games!

Easy and quick semi area control game. It really has something about spirit of Polish people with a lot of contradictory goals. Really good game but for some it may lack complexity - sometimes it is possible to lose control during play but relatively short gameplay do not allow to get stuck in such chaos for too long. 
I think it is important to do not play it too often.

RATING: 6
I rated this game on the low side because it isn't very intuitive and one player can really destroy the game where everyone can lose. Which we did on the second turn. Everyone bid high for the 10 cards and didn't have enough fire power to beat back the battles.

Interesting aspects to this, saw no reason it was a 'big' game feel it could have been condensed down and possibly streamlined. The partially Co-Op aspect really didn't work for me.

Needs the right group.  Don't get too far ahead to where someone will perceive they can't win and tank everyone's possibilities.  Need to try with two players to see if this is an issue.

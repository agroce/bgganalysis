Totally Under-rated, Overlooked market  (auction) type game. There's no chaos here but changes rapidly due to the closed monetary system and constant Flux of the open markets. It's a Tight game, always looking to play.

130929 I've since purchased Ra and its definitely supplanted Nefertiti.  I think its a cute and interesting game, but Ra is genius.

120909 Medium light auction game.  I quite enjoyed my first play, and the art (since I did buy it in part due to Alexndre Roche).   Since I don't own Ra or Medici, this fills the niche, unfortunately only plays 3,4, but it handled a 3P game quite nicely.

My auction stable is: No Thanks, High Society, Nefertiti, Modern Art.  Not a bad set from light to heavish.  For what its worth I like Ra a lot but I did not enjoy Taj Mahal and I'm not a mega fan of Traumfabrick though I do enjoy it.  Medici has an uglyass/ confusing board but otherwise its a great game.

RATING: 6
An odd market-oriented game.  I like how the value of the different commodities is based on the relative rarity (more people own = lesser value).  The different markets are a nice touch.  The extra roles/powers are also a good twist.

In the end, I never got a good feel for successful strategies.  It seemed like there might be some, I just have no idea what they might be or how to pursue them.  There were plenty of minor tactics that became obvious – being the first to enter a market for the extra coin, entering on a coin spot if the market had two coins available, taking two or three spots in a row so you can buy and recoup your money or buy + buy + recoup.  It's just that I wasn't able to discern any overarching strategies, or at least none beyond "buy more for as little as possible."

I would play this again, though it's not high on my list.  It feels like there's potential there.  (I could be wrong.)

I think this game has broad appeal.  This is good gateway game to bring non-gamers into the gaming world.   Fun (dare I say cute?) mechanics, nice art, and pleasant player interactions.

Rated a provisional 8 because I was too pre-occupied with other things (within and without the game) to think about what this game is like. I suspect the rating will go up. This is a nicely balanced, Knizia-like auction game with several ways to score and a fixed supply of money that simply circulates. I enjoyed it and certainly want to play it again with fewer distractions.

On second play, actually rated down slightly. There is nothing really wrong with the game. It is about the right length for a light auction game. It is well designed and well balanced. It is just, well, not very exciting.

Ra - same designer, theme and mechanic - may be slightly rougher round the edges but it is much more fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite a good auction game.  It reminded me of Amun-Re theme wise and in the way the bidding went.  A bit.  I played two games with two and the two player rules (along with the new people cards from the expansion).  It worked really well. 

Lots of tense choices and it's a really fast paced game.  The game would change, I think depending on the number of players.  At worst, I think this is a really good game...but once I get more plays in, I think this could be an excellent game (if a bit under the radar).

An unusual set collection and economic game.  The mechanism for the opening and closing of markets is neat.  The game has a closed economy that works well (money recycles between players and the board).  The learning curve is moderate due to the "god" cards which allow scoring or "attacks" on sets that your opponents have collected.

RATING: 7
Played it once. Liked it a lot. Interesting little variations on the board, which keeps it from feeling too dry. Length (45~60 minutes) is appropriate for it being a lightweight game. If you want an Egyptian based set collection game with bidding mechanics, don't play Ra, but choose this one!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Short game of auctions/set collecting.

Theme is totally pasted on - there is no reason why certain goods are available at certain markets, nor why a market should resolve. But get past that an you have an ok abstract.

For an Egypt and artifact type game much prefer Thebes - for an auction game with the same setting I much prefer RA. But I'd play it if someone else was keen.

Impressed on first play and suspect it will be even better next time round.  This is a nice 'worker placement-auction' game which I'd compare to its near contemporary Ysphan in that it hits a sweet spot for the type of game it is in the same way Ysphan does, though they're otherwise very different games. The markets opening and closing is a nice touch, as are the slightly different auction methods, giving it a fairly different, indeed probably unique, feel.  Looking forward to playing again soon to try the expansion.

RATING: 6
I'm not really sure how I'd describe this game.  It's kinda sorta a worker placement game and kinda sorta a bidding game, but it doesn't really fall under either of those classifications.  You're basically sending dudes out to gather presents for some pharoah guy which score you points.  The catch is that the pharoah doesn't want a lot of the same present, so you're trying to keep the other players away from the presents that you plan on giving him.  Thus, you're trying to jostle for position in the various markets to get the presents you want while denying opponents the presents you'd rather they not have, all while not running out of money which is very tight.  A very tricky task!  Overall, a good game that I'd probably usually be happy to play.

RATING: 5
Any game that features a bronze chicken with a fly swatter attached to its head has to be worth playing once, right?

In all seriousness, the board is a series of markets, with 4 cards available at each and players have a small cluster of workers and some cash. Each market is made up of some number of boxes arranged in a shape and has a different condition for when it will be closed. For instance, one market will have boxes in the shape of a pyramid, and when there is one worker piece at each of the 4 levels of the pyramid, the market will close. When a market closes, the player with the highest bid must pay the amount shown in their box into the market coffers and take either the top card (that comes with a fancy doohickey that gives you access to special powers) or two of the other 3 cards. Each player after that may either buy a remaining card (singular) for the amount shown in their box, or they can take half of the cash lying in the market, rounded up.

The object of all of this is to collect cards. There are a few suits (stylish chair, the aforementioned chicken head with the fly swatter, small statues, harps, &c.) and each has a different number of cards in the deck and a different scoring range. Players are rewarded for being the only one in a given suit, the more players who have a given type of card, the more the VP value of each is devalued. Most of the cards are turned in at the end of the game, but there are some special cards that players gain access to via the doohickeys that come with one card in each market that can allow them to score stuff early. Other special powers the doohickeys grant include stealing money from a market, swapping cards, and stuff like that.

The game is very short, easily an hour or less with experienced players. The set collection is a bland, overused mechanism with nothing new going on, but the markets are where the game is actually at, and the variety involved in how they close and the positional play based on how much you're willing to spend to get a given card is fairly engaging. This is one of those novelty things though, the first game it is interesting because it's new. I see a ceiling if this was ever played regularly. I doubt this is the kind of game that ever [i]will[/i] be played regularly though, because it doesn't have enough going on to make it actively exciting. It's certainly a small notch above average at first blush, and nothing I would avoid, but it's not standing out from the pack in any appreciable way either. Ultimately I think this will fall into the vast "charming yet disposable" category and it's ultimately fallen to 5 because my opinion on this game is about as neutral as my mind gets.

RATING: 7
My first play was a lot of fun, even though I got crushed. The bidding mechanic, and especially the way the different markets (the things you're bidding on) close is nifty. But ultimately this is a simple item collection game (multiple types, with each type having a different value and different number of tiles). Sort of like Hanging Gardens. Except that the value of each tile is dependent on how many players own it, so what you're really trying to do is get all of one thing. For a game where your turn usually consists of placing a single meeple, I don't understand why they chose to only to go 4. Slightly frustrating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game always leaves a favourable impression whenever it is put out on the table. The game is an interesting mix of various bidding mechanics and purrs along at a very nice pace. Players place merchants on markets in order to earn the right to buy gifts or obtain money in a certain order; but the conditions under which the markets close and the aforementioned choice is acted upon are different for each market. The gifts create surprising tension between the players because of the fact that the value of the cards devaluates as more players get hold of them. Once players begin to realise this, the character cards become [i]very[/i] annoying (but in a good way). The one thing a player should [i]not[/i] do (in a 4P game), on any occasion, is to spend all his money early in the game. Because of the closed economy, the other players will lock him out automagically, and this isn't at all fun. (Guess who found that out the hard way.) If there is a downside to this game then it has to be its rather mathy calculation of the value of various gifts and consequently how to act: bid higher, bid lower, and so forth. I use heuristics and still manage quite well, but I can certainly see that some people would sit down and calculate everything to the last decimal. Néfertiti should be avoided in that case.

[b]Update[/b] After long breaks, the game still remains fun and solid. Not an easy thing to accomplish, so compliments to the authors.

Nefertiti is a very interesting game and is much more fun than it may look on the surface. I love how the markets all have different closing conditions and having the option to pay for a gift or take half of the market's cash is really cool.  There is plenty of room to screw with your opponents, though, so you have to be prepared for that.

I liken it to Ra in that it is a non-auction auction game.

Nefertiti is at heart a set collection game, intertwined with a cool worker placement/bidding mechanism. Placed workers are indeed promises of payment, which may trigger the closure/evaluation of the given market. The catch is in the fact that, apart the highest bid, each worker can be used to grab some money instead of buying items. Interesting, though a little overwrought.

Nefertiti is a simple auction and set collection game that is distinguished by the different way that its markets are resolved and interacted with. Unfortunately, that is about the only thing that is interesting about the game, the rest of it: the scoring, the set collection, and the available powers are nothing particularly new, and based on my single play I highly doubt there is enough going on in the game to make it worth playing in any frequency. That said, I would play it again if pushed, I would just rather play something that is actually tense and interesting.

RATING: 6
Players commit pawns to markets, trying to acquire and control the distribution of various kinds of goods.  Players on their turn place a pawn at one of three "open" markets (a fourth being closed).  Placement may close the market, which causes the goods their to be handed out for cash.  Each market has different closing criteria, making the placement sort of interesting.  Players can also pick up seals, granting special powers allowing intermediate scoring, force trades, etc.  Game ends when the goods have been used up, and points are handed out per good owned - more players owning the same type of good dilutes their value.  Okay game, certainly moved along at a good pace.  Just not good enough to stand out these days.

Good set collection game with interesting decisions.  You need to be very careful how you manage your money and use the bonus cards available.

I found it somewhat theme-weak, but the board artwork is really nice.

RATING: 6
Egyptian game of auctions and set collection.   Sound familiar?   But wait, despite being utterly unoriginal overall, it is implemented in a kind of interesting way.  It's kind of a worker-placement bidding mechanic with mini-games where you have to meet either geometric patterns or dice rolls to close the markets.   There are special powers that you can buy and the scoring rewards specialization in certain "suits".   Better than I expected it to be, thanks to some ingenuity in the design of the markets and the closed money system.  Decent level of interaction also.

Nice game of set collecting.  To get your cards you need to place your men in the right way in the markets.  Leads to many interesting decisions to be taken.

Again, last game of the night. This time I was more awake. Hahahaha. Got a better understanding of the rules. Didn't get those disks except for one the whole game. Some players use them to trade with me. Finished 3rd close in a 4th player game. First two players had a big lead.

2015-02-16 : Quirky tight old-style Euro. The chaotic element - the action cards you can buy - actually detract from the game, making it less strategic. Willing to play this again and the rating might go up on this one as there's nothing really wrong with this game.

Set building bidding game with very tight closed economy, it's not hugely exciting but nice enough for what it is. Some of the bidding is contrived, the action cards are tacked on and the theme is a big surprise. But the graphics are nice and fresh and the tightness of the money and sufficient screwage tip this to a yes vote.

Auction game for gifts for Nefertiti.  I like the gameboard design & pieces.  I like the auction mechanics.  There are 8 auctions (of which never more than 3 are open at a time) each with different conditions that have to be met before the auction can close.  Players have to decide in the marketplaces (where the auctions take place) whether to go for money, special abilities, or gifts (which win the game but can't be purchased without money, and whose value can be increased with the specail abilities).  Elements of the game encourage players to bid in a way they might not have otherwise bid--either to close a market or get the benefit of being the first to enter a market, and with a mid-level bid.  Short, well-written rules.

First impression:  The game felt very busy, lots going on.  I enjoyed looking at the artwork, which is beautiful, but no longer wish to buy it.  For an Egyptian themed auction game Ra is so much easier to get into and a cleaner design.  I'll stick with Ra because I prefer games with fewer mechanics.

Of course I'd be happy to play it again.

Alright; we've seen the theme a thousand times, but this is a brilliant auction game which has strategy, risk and reward in spades.  A game in which the decision on how to bid is as important as where to bid.  Somebody in our group better get a copy or it's going to be me again.

Nagyon nehezen mondok róla véleményt egy játék után. Szinte egyetlen megbolondított licitálós mechanika köré épített játék, 4 oldalas pofonegyszerű szabállyal 45 perces játékidővel. Mégse sikerült egyikünknek se átlátni teljesen a történéseket. Ez azért van, mert nem is lehet vagy azért mert olyan mélységek vannak benne, amit képtelenség elsőre felfedezni? Na ez fog kiderülni a jövőben. Az már jó jel, hogy mindenképp szeretnék még játszani vele és kicsit jobban felfedezni. Nagyon ötletes az egyszerű licitálás köré kerekített piackiértékelés és piaczárás. Viszont elsőre nem teljesen álltak össze a szerepek. A szabály alapján erősnek tűntek, de menet közben mégse sikerült túl jól kihasználni őket. 

Egyelőre egy igen vegyes 7-es, de lehet ez még 6-10 között bármi.

Auction and set collection game set in ancient Egypt. There are several shifting markets with different closing conditions that decide when players can grab the wares. The market mechanism is awesomely implemented. Unfortunately, the best moves are pretty obvious most of the time, and some of the special power cards are ridiculously unbalanced and can turn even the best strategy into a pile of ancient Egyptian jackal goo.

This is a great game of money management. I enjoyed my one play. I think the set up is a bit long for the amount of gaming, but I will happily play again. There are many variables to keep track of. The theme is absolutely unnecassary. It is a structured card game.with rewards.

Nefertiti is a pretty good auction game that uses a neat mechanic of paying for cards and then later allowing players to take half of the money you have paid as an alternate. As well, the idea of trying to keep other players from purchasing cards that are similar to yours keeps the competition high. The different types of auctions are still quite similar but neat and keep things interesting. The card drafting, while limited, uses non-intuitive iconography and feels a bit forced, but still the cards when played right can be very advantageous. Overall, a nice package that is a bit repetitive. But I think if the game lasted for about an hour this wouldn't be a problem.

Very nice streamlined game but... with very not obvious choices. I really like it.
At the end the game drags a bit - and using special power cards sometimes is a brainburner:
if i take this, you loose that many points, but i get that many, BUT I also loose these many, and you gain these many... gaaah.

Nefertiti is a set collection game with a series of fiendishly clever auctions at its core. The "auctions" are not the traditional type but rather an auction/worker placement hybrid. Players take turns placing workers on to the board until an auction is triggered in any area. But the "workers" are really nothing more than advance bids for these auctions. But the tricky part is that each worker can (with some restrictions) either buy something or just grab some cash and run. The order of the bids is very important in determining who profits the most from these auctions, but it can be difficult to predict how it will all go down. Good players will try to set up incentives for the next player to bid in a way that triggers an immediate auction, helping both players.

I think it's a cool little game. Kind of swing-y and capricious, but always enjoyable.  It feels like a lost Knizia game, even down to the Egyptian theme.

Suprisingly good bidding/set-collection game (oh no, not another one!) with a small rulebook. There are many games out there, using these 2 mechanisms, but this one can hold it's ground.

This feels deliciously like a bundle of different minigames going on at the same time. It's just fun to consider the vastly different alternatives each round, which makes following other players movement interesting too.

The theme of the game... shopping in ancient Egypt... does not sound like much fun.  But this game is really cutthroath! 
It has some push your luck and risk management, unusual auction mechanisms.  Despite it's apparent simplicity, the game is quite deep, especially for it's short duration (15 minutes/player).
If the theme was not so silly, this would have been a 10 for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
A set collecting game, where one collect cards by placing pawns in different markets.  The market mechanic is new (to me), as a certain number and/or placement of pawns will trigger the closing of the market, which allows the owner of the pawn in the highest numbered slot to pay that price to get first pick (top card in the market + a favor, or two cards in the lower row).  The next pawn owner, in numerical order, has the option of taking half the money in the market, rounded up, or purchasing a card for the price his/her pawn is on.  This continues until all player pawns have had a chance to act.

With the favors, players are able to activate special cards, which will help them in scoring victory points.  At the end of the game, each card is worth a value, based on the number of different players who own that type of card.  The more owners there are, the less a card is worth.

An interesting system, but something appears to be missing, as there could be more then just set collecting.  Then again, perhaps my expectations are too high.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I'll admit the auction combined with weird spacial placement thing is kind of neat. However, it powers some dull set collection. If that were all, the game would merit a 5 or 6 but what really drags this game down is the horrible special actions that are just so much hoseage. All they really do is drag everyone down to mediocrity by screwing up their sets. After 2 plays, I believe I've seen all I care to see of Nefertiti.

I thought there was an interesting game in selecting your position in the market and in choosing goods or money.  But it seems to me that you should take as many cards as you can afford to, selecting money only when it is a ridiculous amount to leave.  This makes the market game seem pointless, and I'm not sure I'll like repeated play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An auction/set collection game. All of the money that exists is kept in the game: it is either in a player's possession or tied to a particular market.

You place a pawn on an open market spot. When the market closes (each has a unique method), the person who placed in the most expensive spot MUST pay the amount and can take two cards (or the top card which comes with a medallion). Everyone else, in descending order, then has the choice to take half of the money in the market rounded up, or to buy ONE card at the price of the spot they are on.

Scoring happens normally at the end of the game. The value of the cards are determined by how many different people collected cards of that type. Ie: if you are the only person who collected headdresses, each one is worth 14 points. But if two or more people also have headdresses, then the value plummets to 7[?] points each.

There are special one-time privileges that can purchased with a medallion; while they vary each game, there are always a card that lets you score one type of card at that moment with a bonus, and a type of card that allows you to swap a card with an opponent [though if you give them a "cheaper" card, you must pay the difference in money].

Another auction game set in ancient Egypt (but not designed by RK).  The auction/market mechanism is vaguely like the a cross between Amun-Re and Mogul, with a different closing condition and price ranges in each market.  The power card mechanism is also unique and gives players the choice of all remaining power cards.

I'm a librarian, and I've been saying for a while that there ought to be a game about collection development, in which the prestige value of your library is determined by what everyone else has.  Though inexplicably Egypt-themed (you know, with the famous Great Auction Houses of Giza), this is that game.  It's set collection with the twist that the value of each item decreases the more people own it.

Other than that, this is a very unusual auction game whose hype I'd been wrongly ignoring.  There are several interesting things about it--perhaps most importantly the opening and closing of the various auction spaces, which gives the game a much more fluid (rather than phase-bound) feel. Also interesting: the money available is a fixed amount which simply circulates among players.  And the ability to set yourself up to profit from an auction is something that, as far as I can tell, is unique to this game.  

In short, this is really clever and interesting, and I'd love to play it some more. Too bad it only plays four.

Aug08: What the heck. Did a bunch of designers get together and just through the kitchen sink into an auction game? Most of it was bearable, right up until the rediculous "priveledge" cards. They were all so random and odd that it just killed the game trying to digest them. The market closing variations were "cute", but I don't think they added that many meaningful decisions. I had to digest how each market worked, but it really didn't pay off it giving me difficult decisions. I usually just stuck with "do I need money?", "Can I afford to close that market advantageously?"

If I was to auction for set collection score in Egypt. I will be calling Ra thank you very much.

Three simultaneous auctions and the Egyptian theme put this close to Amun-Re. The tactical challenge is similar but Nefertiti is less strategic. The goal is simply set collection with the single rather obvious strategic decision to concentrate on a few sets to collect. As the cards are collected openly, competent players will balance out their collections and scores will be close.
I like Nefertiti but I like auctions, tactical games and set collection. It plays in 45 minutes once explained. Nothing for strategists searching hidden depths and the theme is at best thinly integrated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
With a more original theme I would be more apt to move the rating to an 8, but both the Egyptian and trading/collecting/gifting themes are so tired and overused that it hampers my enjoyment of the game.  The big thing Nefertiti has going for it is the ways in which the different markets close, which feels unique and fun.  The method of getting money is also interesting.  I also like the timing involved in playing the very powerful cards, the use of which will probably almost always make the difference between winning and losing.

The first play (with 3 players) kind of fell flat for me, but subsequent plays (with four players) were much more interesting and exciting.

This is billed as an auction game.  This is very misleading because it doesn't feel at all like an auction game.  First, you don't go around the table everybody bidding.  Second, if you don't "win" the auction, you still get stuff.  In fact, sometimes it is good to be second or third in the "auction."  In most auction games, the skill comes in evaluating the true value of the item.  That is not really that important in this game.  So give this game a try even if you don't like auctions.

An interesting tactical worker placement and set collection game that, unfortunately, has enough minor problems to add up to a moderate issue.

It runs a bit too long for a tactical worker placement and set collection game. There is no significant planning or strategic thinking to tie the game together, nor any other narrative arc strong enough to sustain my interest in the game for an entire 45 minutes,

Even though the rules overall are only 4 pages, the reward systems are a bit gangly, and each city having its own scoring trigger adds to this.

Unwary players can set up the next person for pretty nice plays, too, throwing the game unintentionally. This is no worse, and maybe a bit better, than the situation in games like Hansa or Puerto Rico, but I also know it is a non-starter for many gamers. It bugs me a little, but isn't fatal.

Otherwise, the design is rather clever. Deciding where to place your guys is tense vs obvious in the right proportion to provide some rhythm, and it leverages geometry enough to keep the rules at four pages, even with the odd bits. 

If you're okay with slightly long tactical games, this is a real winner. If you need a bit of planning in anything longer than 30 minutes, though, stay away. I'll happily play it once in a while, but I suspect I'd burn out in a hurry with heavy repeat play.

I never knew or thought i was necessary for there to be so many different ways to end an auction. There's definitely a lot of clever ways to manipulate the auctions to your advantage in this game, especially with the powers you can use the seals for, but in the end it is fairly abstract, and cleverness of different auctions at times feels like more of a  gimmick that makes this game a little bit more opaque in an attempt to add auction variety rather than something innovative. I will say it does make timing when you do what more important however.

This game can be quite interactive via the auctions, devaluing other people's sets, and the seal abilities. This is mostly indirect and not take-that which I like. I was afraid that the triggering of which auctions occur when would cause there to be issues of people causing interaction when they didn't end to (which causes the interaction to instead add chaos to the game), but it didn't seem to be a huge problem. Would need more plays to confirm.

While the decision whether to add more to the pot by taking a card or take half of the pot yourself can be interesting, in general I liked Dream Factory's closed economy more (which I played on the same day), as it seems more elegant and there is less of money getting stuck in pockets on the board.

Striking sparks out of a closed economy is a design feat I’ll always admire. In Nofretete, the trading is embedded in four markets that work as a quirky mixture between auction and worker placement. What you’re trading for is the usual set collection stuff with a nifty twist: the value of a set is higher when fewer players want to score it.

On top of what would already be a thoroughly enjoyable and unique game, a couple of special actions add a bit more spice. They allow things like early set scoring, grabbing money from a market, and so on. What’s special here is that you gain tokens for the using these special actions from winning auctions, but a) you decide when and which action you take and b) once an action has been used, it’s removed from the game. This creates an interesting dilemma between picking the optimal time to use an action vs. running the risk of somebody else snatching it away from you.

All in all, this is a fast and thoroughly enjoyable game, with enough unique quirks to stand out from the hordes of other trading games in its weight class.

Very interesting game.  While nothing completely unique, it is new enough to stand out.  The market mechanic is certainly different, and I found the game to be enjoyable.  Rulebook is one of the best I've seen, with many examples, so after just a couple of read throughs, we had the rules down and we're playing without too many mistakes.  Quality components and a nice large board will assure this sees semi-regular play.

Neat game, fast moving.
Placing pawns, hoping a particular market does not close until you have enough money to cover your bid there, keeping an eye on what the other players have got, trying to get a red seal - interesting decisions.

In games played the only character cards anyone has ever used has been the Scribe cards.  The value of the other cards is hard to grasp.

A strictly tactical auction game, it features a clever market and close-economy system. The game play isn't very intuitive, but works mechanically. It's prone to AP though, there are lots of things you can play around and you need to keep track of stuff your opponent have. The small difference in price drop for different gifts is one thing I don't like about the game, as quantity far outweighs quality if the values are so similar. Still, not a bad Euro.

RATING: N/A
In this Eygpt themed game with the board that looks remarkably like Amun-Re, there are three areas with aucitons at any time, and there are four cards in each area that are up for auction. Each auction area has place for workers that represent the value of a bid (like Amun-Re), but there are different patterns. The auctions are unique in that they do not close until certain critera are satisfied. e.g., at least three people have made a bid, or there is a worker in each row, or the workers form a tic-tac-toe pattern, etc. The winning bid gets either two cards, or a card with a seal. The cards represent objects, whose value degrades as more players own it. The seal allows a player to purchase tactical cards, such as selling cards immediately. At the end of the game, the value of the objects are totalled.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.2
It is a bidding game with 3 open markets. Each market has a different closing condition and once it closes, the winner pays and gets the card he chooses, but the second highest bidder can also pay his bid to the market and take another card, or he can simply take half of the remaining money in the bank.

And whats more, some positions on each market grant you some privilege or concede bonus, and you can buy some characters that give you one-time use powerful abilities.

At the end, you score each artifact for a value that depends on how many players have copies of this artifact.

On paper, it seemed to be a blast of a game, and with a playing time of only 45 minutes!!

But then, when we played, the experience was somewhat different. Only the last workers placed on each market (and sometime the first) were thoughful decisions, the rest was done more or less by intuition, because there was nothing to base your decision on. 

Still, it's a fun light game that only lasts 45 minutes.

First impression (4 players): Worker placement & Set collection game that penalizes even more than normally for collecting sets that others collect as they score less than otherwise would. An okey game with nothing really new to offer like you could guess from Egypt theme.

It's just card collection, collecting sets that will score better if you don't let other people get the same type as you, but there's some clever stuff going on in terms of bidding. Bidding happens over three markets at once, but you make one bid on one market each turn. The available bids are defined on the board and bid by placing a worker on the bid space, so it feels more like worker placement than bidding. But unless you put it on the outrageously expensive top space, you can never be quite sure if yours will be top bid when the market closes, or in fact where you'll be in the bidding order ... unless you're the one to close the market. And the markets all close in different and cool ways - total bid power, bids less than a d6, workers on adjacent bids, etc - which provide some interest. When bids are resolved in order, there's some interesting decisions to make - the VP-earning cards, the ability to use a special one-off power, or take half the money that's been accumulating at the market (from paying for cards so far) which will fuel your purchases at the next market to close. Anyway, it provides a different enough spin on set collection to warrant some more play, so that's good enough for me.

What I like:
- Nice components (but see below)
- It felt meatier than its length

What I didn't like:
- Too many options
- Screwage with the special abilities (not a ton, but more than I like)
- Auctions rarely close for the reason on the board
- Closed economy; very tight on money
- Two of the item types have almost the same color and the same numbers, so are hard to tell apart

It's a well-designed game for what it is. For me, the worker placement was too open-ended and overwhelming. The auctions didn't close easily enough. I don't like the scoring based on "number of players who have that type of item". All in all, not terrible, but not my style of game.

I would put the weight higher due to the width of the decision tree. Let's say 2.6.

This is a simple and really fun game with some nice mechanics. you place your ponds in different markets and when the markets close you get to buy treasures based on who bid the most. But each market closes for a different reason and money is only passed around between players, also through the markets, so we must decide between treasures and money each time. Also, the treasures are worth more if you are the only one who has one. The market mechanic really makes the game fun to play.

This auction/set collection game was really enjoyable.  Like Amun-Re or Vegas Showdown, there are a number of different auctions that can be won, but each one functions in a unique way, which provides a lot of variety.  Unlike other auction games, there aren't really phases; auctions may or may not resolve after your turn, but whatever happens, you just keep on bidding.  There are also a number of ways you can alter people's holdings and do other miscellaneous things, through seals you can also win in the auctions.  Overall, a great experience.

Another bland themeless Euro. You're collecting sets, and trying to ensure the other players don't have the same items you are collecting. The interesting decisions come from timing the closing of the markets so you get what you want and each market has 2 unique and alternating requirements to close. It really plays in the 45 minutes advertised. A good game but I wish they'd thought of a different theme.

First impression:
The game is light. The rules are clear and well explained. There is no outside money coming from a bank or other mechnism to be able to produce money. You realy have to manage your money all the time to be able to by the gifts and make sure you will grab cash along the way. You also have to manage the special power cards in order to have a chance to win the game. Some luck is involved in the game but this plays along very well. The material is nice without been exceptional.

After four plays, I'm maintaining my opinion about the game.

Première impression:
Le jeu est léger. Les règles sont claires et bien expliquées. Il n'y a pas d'apport d'argent extérieur provenant d'une banque ou autres mécanismes. Il faut donc gérer son argent afin d'acheter les présents voulus tout en obtenant de l'argent en cour de partie. Vous devez également gérer les cartes de pouvoir afin d'avoir une chance de gagner la partie. Une certaine chance est présente dans ce jeu, mais ceci s'intègre bien dans l'ensemble. Le matériel est beau sans être exceptionnel.

Après quatre parties, mon opinion pour ce jeu se maintien.

Almost abstract bidding game, in which you collect sets of cards with the goal to be the only player collecting a certain type of card. Players put workers on the different markets for bidding. The twist is that the total amount of money in the game is fix and that workers who did not purchase anything can take the money which was paid by other players before. Additionally you can use one time action cards.

All the mechanism work quite well, but there was no real progression (last turn similar to the first turn) in the game. You can easily be targeted by other players, if they  get just one item of the set you collect. All mechanisms are abstract and have not thematic integration.

RATING: 6.4
+ Original bidding mechanism: the game successfully creates very satisfying opportunities to obtain points or money for players who succeed in puzzling together the right tactical moves

+ Rather simple rules, short playtime. Game can serve as an interesting filler

+ High player interaction, gameflow is smooth and keeps everybody involved

- The distribution of cards on newly opened market spots is random and might create too beneficial easy opportunities for a certain player

- The random card distribution on the board coupled with the bidding mechanism creates some chaos. The game offers little control to players for more than their current round. As such this game is very tactical, but not strategic at all

- there is some limited negative player interaction involved with some action cards allowing to steal an opponent's card etc. The effects are limited as these actions only happen infrequently and usually require some form of compensation, but this aspect does add to the chaos and especially at the end of the game it might induce a kingmaker-effect.

Tips:
* Always look for a good opportunity when a market is about to close and money and cards get distributed. At the points in the game it is often possible to put yourself in a situation to get a card cheaply or to gain coins

* Obviously it is beneficial to collect cards of the same type and avoid too many opponents collecting the same type of card. However, it is often difficult to puzzle this together. In the end, I think you should try to obtain as many cards as possible for a good price and if possible try to optimize your collection a little using special action cards.

* 2 of your pawns, one on the most expensive slot and one immediately after allows you to obtain 2 or 3 of the best cards a market had to offer and recover at least 50% of your investment immediately after.

* The special action card which allows you to place 2 pawns at once can be extremely powerful if you can use it to trigger an important market and resolve it so you get lots of great cards cheaply

Equal parts worker placement, auction and set collecting. The one-time-use special powers add a nice dose of player interaction and spice up the scoring. The market opening/closing/shifting mechanism feels fresh and the variety of market closing mechanisms create plenty of variables to think through. Every worker placement feels important and the placement often provides difficult decisions.

While I like the way markets close for the most part, I don't like the fact that they can close very (too) quickly, completely locking some people out before they have a chance to place. Especially the two that depend on dice rolls- I've seen those close after one worker placement.

An auction/bidding filler that thoroughly surprised me with its fresh and unique ideas. 

The mechanics introduced take the simple bid formula, and add such things as: a variable auction end trigger, a rotating closed market, multiple bid options in a single market, and one time use variable power cards. 

All of these center around a set collection goal, and the attempt for these sets to remain unique. Points are based on how many people have the same items, the more people that have the item, the less those items are worth. It all, somehow, manages to work with the theme.

The excellent art from Roche, and the generally excellent production values, nudge this one into the 8 territory for me.

There is nothing hugely original there. But everything runs so smoothly it's always nice to play. The cards that allows to sell a collection mid-game, and with a bonus on top of that, are clearly broken, but as they are available to everybody, I don't think it's a flaw.

Izgalmas a licit része, hogy minden piacon más és más feltételekkel lehet az értékelést elindítani. A megszerzett lapokkal való pontok kalkulálása és figyelése is érdekes ötlet. A kivitelezés is megfelelő, a kiadó egyre jobb játékokkal rukkol elő, így tovább.

RATING: 6
A quick playing game with auction and worker placement elements.  And a "keep it fresh" mechanic of shifting markets - 4 markets, but only 3 open at one time.  And each market has two sides - only one of which is open.  Very little downtime in this one as each person's placement has impact on what others will do and the potential to close a market at any time.  Different criteria closes each market. 

Rules are short and easily understood with very few questions along the way.  Not a bad little game.

RATING: 7
3-4 player Worker-placement with set collection. I thought this was a simple game at first, but it turned out to have surprising depth. The game felt really elegant, but it's a little worrisome that everybody I know who's had 4 or 5 plays seems tired of it. I like how it plays smoothly, and always under an hour. Great game to introduce non-gamers to worker-placement and set-collection. There might be some balance issues (is it worth it at all to collect the crappy gifts?)

Undoubtedly plays best with 4, because the double senets add an extra strategic element, and a lot of the character cards reach their full potential with the full complement of 4.

Try to time when you're short or long on money, when markets close, and have favorable positions in each. Lots of interesting decisions. Perfect information and the luck involved is reactive after you draw the gifts in each market. The most unsatisfying aspect of the game is the Louqsor market, since it makes market closure random, not player-driven.

The map looks a bit like Amun-Re, but to me it feels more like a multi-player Aton game with a Hanging Gardens-type scoring system.  It's really a card collection game with the collection of the cards determined by token placements.  Its got a few extras that make the game a bit complicated, but I think that would make the game better in repeated plays.

Talán nem volt szerencsés egyből a kiegészítővel kipróbálnom a játékot, de elsőre nekem csalódás volt. Egy nagyon jó licitmechanizmuson alapuló káoszt kaptam. A játékosok alapesetben 3 piacon licitálnak különböző értékes tárgyakra, amit fajtánként gyűjtenek. Mindegyik piacon más a licit és más a licit végefeltétel. A végefeltétel beteljesülésekor elosztjuk a piacon szerezhető kártyákat, majd egy eddig zárva tartott piacot nyitunk meg ehelyett. Mindig választható opció, hogy nem veszünk el kártyát, cserében a piacon található pénz felét visszük. Ez a részt teljesen rendben van, a kártyagyűjtés már kevésbé. Pontosabban még az is rendben lenne, ha nem lenne túlbonyolítva. A többféle kártya és pontozása még rendben, azaz, hogy minél kevesebb embernél van belőle, annál többet ér egyfajtának a darabja, viszont behoztak egy rakat bónuszkártyát, amit külön pecsétért lehet megszerezni, amivel érzésem szerint kiszámíthatatlanná teszik a játékot és erősen királycsinálóvá. A játék bár egy óra alatt lemegy, jóval nagyobb mélysége lehetne, amin kellene gondolkozni, de igazából nem lehet előre számolni, mert egy bónuszkártyával keresztbe tehetnek bármilyen tervet, illetve adott kártya fele annyit érhet, mint korábban. Kicsit úgy érzem itt is pont abba a hibába estek, mint a másik egyiptomos játékban, az Amun-Rében, ahol szintén a bónuszkártyák egy része ront a játék megítélésén a szememben. Valószínűleg másodikra már jobban játszanám, de akkor is valahogy nekem nem állt össze. Könnyednek nehéz, nehéznek meg káoszos. Valahogy nem stimmel összességében. De adok még neki esélyt kiegészítő nélkül is, amikor gyaníthatóan javítok majd a ponton. Elsőre 5-ös.

RATING: 6
Yes, this is a good game with good looking components, but unfortunately the sum of its parts is less than it could be. The auctions, the worker placement, the set collecting, the special cards - it all works, but I have seen each of them done better in other games. Maybe what makes Nefertiti unique is that it combines these aspects, done better elsewhere, in an adequate manner which makes for a fairly good game but still - I would rather play those other games that excel in their special fields, than an OK game where all those aspects are only adequate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First, I have to say that the abstract market auction system is very cool.  So great in fact that I will give this game a five despite the fact that I don't particularly like it.  I'm really hoping that this geographic system will be used elsewhere -- better implemented.   I also want to point out that the art is stellar, I really love this style.

Sadly, I found the game downright grating.  I have no problems with overly tactical games, but this game falls prey to a nearly pure situational opportunism.  It is a perfect information game (with the exception of a little luck on the dice at the bottom right quadrant), and while I usually like perfect information games, this game suffers because if it.  I felt that in most cases the best moves were often disappointingly obvious.  I feel that the game is rife with false choices.  Now, I have to say that this isn't always the case.  There are real choices to make regarding whether to take the card with the seal or the two cards or lower down on the ladder taking a card or money. But too often, even these choices are clear.   

This game would be especially dry and overly analytical (which I have to say that it already is more than I want) were it not for the special power cards. But I have to say that these make the game even more frustrating.  Some are very difficult to use efficiently, unless the stars align then they are absolutely perfect for your situation, so it takes you back to false choices again.   The scribe scoring is absurd.

Unlike games where value dilution is made intriguing (Wabash Cannonball), if a game is strictly set collection I found this to be exhausting, and the scoring value often times based on happenstance.

All in all I found the game irritating as I rarely found an opportunity to do anything particularly clever.

One of my 2008 favorites. I like this game a lot. It plays fast, has good components (although it could have more money) and it has a solid strategic feeling. Excellent re-playability and interaction.

After a few more plays, as in all middle games and in some classic meaty monsters, it turns out to be less interesting and only "fun enough to get played occasionally". I like to try new games but I also like to return to the old ones when they are good. Nefertiti is good enough to get back to it but it's not a master piece that will last forever. 

Still a good game though. I like it more with three players.

 liked this, though not a tremendous amount. It had some interesting decisions. You have to manipulate the markets (in bizzare bidding mini-game fashion) in order to gain money and gifts. The money is in short supply, and the gifts score you the points, so you really need both, which creates a nice tension. Added in are character cards that you can use to create a bit of chaos, and they can really help you out. Plays quickly, which is good, because there is a fair bit of luck and craziness.

I'm not itching to play again anytime soon, but I did have fun, and I'd play again sometime. It was better than Hanging Gardens, which may or may not be or have been similar.

An ancient Egyptian auction game – what will they think of next? Actually, it feels quite fresh. Worker placement into 3 open markets (of a total of 8 used). When enough workers are placed to trigger a market closure (each market is different), then every worker earns something (in bid order) – maybe a card, maybe an extra special-power action, maybe some cash. Need to watch out for being caught short of cash. Most points scored at game end, cards being worth shifting amounts based on their rarity.

This is an initial rating with room to go up or down. In the early going, this game seems to requre equal parts of bidding well and (acquisition and) use of the special cards to win. I especially find the bidding system rather intersting and engaging. The set collection aspect of the game is pretty dull; it's the auctions that vary and keep things interesting. I happen to be a big auction game fan, and so far this one hasn't disappointed.

Excellent, quick playing game that has a very unique auction and market mechanism. Each market closes differently, which adds a nice amount of variation to the game. Character cards get a little getting used to, but everything else is very easy to figure out, so it could be used as a gateway game to more complicated auction games. Pretty basic artwork, but it does the job.

Interesting little set collecting / fixed bidding game (Amun Re or Vegas Showdown style). There are 4 markets with two different halves each. You put workers/bids on these markets to buy gifts. Each of the 8 sections have different rules on when the markets close, which might be physical (3 workers in a row like tic-tac-toe), numerical (bids add up to more than 15), player related (3 different colour player pieces placed), etc.

The more of a particular item you have, the more points you get. However, this is reduced the more players have that item. So, you want to have unique items, while your opponents share.

First play - 4 players - 8 different auction tracks. Only 3 will be open at a time. When one closes a different one opens. Try to get the best "gifts" for the pharoahs. Scoring is based on how many other players have the same gift. If your gift is unique at the time you offer it you will score more points. Grab the gift with the "seal" on it and use the seal on a following turn to summon one of 8 different "helpers". I scored big early (36) but didn't do much after that. One player scored 72 in a turn and still lost! The player who seemed to have the loosest grasp of the game wound up winning. This was the first play for all of us so I don't think that is going to happen on the next play. A very unique twist to the old auction mechanic.

As I said while playing, "any game where you buy princesses gifts is good with me". My initial thoughts was that it is a good game that is lighthearted, fun, and makes me smile but not so much so that it is silly or requires no thought. My rating could, in fact, probably be an eight. The "closing" markets threw me off, and I found that it could be hard to collect only one type of item depending on what was drawn. I guess I need to play a few more times to develop a strategy and get the hang of it but I did enjoy my first time.

Set collecting (cards)with a interesting purchase path. This is a placement game also. Each market has it's own closing conditions so you need to place people (bids) into markets when they are open but then they may not close or other players may out bid you and get the good cards. It is hard to decide where, when, and how much each turn. Definitely a good game that may turn out to be very good.

Nefertiti is like a one-trick pony.  Its most interesting aspect is the 8 different conditions each of the markets will close at, but once you get pass that, the rest of the gameplay becomes painfully obvious and mechanical.  From the placing of the servants in the stalls (the coin spaces will almost always go first), to the selections of gifts (with goods dilution in effect, unclaimed ones are always preferred, unless you are already collecting a particular set) and even in the choosing of the character cards (those that don't realize the power of the Scribes is throwing away VP at their own risk), there doesn't seem to be any room for subtle or unexpected plays.  The endgame is disappointing as well because it is totally possible to get shut out of the bidding in the last two auctions and be left with a lot of unspent money and/or seals.  Sure you get to exchange them at a rate but it pales in comparison to the cards you could have gotten instead.  A harmless experience if you can stick to the 45 minutes time frame as suggested, any more would be criminal.

Probably my favorite new game of Origins 2008, Nefertiti has a lot going for it.  Clever mechanics, easy to teach, and once you know the rules, it plays quickly.  Excellent depth to length ratio.  Can't wait to own a copy.

I LOVE the market mechanics.  I'm indifferent to the character cards; some of them feel useless or clunky.  After one game, I feel like there's something wrong with the set collection.  There were almost no decisions to be made, no optimal decisions.

Tricky balancing; rather interesting!

After 2+ Plays: All the different auction types end up being a little goofy, and without those the game is a very basic auction / set collection exercise.

Not a bad set collecting game. A few new suprises, i.e. markets open/closing. I realize there isn't much new to the mechanics but why does everything have to be brand new. If it works why fix it, no need to re-invent the wheel. Rating continues to go up.

Excellent bidding/worker placement game that works and moves at a clip because it doesn't try to do *everything* like most other worker placement games. The art is bright, the playtime just under an hour. This is my kind of game.

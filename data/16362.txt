Hula Hippos!  A quick flicking (dexterity) game.  Fun enough, quick enough.  Good filler.  Does need a semi-slippery/smooth table-top.

{3 plays, 3-4 players} More fun than it should be.  This one surprised me, as there was, believe it or not, definitely room for some strategy and skill... but not so much that any one player dominated.  Better with the full four players.  Silly fun.  Cool bits.

It's fun, but it can be hard for kids. I think a good handicap would be to let them flick their pieces more than once. I brought this to Sunday School and the kids got pretty frustrated with the standard rules.

RATING: 5
A silly little dexterity game of sliding hippos into the spinning hoop.  It can last a bit longer than it needs to, because the hoop has a tendency to knock the hippos away.  Timing is definitely key as you try to slide your hippos in just as the hoop is about to come to rest.  A simple game that is entertaining for kids and adults alike.

A cool little dexterity game - good fun, simple to pick up and play and a nice time.  Great game for kids - though not too young given the small pieces - if they are old enough to know not to swallow the little Hippos, this would make a great game for them in my view.  Fun game for adults on occassion too - especially if you, like me, can't get enough finger-flicking games!

Played at ConnCon 2012.  Good concept, but the one thick, wooden hoop kept pushing the pieces outward and ended up landing in the middle with rarely any underneath.  (we played on a table with a thin tablecloth, pulled taught on top of it)  They should have included several hoops of differing weights.

I played the Hula Hippo version and I think the ring is too small (or too thick).  It was very difficult to get our hippos into the ring, which was frustrating and made for a long game.

I like the concept of the game.  Perhaps the Habba version is sized better.

RATING: 5
Simple kids game of flicking, flinging, and sliding your hippos under a large spinning hoop before it comes to rest.  The simultaneous chaos of hippos flying all around results in plenty of laughs, and there are a few windows of opportunity for skillful shots.  A good solid 10 minutes of entertainment, and costs less than Mr. Mouth or Hungry Hungry Hippos and is way more fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This isn't the greatest dexterity game, but it is fun for a play every now and then. The fun of it obviously occurs when there is the flurry of flicks once the ring starts to slow down.  The moderate difficulty of getting a hippo in the ring actual increases the satisfaction of when you actually get one in.  Plus, with other people knocking your hippos out, the game can create some riotous moments.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Finger flicking hippo fun! Gets everyone laughing and the hippos go flying! Great with little ones, although the 4 year old just wanted to spin the wooden hoop instead of flick the hippos.

This would make a good game with the kids. Just make sure to let your pets out before you start playing. Otherwise they may eat your pieces as they get flung all around the room.

Stupid fun for adults, but

[b]NOT RECOMMENDED[/b] for kids!

It is far more difficult to score than it appears.  Even if you get close, the ring has a penchant for expelling  hippos from its vicinity as it spins and falls.  

Edit: Apparently this is highly dependent on the table surface.  Need to investigate.

Possibly too hard for actual children, but a great end-of-night dexterity filler. (Also, you can adjust the difficulty by changing the size of the play area.)

RATING: 5
This game is a great example of the chance inherent in some dexterity games simply due to chaos theory. I cannot imagine how you could really get good at this game. Adults seem to like the concept, but generally become frustrated with the difficulty and randomness. Depending on how much glide your table has, the game can definitely overstay its welcome.  But for kids, I would think it would be a hit. Kids (and even some adults) think that because they are physically doing something, they are controlling it. (Dice are a great example. Studies have even shown that people throw dice harder when trying to roll high numbers). I can imagine shouts of joy at how well they slid their mice, even though they probably didn't do much. As a side note, I think Hula Hippos is a much more sensible re-theme from the original German one. I could not figure out how a spinning ring was supposed to represent a house.  Having played both, there is really no difference in component quality so you might as well get the one that at least makes a little bit of sense. Yep, I just said a hula-hooping hippo made sense.

Jan09: Bring on the silly.  I have the Hula Hippos version, and it works just fine.

It's all about the flicking.  And at least for me, it's frickin' HARD!  I thought it would be simple to get the little buggers in there, but I couldn't do it to save my life.

I've only tried two player, but we both were chuckling and pointing fingers from the first spin.

It's *totally* worth the $10 at Barnes&Nobles at the moment.

Too much fun!

This is a really nice little dexterity game. It's deceptively addictive after you learn how to get the hippos to end up in the hoop. The kind of game you say you're only going to play once, and then get sucked into multiple games of. 

You need to conserve a few hippos till the sweet spot between when the hoop is spinning fast and when it's almost done spinning.

It's marketed as a kids game, but playing with adults it can get pretty competitive.

Enjoyable flicking game where you try to get your hippos to land within the hula hoop when it stops spinning.  There is actually a little bit more strategy to this game than initially hits the eye as you can hit opponents' hippos away with yours and effect where the hoop goes by hitting it and timing your shots to get in just under the final swoop or so of the hoop.

Fun dexterity game where a hoop is spun and players try to flick Hippos or Mice (depending on the version) towards where you're hoping the hoop will land.  All animals within the hoop, after it's flat on the table, are taken out of the game (scoring!).  First player to get rid of all their animals wins.

It's much more difficult than it sounds and sometimes a bit of luck can really help you.  You can also try to flick your opponents pieces out of the way.  Most often the animals that make it into the ring are the ones that were flicked at the last second.  10-2008

UPDATE: Knocking rating down 1/2 a point.  I love this game but the ring is too strong.  Knocks away all the hippos.  10 minute game?  I wish!

First, my rating is not that of an adult looking at a kids game. I try to rate fairly when I look at things like that.  In fact, I wanted to give this game a better rating.  I think the idea is really kind of fun.  However, in practice, I find it nearly impossible to play.  I'm not certain I've ever had a hippo actually end up inside the ring.  And if an adult with fairly decent eye-hand coordination has issues, I can only imagine that it would drive a kid crazy.

It’s a "mighty-mouse" flicking game, the aim being to bring your four mice home first. The players need a steady hand, since the mouse hole is a wooden ring that spins around in a circle! This can be some decent fun for the occasional pullout as a filler. It's just flick and hope really, but the spinning hoop is novel and sliding hippos at it can't help but make for fun.

Surprisingly difficult children's dexterity game. The original Haba version is difficult to come by locally, but this one will do. Entirely too big a box for the game, however, which annoys me.

Tricker than it looks as  the hoop tends to push your mice out of the way.  Fun for a little while but not something I would ever ask to play.

A good flicking game, but the learning curve is harsh. It's very hard to score points at first, and games can drag. Start with three hippos per player, I reckon. Once you get better at it, it's awesome.

An immensely fun and entertaining dexterity game. Silly nonsense but uproarious laughs will be had... and since the game costs only $5 there is no reason why it shouldn't be in your collection!

[b]Edit:[/b] After about 5 years with this game, it still is silly fun that has yet to fail. It's still ultimately inconsequential, but I increased it by half a point because of it's longevity.

I like flicking games, a lot (see my ratings for Elchfest and Crokinole). So, in theory, this game looked like a sure winner: it can be played with kids; it has cute wooden mice; and it adds the challenge of a moving target. In practice, however, I found the game kind of uninteresting and, in a non-game related way, pretty frustrating: the wooden ring nearly always ejects the mice as it comes to rest and it becomes a rush to get them back under the ever narrowing gap between ring and table which I didn't find all that fun; but the frustrating part was having the kids constantly flicking mice off the table to hide, invariably, under sofas, buffets, and under anything else that makes retrieving them not especially entertaining.... I'm sadly disappointed.

Very cute dex filler.  I like the natural balance that I first had seen in Witch Pitch where the more you score the more pieces that you have taken out of the game, which makes it harder to score.  Winning is based all around timing your shots as much as it is about aim.

UPDATE:  I now have the Hula Hippos version.  The Hippos seem to get knocked out a bit more than the mice do.  We'll have to see if this is consistently so.  

UPDATE: Hula Hippos just ended up being too difficult. We just had too many null result turns for it to be fun.

This game is unbelievably cute, with an interesting flicking mechanism.  I got this thinking that I would end up playing it a lot, but it doesn't come out as much and is usually passed over for favor of other ultra-light fare.

After playing liking Pitchcar, I thought my daughter would really take to this, but she doesn't care for it at all. It's too bad because I think it's a pretty fun little dexterity game. However, I'm prejudiced and like almost all dexterity games.EDIT: I tried to play this with my friends as a first player decider but they all hated it.

1 play, 4er. 

We had a LOT of fun with this one. I only give it a 6, though, because I would have preferred it to end sooner -- it's too hard!

Summary
Each player has 6 mouse tokens. Take turns spinning the wooden ring. While it spins, players simultaneously try to flick their tokens towards the ring. When the ring stops spinning and falls to the table, remove any tokens within or under it. The first player to get rid of all their tokens wins!

Not something you play a lot in one sitting, but will pull out repeatedly over the months for a good laugh.  Oh, and it's even better with children ...

[HABA 2005 edition] {Animal, kid; action; optimal 4p} Mouse in the house is a hilarious dexterity game. It's suitable for all kinds of players; esp. good for children. In the game, players crazily "flick" their mice to the ring. It's fast, interactive and hectic. It usually is enjoyable. I like it.

The components are top rated. The mice are cute. The ring is sturdy and well polished. It can swirl nicely on the table. However, the small mice are problem. It should be a game for kids but the mouse is too small for kids. And the box is much larger than necessary.

A cute little mouse-flicking game. Try to get your mice in the ring to score. Very quick game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It was kind of fun, but the ring kept knocking all the hippos out of the way and then falling down with nobody scoring, I don't think that this will be helped very much with repeated play, especially with children, because they knock lots of hippos that had a chance of scoring out as well.

I enjoyed it, but I would never play this one over a ton of way better dexterity games that are out there.  I'm amazed nobody's lost a hippo yet.

RATING: 4
A weird dexterity game that I guess is meant for children? I have trouble understanding how children would manage the subtle dark art of aiming their hippos at a spinning ring without breaking into a fit of frustration. Or maybe that was just us adults...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun dexterity-based kid game.  There is enough variability in the spinning ring so that everyone should have a chance to get at least one mouse in there over the course of the game, and yet there is enough skill involved so that good players will do well.

RATING: 6
Very light, finger-flicking fun. Hula Hippos isn't in the same class as Carabande/Pitchcar as far a dexterity games, but it's great fun for kids and often at least a momentary diversion for adults at a low price point.

Very fun dexterity game of spinning a hoop and flicking hippos with the hope of having the hoop land on top of or surround them. Good for kids and adults alike. Supports 2-4 players, best with more.

RATING: 5
Another very good kids game.  It is silly in its simplicity, but it is seriously difficult to not like the purity of this game.  We own Hula Hippos, and all of my kids love it.  I also enjoy it, and would not feel out of place suggesting it between games at a convention or game night.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I love dexterity games and I thought this one looked cute. It just seems too difficult for what it is.  I don't know, maybe we are all just bad flickers, but seems difficult to get even one hippo in the ring.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 5

This is a fun Haba children's game in which players simultaneously try to flick their small mouse components into a spinning wooden ring.  It's quick and silly and fun, but pales in comparison to my other favorite flicking game (Crokinole) and my other favorite Haba game (Schnapp).  It's good but has some stiff competition that it just doesn't measure up to in my mind.

This game is a dexterity game that is harder than it looks. I mean the hippos just don't slide under the ring well after spinning. Can get frustrating for little ones. Not quite sure what the target audience is. It is too silly and simplistic for an adult audience, but too tough and frustrating for smaller kids. Perhaps the age range for this game is rather narrow.

It's not exactly a gamer's game, and it probably won't rank highly on respectable dexterity games, but for a game that lasts about ten minutes and keeps everyone engaged, it's not that bad.  If I were to find it at the right price, it would probably end up in my collection.

[Hula Hippos version]

It takes exactly two seconds for adults to come to love this "children's game".  Nearly everyone I've introduced this to is now looking to buy their own copy.

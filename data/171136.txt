Super silly game of dexterity, quickness, pistol-shooting, chaos, funny music...
It is not my cup of tea, but I recognize genius and crazy ideas, so would like to try it again while half drunk!

Take a little bit of something and pack it up in a light game: meet Pingo Pingo, a chaotic filler that overextended itself and yet is still fun. And addictive.

RATING: 6.8
Lots of fun but definitely need enough room to set up targets 10 ft away.  Also need a table big enough to keep the center card stack arms length away instead of in your lap.  Soundtrack adds a solid thematic feel to the game similar to Escape, but with less tension.  If this goes on sale at coolstuff again for 50% off it's almost a required buy.

Amusing little game, it seems like something you'd make up as a kid. Will be a pretty neat little party game.

This game deserves a 10 for family fun.  This can be enjoyed by both adults and kids.  I rated this per BGG scale, but my 4 year old can even participate, which is awesome.  Top 5 family game for me that I can recommend to anyone.

This game is a bit of a gimmick.  Has a gun that required running around and shooting objects.  The game it played real-time, so it's ooookay.

Crazy party game for adults and kids, that involves a Space Alert / Escape timed soundtrack, card flipping, pattern recognition, dexterity as you dash off and touch a few locations around the room, and of all things, shooting distant targets with a rather well made flintlock pistol that shoots rubber darts.  

It's awesome.

I still prefer Squad Seven, but probably because I played it first. I'm not sure if the penguin theme adds anything to the experience, except a little bit of confusion. I do like the changed rule about not having to run around the table, as that is probably the main reason we don't play Squad Seven more often, there's not enough room!

Hilarious action game!

You really need to sleeve the cards, because they get quite a rough treatment when the adrenaline pumps ... at which point you will notice, that sleeved cards don't fit the box inlay ...
When do publishers learn to admit space for card sleeves??? It's the simplest thing to do, and yet almost no-one does it?!

Btw. If the gun breaks (I have no reason to believe it will, but as I said, the game gets quite hectic) you can use any other toy-gun you have lying around, a Nerf-gun for instance.

Best w/?, 2-5:

Every time I play this game I like it less and less. This game suffers from the active player flipping their card away from them (otherwise they get insider info), then since their hand is next to the card they can immediately slap it (unless you institute another house rule) and then if a player makes a "mistake" then the time spent resetting breaks up the flow of the game and runs down the clock.

Supposed to be fun for kids, but do not mix age groups because older kids will crush younger ones. And tears will erupt whenever a heart is lost which can occur just due to unlucky timing. 

You almost need a person to sit out and just flip cards for everyone. Then the flow of the game can proceed uninterupted and noone has the advantage. But then who gets the challange?

A total blast of silly fun that has us all amused the entire game win or loss. There is a speed element to the game that reminds me a little of ghost blitz but combined with a real time music CD.  So not only do you have to have visual recognition but also listening recognition on top of there there is physical aspect as you need to run to different areas of the room of shoot at a bear. One down side it that you really need a lot of room to play. Just an innovative and unique mix of elements that is just fun.

1 play, 3er

This is a cute realtime game that plays with a soundtrack and a very cool suction cup dart gun! Each player has 8(?) lives. Place some target placards (penguin, bridge, etc.) around the room. Divide the cards equally between them, then start the music. On your turn, flip the top card of your pile into the center, and do what it says. There are a variety of possible tracks: first to slap a treasure card gets it, divide the pile amongst all players, run and touch some target placards, use the gun to shoot the bear, steal someone's treasure, etc. Some treasures have traps on them, and others are supposed to be available only in daytime or night (according to the music); errors result in losing a life point (if you lose your last one, you're out). The game ends at the end of the 15-minute soundtrack. You get points for your treasures (and remaining life?). Most points wins!

It is kind of frantic fun, although I think 10 minutes would've been better than 15.

Maybe a 6/10?

Going by the BGG rating system, I have to give it a 6, just because it's more limited in scope and situation. But when you do play it, it is a blast! A slapjack variant that makes you shoot targets with a dart gun and run around the room. Yep! Probably family oriented, but I would challenge all gamers to give it a go, especially as a social activity or ice breaker. Frantic fun.

My wife loves this, but it's very tedious and overlong.

Zany fun, but before you play, you need to agree how to handle things like collecting darts and standing targets back up. Honestly, it's best to have a "stage hand" to MC the game by taking care of such matters while the players play.

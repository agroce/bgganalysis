Ok, it's not anywhere near DS the boardgame. Let's get over it.

As a game itself, it's a pretty decent filler that takes about 45 mins for 3 players. 

In some way, at least this is not another poker hand set creating victory point collection game. It felt more like a push your luck and dare your opponent game that has some slight tactical twist, in a sense that you can get rid of certain cards and no gamer can just keep adding and adding without care or no tomorrow kind of extend.

There is a point that I did not like about the game is the notion of playing everything in your hand on the last turn, be it useful or not. The player that draws more cards in the survival track will have the upper hand. The randomness of the draw could possibly make this gap between players even wider.

For this point alone, I have drop the rating by a notch.

A decent card game that plays fairly quickly.  Shares the iconography of the board game, but not much else.  

Playing it really reminds me of Taj Mahal in that it can really punish you if you get in card battles too aggressively.  

The trick is to find a balanced approach with your card play.  It can be a little bit much figuring out the running dominance totals with all the pluses and minuses for each round.  But you could do a lot worse than this game when you want to play a filler card game.

Finally played a copy of this game and found the game to have quite an interesting mechanics. While I had not tried Dominant Species so I played it without any expectations.

The card draw is important but in the finale battle I didn't managed to put all my cards down as one of the players ended the game as he ran out of cards. So it ended prematurely. Since had fun even though I am not too into the theme.

c.2011, 6p, hand mgt.  A lightweight game of "take that" and brinkmanship that was a big disappointment compared to the Dominant Species board game.  It tends to be a boom-then-bust game (play most of your cards to get ahead then sit and rebuild for a turn or two) that requires lots of rounds (10) to balance out the luck, but then overstays its welcome because it's a light filler style game. Basically, is a standoff or game of chicken; the only limit to the number of cards you can play on a turn is the size of your hand... but if you and another player go all-in, then you weaken yourselves for several rounds and opponents not involved in the pissing contest could grab some easy VPs.

RATING: 6
A pretty decent little super-filler card game, where players conduct 10 battles, fighting for dominance in two different types of scoring in each round.

Each round, a landscape card dictates various modifications to the base scoring system, making different element icons and animals more or less valuable in that particular round.  Players simply either play a card or pass, attempting to play cards that will best help them score in that round while also hurting other players (there's a little bit of take that style card play).

The real key to this game is hand management.  You don't get to draw many cards, but you'll often be tempted to play a lot of them!  So, you must carefully pick your battles, and sometimes decide when to cut your losses rather than committing too many cards to a battle, which will make you weak in subsequent battles.

Overall, there's a lot of randomness here in the card draw, but it's still a fun hand management game that I'd be happy to play once in a while.

A decidedly OK port of the board game in to card game form.  Whereas I really like Railways of the World: The Card Game as a nice, concise way to introduce concepts to new gamers that you want to move to the full daddy game, Dominant Species: The Card Game just felt like it teaches nothing, but the theme of the game.  There are Event cards you can play, but they are so random and you don't see them coming in the card game, whereas in the board game you can start to prepare yourself for what may come.  As a half hour game this is an OK filler, but call it something else.  The big game is much more fun and meaty!

RATING: 7.75
Much better than I was expecting. As long as you set aside the fact that this isn't a distilled version of the original, you can enjoy a very nasty game of supremacy and hand management. 

Players select from a limited hand of cards to try to gain dominance in that round (by having the highest value of cards) while simultaneously competing for resources available (which offer 1 - 3 points).  But some cards suppress other species, so you have to invert them, lowering their value.  Various event cards can be helpful if you save them for the right moment.

The key for this game is timing - not only looking ahead at the next biome card coming up, but also at whcih round you're in.  Getting dominance in early rounds is fine, but you only get a few points.  Taking control later scores you a lot more.  A good game with 2 players, great with 4, and I would love to try it with 6.  I'd call this game my surprise of the year.

This is a game about having a limited hard of cards and having to pick which battles to fight (i.e. commit your cards to). Overcommitting to the wrong fight could leave you without enough cards for the really important round. It's like a trick-taking game, but somewhat less elegant.

RATING: 3
Players play animal cards into a round hoping to score points for the highest total and/or the bonus symbols.  Players take turns playing animal cards, until the pass and wait out the round.  Points are awarded that escalate throughout the game, with highest winning after 10 rounds.  This is a fairly obvious lift of Taj Mahal, and not a good one.  Taj is luck free, as you see the cards going into the players hands... here you don't.  This game has crazy event cards that whack you out of nowhere, and these get recycled into the deck during the game!  Taj has the brilliant withdrawal mechanic, where you can pass and still score... here if you pass you're a sitting duck.  And this game is way too long, longer than Taj Mahal.  The +5/-5 bonus/penalty at the end of the game is just insane... whack the unluckiest player?  Disappointing.

RATING: 7
Fun, simple card game that unfortunately has little in common with the board game that shares the same name.
The basics of the game can be quickly explained and grasped, even though the full nature of the survival track and the turns might not be apparent right away. Makes for some tight games and doesn't overstay it's welcome, at least with 3-4 players.

The main issue with this game is that its the inverse of the regular Dominant Species. This game is short, very simple, rather random, minimal theme and rather light. It's not as bad as perhaps its rating suggests, fun everyone in a while. You play cards representing species to either lower the value of other players cards, raise your own or play various symbols to score points. What makes it interesting is the very limited card draw (use your cards wisely) and that each round gets sequentially more valuable.

A nice middle weight card game for 4-6 players with surprisingly few moving parts. Reminiscent of Condottiere, but more enjoyable, and actually even simplier than that game. Easy to teach, minimal symbols. A nice take on an area control card game. I was taken by surprise at how good this game is.

RATING: 3
This is the kind of game where I'd much rather have a conversation than play. It gives you two pieces of information: which cards are at +1/-1 for the turn and the hand size of your opponents. If you have spiders and they're at +1 and your hand size is equal to or better than everyone else, you need to go for it. 

Or at least so I thought. I was careful to manage my hand size and go for scoring on two turns when I had the hand size and +1 advantage only to be undone by events. I could not have played any better based on the information given and was out of the game mid-way through. 

Definitely a disappointment considering it shares the DS name.

This is a very simple card game with a nice theme that sort of fits. Little bit disappointed that this is not heavier and more in-keeping with the depth of dominant species the board game.

The end game scoring whereby the player highest on the survival track scores 5 points and the player lowest on the survival track loses 5 points is far to powerful and is usually a ten point swing. This feels very much like a win more mechanic

Not nearly as bad as some have been saying, the card game loosely based on the board game of the same name is a tense, multiple-ways-to-score, push-your-luck card game. It fares well with any of the less successful Knizia card games (Money and Modern Art: tCG come to mind.) Not a mind blowing game and certainly has enough luck in it to give it enough strategical options; but there are enough choices to be made to make it worthwhile. Would play this again as it has a good enough amount of depth to make it interesting. Almost wished it was more of an abstract design as this game should stand alone from DS as it really has nothing to do with it.

RATING: 2
Has a similar feel to Ivanhoe and Taj Mahal, in that you play cards to fight for control, yet isn't nearly as good as either.  Dominant Species the Card Game plays way too randomly for the time it takes and has many balance issues.

Playing this game can be an exercise in frustration, where you sit and watch other people get incredible cards and you are constantly dealt ones with little value. There is also no way to discard and redraw.  In Taj Mahal, bowing out of a round can be beneficial as you can select needed cards.  Here everyone receives the same random draw.  

Then there are those lovely special cards.  A number of these cards help those already in the lead, and then the balance of the others are so lop-sided.  This might be ok in a 15 minute card game, but not in a game lasting 45- 60 minutes.    

Could there be a way to save this game? Maybe five rounds(n\?  or maybe a way to flush your hand(maybe if you pass without an action you can discard and draw)?  

As the game stands Dominant Species the Card Game is terrible.

Acquired 2014 BGGCON VFM from Chris (NIS)

Played at OWLCON 2015. Lightweight card game, filler. I've never played the board game by the same name so my expectations were nonexistent. It was a fun game that did provide some tough decisions. All who played (5-player game) said they would play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I like the playing mechanism but the scoring ruins somehow the game: the last round is too important (with all VPs you might get). The survival track even emphasizes this culmination. With just getting two cards each round my fellow players criticised the few influence/choice you have. The +5/-5 point end-game rule is pointless as it rewards the player who's already in the lead and screws the player who's already losing. Why emphasizing this again?
This leaves much space for house rules to make it gamier like "survival track indicates additional cards to draw each round" or "rising the value of VP each round not from 1 to 10 but slightly more balanced like  3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7. Also I found it useful to offer the players twice in a game to draw 3 cards instead of only two. This is like having 9 starting cards and so in average you have about 3 cards to spend each round (instead only two). You easily can do this additional offering in round 4 and 8 for example.

 I consider Iliad as its predecessor and it was even more balanced than this.

This has the beginnings of a good game, but the limited and linearly increasing scoring combined with limitation on action card draws per round (2) make for a somewhat boring game.

DS:TCG could probably be improved by drawing back to 7 cards per hand per round (so there's no penalty for overplaying) and by instituting scoring based on multiplication of matching food sources to one's cards (similar to calculating dominance in Dominant Species).

This last 3 player game was very good! I think it's likely a sweet spot for this quick and aggressive card game. Maybe 4 would be good too. I like the chaos of this game, but my main complaint would be the "reward the leader" effects included. It might be more thematic, but it only hurts the enjoyment of the game for all the players involved. I think the action cards should reward the losers and the endgame scoring should penalize the survival leader; they got enough points already!

I'm generally not a fan of such escalation-type games (if you get into a fight you lose, and you can't control when you get into a fight)--and this one doesn't even have much going on in the way of tempo. The special actions cards are also weird and wonky.

RATING: 6.5
It is a hand management / trick taking card game that has seemingly little in common with its namesake, the heavy euro Dominant Species, aside from a few icons.  Shines as a light game, totally different from papa.  The round to round play is typical of a trick taking game where you are competing in several different categories.  The larger strategic aspect lies in managing your hand and deciding when to pass.  Saving a bunch of cards for later is a good thing, unless another player empties their hand, which prevents you from playing your remaining cards.  

  It also scales from 3 to 6 pretty good.  I'd say the sweet spot is 3 to 6, two would function but would also feel a little "zero-sum."  We played twice with five and it worked great, I don't think six would change much.

Overall its a simple and fast playing euro that doesn't do anything innovative, but uses some time-tested mechanics pretty well.  I liked it but I'm not sure how often it will get played.  I can't see myself suggesting it very often.

Several of the negative reviews try to compare the card game to the board game and thus it does not live up to the high expectations set by the original board game.  Fair enough, but as someone who has yet to play the board game, this card game is fantastic.  I love games with lots of interaction between players and high degree of a "cut throat" game play, and this game is full of it.  This is an auction style game, in which players must strategically plan on when to make their move.  Exhaust your resources to early and you will fall behind in the later rounds where the points are worth more.  Make your move to late, and you may not be able to catch the player that has been nickel and diming his way to victory.  What makes the game awesome, is the best laid plans can be quickly laid to waste in a heartbeat and at any time.  Like nature, the winner will be determined by who can adapt the best AND a have a little luck.  You can go toe to toe with your opponents every round in a war of attrition, or save your cards for an onslaught of points in the final round to destroy your opponents, but beware you could find yourself holding an epic hand, only to see the round being brought to a premature end via a special event card before you have the chance to play your cards.  As soon as I finished playing this game, I hopped on my phone I ordered both it and the board game version of the game.

Uses little from the boardgame other than some of the artwork and that there are two ways of scoring points.

Putting that to one side (and please do; a lot of comments/reviews seem to be focus on "I don't like it 'cause it's not like my favourite boardgame!"), my take is that it is a fun card game with some challenge albeit it's not a brainburner like Daddy.

It's played over 10 rounds with escalating points as the rounds progress (i.e. winning round 1 gets you 1 point; winning round 2 gets you 2 points, etc).

Card play is simple: either play a card to increase your total for the turn, or pass - and when you pass you can't come in again that round, although your cards in play still stand. Player with the highest points wins the round after everyone's passed.

There are special cards that give you bonuses or allow you to zap the opposition.

As others have said, it is reminiscent of Knizia's Ivanhoe and Taj Mahal, although the scoring's not as obtuse as the latter.

You need to decide when to pass without playing, when to play a card or two in the hope of getting one of the secondary scores, and when to go full-out for the major scoring. The rules about ending the round when someone with an empty hand passes and the penalties for trailing on the survival track mean you can't just hog cards for the last few rounds, which might otherwise be a sound strategy.

Earth-shattering no, fun with some challenge yes.

This is a wonderful card-based adaptation of one of my all-time favorite games. DS:TCG provides players interesting decisions to make, and the timing of those decisions is critical. This is markedly different from its parent game and doesn't necessarily prepare players for "real" Dominant Species. However, this game stands on its own 2-4 feet admirably. A fun, engaging contribution to the card game corner of the hobby.

I am willing to admit that I could be wrong, and I would still listen to a persuasive argument from a seasoned player, but our only play of this game left such a terrible taste in my mouth that the game has been forever banished from our group.

Especially after Urban Sprawl, I should have anticipated that this game would be highly chaotic, but what we found most upsetting were all the cards that only served to help the person that was already winning the game. Add the annoyingly swingy event cards and the overwrought rules for what feels like a souped-up game of War and the game was an absolute nightmare. At 15 minutes, it is palatable, but at 45 or more it is simply too much to think of ever playing again.

(Rating after several plays)

This game is even drier than the DS board game! Rules are simple but the scoring is a mistake. There are ten game turns and winning each turn awards the player with the amount of VPs equal to the round number. This means that winning first five rounds gives only 15 points, whereas winning the remaining 5 rounds is worth 40 points. A complete nonsense IMO. At the end of a game the player that won the most turns is awarded extra points, whereas the player that won the least number of rounds loses points, which is one of the worst rules I've ever seen in a game.

Dominant Species: The Card Game is a fast-playing game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous rescinding of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth.

Players will use six major animal classes – mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid or insect – to further their goals in various terrain. Through wily card play, players will strive to become dominant at as many different terrestrial and sea biomes as possible in order to claim valuable victory points: It is survival of the fittest.

All of this leads to the end game – the final descent of the ice age – where the player who has accumulated the most victory points wins the game.

But somebody better become dominant quickly because it's getting mighty warm...

Played once, 6p.  Waste of time.  Take Ivanhoe (or, at a bit more of a stretch, Taj Mahal).  Now, add less balanced event cards (some are MUCH stronger than others).  Then, include a point scoring win method, where the later "tournaments" are worth much more.  Now, add a reshuffle at a strange interval, so that those powerful events get shuffled back in.  I see no good reason to play this over Ivanhoe.

RATING: 3
I played this 3-players and did not enjoy the high randomness of the design/mechanisms.  There is a big "falling behind" issue and it's improbable that you will catch-up with runaway leader(s).  It takes the "card element" from Taj Mahal board game and abbreviates it.  A much better implementation would have been to keep 90% to 100% of the whole card mechanism from Taj Mahal.  (There's a reason why Knizia, math wiz, designed it that way.)  For example, allow a player who passes 1st/2nd (depending on # of players) to draw card(s) which allows players to catch up.  The design hopes that players will police each other and the gameplay did not really allow for such opportunity.  Often, you don't have much control, and in my opinion, there are plenty of better card games that I much, much prefer.

RATING: 6
This is not Dominant Species the boardgame in any way.  Expect that and you will be disappointed.  There is a fair bit of chaos in the cards which can sometimes be mitigated if you know of their existence.  I would recommend when teaching this game that you tell everyone what the different event cards do so the unpleasant events are not totally unexpected.  You have to pick your battles in this one and there will likely be rounds you will choose to just pass so you can save your cards for the next round since only the victor gets the points...you can score points even if you are not the food chain leader for resources on the biome cards if you have the most in play.  This is not a nice game and is very conflict oriented.

Well, it’s at least shorter than Dominant Species the board game, which it otherwise has nothing in common with (this on the surface isn’t too bad; I didn’t like the board game.). It’s a card game in which you either have good cards for the round or you don’t. You see what’s worth points and play whatever cards you think might get you some. If someone had more of those things, oh well, better luck next round. If Dominant Species the board game is like playing two area control games at once, this is like playing two games of “War” at once.

[microbadge=5]

So what if Dominant Species The Card Game isn't is a card game version of Dominant Species?  Instead, it's a clever game that redefines its trick-taking each round.  Hand-management is brutal; the most critical skill in this game is knowing when to just quit before a fight even starts.  I found that the game played very quickly with up to four, but I've not tested another number.  My major criticism of the game is lack of catch-up mechanism: the rich get richer, and there are fewer unexpected come from behind victories than I would have liked.

The game is better than many reviews make out.  It is extremely light where you are trying to get the majority numbers in order to score a point; however, you have fewer cards to fight with later.

Decent game, good attempt at maintaining the feel of the board game, but make no mistake -- this is NOT Dominant Species.  There's a lot of "accidental" conflict, and the event cards swing the game greatly.  If you're not a fan of chaos, this game probably isn't for you.  It would probably be much more tactical if the special events were removed from the game, but then it would be quite a bit drier.

Basically a trick taking game with some extra complexity. 

Unfortunately it's either too complex or not complex enough: it's not light enough that the players can interact socially and chat with each other during game play--they actually have to pay attention, but at the same time, since it's basically just trick taking, it's also not strategically complex enough to be intellectually engaging.

This game, as it is, has little-to-none control: you draw cards and hope for the best, if you lose a turn and have the wrong cards, there is nothing in the world that allows you to win the next one unless you (and not your opponent) draw what you need.

We play it with custom rules: have 3 cards from the deck layed out as a choice to buy for your action (pick 1 card then exchange it with 1 card from your hand); also we changed the scoring a little.

But in the end, not a keeper. The boardgame version is WAY better.

I was  hoping for a card game as challenging as Dominant Species. DS;TCG is nowhere in the same league. That's not really a criticism, but forewarned is forearmed.

DS:tCG is played over ten rounds. Each round is effectively one large "trick": play one card at a time, adding to a running total for each player. Highest total wins the points for this round. There are cards that zap other cards, or change the scoring slightly, or provide short-term buffs. Scores escalate and the last round features bonus cards for the players in the lead.

It is very simple. There is quite a bit of luck, and table talk and taunting is almost mandatory. Play should be fast, and I think DS:tCG outstays its welcome a little. It is an OK end-of-evening filler.

It seems a nice adaptation of the look, feel and theme of the board game, but there are game-play issues I don't like. You're playing 10 rounds, each round playing out cards competing for dominance in a scoring card. Highest value gets points equal to the round number, making the latter rounds obviously really important, but also getting points if you put out the most of the symbols that survive well in that environment (ie those listed on the scoring card ... don't get too stuck on the theme here). But winning any round is good as it gets you moving along the survival track, and being first or last in that at the end of the game is +ve and -ve points respectively. With everyone competing for limited points each turn though, the game quickly turns into a Taj Mahal type king-maker fest where, if you get sucked into a land war in Asia, blowing all your cards and end up getting second, your hope for the rest of the game is that everyone else gets sucked into similar affairs while you build your hand size up again. Which ain't that much fun. Therefore the game turns into a diplomatic whinge-fest of threat and negotiation - I'll pull out if you pull out - and trust / non-trust. Which can be entertaining in its own right, but can grow tiresome when repeated each round, especially as the game runs long for a card game as it is. There's also some big chaos-bound event type cards which can be huge when played in the right situation, so hope you draw some of those as well. There are other take-that cards which you can use to reduce an opponent's card to half value, or to kill outright, so nothing you play is set in stone. All up, alright for the occasional play but it felt explored after one play.

Hmm...really unsure of how I feel about this game. 2 players has far too much of a runaway leader. I feel like 5+ would be far too chaotic. Maybe 3 or 4 would be a sweet spot? Really feels like luck of the draw most of the time. Still, I have some hope since it's Chad Jensen but as of right now, blah.

Decent little card game, though it really doesn't have a lot of connection to the board game (which is one of my all-time favorite games.) Basically, it a good little filler... I like that you have to make a choice about the best time to play or keep cards in your hand.

If you play this, you have to be prepared that there is gonna be some randomness. I can totally live with that, what bothers me more is that some cards seem to be  completely overpowered. In our first game I had tons of water-elements saved up for the 10th and final round, when Surya played a card saying 'everybody MUST pass immediately' :s. That card will never be in one of my future games again :D

One thing is for sure: it's like in Taj Mahal: if you are going for winning the round, you'ld better win because if you play a lot of cards and get nothing, you're screwed!

Not a bad game, but you need to know when to sit out a round to conserve your hand. Nice card removal mechanic where the first time your card turns to it's weaker side, and the second time it's removed. Feels like it's missing something to be special.

RATING: 3
The players have a hand with animals with various number of bonus symbols and strength strength points and event cards. Each round scores more points up to 10 in the penultimate round. The round cards note which animals are favored or not (+1/-1) and the bonus symbols acquiring points. The current and next round cards are displayed.

Players play a card in turn until they drop out. After each turn regardless of how many cards played each player gets 2 cards.

The animals have 2 levels the initial stonger and a weaker level, and various animial cards and events impact the current strength the animals you've played. However, there are too many events that are crazy strong and several that have the impact of the rich get richer. 

The round based tricks remind me of Ivanhoe and Galaxy the Dark Ages, which to me are better implementations. At least the events in both are more in line with the game play. 

Ultimately I can pass on this one.

Sadly, takes the element of "take that" I like the least of the main game and spins that off to a card game. No worker placement, no area majorities, etc. The hand management is sort of neat though and it plays fairly quickly which is a plus, but overall this is a game I'd be happy to play if someone else owned and suggested it, but I don't need it myself.

Decent game with some good mechanics. Player interaction is good as opponents target other's species to go extinct generating escalating battle for dominance. The tension between giving in to this temptation to escalate versus showing restraint and saving cards to play during the next round adds an appealing and interesting dimension to an otherwise somewhat flat game.

In what universe is this a good game??
If you like the whole "rich-get-richer, poor get trampled" world, maybe this is for you. 

Or, if you enjoy watching others play cards while you look at your hand dismally, realizing you arent going to win anything this round, or the next, maybe you'll enjoy this. 

Honestly the worst game I played in the past year. And I'm not bitter over the outcome as I won my only play.  I do wish I had the time we spent back though, so we could play something good.  

I'd say the only way to win at this game is not to play.

Players for compete for points over 10 rounds (biomes) with a limited hand of cards so must choose their battles carefully.  As we played, someone suggested parallels first to [gameID=19363] which used poker hands instead of animals for points which brought out a thought that this was a bit like poker in deciding which hands to play and which hands to fold (and wait to play another round).

Game was greatly helped by having the passed players calling out the current hand scores to help everyone stay up to speed totaling up the various points, but then each card play (especially the events) would sometimes slow down as folks recalculated the changes.  A lot of math going on which did slow down play a bit.

Of course, we did play with 6 which does work, but suspect the game moves along a bit quicker with fewer players.

People have been quite dismissive of this game by Chad Jensen who designed the superb (though long) board game. This is much shorter and quite different, though the theme is very reminiscent. It involves trick-taking and push-your-luck as well as action cards similar to those of its big brother. Plays up to six (the more the merrier) and improves for me with each play. Underrated IMHO.

First of all, you don't want to play this game with just two. It's hopeless with that number. The game has a rich get richer mechanic that only makes sense in a multiplayer game where it turns into a leader bashing protection mechanism.

Fans of Condottiere and Taj Mahal should get a kick out of this pick your battles mechanic. However, where Condottiere and Taj Mahal have predictable card powers that multiple players can hold or are known to be held by an individual,  Dominant Species The Card Game throws in a bunch of secretly held powerful card powers that elevate the chaos a step or two over those other titles. I also have the feeling that there's less control in Dominant Species The Card Game. Players are more at the mercy of what cards they're dealt.

Of course it suffers the same sometimes perceived problem as any pick your battle game - if you lose a big battle you're screwed. Success relies on picking battles you can win cheaply. The beauty of Taj Mahal is that you can observe what cards your opponents are picking up and where they're likely to go hard at winning. Dominant Species the Card Game is far more random that that, with little of the finesse that saves Taj Mahal from turning into a game of frustration.

So at the end of the day I'd rather play either Condottiere or Taj Mahal over this. That said, I'm happy to give this an occasional spin, if for no other reason than the kids find animals a whole lot cuter than Italian and Indian princes.

RATING: 5.75
Received in trade for quarriors

I had the pleasure of playing this game without ever having played Dominant Species, although I have a cursory familiarity with the gameplay and rules from videos/reading. The benefit of coming into the card game with no practical experience with its namesake was that I was actually able to enjoy the game, unlike the 3 people in our 6 player game who know the board game. It really is light, but I think there are great decisions to be made, although the crazy action cards WILL turn your plans on their head from time to time. But the fact that you have those action cards as well does allow you to plan some fun future turns, or at least fantasize about pulling off an awesome combination. 

Anyway, i'm not sure anyone else has this feeling, but I REALLY got a multiplayer Battle Line feeling from this game (and not just because of the publisher/box size). You are playing out "formations" of creatures to capture an objective (the biome) while reserving cards for other objectives. And the action cards in DS are all fairly comparable to the tactics cards in Battle Line as well. Scoring is radically different, of course, but it still felt a little BattleLiney.

6 players is two too many - the game becomes too long for what it is.  4 players is most likely the sweet spot but need more plays.

This rating would probably go up when I play it with more players. It gives a little bit of the feel of the original game, although you're just focused on a single tile and don't have the interesting action cascade. The dominance cards are pretty powerful and this certainly seems much more luck-based than the original.

UPDATE: Having now played it more than once, the rating inches up a bit. It's not that it's not good, it's just that I find myself really wanting to play the full game. I think I miss having a board.

If you approach it on its own terms, it's an enjoyable game of hand management, bluffing, and screwage. In many ways, it reminds me of Condottiere, though I'd rather play the latter. By comparison, there's a bit too much (too decisive) king-making here.

In the three games i have played it would appear that a hand full of events at the beginning are a disadvantage. I wonder if there could be a variant with 2 decks to draw from

Playtester (credited) at prior GMT Wests, and I liked this card game even though I am a rather poor player at it.

If people are expecting a direct port of the boardgame to a cardgame, they will probably be disappointed here. 

The event cards can be cool - timing is important, or use them to keep you in the round and cycle the table before you have to play again.

A comparatively light and fun multi-player effort that I've had great luck teaching to others, or merely using as a filler. I'll pretty much play this one anytime.

Dominant Species Card Game is nice lightweight version of big board worker-placement game. It maintains the basic idea of watching evolution during ending ice age. Players are not particular species this time, but they play for every creature and are trying to get advantage and help their survival the most. No matter, if you struggle for arachnids in round one, you can be a dinsinfector in the next one. Players are watching their success in victory points awarded for domination of active area, which is based not only on food, but also on population strength. Numbers are always better. Everything is decorated by nicely illustrated action cards offering more choice and interaction. But there are also predators, who can supress enemy creatures and even get them extinct! Individual biomes, for whose dominance are players fighting, are coming in a random way and award for supremacy is getting bigger. Besides, players draw randomly cards into their hands, which might seem random. But there are ways to mitigate this luck factore, because you can always use them in two different ways or keep them for future rounds. Dominance of the individual locations gets more important as the game progresses, while food is getting less crucial. Game is excellently balanced and contains lots of intriguing choices for a card game. All this means, that this game is no shame for a Dominant Species brand and guarantees lots of fun not only for fans of original game, but also families and every card games lover.

This was just terrible. I was anxious to try Dominant Species: The Card Game because I had heard comparisons made to Taj Mahal, once of my all-time favorites. Unfortunately, while the mechanics of play a card or drop out are similar, Dominant Species lacks the elegant escape hatches available in Taj where skillful players can drop out of a round and still get something useful. Dominant Species does have some consolation prizes, but you do not claim them when you drop out, so if you do bow out of a round, you are likely to get nothing for the cards you've expended. This means players simply pick a round and play cards until one player has bludgeoned the others into submission, often by randomly having a take-that card that nerfs an opponent's card. The winning player remains in contention for the win while the losers are pretty much playing out the string from that point on. To make matters worse, extra cards are doled out for the last round based on earlier success, so the rich get richer. This game is so unbalanced and lacking in fun that I'm astounded it was even published. Shockingly bad considering the many great games hitting he market on a regular basis these days.

Up to four Dominant Species:TCG tricks are won in each of 9 rounds, leading to a mega-battle of six tricks in the tenth.  This should be enjoyable for fans of the trick-taking genre, although the major suits are hard to read in one's hand. The occasional event cards are overpowered but the zest in this category is a welcome relief. Fair warning: there is no gameplay connection to the original Dominant Species.  This would have been a better fit as Taj Mahal:TCG.

It is like Condotierie but with a second level of complexity (scoring). A very interesting game with a cutthroat ending.

The mechanism for early ending a round (a player with no cards pass) makes the last few rounds really tense, as you cannot hog cards in the early rounds and, then, down-play waiting for others to quit so that you can dump a handful of animals to take all. I fell in this trap! Be warned.

Provisional rating, one play. Maybe it's the GMT production, but this seemed a throwback to an earlier epoch, maybe the 80's or early 90's.

Surpisingly, the family likes it as it's light and easy to follow with a bit of "screwage" to make it competitive.  Definately not as complex as the board game.  Just wish the pieces/counters were bigger.

Better than the original, although because the original is an overly lengthy exercise in boredom and chaos, this isn't really saying much.  This card game version is reminiscent of those light Knizia card games from the 90s and early 00s with very simple rules but not much to keep you, like [gameid=22198] and [gameid=105].  This, like those games, is a pleasant enough way to pass the time, but it's not anything to seek out.  You could use this as filler, but you're probably better off looking elsewhere.

Kind of bad actually. Completely dependent on luck of the draw (unmitigatable). Nice concept and potential for fun but ultimately empty.

Like Taj Mahal, except instead of cards being drafted from an open pool they are randomly drawn, plus some of the cards are game altering events (not unlike those in the board game). Moreover, there is no value to cards in your hand at game end so towards the end you will see players blow their whole hands in pursuit of the few rewards left. It all isn't as bad as it sounds, but it sure isn't anything to write home about either. My biggest problem with it is that it probably deserves to be 20 mins long but unfortunately is closer to an hour. Still, I'm strangely willing to give it another try (with fewer than 6 players). Don't expect this to be anything like the board game though.

I'm a fan of Taj Mahal and Havoc, two other games that have the "Keep adding cards each turn to try to outnumber everyone else" mechanism that one finds here, but both of those games do a better job of integrating that mechanism that Dominant Species: The Card Game does.  I think it's because Taj Mahal and Havoc don't use action cards and suppression as a means to drive the player interaction.  That's a kind of confrontation that pushes over into aggression, and it feels a little bit like an interrupt card, which I don't like at all.  Plus, the whole -5/+5 point end-game rule based on the survival track rewards the person who's already in the lead and hurts the person who's already losing.  What's the point?  And in a 2-player game, it's totally overpowering.  There are some aspects of the game I like, but overall the game isn't for me.  I can see why other folks might like it, though.

Dunno what's wrong with Dominant Species, but even this very simple & fun filler/family game is quite addictive.

Highly recommended for everybody.

Good game for a group where some strategies can be used, counter-acting the effects of luck in the card draw.

ok game , bit when the first 3-4 turns don't really count.. why have them? its long for a card game.

Gioco molto simile a Condottiere che a quanto pare funziona meglio in meno giocatori rispetto a quanto indicato sulla scatola, si cerca di acquisire maggioranze su due diversi campi con un intensificarsi dell'impegno sulla fine della partita.

I enjoyed the card version of DS a lot.  Definitely less complex and easier to follow.

RATING: 7
Very simple mechanics with lots of scoring variables.  The tensions are mostly in saving your cards for the right time to strike and in recognizing a sunk cost and bailing early enough to minimize your damage.  The actual card-play is pretty straightforward, though there are some interesting events that can add some complexity to this.

The special event cards seem awfully swingy (though maybe being familiar with them will help this) and the take-that aspect will lead to some kingmaking that some folks probably won't like (I was the beneficiary of this in my first game).  I liked the game though and am interested in playing some more.

A good 8. I like the theme, the artwork and the game play. It is a second game of the night rather than a full night's game.  I imagine playing quite a bit, if I do I think it will go up to a 9.

A "take that" style of card game. Too long for a light filler and if you think you can play meaningful cards they will be cancelled by an action card.

Light card game that may be an auction game in disguise, but with a twist in that you can affect other players' bids.  Has nothing to do with Dominant Species other than the art.  Easy to teach and plays fast.

Not the most exciting game in the world, but it is ok. The card play lacks a certain amount of tension, as you usually have planned out your entire turn when you see the biome.

If you like the dinosaur theme and don't want to play a 3 hour wargame like Dominant Species, this might be cool.  But I'd rather get the real DS on the table.

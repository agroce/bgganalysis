This is a great introduction to the system!  It's not an insulting facade pretending to be a complete game, it really is.  I love having spell books and customizing them and then paying to cast them.  The whole game is smooth, and it's not random: you have to think your way through this.  Big thumbs up!

It's not about to replace Magic any time soon, but there's the nice tactile feel with the spellbooks and it does play rather straightforward and smooth. Note that I haven't really played the heavier Mage Wars to compare. Solid if not exceptional wizard dueling.

Takes everything that makes Mage Wars Arena interesting: the spellbook, the variable player powers, the balance of creatures versus spells, and makes it into a streamlined card game.  I honestly can see this hitting the table twice as much as the original game, and that says a lot considering how highly I think of the original.

High skill ceiling and moderately low skill-floor. Great game that keeps improving the more versed a player gets into the rock-paper-scissor nature of knowing the flexibilities  of ones own and their opponents spellbook.

Negative: Only starts to open up with spellbook customization which requires a moderate amount of experience and commitment.

Interesting attempt to ease & speed the original Arena experience. Unfortunately a failed one for me as it strips Mage Wars of most of its strategic & tactical glory. Why playing this one over Phoenix or better yet M:TG if you get rid of the spatial element?
Good to excellent card additions to Arena though.

RATING: N/A
Feels like Mage wars.  It is fairly fun. It loses a little bit of theme since the board is now gone.  It does feel like a preparation for the arena.  Smaller spell books, a variety of cards, stripped down rule set, and simplified core mechanics.  It will not replace areana for me but it does have a lot to offer to new and old fans of Mage wars.

RATING: 6
Another game that takes a lot of inspiration from Magic the Gathering. This one is better than the rest however because you get to choose which cards you play from your whole deck. This makes it possible to create strategies and also make tactical decisions.

Aside from that it doesn't stray too far from the MtG formula. But the spells and creatures are all cool and the game isn't over-complicated by tons of statuses and counters.

I really love this game. I am a mtg player that no longer wanted to pay the price of keeping up with a tcg "booster pack" model. This game feels a lot like mtg (a good thing), but also is different enough to tickle a different part of the brain. It also fixes mana screw and luck of the draw. You gain a fixed amount of mana every turn that you can spend as you see fit, when you want too. Also, all your cards are in your "spellbook" and can be accessed at any time! Wow no more top decking, lol. 
So it mainly is, as the name implies, a typical mage dueling game. Your mage will have studied a certain type of magic which will limit the types of cards you can use in the spellbook. Each mage has a unique play style. The rules are easy and streamlined. 
One potential con I can see someone having is that there is a dice roll for attacks. A creature will roll "X" attack dice, depending on the card. You never quite know if that attack will crit or miss, but is balanced because better creatures roll more dice (will probably hit some). This makes attacking uncertain and a little risky sometimes. I really like that aspect of the game, but understand some people will not.
I highly recommend this to anyone who likes dueling games! I'm excited to try the highly rated expansions once I'm ready for them!

I'm very impressed with Mage Wars Academy. After dealing with luck of the draw for years the concept of the spellbooks is very appealing and it gives the players a lot of range for their decisions. The two characters are very different, I'm curious to see what they'll add to it.

The great box size is just right for the components and makes it portable, at least until expansions start coming out.

Must play further.

This game has simple phases, but there are so many little rules involved that we have had a hard time playing.

Love Hearthstone? You'll love MW:Academy then! That's how I see it! The idea of the spellbook is fascinating, and Arena is a bit daunting (but not doubt awesome to get all into it). This can be crunched into an hour (after a few learning plahs). Please AW do NOT let it go too long without expansions!

I played Mage Wars: Arena once and enjoyed it but was overwhelmed. I've wrapped my head around Mage Wars: Academy not necessarily because the rules are simpler, but because the playtime is so much shorter that I've been able to get in several games in rapid succession with my son. And we're loving it. It feels much more thematic to me than Magic: The Gathering, while also being less complicated.

Some years before i played Mage Wars Arena. Arcane Wonders did an outstanding job with it. But it was too "big" for me. I am a casual player. 
Now i bought Academy and it fits my personal taste so much more. And it has the great Mage Wars feeling! 

I like that there are just a few cards out there and that every year "only" 2 additional mages come out with some hands full of new cards. Not like in the other LCGs with tons of new expansions (money sink).

I played it 6 times now. Will be interesting to see how many games some can play before the core set gets repetitive.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (April 2016)

I love Mage Wars, it was the best game of its year for me (2012), so buying Mage Wars: Academy was a no brainer, even if the game was bad, I would buy to have the new cards (which are compatible between the two games, a HUGE plus in my book).

The game rules are simplified and they are very easy to teach, you can do it under 10 minutes. Playtime is around 30 minutes.

The game art continues to be astonishing, I love it. The game components are also good quality but they are, somewhat, diminished from the previous incarnation of the game. I really like the player´s dials, they are very practical.

Thematically, now you are a student wizard who is training for the arena (the previous game), so now the battles are a lot shorter (you have less life, less spells, less spell points to spend, less strategy, less rules, less everything in general), due to this I feel the game lost some of the epicness feel it had. However, Mage Wars: Academy still offers interesting decisions (basically which spell to play, but that’s not obvious in many cases) and makes thematic sense (it does feel you are training for arena). The big difference between both games is that in Academy there is no board, so the concept of distance was eliminated from the game. Also, now you can also choose any spell you want to play, you don’t have to prepare them before playing them (I’m still not sure how I feel about this). They also removed the conjurations but it seems expansions will bring them back.

It seems way too easy to attack your opponent’s wizard. I need more plays to verify this point! (but that’s one of the reasons the game plays so fast).

The advantages Academy has over Arena are significant (short playtime, portable) so it is lot easier to get it to the table, but I still prefer Arena.

Bottom line, Mage Wars: Academy is a good game I want to play more. I will surely buy all its expansions but I prefer to play the parent game (Mage Wars: Arena) over Academy. I hope Arcane Wonders continues to support Mage Wars: Arena.

Current Rating: 7.0

A quicker game of mage wars played in one zone, excellent for two reasons. 1) It is a great way to introduce newer players to mage wars overall and 2)Plays in a much shorter time span, although it doesn't scratch the same itch as an epic round of the original, it will hit the table far more often.

Pretty fun duelling mages game. The spellbook is a great mechanic. Plan your stuff without the randomness of card draw. Properly anticipate mana curves and game tempo. Great stuff.
That being said there's still randomness like dice rolls for effects and damage values and stuff.

That being said, it's not enough to stand out from the masses. The game's good but not excellent.

Art's good. A lot of stuff I really like. The graphic design... not my jam.
Do love they kept so much stuff in the game so you can combine it with big brother Arena.

Szkoła magii wstępem do planszowych potyczek w MW Arena. 
Bez planszy. Mag magowi oka nie wykole ale może wysłać kruka, czy inne coś ognia, czy też coś błyskawicy. Karciane potyczki magów z wykorzystaniem dowolnej karty z księgi czarów (w pudełku 2księgi i ponad 130 kart). Akcja wspieramto zakończona w połowie 2016, rok później jeszcze nic nie wiadomo o dacie wydania. Wakacje 2018 nie wykluczone. Mniej cierpliwi żądają zwrotu kasy (i dostają w ciągu kilku dni) reszta czeka. Bardzo niezrozumiałe i przykre zachowanie twórców kampanii w stosunku do wspierających. Milczą nawet na temat profów (przedprodukcyjnych), czy oglądali czy nie, żadnej aktualizacji po 2miesiące a jednocześnie rozpowiadają na spotkaniach z recenzentami że jest szansa dotarcia gier na wrzesień-październik. Kuriozum komunikacyjno-wizerunkowe. Następne kampanie raczej do zignorowania, zdrowiej poczekać na dostępność w sklepach. Aktualicacja 11.09.2017 Przeprosili, dali 50%zniżki (od ceny konwentowej nie SCD - sugerowanej ceny detalicznej)na jednorazowy zakup dowolnych gier (max 2szt każdej gry) do czasu ukazania się MW. Udostępnili instrukcję (jest trochę błędów - ciekawe czy poprawią) i karty - błędów nie stwierdzono (na razie). 1.10.17 Podobno uwzględnili błędy które zgłaszali wspierający po przeczytaniu instrukcji. Ciekawe ile pozostanie baboli.
23.10.2017 nadal nie ma żadnych konkretów z produkcji, data, podobno, grudzień 2017. Zobaczymy. Ludziskom jak przy 500+ nagle nic nie przeszkadza i siedzo ;) cicho.
2.02.2018 Podobno już drukują, były (ponoć) wydrukowane karty ale drukarnia (?) zrobiła błąd i wydrukowała nie z tego pliku co trzeba. Ma poprawić i wydrukować te co trzeba. Może to i prawda jednak gry jak nie ma tak nie ma i nie wiadomo kiedy będzie.

A faster and "simpler" version of Mage Wars Arena?! YES, please!

Mage Wars Academy hits the spot for me! It proves that tactical game play does not need to be long and tedious. This is 30-40 minutes pure action and fun. 

This replaces Mage Wars Arena for me, because it is faster and more to the point. I can play Mage Wars Academy way more often and it is NO LESS fun than Mage Wars Arena. In fact I like it even better. You jump right into action. It goes back and forth more quickly and Mages cannot turtle or run away. 

Maybe I am the only one, but I never fully enjoyed the board movement system in Mage Wars Arena anyway. I'd rather play a miniatures game, if I want movement. Mage Wars Academy is a pure card game and definitely what I wanted in the first place.

Mage Wars Academy is now the fastest game in my collection, while still being equally tactical and even more engaging at the same time. Therefore it will definitely see the table much more often than any other of my games.

So for anyone who would like to play Mage Wars more often, or who is looking for a fast, yet tactical game, this is it.

Mage Wars Academy is just "Ok". It should have been called Mage Wars Express. It's much slimmed down from the deeper game it was derived from, which I would much rather play.

RATING: 6.8
With only the base game it is only a 6.8 for me as it lacks variance and everything is happening in only one zone.
As with Arena if you don't play if often and don't know every card and every condition in the game the time spend on the game is easily 4 times as listed as you have to check/read for the synergies of your cards in your book.

With the addition of priestess and warlock and possibility to build some different spellbooks it's more fun.

Mage Wars Academy is a streamlined version of Mage Wars Arena that removes the board and movement in favor of shorter games.  A great replacement for Magic the Gathering.

PROS:
* Pick whatever spells you want each turn. No deck shuffling and hoping you get the cards you need.  You can execute your strategy as planned and pull the cards you need to react to what your opponent is doing.
* Mana gain each turn means you don't have to worry about drawing too few or too many mana giving cards like in a game like Magic The Gathering
* Deck building.  Lots of freedom to create your spell book as you like.
* Living card game. No rare cards to chase.

CONS:
* Learning curve. There are many keywords such as "Pest" and "Ethereal" and until you know them all you'll be reaching for the rule book quite often.  I would have preferred to just see more text on cards like "Unable to guard" and less keywords.
* Attack dice can be a bit swingy.  As there is no shuffling it's not a bad thing that some randomness is added by rolling dice for attacks. However, I think the dice could have been numbered to be just a bit less swingy. For example by replacing one of the blank sides with a '1'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Like a CCG but players play cards out of a spellbook (no random shuffling of cards, you choose). Once you get the rules down (which aren't too difficult) it should play fairly quickly. Nice little system.

The spellbook is such a great and simple innovation. I haven't played Mage Wars Arena, so I can't compare it to its big brother, but as a 2-player game the fast and elegant gameplay is probably just what the doctor ordered.

As I play this more, I'm really starting to become enamored with it. It's fairly samey from game to game, but with the expansions on the horizon, I think there are going to be some really fun match-ups to be had. This takes the board game and condenses it into strictly a card game. It feels very similar to M:TG in this way, but I think the fact that you have your entire deck available to you makes a big difference. Ultimately I would rather play this than other mage-dueling games.

This is a simplified version of Mage Wars Arena, which I also didn't like.  I only played with the starter decks. The combat was much too random for me - I'm not a fan of rolling dice for when you are doing few enough rolls that the randomness really matters.  If you get lucky and manage to destroy something you probably shouldn't have, it doesn't feel like you earned it - it just feels like you got lucky.  Conversely, it just feels bad if you just miss a bunch.

Solid game, but did not give me the feeling at the end like it was a MTG replacement.  Instead, it made me want to play Mage Wars Arena.  I will give this couple more plays before rolling these cards in with the Arena set.

Games like this, Ashes, and MW Arena tend to have a lot of lingo like dispel and thing other words, so first sessions and barrier to entry can be a huge pain. Also they are very Ameritrashy, so its debatable whether a europhile will enjoy as much. They are more similar to MTG or Epic than other games. Try to try before buying if at all.

This is a direct descendant of Magic: the Gathering, and a worthy one.  It improves on some of the more antequated ideas of Magic (like replacing deckbuilding with spellbook construction), but a limited card pool introduces balance and synergy issues.  I have not played Arena, so I cannot comment on the lack of area effect dueling mechanics.  Highly tactical and fun.

Simple versions of mage wars Arena. If you want a game a little bit easier to play. Shares some similarity with magic. This is a pretty fun game.

I love it. Not as much depth as Arena but it packs a lot into a much more streamlined game. I'm hoping Arcane Wonders continues to support this because I think that there are times I will want to play Academy and times where Arena will be better. I have no problem with keeping both of them in my collection.

This streamlined version of a Mage Wars has been a big hit with me. It feels like an epic Mage Wars battle, but can play in 20-30 mins. The potential for Arena games to out stay their welcome is a deterrent to it hitting the table more often, this eliminates that. Plus my kid & big brother both love it meaning I can get regular games in, often. :)

Excellent game. playable as a standalone game which is a very simplified version of Mage wars arena, or use it as a supplemental expansion to the full Arena line of Mage Wars. there are many great cards in this set that will work great in Arena, as well give a nice tactical edge when playing the smaller academy version.

Coming from being a massive Mage Wars Arena fan, I did expect to really love this game.

Starting with the positives. 
1.The box is nice quality and the art is fantastic. 
2. Card art is superb and in keeping with Arena. 
3. The game is much quicker to setup and play than Arena. 
4. The beginning spellbooks have good variety, but are also small enough to allow even a beginner to get their head around the options (as opposed to the infinite decisions for beginners in Arena). 
5. There looks to be enough cards to explore some deckbuilding in the initial set. There are still a few rules to be read, but it is quite comparable to how much needs to be read in other games (got a few new games this Christmas). 
6. Turns are a lot simpler than Arena, so a lot of the complexity is removed. 
7. Like Arena, spells work like a layperson would imagine them to. Attack spells attack opponents, creature cards summon physical creatures etc...
8. For an Arena player - I can also see lots of positives as far as bringing cards in this expansion into the Arena and enhancing my experience there!

However, I see a few negatives.
1. The box is too small. Seriously, when I put the trackers together and bag tokens - it is a struggle to close the box completely. When expansions come to the game, there is zero chance that extra items will fit into this box. I do appreciate that original Mage Wars had a box that was way too big, but this is going too far in the other direction.
2. The dials go the intuitivally wrong way. Minor quibble, but is annoying.
3. One of the starting Mages (the Wizard) has a heavy focus on mana denial. Seriously, this is horrible. I know in the main game that mana denial is a valid strategy, but this is not something that should be in the starting game if you're aiming at new players. I was able to keep my opponent at little to no mana at all times, which limits what they can do and frustrates them. Since Mana Worms, Minor Essence Drain, Rod of Arcanum are some of your main tools in the starter book - it wasn't even much of a choice to do so.
4. The Asp and Basilisk. If there is one condition I HATE in the main game - it is "Weak". It is incredible debilitating and renders some of the most powerful monsters worthless. It is incredibly annoying to get rid of for everyone except Priestesses. Options in Arena are fairly limited to remove it. On the back page of the rules, it explains that Weak has a removal cost of 2. Yet there is NO WAY IN ACADEMY TO REMOVE IT. My opponent saved up mana and summoned that incredibly tough Hydra - I used DoubleStrike and put 2 Weak tokens on him so he is now rolling single dice attacks for the rest of the game, I could basically just ignore it for the rest of the game. This, I feel, was incredibly bad design.
5. Creatures with defense. The Beastmaster has way too many of them. In Arena, defense is quite powerful and relatively rare. It's quite annoying to swing at a creature and have less than a 50% chance of hitting them. A great thing about Mage Wars, for me, is that attacks hit - damage is mitigated by bad rolls or armour. But constantly rolling a D12 and getting "misses" is not a great experience for new players.

I think the starting Mages should have been BeastMaster v Warlock. Two great archtypes with simple mechanics that would be easily understood. The BeastMaster would focus on summoning a legion of animals, the Warlock would focus on direct damage. 

So overall, I'm conflicted. 
Will I play the game again and will my cards see play? - Absolutely! 
But I'm not the best target audience for this set - I'd have got it anyway. The target should have been newer players and mages with less infuriating tactics/abilities. I really wanted to be able to bring this along to my local gaming group and get people to try this out, so they can have a possible introduction later into playing Arena. While I will be doing this, I'm not sure that the experience will be as good as it could have been.

So I don't think I can give this the "10" that I expected to be giving it. :(

great short duel game. Love Arena, but like to play Academy in it's own right. So glad to trade deck BS for some good old dice. I get to play what I want, when I want, and if the dice screw me, I can still feel good about my play, and play again. THe better spellbook will still win almost all of the time. This is important to me. I come from abstract games, and want my moves to be my moves, not friggin decided by a limited selection from a randomly shuffled deck.

Terrific alternative to Magic. Love that both sides are on equal footing, and it comes down to the cards you have and the way you play them, rather than the cards you can afford for the current legal block and how they come up in the random draw.

As far as differences with Mage Wars Arena, though I do somewhat miss the tactical movement and traps of the original, I really enjoy how fast this game plays. In the same span of time that I could play one (enjoyable) game of Arena, I can play three games of Academy.

While I have only played this game a few times, I already love it. The core mechanic of the game, which sets it apart from any other game I’ve played, is that the game is not dependent on the luck of the draw. Not only can you build your own customized deck for your Mage, but you have full access to each and every card at all times. Instead of having your cards in a deck, you have all your spells (cards) in a Spellbook (mini card binders) that you can play at any time, as long as you have built enough mana to cast the spell. The two Mages in this set, Beastmaster and Wizard, play completely differently from the other and really require you to study your Spellbook and strategy for success. There is a bit of a learning curve, but it’s worth it to get the depth of gameplay and replayability.

This was probably an unnecessary impulse buy.  I really enjoy Mage Wars (now Mage Wars Arena) and I don't need a board-less version.  I like Mage Wars so much though I have acquisition disorder and bought this to get the new cards that don't appear in Mage Wars Arena.  So I have some new stuff to add more variety to my deckbuilding but I already had enough, and don't really like the two concurrent versions of this game.

Quick-fire duelling wizards game (20-30 mins), and the first of this type if game I've played. I've not played MW Arena but like this paired-down version. The two core-set mages play very differently but are well-matched. I have all available expansions and each mage has it's own style. I play with my 8 yr old, and he picked up the rules and strategy pretty quickly.

This seems to address a number of my issues with the larger Mage Wars. In Arena, AP could be quite an issue since you have your entire deck available at all times. In Academy it's not as much of an issues simply because your deck is smaller. Also your mage can usually only cast one spell per turn, so you don't have that phase where you select two cards to possibly play.

The next thing is the play time. This is addressed in a couple of ways. It gets rid of the spacial aspect, so you don't have to deal with slowly moving around the board and enemies retreating. The other thing is a lower amount of HP for the mages. The base game mages have HP in the low 20's, so it's only a matter of time before someone gets killed.

My main issue with the larger game, though, hasn't been completely fixed: the number of keywords. There are still tons of keywords here. This wouldn't be a huge problem, but a lot of keywords are in effect even if they're not printed on the cards. Most creatures are considered corporeal, even if the card doesn't say it. Creatures are either minor or major, but you have to check their level to see. Some effects (such as Weak) stay with the creature for the whole game, while others (Stagger) are removed after activation. If a creature has Doublestrike, its attack bonuses only count for the first attack. So. Many. Variables. Every time I play or even read about Mage Wars I feel like I learn a new rule. Academy isn't too bad yet, just because the cardpool is smaller, but I imagine it will eventually be as bloated with keywords as the Arena.

With all of that said, though, the game seems like a good one. Definitely an improvement over Arena. The impact of creatures makes it feel different from other dueling mage games. Creatures usually don't just come out for a turn and then get immediately killed like in similar games. A creature usually sticks around for several rounds, and they add to your number of actions per round.

The game seems good overall. I just wish they had taken this opportunity to totally revamp the system and streamline a number of things, instead of creating a game that can also double as an expansion for Arena.

I like this better than Mage Wars Arena, because it is the same game, but without the board, that just slowed down the game. So this plays a lot quicker, while still holds all the goodies in Arena. I love the speelbook! You can try to plan and anticipate the game temp and evolvement. However, I still dislike the dice combat.

The game was fine but very random. You flip a card which you can't get? Your opponent will surely grab it. Then, on your turn you can flip another card for them to get!

Fast and easy to learn micro scaled deck builder game. Instead of who knows how many stacks of cards, you just need one deck to play.
Highly portable. Very fun.

Full disclosure, I help design this game. I love playing it. I always want to play it. The Red Dragon's dungeon is the most vanilla, but really feels like the essential 100 Swords experience.

RATING: 9
100 Swords is the kind of game that can look normal on a first glance but when you played it, you're hook!  Line and Sinker too!

The Deck-Building mechanism are simple enough to be understand in the first 5 minutes and the quick game leaves you wanting to play another game!  Then you have the Dungeon Builder Set to add gameplay and variability and your sold.  Completely sold...

My 9/10 rating is based on the Season 1 Kickstarter's experience.  I backed this game, then wasn't sure I made a good choice.  When this game hits my gaming table, all players I introduce to this card game were hooked!  They loved the simplicity, the nice graphics, the originality and the mechanics.  When I added the Dungeon Builder Set, for longer game, they all agreed that was a must-have game!

With no surprise, I bought the Season 2 with everything I can put my hands on, with a "shut up and take my money" attitude.  And you can guess, I'm not disapointed!

Oh! Did I mention there's also two solo mode and now, a Multi-User Deck, to play with 3 or 4 players instead of the original 2 players-only?

*Disclaimer*
I did not received any money or goodies from Laboratory for this review. This was made with my own free-will, just because this game was so much loved then expected to be!  I really tought this will be a 5/10 game, one I pull out of dust once in a while but it's not!  I carry Deck 1 (Red Dragon) and 2 (Blue Mammoth) most than any game I own.  Gonna need a new boxes soon... but I just receive Deck 3 (Gold King) and 4 (Silver Queen) so...

Backed on Kickstarter. I like the customization possibilities. I've only played with the basic decks so far, haven't tried mixing anything.
For ease of reference, anytime I play 100 Swords, regardless of which deck or whether I built my own, plays will be recorded here.

RATING: 6
A quick, light deckbuilder with less interaction than many we play. Due to bad luck, the dungeon can sometimes be rather difficult during the early game which can slow the game to crawl.

RATING: 1
First, the online instructions (the game comes with no printed copy) for 100 Swords are poorly-organized and do not explain how to play the game completely. This comes as a surprise, since the Kickstarter copy was cheerful and literate. No game can be a game with instructions on how to play the game, so this one fails before you can even get it on the table.

Let's say you manage to put things together from KS videos and give the game a go. You'll find that once the cards are in your hands there is no compelling reason for the player to act other than because the game requires it. There's nothing urgent, fun, or even logically challenging about the elements of the turn. It's less engaging than a game of Hearts.

Essentially, you discard to move through a dungeon of cards. You land on either a card that you can buy by discarding more cards or on a monster/barrier that prevents you from moving more unless you discard even more cards to defeat it.

There is intended to be an interesting puzzle here of trying to get the most out of your actions with the least cards. What happens in practice is typically that you hit a monster, are excited to defeat it, but then either are card-poor or disinterested by the remaining offerings. Since defeated monsters are worth gold that is only useful in scoring (and not purchasing), the game quickly flatlines  because your have spent your entire deck and without greatly increasing your energy or movement capabilities. 

There needed to be something more dynamic about the dungeon to make this work. Having the gold from monsters be spendable in the dungeon (but detract from your final score) is the obvious answer. Other mechanisms are either more cards with a "when revealed" cue or some other mechanic to deal with items you intentionally skip purchasing.

The game has a delightfully unified look that screams both 80s Saturday morning cartoon and lo-fi video game, but it lacks in motivation for the player to do things other than because the game requires it. Conceptually, the ambition to collect things which are worth the most gold doesn't always line up with making progress in the dungeon, but that in turn makes progressing through the dungeon pointless - causing the game to grind to a halt.

100 Swords is a solid micro-deckbuilder.  I like the movement through the dungeon mechanics and the secrecy of most cards.  My only big complaint is that you have to go online to get the full rules.

Amazing deck-builder for 2 players only.
A cool mix of a push-your luck dungeon crawl and a deck-builder with more focus on the simple dungeon crawl.

I recommend getting many core sets and expansions to mix it up and get a unique setup each round.

RATING: 7
Good: Simple easy to play. I play solitaire while listening to TV with my wife.  My mind does not need to be fully engaged in the game.
I like how the monsters are set aside instead filling my deck (unlike Dominion or Thunderstone).
I also like that I get to use a item immediately, instead of waiting until I draw it. 


Bad: Rule book should be in the game. Not require access through the internet.  The printout chopped both left and right of the rules.

Tiny Epic Clank! :-)  Like some of the Scott Almes Tiny Epic games, this little gem from Laboratory Games packs a lot of game into just 50 something cards.  As with Clank!, you get a good combination of a dungeon crawl and a deck builder.  Though nowhere near as deep and elegant as Clank!, 100 Swords will fit in your pocket and give you a very satisfying game play for under $20 US.

The artwork is fun and some of the card text is cute (crappy swords, OK swords, better sworrd, shy mold monster).

The big surprise is how nicely this game plays solo.

RATING: 7
This seems to be a game that people love or hate but I think it is great! It is a quick, light deck builder perfect for introducing deck building to new players. 

The art is light and fun as is the game play and there is very little writing on the cards so you can teach it to a variety of ages/people.

On the forums there is a fun solo variant already up on BGG to replace the lest than stellar solo play in the box and there is also a good multiplayer setup variant as well, with two dungeon entrances that works well if you have two decks.

I highly recommend adding tokens to track which cards you have/can see to remove the memory element until people are really comfortable with the game. As for me I added put both the Red Dragon and Blue Mammoth Dungeon into my Welcome to the Dungeon box for a fun, thematic easy to carry game set.  I use the character cards from Welcome to the Dungeon as markers for each player and to add to the theme!

Quick little deck builder. I don't normally play 2 player games but this works in good for a quick game. Solo is okay, but doesn't give you a true feel for the game. This is a basic deck so easy to mix in Dungeon Builder Sets.

Two player fantasy deck builder romp through a Munchkin like dungeon.  The twist to this deck builder is the tableau of cards for purchase are face down representing dungeon corridors. You have to explore the card space to see what lies behind. Cards can be monsters, gear, and of course swords. Player turns can take awhile, so have something to do while you wait for the next round.

RATING: 8
Once you get past the abysmally useless rules, and learn how to play, the game is pretty light and easy. 

Especially with the dungeon sets, it has enough variety to let you try out a bunch of items, and honestly just have a little light fun with a low time investment. 

It won't replace something like Dominion or Thunderstone, but you'll probably enjoy it as a filler.

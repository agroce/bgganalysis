RATING: 7
Good game.  It was enjoyable to play.

Pros:
- New and interesting mechanics: selling the track off to the Red and Green Lines when no longer useful
- I can see some depth to the game as players strive to build in the same areas to pull resources.
- Definitely a good amount of player interaction: Auctioning Resources, Buying Trains, Building Tracks
- Historical Aspect: I enjoy the idea of building up the tracks to later sell off when they are no longer profitable.

Cons:
 - Steep Learning Curve: lots of symbols and resources to try to figure out.
 - Good amount of setup: Kind of painful to have to seed the board, remove, seed again.
 - AP Prone: This game will have AP Players tied in knots.  There's an auction for resources where what you purchase is what you will use for the rest of your turn.  So, you need to plan you're turn in advance, then execute (being penalized if you don't calculate correctly).

+ The board will always be different for every play which forces you to focus on different areas and tactics; Scoring methods are varied (passengers, goods, sets, profitability, old tracks, etc.) and all need to be maximized.
- It takes so, so, so long to set up the board.

Easier than I thought after reading the rules. Gameplay is quite fast and interesting. In my only game so far there was very little competition in the map, only in the audiction and buying trains. I hope that this is not the norm but an exception.

It's a good, kind of different take on train gaming. My biggest gripe is that the end game has consistently been  sort of uninteresting/difficult because it seems worthless to do anything at all. I like the heart of the game's design. But I don't like running out of things to do.

I would also probably rate it higher if the beginning of every round wasn't so fiddly adjusting all the little influence tracks (such tiny discs! Argh). And there are one or two funky situations that can happen on the board which result in players being unable to ever sell off some of their track.

On the plus side, I love that the goods are randomized. Ideally, I always prefer modular board game setups. Nuremberg has two maps that will never change--but the best routes to navigate those maps will always change every game.

RATING: 7
A nice and quick to play pick up & deliver game by Martin Wallace. It has an auction round too and some light economic management. Plays good from 2 to 4 and you get a double sided map. The worst part is the manual... Couldn't they write it better?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I can't think of another game that puts its players where First Train does; as businesses operating in a very marginal economy, where expenses often exceed earnings,  suffering a slow death at the hands of a couple of major companies. That economy fits Wallace's railways in Wensleydale theme very well.  I am less convinced that it works for early railroads around Nuremburg.  However, I am not about to complain that Argentum gave us a second board to play on.

Central to the game are four types of influence that determine play order in two key phases (track building and train hiring) and are spent to accomplish essential activities.  That influence is acquired in an Evo-esque auction phase. 

The nature of track in this game is interesting.  Of course you need it to get from A to B.  But once the passengers and goods have made that journey, track becomes a costly liability to be sold off as quickly as possible to a major company. For those who don't quite get the idea, the end game scoring hits with a double whammy of negative points for being in the red (too much track will put you there) and a minus point for every track section.

Overall, juggling those several forms of influence and thinking in ways that most railway games don't require, while indulging in kinds of screwage that are familiar ("you stole my train/cubes/track connection!") makes for an enjoyable time.  While Wensleydale makes the better thematic sense, I have to say that I prefer the wide open spaces of the Nuremburg board.  Complaints of fiddliness have some justification.  The set up takes a while, with its nadir the put some cubes on and then take some cubes off seeding of the board in a variable manner.

The Argentum board is much easier on the eye than Treefrog's raw liver and custard attrocity. Production quality is good.  With Wallace and Argentum involved, the English rules were always going to have their vagueries, but they're reasonably serviceable.

I like this, but I can't figure out why. Fiddly, especially the counters with four players; easy to get rules wrong all the way; almost too much to keep track of for what it is. But, still, I enjoy it, it intrigues me, I want to play more.

RATING: 6
This pick up and deliver game seems like it has some decent design ideas and gaming elements in it, but they didn't cohere for me thematically.  The "capabilities for this turn" auction, in particular, doesn't seem to me to be thematically relevant or connected, and ends up feeling artificial and uninteresting. 

I guess the overarching goal for of this game is to provide a "plan everything out on your turn" joy, and fight for that plan, winning a round sometimes, and watching your plans go up in smoke in other rounds.  All of this takes place on a board with lots of arrows and lines that did not present a tractable board for me.

In the final analysis, I just cannot see why I would want to play this again when there are other, far superior "pick up and deliver" games, like Steam or Railways of the World.

Takes a few plays to get hold of how the game works. The setup takes some time, there is some micromanagement and the influence track is not handy to update.

Pretty good variation of Wensleydale. I just didn't like the incentive to connect the two cities at the beginning. It might result in a situation where one player gets left out of the initial VP bonanza and will have a hard time to catch-up.

I need to play more times to check counter actions against that.

RATING: 7
+ Interesting approach to train games, theme and decisions throughout the game.
- Idiotic jokes in the manual, boring setup and the endgame scoring (by number of sets) feels like something from Knizia to me, which is not a good thing.

RATING: 7
Graphically superior to Last Train to Wensleydale and I appreciate the additional map. I find this to be one of the more interesting train games in that you have to manage a variety of resources that dictate turn order throughout the game. I also really enjoy the bidding at the beginning of the rounds.

Another train game. This one suffers from problems with bad starts and uncorrectable mistakes, though the general idea is nice, despite the feeling that the game tries to tell me I am playing a company that's completly on the wrong market.

Much less opaque than other Wallace games but this does not detract from gameplay. While the game is still pretty involved it is also quite easy to grasp. But managing the resources and getting to the right cargo and passengers in time is not an easy task. The different starting setup and available trains make for good replayability. There is a lot of game packed into a very tight package here. Highly recommended!

RATING: 6.5
Maybe I'm not getting this, but like in the original version, a win of the bidding on the first turn can be enough to get you the game. Probably even more so in this case wit the bonuses for linking up Nuremberg and Furth and the fact that this route across the board gets used to move a fair few passengers if you do it right. 

I like a lot of Wallace games, but not so keen on this one/two.

RATING: 7
There was a lot I liked about this game: Using "investment cubes" to bid for influence _AND_ pay for track.  The 4 different influence gauges and needing to strike a balance.  The slightly variable influence lots.  Different player orders for different aspects of the game.  DEFINITELY like the train selection mechanism and needing to trade off between passenger and goods capacity.  The wooden bits are very cool.

There were several things though that just didn't win me over: Why can you spend 1 of ANY influence to lay more track?  Why can you spend 3 of ANY influence to earn an extra influence where you need it?  Why is Profit & Loss such a little impact on the game?  Why does EVERYONE get the same amount of investment income every round?  Why couldn't they make the influence tracks bigger so the pieces don't get jumbled about so easily?  The goods setup is lengthy and error-prone.  Why is the Mail Yellow and the Beer is Gray???

Anyway, I will gladly play this game again and looking forward to it actually.  I was very close to winning my first game and think I could have taken it if I had been more aggressive in the first round.  But I think this is probably my least favorite Wallace game that I've played at this point.

RATING: 5
looks like a smarter version of railways of the world. Might be worth a play, but it still has an auction mechanic. Update: I didn't hate or like this game much. But I didn't see anyone wanting to play it again. The setup is a bit of a pain, the instruction convoluted, we got at least one rule wrong, and overall I found a lot of elements to be excessive and uninteresting, especially the small bits. That said, I wanted to play again, but it's been too long now.

Interesting train game variant, as players have to get rid of unprofitable track by "selling" to bigger rail companies.

Setup is rather long and very fiddly (placing and then partially removing cubes and placing landowners and passengers). 
Player order (or rather three different kinds of player order) play an important role in the game. Handling the different player order and influence tracks is again a tedious task.

This is a really fine little train game, and one that is unlike any other you'll play.  It's mostly a pick-up-and-deliver route building game, with a few twists... the biggest of which is that you are limited to 15 links of track, and so will have to periodically sell track to the "major" companies (which are not under player control).  The timing of when you do this will be paramount, as track on the board cuts into profits, which is what decides turn order.  

What makes the game really nice imo is the semi-random setup.  You place 2 cubes in every space that accepts cubes, and then empty the space of the type that doesn't match the space.  This means that the overall distribution of cubes (across the board) is fairly consistent, but where they are exactly is never a sure thing.  Passengers are likewise distributed (although none are removed).  The way this distribution works with board geography means very often you can't divide up the board, but have to compete for the better filled areas.

The board has 2 sides, and both play quite differently.  The game scales really well - the 2er is good.  If you like train games, this is a unique, fairly meaty one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice little train game. It isn't nearly as punishing or financially restrictive as Wallace's other games. I liked the auction mechanic, where the order in which the auctions resolve has a direct effect on turn order (possibly the most crucial element of the game). I also like that it only takes an hour or so to play. Although the board is adorable and the provincial theme very sweet, the gameplay gets pretty competitive pretty fast as you start blocking routes and taking each others' cubes and passengers.

Excellent game; there's a lot going on at a tactical level, with multiple sub-objectives which are tricky to balance, and you need a strategy to cope with the end-game.  This remake of 'Last Train to Wensleydale' has the advatage not only of a much more attractive map - the original is a very Damian Hirst take on the Yorkshire dales - but one which is double sided, substituting the collection of beer and post for cheese and stone, providing a further challenge (though probably easier than the Wensleydale side).  That means it's worth an extra half mark but, otherwise, my comments on the original still apply - "If you like Wallace games you're likely to like this too - at least I think that there's a distinctly 'Wallace' feel to it even without it being very similar to any of his other games in the way it plays - but it does have the few turns/ multiple phases per turn structure, which is now a bit of a trademark, as well as the the need to consider the spatial dimension in terms of map position which adds that extra layer to the complex decisions you're faced with (and reminiscent of brass in that way, if not comparable in other respects)."

[floatleft][imageID=835918][/floatleft]  
[b][thing=83667][/thing][/b] - I didn't have the opportunity to play [thing=39927][/thing] last year, but I was highly intrigued by the idea of  a cleaner, abstracted non-traditional train game (and not particularly repulsed by the diseased lung artwork).  Although I am not a train gamer, I am a [person=6]Martin Wallace[/person] fan, and I thought the latter to be sufficient to get me past the former, should the opportunity (and a half-decent third player) ever arise.  Enter [i]First Train[/i] a collaboration between [company=3096][/company] and [company=538][/company] to make [i]Wensleydale[/i] more attractive, less expensive, and playable with two.  It was an easy must buy.

One play into [i]First Train[/i] and I have to admit that I find myself at a bit of a loss.  First, the game doesn't much [u]feel[/u] like a Martin Wallace game (and query just how much the [i]First Train[/i] ruleset is attributable to Wallace in the ordinary sense).  I have come to expect a deep and quirky commitment to theming from Wallace's games; the ones I've played have often surprised me by managing to evoke the proper thematic mood even in the absence of what I would typically consider theme-bound mechanics.  [i]First Train[/i] fails in this regard, at least on the first play.  It is simply much more abstracted than I would have expected, and much of the game roused memories of [thing=43015][/thing] and [thing=19995][/thing] -- certainly not titles that I would generally put in Wallace's thematic wheelhouse.  

Second, contrary to my misguided expectations, [i]First Train[/i] abstracts the capital-management side of the game, but leaves intact much of the route-building and pick-up-and-deliver.  I had hoped that the game would be a non-traditional train game in precisely the opposite sense.  The game seems primarily about whether and when to sell track to the game's companies. I think that was one of the reasons that I was a little disappointed with the first play. Despite the fact that that decision is framed as a financial one, it seems to me that all the interesting implications of that decision are spatial. Since track is purchased by the big companies at a fixed price, each turn players are simply weighing the cost of keeping track (1 VP/link + possible reduced options for future track sales) against the benefits of keeping it (1/2 influence/link + expansion opportunities + passenger shipping potential + foreclosing shipping options for opponents, etc.). The right side of that ledger is mostly about board position.  

For one, I don't really need another game on the shelf whose success depends on my wife's ability to recognize which spatial building patterns will efficiently frustrate my goals (it's simply not how she approaches games; though she managed quite well on the first play, much of her success in this regard was obviously unintentional).  

For another, I find capital management to be the strong suit in most of my favorite Wallace titles.  Here, one simply expends colored cubes (handed out freely at the beginning of each turn) to acquire points on different-colored tracks.  The points on those tracks are then expended (along with any colored cubes remaining) to lay rails and buy trains.  Rails and trains score VP and "income" (in an oddly unsatisfying way) by removing pre-seeded colored cubes from the board.  "Income" is neither actual money nor additional colored cubes, but is simply a turn-order mechanic that eventually converts to VP.  Indeed, what struck me as particularly inelegant is that "profit" has no function other than VP conversion. If the profit track restricted the cubes you get next round, then I'd be all for it. But instead, the game forces you to record "profit" only to later convert them to VP instead of just taking these VP at the same time you take other VP. The only reason that the two-step process employed by the game isn't entirely superfluous is the arbitrary +5 and -13 caps. So the game forces you to do some extra bookkeeping just so it can create artificial constraints that [i]don't do anything except make players think about how to efficiently navigate the artifice[/i]. That's the sort of thing I hate in games (FELD!! :arrgh:  ), so I am hoping to find some function for the constraints.  

The level of abstraction actually makes me feel like much of the game is in solving the rates of exchange between various abstracted currencies before sitting down to play.  Within the Wallace catalog, the game feels most in line with [thing=30658][/thing], a game which I had previously decried as having failed by calling too much attention to its obviously novel mechanics.  It was a game that couldn't seem to get out of its own way (and which I eventually sold).  Clearly, that is not the best of company for [i]First Train[/i].

It's really much too early for me to rate the game.  I had no idea what I was doing (and my wife won handedly).  I'll certainy keep at it; it's just eluding me at the moment, and doesn't feel as if there's a particularly rewarding game to be found at the other end of the learning curve (which is not to say there might not still be a good game to be had).  I should also note that, despite having neither played the original nor having ever played with more players, my initial sense was that the two-player game seemed quite obviously lacking a third party to move things along and cause a little chaos.  If the three-player game is actually noticeably better, I will quite dismayed that I didn't just spring for the [i]Wensleydale[/i] original, rather than the [i]First Train[/i] version.

Rated 4 after one play. I was excited to try this game. After all, it's Martin Wallace, he's supposed to be good, I like Steam a lot, etc.

Boy, something about this game rubbed me the wrong way. Turn order is really critical almost to the point where someone going last is really blocked out of all decent options. I found the board frustrating, and I missed having the continuity of "my track." Being incentivized to ditch your track each turn and just start over with less resources made the game feel mechanical and repetitive.

I'd play this again, just to see if my low rating is the result of poor play and sour grapes, but let's just say the first go-around wasn't what I hoped.

Definitely a twist on the train pick up and deliver game.  Quite the brain burner to juggle all your areas of influence, still turn a profit, and knowing when to hold and when to fold your tracks to the big dogs.  And with most games of these types, never enough time to do it all.

Interesting pickup and deliver game that also has elements of euro style economic engine building and to a certain extent, area control. It is a good combination that has a lot of depth. It also reminds me of the old railway building computer games I used to play as a kid, so I really enjoyed the theme. Will have to make an effort to bring this out to play again. 

29/6/2013 - Played this again, and with four players it dragged quite a lot. There was significant downtime, and the pieces are quite fiddly which makes setup and the in game auction mechanic quite time consuming. Probably better with less players because of this.

Was hoping for more from this. It was fine, but it's definitely not in the same league as Brass (or even London). The game certainly works and had some meaningful decisions to make... it just wasn't fun, I guess.

We've only played it once, though, and it certainly deserves at least another play. Maybe I'll change my mind (though I can't recall ever growing to love a game that bored me on the first play).

RATING: 8.5
A really fun game that went faster than expected.  Missed the '12 NEW investement cubes' each turn, with a possible carry-over of 3 from the previous turn.  Some rules could have been stated more clearly, but overall after a rules read through, and a game turn played, we knew exactly what we were doing.  The connection from Nuremberg-Furth is worth a lot of points, and if you play no part in the connection, you will probably lose (as I did).  My opponent unnecessarily maximized his rail length by 2 to make a connection for the extra 4 points, and I ended up losing by 3.  A better rule would be that these points are only counted at the end of the game, with the shortest track being counted (thus I could have built a shorter track and gotten the points for it, and my opponent would have left his track out on the board for a few turns).  Either way this is the first game with an auction mechanic I like, and the components/map/gameplay are beautiful/wonderful.

I might be rating this a point to low.  I liked the auctions, the rail building, even the takeover mechanism of your railways.  However, with each of these mechanisms, there were things that made them cludgey.   The auctions seemed to go on for awhile.  And it was tough to see what you were bidding on as the boxes got crowded.  Then resolving the auctions was near impossible because the pieces were so small to move and stack.  Building track was interesting, but it was difficult to remember that you can't build into some regions...and you want to build adjacent to other regions.  Last the takeover mechanism is not very forgiving.  Don't have enough red to convert over?  You are stuck with those railway lines for yet another turn.

The game length was what is really keeping this down to a 6.  4 hours for a 4er game.  Also, while I thought the game was interesting...at the end of it, I concluded it just wasn't all that fun.

First Train of Nuremberg was enjoyable enough for a single play, but there was very little in it that encouraged further play after that initial one. It was pleasant but forgettable which is the unfortunate slot that many eurogames, and Martin Wallace games, seem to fall into these days.

RATING: 5
Players are trying to run minor rail lines through the Yorkshire Dales, then flog them off to large companies.  Players work through a turn by purchasing lots of influence via auction, then spend that influence on building track, buying trains, running stuff off the board, and then selling track to either the Midlands Railway, or North Eastern Railway.  You're assessed at the end of each turn for stuff you transported and infrastructure left on the board.  Game ends after four (?) turns and you score for your stuff, sets of stuff and you're overall profit/loss tally incurred during the game.  Not a bad game, with obvious bits lifted from other games.  The auction is taken directly from Amun-Re, the transportation from the Age of Steam series, etc.  As usual with Wallace games, there is a large entry cost in terms of rules, which combined with the 2 hour playing time, means this won't be a game I'll be playing a lot of.  The double sided board is a nice touch, with Nuremburg on the reverse.   Plays okay, yet feels a tad underdeveloped - like there is a cog or two too many spinning inside this game.

 Actually a simple game, but hard to get your head around it until a few turns. 

Bid on influence, build track, rent trains, ship stuff, get vps, lose money, ditch track, repeat 3 or 4 more times.

Weird and inelegant, but I love it. Plays well with 2.

Enjoyable first play.  Good classic Wallace.

 A great Martin Wallace train game.  Part network building, part pick-up & deliver, and part a tough business economic game.  And as with the best Martin Wallace games there is a real twist.  You build your railway, but you also want to sell bits of it back to the mainline train companies to keep your costs low.  Wonderful brain burning stuff.

Fiddly bits, hard to see what color the discs are, spaces too small. On the map it's hard to distinguish the different areas. Otherwise gameplay is ok, but Last train plays smoother because of the better quality of the bits and board. Pro: Six box auction board for three players.

RATING: 7
The highlight of this train game is the way you can sell your track at the end of each turn. You can take parts of your track from the board and sell it to one of two parent companies and it becomes "company track" now. As you get charged each turn for every piece of track you have on the board, it's essential to start lowering your costs (track). The catch is that when you do this, you lose control of areas on the board as anyone can build from the company towns connected to company track. So there's this wonderful choice at the end of your turn -- after you've done all the bidding, building, and cube grabbing -- of what to leave of all that you've just constructed and what to sell in order set up for next turn.

Goods and passengers are moved via trains you rent for the turn and are chosen in one of the three turn orders and make you money and score you points. You're also rewarded at game end for sets of every type of passenger and cube in the game so you're forced to diversify to some extent. As red and green passengers need to be moved to their respective colored towns, you have to remain flexible in how you build your routes.

It's all very good except that the game lacked a way for people to come back once they were down; a problem that is addressed in First Train to Nuremburg, and why I sold off Last Train and acquired the newer implementation. First Train enables you to move passengers via 1st, 2nd, or 3rd class for 3/2/1 points per passenger moved so that you can possibly get some extra points for sending a lot of passengers as well as for participating in the connection of two cities on the board.

One aborted attempt so far but that was only because I messed up the rules.

And speaking of the rules, they're not terribly well constructed.  Mixing the differences for two games into one set of rules disrupts the flow when you are reading.  There's a lot of text on the page and after a while you lose sight of whether the specific rule applies to Nuremburg or Wensleydale!

I've re-read, watched Rahdo's run through, now to persuade everyone to give it another go....

Solid Wallace title. In order to run a profitable railway company you have to build lines where there are goods and people to carry around. Since those lines quickly become a burden once the easy profits have been skimmed you also need to keep an eye (and good relations) to the bigger companies who you might be able to sell your unwanted network to.

The game is a tad fiddly. It starts with the board setup, and doesn't stop at 3 different turn order and 4 different favour tracks. It does, however, fit together quite nicely. There is a lot to consider: When and where to expand your network, which trains to buy, and when to hand your rail over to the big operators.

As you might expect from Wallace the rules are a bit quirky. Even if you do get the rules correct, though, there is ample opportunity to happily screw yourself.

Played once; it hurt my head.  But my wife really liked it, so I want to try again.  
Played again (both plays 2 player) on 12-29-16 at the islander inn. The rulebook really makes this game seem harder to grasp than it is. It's a fantastic medium weight strategy game that's well worth a serious look, even if you aren't huge on train games. Gets on the cusp of being very brain burny but doesn't cross the line. If not for the iffy rule book (rules summary on bgg helps) and kind of lengthy set up time, this would be in my top 10 for sure. It's still quite possibly going to make its way in. Well worth the effort!

The game is undeniably fiddly to play and doesn’t help itself by having a rule book that in places is more confusing than the instructions for flat pack furniture. If you are going to be playing with more than two then Steam or Railways of the World may be a better option, but if you are looking for a pick up and deliver train game that plays well with just two then this is a game to seriously consider.

You are getting loads of stuff in the box, plus two different maps to play on, I haven’t seen a better offer since my local Supermarket was doing a BOGOF offer on Wensleydale.

I think First Train to Nürnberg is Martin Wallace's best game since Age of Steam. This edition is a big improvement over its forerunner Last Train to Wensleydale. It's cheaper and better looking, includes a second map with a different gameplay feel, and fixes the auctions and trains for the 3-player scale.

Be warned, though, that the rule book is terrible. It doesn't even tell you which configuration of the boards you should be using with different numbers of players. I'll save you the trouble of searching in vain for this missing information. For the two smaller boards, use the sides labeled iii-iiii for 4 players, and the sides labeled ii-iii for 3 players. I have no idea why they both indicate that they're suitable for three players - they're not. For the main map board, either side (Wensleydale or Nürnberg) is suitable for either three or four players. The game also claims to support two players, but I have stern doubts.

Intriguing train game, with a Wallace emphasis on money usage and savings, as well as cleaning up after the panelty points that always seem to accompany Wallace games.

I'm not sure whether this is his cleanest mechanism- the theme seems strong, but it also feels gamey on a 1st play, and I'm not certain whether the play will lift that up enough to justify it.

I'm starting this at a conservative 6.5; it may well change with additional plays.

First Wallace. Picked up from the deep discount pile in Stratagemma, Firenze, 2015.

I quite like this one, although there are some issues: (1) The influence tracks are too fiddly, both in terms of components and in terms of mechanism. We just don't play this game at a level where we can figure out what box to bid on to gain first player rights. (2) The rules are very thorough, but poorly organized. (3) Everything is interconnected, making this game quite hard to teach.

On the plus side, I get to build train routes! The game is convoluted for newbies, but the first round(s) is (are) normally fairly easy-going, which helps a lot. The auction works really, really well, there is not too much downtime, and the game offers some nice challenges without feeling brain-burning.

An improved version of Last Train although I think it loses a lot of thematic traction by taking as its setting a nation known for uncompromising efficiency. Better presented for the most part, with toned-down art and separate boards for the influence tracks and trains, although the scoring markers are smaller and fiddlier than the originals. I'm still far from convinced that this system has achieved its potential yet, further expansion maps would always be welcome.

This was the game that made me realize how ambivalent I am about Martin Wallace: I love the tension, player interaction, and tough decisions in many of his games, but get really frustrated with his rule sets, which often seem just flat-out unfriendly to players. 

IMO, First Train of Nuremberg suffers from rules fiddliness and feels underdeveloped. It's so difficult to explain to new players, and there are several non-intuitive rules that are easily missed by people who have played before. 

As an example of fiddly rules, take the restrictions on selling track back to the red or green companies: the track must start in a red or green town and also end in a town; a player can sell only one line, and that line cannot fork; selling is done at a two-track-for-one-influence ratio (so make sure the line you want to sell contains an even number of track pieces). These rules seem arbitrarily detailed and unthematic and get in the way of the what I felt was the (very interesting!) heart of the game: deciding when you ought to retain some track of your own color rather than selling as much as possible, and making sure you have enough red or green influence to sell your track back at all.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (March 2017)

First Train to Nuremberg was one of my oldest unplayed games, I bought it on January 2014 so it took me over 3 years to play it :D. I was expecting a lot from it, after all it is from Martin Wallace, a game designer I respect a lot!

The rules aren’t very complex, but there are many of them. You can explain the game under 18 minutes. Playtime is around 2 hours and a half.

The game´s components are ok. The art is serviceable, but sometime the arrows on the map are hard to see.

The theme is also ok, nothing exciting but it works for me. I like the general idea, we are always operating a losing enterprise and we need to sell our track as efficiently as possible.

First Train to Nuremberg has a variable setup and that’s great! Every game is different from each other. I also like that they included the map Last Train to Wensleydale, both games are very similar but they have some differences, sadly I didn’t get to play it.

The game offers interesting and non-obvious decisions (which kind of influence do I want?, how much to bid?, where to build my tracks?, which track to sell?, which passenger/item should I transport first). There are 4 kinds of influence in the game and they have a huge impact on the game. They decide who build first and who buys/transport first. They also help when you lay track and buy locomotors. So much of the game comes from having the right kind of influence at the right time. Planning and outguessing you opponents is very fun.

Very small luck factor. Luck only affect the influence cubes before the auction. That is a huge positive for me.

On the bad side, the game is very fiddly. After the auction you have to adjust  the influence tracks and play orders. This is a minor issue for me, but that part was boring. The rules are confusing at parts, furthermore with the stations. When Argentum Verlag is involved, you know the English rules are going to be regular. The setup takes a long time to finish.

Bottom line, I like First Train to Nuremeberg. It is a good train game, but something was missing from my first game, I didn’t have as much fun as with other Wallace´s games, it is also very fiddly.  As I’m currently on a shrinking phase I decided to sell it, but I did so with a heavy heart. At least, one of my friends bought it so I can play it again if the mood strikes. 

Current Rating: 6.5

RATING: 8.3
This game is fantastic. .... that being said, I must have opened this game few times before I sat down and learned it. It looks intimidating with all the many wooden pieces. The wooden pieces are great quality and interestingly shaped but the biggest suprisze is that the rules to set up there game where not in there box. I had to go to bgg and download a copy of how to set the game up but after that this game sprung to life for me. It's essentially a puzzle game with an amazing bidding phase  ( typically i don't like games with a bidding mechanism). Another hurdle to overcome was how many phases there are too each round but after making it through one round i realized how simple it really is. 
This is a game that you kinda have too understand the entire game to play it well but jumping in and just going for it is definitely worth it. I'm just itching to play this again and I think it would be quite easy to teach.

Typical Wallace design with rough edges and initially opaque strategies that needs at least a play to get a grip on what's going on. Its most remarkable feature is the need to sell your own tracks to some kind of state railroads in order to stay profitable. Actually, players have to pay to get rid of their track which is counter-intuitive as the urge to save money on bidding in order to build more track will run players deeply into the red when the many laid tracks eat up all profit from transportation. Beside that, it features the usual trademarks of his economic games, i.e. competing for turn order, debts and minimalist auctions that work without actual money.

A game is full little details, different currencies (the price of one thing is paid in one way, of the other one in another way), different markers. Moreover the rules are also quite fiddly. However, for me the game is still attractive (maybe thanks to the railway theme) and I want to go deeper in it. By the way, it is really hard to get any clue about what you are doing during the first play.

I wasn't sure I'd like the selling track to some dummy player, but having played the game now four times, it works.  And while I'm not sure what the function of the +5/-13 VP constraint is beyond maybe capping a runaway leader's bonus VPs or stopping the free-fall of a poor player, but I actually like having to work within it.  While there's something very freeing about playing a game with no constraints, an open sandbox, there are other times that I like some constraints, some boundaries to have to navigate efficiently.

One of those Wallace train / pickup and deliver games. But once you have deciphered the rules (can be quite an undertaking), it is actually a great game. But not one of his best games.

I'm telling nothing new that setup is a bit tedious. There is also a steep learning curve, although, once you get acquainted with the rules, it's not a complex game. But then, when you don't play it for a while, you have to go through that process again.

Minus: 3 (playtime and setuptime) - 5 - 8 (rulebook is not great) - 9

Hazzah, an expansion map.  And what an expansion; who wont get excited about delivering the first junk mail and skunky beer.  Seriously though, the redesign looks great and the new map and side board options seem like a good fit to the original game.  My only concern is that on the expansion  map, there is a bonus for the first players to connect Furth and Nuremberg.  It feels like it scores almost twice what it should be worth to keep the game balanced.  It would not prevent me from playing, and with more experience, it might prove not to be so unbalanced after all.  I highly suggest this version of the game in order to get the extra map.  Great artwork, design, and components.

Our first play was quite enjoyable despite the 15+ minute setup time.  The auctions work very well and a lot of thinking is needed to determine whether it is more important to be first to build, first to buy/rent trains, or if you should simply build up green/red so that you can sell trains at the end of the round.  I never really felt short on money, but that might be because we were not aggressive enough during the auctions.

I need to wrap my head around the importance of final scoring (profit/loss track, sets of four, and unsold tracks).  It seems to make up quite a bit of the overall score.  I did not focus heavily on it, which was a mistake.

Another unique and fascinating Wallace game. This time it's another train game but with a unique twist: upkeep on the rails! Sell off the links to lower your liability but lose flexibility and scoring potential. I did not realize all of the things I was balancing until the game was over. Definitely need to play this again but certainly impressed and enjoyed the way everything interlocked.

Martin Wallace game of route building, delivering goods/passengers and juggling resources. And an auction of sorts. Works well enough for 2 players, I'd like to try it with more. Also, this edition has a double-sided board which I love.

Good game, but it just wasn't hitting the table. Traded to Kurt for Helvetia.

I keep flip-flopping on this one. To start, there are some challenges that will always hold this game back from being awesome. First, the setup takes forever, and I'm not sure it adds a whole lot to the game. I suppose it keeps it from being "solved," but it's not like one game is going to be dramatically different from another due to the randomized setup. Second, the Furth-Nuremberg connection bonus is a bit too easy for an experienced player to pull off, getting huge points early in the game, setting himself up for a blow-out victory. It's stopped with proper bidding and overcome with careful alternative strategies, but these aren't going to be apparent at first blush to new players, so don't expect to win any converts on a first play. This is compounded by finnicky rules that require a lengthy explanation, another likely turn-off for first-timers.

But after a play or two, First Train to Nuremberg can present a satisfying challenge. Split the setup responsibilities between the players, and it's done in five minutes tops. The turn order auctions, which seemed completely uninteresting to me at first, do present some subtle opportunities for key decision-making. Keep the basic conversions of influence in mind (i.e., brown influence is worth 3x more than anything else), and then evaluate how worthwhile the other stuff is to your current board position and plans for that round. If you're nowhere near a red city and still need to sell a lot of track coming out of Nuremberg, the red influence won't be worth much to you.

Players should be aware of how big a swing the Furth-Nuremberg connection is. In my initial games, whoever pulled this off won the game, typically overbuilding to get a +12 or so bonus and then spending the rest of the game shipping to dig out of the hole, eventually turning a profit to avoid penalization at the end of the game. However, against experienced opponents, that initial build should be costly in the auction, and shipping goods shouldn't come so easily. In my most recent game, the player who stayed out of the Furth-Nuremberg battle and conservatively ran a profitable company the whole game came out on top. Just avoid stretching yourself too thin and make sure others pay for doing so.

With that most recent play, my interest in this title has been restored. Unfortunately, it does require players familiar with the game to be truly enjoyable, and getting folks past that first play or two can be quite onerous. It's a tough situation to be in, but I hold out hope that this one will find its niche someday.

First Train to Nuremburg copy.  Loved the game. Can't wait to play again.  I'm a big fan of Brass and Steam and I like this one almost as much.  

My only real complaint is that, yes, it is extremely fiddly.  I feel like we spent an extra 1/2 hour just trying to move pieces around, especially trying to maneuver pieces on the influence tracks.  I don't know about the original but the First Train edition is pretty awful.  The little round discs are slightly bigger than the tracks which they sit on and having to pick up pieces that are under other pieces, we were constantly bumping them and dropping them.  It was a huge annoyance and I can't believe they haven't come up with a better way to do this.

I also think (believe it or not) that I prefer the map from the original edition.  The colors are clearer and it is easier to see where the symbols for cities and for cheese and stone are. The new edition feels cluttered with artwork, though I do like the colors of the map.  The one real advantage is the double-sides board.  I look forward to trying the Nuremburg map.  And it's nice that it plays 2.

As for the game itself, well, I enjoyed it a lot.  I like Wallace games with economic as well as visual and spacial elements.

The map and components are great, really like the look of it... 

But the thing I like the most about the game is the planning that goes into everything you do, the interaction between the players... the "auction" that goes on at the start of each turn that has a randomized item in every box in each round and that auction determines player order in therms of laying track, transporting and buying trains, etc...

Also, the way you sell your previously laid tracks to the "govern" so you don't have to be paying the upkeep of those tracks it's pretty cool...

I don't think there was a single thing I disliked about this one!

Having played Last Train and enjoyed it, I was looking forward to First Train.
The game is long, BUT the rounds play reasonably quickly AND there is a lot of interaction between the players - which I enjoy!
The map plays much better than the Last Train one as the separation between starting locaitons allows all players to get a decent foothold for their networks.
Recommended!

Non il miglior Wallace, non il peggior Wallace. Gioco ferroviario che si lascia giocare ma che non aggiunge molto al panorama ludico. Il cioco mi ricorda per certi aspetti altri prodotti di Wallace come: Tinner's Trail e Steal Driver. Fase d'asta interessante e avvincente, mi piacciono meno le possibilità di utilizzare altre risorse per poter svolgere le azioni necessarie. Un gioco carino

Essentially the same game as Wensleydale, but I enjoyed it a touch more than I remembered my gaming of Wensleydale from some years back. Maybe because we didn't vacillate over the auction as much. It's your customary "build track and run cubes" game but with a twist. For the small profit you make each turn running cubes, you can't maintain all your track, so you need to "buy" influence points to turn the track you no longer plan to use into common-use track. This leaves less money for building future track. In the meantime all the easy cubes are gone and you need to build further into the hinterland at more cost to get your next income. Lots to manage and think about. VP's reward collecting a balance of everything, meaning latter turns become more restrictive as you will score best by doing this and this only, making it easier for your collection plans to come undone through accidental collateral damage from other players. A game I'd like to explore further, but the re-assessment downtime in both the auctions and the build is a possible turn-off.

Medium-weight, Wallace-designed, Route-building-ish, Pickup-and-deliver-ish, Auction, Train, Resource-management-ish Boardgame. Lots of wood; don't bump the table.

Based on one play: There are some very interesting mechanics in this game. You use action cubes to bid on other actions points and to build tracks, it is tough to determine what to bid on and the other players have a huge effect on your turn, especially due to turn order. The game is only 4 turns long, but each turn has a lot of decisions and based on what the others do, you may have to totally rethink your move. Well worth a try and looking forward to another play.

Like other Martin Wallace train games, your goal here is to create an efficient rail network to deliver dwindling resources on the board.  The differences are that a) the resources never replenish, ever, and b) as your rail network grows, the cost to maintain it becomes completely unbearable, so you have to sell off parts of your network to non-player rail networks.  Basically, you want to get in, deliver the resources, and get out as quickly and effectively as possible--and hope the points you score outweigh your debt.  I guess that's really about as Wallace-y as it gets.

This is a perfectly fine train themed pickup and deliver game where you build rails out of these cities, deliver as much as you can, and then try to sell your rails off to those cities, so you don't have to pay for their maintenance on the next turn. It's cute I guess, but ultimately I like it less than Railways of the World, Steam, Steel Driver and Age of Steam, so I don't think this is a keeper for me. Part of the issue for me is that cubes represent money. Each player has a maximum of 15 cubes, but you earn a new 12 each turn, which means that at most you can carry 3 into the following turn. This evens things out between players round to round I suppose, but it feels strange.

NA! Végre, kipróbáltuk. Konklúzió számomra, hogy ez egy kis gyöngyszem. Wallace szerintem rétegtervező rétegjátékokkal, de én igen kedvelem. Ez a játéka is igen jól működik és igen sok dilemmát okoz játék közben. Befolyást szerezzek itt, vagy inkább ott, vagy legyek első az építésben, vagy szállításban. Olyan sok apró mozzanata volt a játéknak, ami a végeredményt kialakította, hogy  nehéz volt átlátni az elején. Ennek ellenére egyáltalán nem nehéz játék. Visszatérve, hogy miért is gyöngyszem. 200 játék környékén ilyen sok újdonságot és egyediséget rég mutatott a játék számomra vasútépítés és szállítás terén. Meglepett.

I got this game cheap and eventually gifted it without playing it. Finally tried my friend's copy.

Feels less like a train game and more of a set collection/resource management game. I was hoping for interesting decision making with the takeover mechanism, but really, under the covers, is just adding something to make the auctions a bit more interesting. (The takeover mechanism is really just something to do with track that you don't need anymore.) Same thing with the landlords.

Even the route building isn't as interesting as I hoped. Yes, you can build anywhere on the map, but in most cases it's more efficient to simply extend your route.

Way too much AP for a game that's really not that strategically deep. Most of your time is spent parsing all the information on the board.

High learning curve, super long setup time, and difficult rules (not as well written as other Wallace games) mean this will not be played as often as it should.

One of my preferred train games. Plays well from 2-4 and has all the right mechanics we've seen before. On the down side it's rather fiddly and perhaps a tad too long. There's quite a time investment in understanding the rules, but in no time it'll make sense after you actually begin playing. I'm not really a train game fan, but with Steel Driver, from the same author, I've got all the train goodness I need.

Fiddly train game, not because its rules are hard, but because players have to manipulate a lot of tiny bits around, and this can become annoying in the long run. The setup time is incredibly long.  Nevertheless, gameplay is nice, fluid and thematic, and the game offers a lot of though decisions to the players.  Its mechanics are very original in a genre in which everything seems to have been invented.

The rules are not very intuitive, but once they are mastered, the game is pretty straightforward. Track building, goods and passengers delivery with a nice, fresh touch: the neutral companies that can take over part of the players networks, in order to save up on maintenance costs.

What I really like about this game is that it feels like it delivers a deep, heavy game experience without being overwhelming. Once we got into the game the clear turn structure makes it very easy to stay focused and make real progress. One of the things I appreciate is that there is a lot of variability in the starting set up. This means that while each game plays the same, the way the player approaches it will be different. I think this will add a lot of replayability and give the game a lot longer legs than games of this type tend to have for us.

We actually played Last Train to Wensleydale which is included in the Nuremburg box. First play felt cumbersome, lengthy, and unintuitive. Second play with two players was better, but two players don't give enough interaction. We wonder whether 3 is the sweet spot, but not sure FttN is really that alluring for us given it's extended set-up time and slow play. Lots to like about it, but for me, not a classic.

Игра что надо! Много всяких действий, компонентов. Очень не типичная железнодорожная игра про перевозку грузов и пассажиров. Как всегда у Уоллеса, очень всё хорошо продуманно и притянуто к теме. Минусом может быть - довольно долгий сетап, для вроде бы небольшой игры.

Nuremberg is sadly just too fiddly for what it does. The set-up feels like it could really have been streamlined a great deal instead of having to go through so many redundant motions just to get the board set.

Usually, by the time this is finally set up, we  barely feel like playing it anymore, and  the game goes by so quickly it feels like a lot of time spent for nothing. There are simply far superior games with this kind of set up time that provide a more rewarding experience. This one likely won't see play again. It's not a bad game, it's just not a good one either.

Not just another train game, as it has some unconventional mechanics. In particular, you don't really build up a rail line and try to deliver a bunch of goods, but just opportunistically work on fringe new lines each turn, and in fact, by giving up your own line, you allow a bunch of possibilities to be opened up for all the other players.

Because the rules are full of exceptions, it's easy to get some of them wrong, which wouldn't be as much of a problem if the rulebook weren't as unhelpful as it is. Still, once you get the rules down, there are many decision points throughout the game. But combine annoying setup with the ungainly ruleset and it's an underwhelming Wallace, not one I'm enthused to play again.

Pick up & deliver and network building that seems to work with two players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a pretty thematic, somewhat intricate set-collection, pick-up-and-deliver, network-building game ... a train game! You have to deal with multiple currencies (influence in 4 areas), turn order manipulation, and careful timing to accomplish your goals. After one partial play, I [i]really[/i] want to get this back to the table!

The basic idea is that players are small-time railway operators. They build track (using government influence to override any local opposition, if necessary), make some deliveries and earn some quick cash; but their track isn't actually profitable. In fact, it's a source of loss! So they have to use their influence in the major companies (red/green) to get them to take the tracks off their hands! The companies are trying to expand their networks; they start on the edges of the board and will take track over if it connects to a new town (and you use the appropriate influence, of course).

In the end, the player who moved the most stuff (with bonus for sets) and is most profitable, with fewest tracks on the board, wins!

--- Summary ---
The setup is somewhat tedious, but not so bad if multiple people are doing it: a random distribution of cheese cubes go in the lowlands, stone cubes in the hills, and red/green passengers and/or white opposition farmers in the towns/cities. 

There are 4 Turns. Each turn follows the same sequence: first, players each gain 12 investment cubes (max 15). Then there is an auction for 6 or 8 lots (depends on number of players), max 2 lots/player. Each lot is for 3-4 influence (some combo of government/engine/green company/red company influence). Players then build one chain of tracks either starting from a company town (any town connected to company tracks) or from a previous link, using investment cubes (and, if necessary, influence) to pay for the builds. The tracks connect regions together. If your build includes company town(s), you of course have to use some company influence to get them to allow the build. Then, players, borrow abstracted company trains (using engine influence) and move pieces (cheese/mail and passengers in connected regions; stone/beer from adjacent hills/hops fields). This gives you income and VP. Finally, players may spend company influence to get the company to take over a chain of tracks.

There is a bit more to it -- various turn orders for different types of actions, for example -- but that's basically it. After 4 turns, get VP for all the pieces you delivered, with bonus for sets of pieces; plus your current profit level; minus tracks still on the map. Most VP wins!

Differences from Last Train:
- additional map of Nurnberg area
- earn and display VP for deliveries immediately (sets still score only at end of game)
- passengers on expensive trains worth more VP (1/2/3)
- some towns/stations have specific passengers, so better spread of colors should occur in setup
- Nurnberg: bonus VP for first Furth-Nurnberg connection
- Wensleydale: optional extra city?

Same game as Last Train to Wensleydale on one side, First Train to Nurnberg on the other. Not a very different game from its predecessor but still a good game. Several small new things were added to this version making it more versatile. I think I prefer Last Train... to First Train... but I think that this version of the game is the best buy.

This rate is for First Train to Nurnberg only.

A fabulous development of Last Train - the 2 player game, the Nuremberg board and the new passenger rules make the game even better. My only caveat as a Color blind player is that the Red/Greens are closer together than in the original - however this will be the game played in future - excellent!

I stumbled upon this game purely by accident when I came across an in-shrink copy for $14.99 and couldn't pass it up, and it's been kicking my ass ever since!  It's one of those games that I struggle to do well with, but as a result, I keep coming back to it in an effort to do better.  The rules are atrocious, the setup is downright ridiculous, and I kind of want to hate this mini beast that keeps beating up my brain, but I do quite enjoy it.  I've had it on the chopping block with each of my collection culls, yet I've always taken it back and put it back on the shelf.  I also quite like the look of it from a visual standpoint, and I love that it has the First Train to Wensleydale game on the reverse side of the board.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 8/10

Of course I have played [thing=39927][/thing] and I liked it quite a bit. But I hadn't played in quite a while. Neither had the other players.
This game includes a new map. I don't think I like it as much as the original one. I liked the confined layout of the original one, the new one is much more open.
In the last turn all of us where frustrated when we realized there weren't enough green tracks for any of us to do anything useful with them. This is of course down to us not playing the game in so long so we had forgotten to pay attention to this fact, but it did sour the experience a bit.
Still, there's no denying the quality of this design, but you don't need the new board. And the original one while not appealing to the eye, is much more functional.

What seems like a long time ago, I played and liked Last Train to Wensleydale so thought it might be time to try this one.

Technically, it's quite a clever game and I quite like it, though the turn order board is a mess of icons and poor colour matches.

What kills the game for me though is the AP-inducing nature of it. The board state is in such constant flux that, to play optimally, requires constant recalculation and I'm barely willing to do that. I'm a million miles away from being willing to sit and watch two or three others do it for each action that's taken.

What is it about this game? Something here makes me want to like it more than I do. I still need to try it at 4 players...at least once to make the final call on this one but after a few plays at 3 and one at 2 I'm kind of done at this point. Seems to be too much put into this game with very little return. 

UPDATE: Played with 4 and well...this game is exactly what it is. It offers nothing more and by that I mean nothing interesting. I just don't need to play this one again. It was best with 4 players as everyone had to eventually get in each other's way and the battles for delivering goods finally showed it face. This was absent totally from with 2 players and mostly from the 3 player game.

After reading the chaotic rulebook, I was pleasantly surprised by the flow of this game. Everything fell into please around the start of the second turn, making our first game (Nuremberg side, 3 players) very enjoyable. We opted for a 4-turn length, and will likely choose this game length again next time. It feels spot on. First Train (like Last Train) is first and foremost a pick up & deliver/route building game. More than most other train games I played, in which money played a much bigger role (by means of debt management, profit making or stock trading). Together with some other aspects, this makes the game feel pretty unique and straightforward. Too bad the little player discs and the score board are so fiddly to handle.

Having overcome my initial negative impression (yes, it IS fiddly), this game is rather engrossing. It gets pretty complicated as the game develops. One poor bid and you're probably out.

Plays sort of like a (very meaty) tile laying game, only instead of placing tiles, you're laying track. There is of course, much more to it, but I'm a lazy writer. Every turn requires careful planning (which is why I'll never win). Seems a little short to me, but there's room for 3 more turns on the turn track! Great with two (non AP prone preferred).

Get it and play it.

Smart-ass son keeps telling me it's honey, not cheese.  Fun to play but it's taken the family a bit of time to catch on.  Nice having "Last Train" on the opposite side of the board.  Two games for the price of one.  I HATE the scoring pieces and the scoreboard as things are too small for my neuropic hands.  Twice the size would have been better.  Also, the brown markers need re-painting as they are too close to red.  A quick fix but an annoyance until repainted.

The setup is extremely cumbersome and game play itself continues the trend by being fiddly, for no real payoff as the game brings no new ideas to the table. The fact that the different currencies are fungible deflates the little tension that exists. In short: even by Wallace's standards this game is overwrought, and unlike many of his games, there is no redeeming x-factor here to really justify the BS, especially in a market as crowded as network building/delivery.

RATING: 6
You can tell this is a Wallace design, since its setup is ridiculously fiddly and the game is full of turn order tracks, but it's not without its issues, one of them being the color problem.  Does Martin not have anyone in his playtesting group who's colorblind?  Is there no other set of colors other than red, green, and brown to differentiate the three resources on the bid chart?  What's wrong with this guy?

Surprisingly good with only two players but it lacks a little bit of tension during building phase at the beginning of the game.

I don't like the change where you have to count points at the end of each round although I understand that this is necessary to do this on Nuremberg map where you earn points for Nuremberg-Furth connection and different points for passengers. It's hard to explain to new players why you score points and earn income for the same resources in two different ways.

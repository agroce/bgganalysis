Although I prefer the simpler DBA rules to this one, it's always nice to play a huge battle once in a while, instead of being limited to 12 elements (or 36 with the BBDBA rules).

As with all the DBX rulesets, this game is not an easy read (you'd have to take a PhD in "Barkerese" to be able to understand the rules on your first read), and this one is a particular challenge, as it has a lot more special situations and exceptions. The extra grading of the troops doesn't make it any easier to digest either. But once you make your way through its dry, legalist writing style, you realize the game is not as complex as it first seems, and the games actually flow fairly quickly, as you don't find yourself bogged down by infinite modifier tables and charts, even with the combat being "element by element".

This system was generated by the DBA, and as DBA first you find it strange, then you can't get enough of it.
Very, very competitive.
Arriving late, I start playing DBM in 2005 (The golden epoch of DBM had already happened).
My first Army was polybian romans (total useless) and my 2nd army Carthaginians (a good surprise).
2006-2010: Participated in many national tournaments in Portugal and one in Spain.
Only played in the tournament format (400 points) and exclusively ONLY in Tournaments! People get tired of playing with the same armies and same opponents.
2010-2011: Replaced by a medíocre system (FOG)that I don't care.
Fond memories.

Actually I used to play DBMM that is similar but more detailed. DBM can be played faster than DBMM. I'm not sure wich one is best yet. neither one is perfect but really funny to play historical battles or campaings like 2nd punic war.

RATING: 10
Each stand is a unit in and of itself and fights separately.  I rate this a ten, because this mechanic gives a more realistic flow to combat. 

Depending on combat results one of your own units may be pushed back, but in an adjoining combat, one of your opponent's may be, giving a staggered look to the battle line.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A rules set which allows bigger battles with minis...the rule book is very densely written and quite hard to get into, best to have someone with experience run you through. Also need to have a good understanding of various unit capabilities so you can understand which troop types trump the opposition. Can be a bit of rock,paper, scissors but gives a good feel for the era in a relatively quick playing time.

Possibly the single game I have played the most times in my life. Certainly approx 500 plays between 98-2007. Fantastic variety from a single "meeting encounter" scenario through amazing historical army lists, variable army composition, terrain setup and weather/time of day rules. Superseded for me by DBMM.

For years I played this game weekly and would play in all the tournaments held for it in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.  I taught many people to play it and assisted them in getting their first armies on the table.  Was my most favorite miniatures system that I ever played. I left the hobby for a few years and now everyone plays Fields of Glory... I bought the books and read them over but never got inspired to try it out.  I miss the good ol days of DBM.

RATING: 8.5
Very good set of wargames rules for Ancient and Medieval battles - not a boardgame.  requires two armies of around 300 figures to play.

Best part is limited command & control with natural fragmentation in C2 as armies start to engage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
This is *NOT* a board game but was the big dog of Ancient and Medieval miniatures rules once upon a time...

Also VERY abstract, VERY rigid, terribly written...Add in the insane about of die rolling and my conclusion is simply that there are many other better rules systems around.  See: Might of Arms, Hordes of the Thing or even Warrior or better yet Field of Glory.

RATING: N/A
After nearly 10 years of over 300 hours a year playing DBM I think I have finally reached the end of the road.

Most of my play has been on the competition circuit, I have played perhaps 2 overseas tournaments a year and 16-20 in the UK.

I have removed my rating because while I still consider DBM a good game there really isn't a valid rating I can use. I have no intention of playing DBM again but don't want to drop my rating to the appropriate level, I have simply removed it.

For Ancients I am now playing Field of Glory

RATING: 5
When we played GW Warhammer Fantasy and other self-tinkered rules DBM with its fixed length playing time, player community and international tournaments looked like agift from gamers heaven. I own several armies and used to organize tournaments in Bern. But the rules are actually unreadable and unplayable without a binder full of explanations and rulings, or a referee. It wants to simulate big ancient battles, but in end the game is played and argued by the milimeter. So sometime I just quit.

RATING: 3
rather dryish wargame. needs lots of figures and plays like a huge skirmish sometimes, as each player controls at least 40 or so units that can all be pushed around individually. 
this game actually might be ok if played with a light attitude. alas! many players are grumpy competition fantatic power gamers.

It could be fun as a game, but as historical wargame it's to say least "fantasy". Practically no resemblance to ancient warfare. Maybe better apt to medievalbattles, but IMHO still lack enough chrome and period feel. You can't get the feel of manuvering real formations of troops. 
Still on of the best tournament ruleset available today.

RATING: 8
I must have played about 400 games of this over the years, even winning the biggest tournament in Australia in the year 2000 (Cancon). It's gone through lots of variations over the years, but I prefer themed tournaments rather than the open-book slather the big tournaments attract. That way I can play proper ancients against ancients, dark ages against dark ages & medievals against medievals. But even under the last version of DBM, 3.1, the game was still pretty balanced in the open book tournaments & I think 3.1 was the ultimate DBM incarnation. Now there is DBMM, the solo creation of Phil Barker. I don't really enjoy it at all, it's weighted in favour of Kn(S) & El(S) & not much else. 

DBM 3.1 is dead, long live 3.1
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A ruleset that broke many of the previous wargame standards.  An excellent competition set of rules. Some of the ideas in it were brilliant.  Unfortunately the system was let down by poor expression (hard to read/follow) and the authours unwillingness to clarify or resolve rule questions. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Popular rules set.  Lots of little tricks to good play.  Fun to play, but games tend to be long (3-5 hours) and a few too many gamey "tricks" for my taste.  Still very fun to play, and fun to construct armies with the army lists.  Works very well with 4-6 gamers.  Basing system is popular and used by other rules sets.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
criticised for the dry and grammatically correct rulebook, DBM does provide a great wargame experience. Basically, it is quite simple with single dice rolls delivering realistic outcomes but you do need to wade through complex, multi-clause sentences.

RATING: 8
The system that got me back into figure gaming after a ten year rest (Early 2000's). Fast and simple, just the way I like my rules. I stopped playing ancients after DBMM came out, recently (2013) started again with my 9 year old son.

I played DBM for a few years and entered a few tournaments during that time.  The rules are comprehensive and are written in an efficient style (Barkerese) that can take a little while to understand.  That said, once you get your head around the writing style you can see there is an elegance to this system and it produces what feel like historical results.  Thankfully there are some great sites devoted to this rules set as well as a helpful and informative Yahoo group.  Games take, on average, around 3 hours.  There is also the huge commitment in time and money to research, purchase, base and paint your armies.  At this time in my life, with limited gaming time, I'd rather play big battle De Bellis Antiquitatis (DBA) by the same authors.  I do, however, credit this game with inspiring me to increase my knowledge of historical warfare, civilisations and leaders through the researching of army lists.  Only a 6 for me for reasons of time and energy needed for this game.  However, if those aren't considerations for you then this is one of the finest Ancients/Medieval miniatures rules available. [Update - DBM has now been superseded by DBMM].

I have probably spent more time playing this game than any other, and just as much time painting armies and working out armies. DBM took the world of miniatures wargaming by storm you could play games against people from all over the world, as I did in New Orleans, Rome, Melbourne, Ghent, Pisa, Milan and Athens. I twice won at the UK Nationals, won the World team Championships as part of the UK team and a hat full of other tournaments. Unfortunately it broke up in 2009 as players trotted out their armies for the umpteen time and became to wily to be easily beaten, forcing many draws.

El hermano mayor de DBA, mucho más completo y pensado para librar batallas mucho más grandes, ya en una mesa de juego de 180 x 120 cm aproximádamente, y ejércitos 4 ó 5 veces superiores en número a los de DBA. MÁS IMPRESCINDIBLE TODAVÍA.

Yes, this is elegant and all that, but all the types and their interaction also make it very fiddly on one hand and still not very colourful on the other. The worst part are the geometric puzzles, which I really believe do not belong in a minis game. (though admittedly hard to avoid.)
I am not sure whether rating this game so low is fair, as I would really enjoy it (and, in fact, do enjoy it) with the right people.

What the heck with those rules? You just can not learn this game by reading the rules. Best way to learn this game is to play with people that know the rules and teach you. No charts, almost no visual helps, just plain Law-type text... But the game - when you know the rules is superb. One of the best miniature-games.

RATING: 2
DBM has probably one of the worst written set of rules I have ever seen. Ever. That said, given enough time, and loads of help from experienced players to guide you, a game may be unearthed (albeit, it is likely that the lengthy process will kill any last cell of your body interested in the game).

Based on two (unfinished - Earth day just isn't long enough. I guess Mercury would be about right) games, DBM is like bastard child of rock-paper-scissors and chess - somehow picking worst of each. General feel from former, length from latter. More of abstract geometric buzzle than a miniature game.

In short (and regrettably), badly broken.

Loved this game and it brought me back to minis after a long period in the desert.  Enjoyed the randomness and lack of control from the PIP dice.  However got too gamey and there were too many rules lawyers who played games with the game.  My 15mm ancient armies are now collecting dust. :(

This game is "state of the art" for ancients gaming with a large number of players worldwide, especially in the UK, Australia/New Zealand, and North America. The rules are aimed at tournament style play where ahistorical matchups (for example, 3rd century BC Egyptians vs. 12th century European knights) are the rule. The game play is good, but it fails to provide enough historical feel to keep the interest going. DBA, with its smaller army sizes and de rigeur historical match-ups, is a more enjoyable game.

Using the mechanics of De Bellis Antiquitatis while improving on it in every respect. A wargame that does feel like a simulation. I should give extra points for the effort that went into the army lists.

Apparently, players were not happy with some effects in the game which led to loads of rules tinkering.

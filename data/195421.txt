The gamer in me would rate this game a 7.  The family gamer in me would rate this game an 8.9.  At 4 player.  

The game needs a variant at 2/3 player counts to keep it from devolving into a very boring race, when played with at least one gamer of any sort.  As soon as the threat rush is revealed, the game "almost" breaks and the threat rush becomes the quickest and best way to win.  But, the threat rush is no where near the most fun way to play.  So, using a variant, I am able to play this game - enjoying all it has to offer - with my family, including my rush loving son.  :)

Shorter duration means it'll beat Tales Of The Arabian Nights to the table every time unless people feel like much more storytelling and much less gameplay than this. Rules explanation is very front-loaded and is a pain to explain, especially since the first turns are too important to explain some things later on. There are a lot of strategy paths to take, but some choices seem to set people up to be strictly worse later on, like not fielding a full party. Boiled down, it's all about getting the most out of every single turn, but then again most games are.

It feels like there is one too many resources to track; I'm looking at you, bread. The stories told thus far are wonderful, unique, touching, and humourous.

Time and repeated plays through will determine if just rushing to place all one's camps as soon as possible tends to win more than other strategies, but, like Arabian Nights, it should really be more important to settle in and enjoy the world and story rather than coldly optimizing. Who has the most points at the end feels less important in this game than other competitive games. Consider the upcoming official or current unofficial co-op variants.

The story telling and worker placement of this game are excellent. The one nit-pick I will give is this.....it feels like a legacy game. It feels like after 20 plays or so, the stories will all be done and you will just have the worker placement left over.  possibly with interesting "unique player powers" on each character, but just a worker placement game.  One that is not more inspired and very likely less balanced/engaging than above and below. Now everyone in this hobby will say, "20 plays is fine, we have plenty of game we love that will never get to 20 plays" but there it is. If you already own above and below and love the story elements, get this game....just be ready 10 or so games later to be considering trading out your above below because you would always rather play this, and then another 10 games later, regretting losing your above and below, and trading this out become some other worker placement seems more fresh and interesting.

The expansion is going to add co-op and another exploration axis. I think it should make the game a little unwieldy but have enough meat to be fun after the story is done.

Some context:  I am not attracted to worker placing, resource converting games; I am attracted to games that immerse you in  a story and to games that develop their player characters by askng them challenging questions, rather than just doling out rewards for skill checks successfully completed.  I thought that Above and Below was an interesting attempt to merge those very different types of games.  Near and Far probably integrates those elements better.  Yet it is still possible to ignore the adventure element altogether, do rather well and piss off those enjoying that element by bringing the game to a rapid conclusion.  And those adventure elements, whether in campaign or character mode, just aren't very satisfying in terms of the perfunctory little stories they tell, their decisions framed in terms of the  achievability of skill checks and the seemingly random selections of resources they offer as rewards.  

Near and Far has Ryan Laukat's usual charming artwork.  Production quality is very good. The rules are fine.

Beautiful artwork, unique and imaginative world. For my tastes, Ryan Laukat is unsurpassed on both counts. My opinion of the gameplay for both Above and Below and Near and Far is much less enthusiastic: pleasant but bland. Neither are bad games, but there are so many more mechanically interesting and clever games out there the only reason to recommend these is if you love the art & setting or love reading mini text encounters. The encounters are well-written and evocative of the quirky setting but have two failings. First, they don't matter. I don't mean they aren't important - you need to go on adventures to do well, they're a major way to get resources. But the choices you make aren't meaningfully connected to the text, and they have no far reaching effects on the game. You hear some pretty prose, but the decision just boils down to "do you want to roll the dice for X or Y?" (This was in the normal game, don't know if the campaign game makes the adventures more meaningful). Second, you never know what you're going to get from adventures, yet much of your resources are going to come from them. This undermines meaningful strategic planning in the game. You're given point-scoring "goal" cards but your ability to complete them is dictated to a large extent by luck of the draw. (Yes, there are ways to trade resource X for Y, but because it comes at a cost, it doesn't alleviate the problem that luck will or will not give you adventures that provide the specific resources you need to score points).

Beautiful artwork as you're used to seeing in Ryan's games, but a huge disappointment overall.The game pales in comparison to Above and Below. The stories in this are the only appeal but they're extremely limited in number for each game. The gameplay in this is extremely weak and boring. If there are going to be so few stories being told each game, the gameplay needs to be solid, interesting, and be something to drive things forward. Instead, it just falls completely flat. Once the stories are done for the mark, there's nothing compelling to make you want to keep playing. This was a huge waste. This is the fastest we put a game onto the sale/trade pile. Sold it and thankfully got most of our money back.

Ryan Laukat has become one of my favorite designers. This game is a big part of the reason why.

Rewarding as a narrative campaign.  The competitive element of it feels thinner than some games.  Initially, it felt from a competitive standpoint more like a solitaire experience where you compare points afterwards.  There is competition to reach resources, but even with that element, it felt like a 'friendlier' game, which for some is an advantage.

Upgraded to a 10 (from a 9).  After several plays, I am still consistently suggesting this as the game to play.  I have still yet to play even a fraction of the content and continue to want to bring it out. (1/5/18)

The longer, fiddlier, heavier, and more involved older brother of Above and Below. It's good but not great. It's a very simple euro with a cool adventure tucked into it. Many paths to victory and lots of stories but ultimately it just feels a little bit dull and repetitive. I wanted to like this more. It is definitely worth a play.

In Near and Far, explore many different maps in a search for the Last Ruin, recruiting adventurers, hunting for treasure, and competing to be the most storied traveler. You must collect food and equipment at town for long journeys to mysterious locales, making sure not to forget enough weapons to fight off bandits, living statues, and rusty robots! Sometimes in your travels you'll run into something unique and one of your friends will read what happens to you from a book of stories, giving you a choice of how to react, creating a new and memorable tale each time you play.

(Intro game): The many ways to score points and story elements don't help to stick out above other worker placement games. The movement phase felt like a variation of WP of sorts, and the story elements, though really nicely written, just give another way to gain resources. Maybe the campaign might change things up, but the intro game didn't convince me to keep going.

A storytelling game that is fairly involved. It's a sequel (and different game) than Above and Below but does give the same kind of "Choose Your Own Adventure" feeling to it. The game is bigger and more interesting, but the best improvement from Above and Below is how the stories sometimes build upon one another making for a much more interesting story line through the game.

My initial play of this was enjoyable. We played 2 player and the game was very quick (around 50 mins). The art is beautiful and helps bring the theme to life. The game also has a nice flow between town actions and adventuring. The quests were fun and the text seemed well written and interesting. The only thing that is a bit strange about this game is how many points are possible from fighting threats. In our game one player loaded up on hearts and swords and went off to fight 3-4 threats per turn. They ended the game very quickly by getting tents from these threats. It just seems very powerful that these threats let you a) get a tent out b) fight as many you want per turn c) give you points. Nothing else in the game really allows you to amass so many points this quickly. I am not sure that it is unbalanced and of course the other players can help combat this. However, our play made it feel like this path is far more valuable than questing which makes the questing feel sort of lackluster in this game. That is a shame since it is supposed to be a focus of this game. It just feels like there isn’t any real risk in this threat strategy, because failure just means the player’s turn ends. With enough hearts and swords this will rarely happen. I’m still looking forward to playing more and my wife enjoyed the game which is always a plus. It’s just that my first feeling about the game is that this secondary part of the game is very powerful and detracts some focus from the adventuring aspects of the game.

RATING: 9.5
Really a lot more data required, but I've enjoyed my initial plays of this. Currently working on a character play through. I like that each game of Ryan's shows more love, and more attention to detail than the last, so this game feels like a treat to open and play. The gameplay is really great, and as I always find with Red Raven games, it is quite a unique piece, especially from Above and Below. 

However, I've been experiencing some cognitive dissonance in that I keep trying to play it how I would Above and Below, at a slower pace, knowing that I can somewhat take my time through the set number of rounds, and that I will more or less get to finish my plans. But this game is MUCH more of a race, with the cards and other goals that you are working on being secondary to the board state, and I think embracing that is key. The cool artifacts and treasures, much of the town board, even the stories, are all things that happen incidentally to you fighting baddies, mining, and putting up camps by the side of the road. The stories help drive you out of your house, but really if you're not out in the world, you're behind, which is a tough balance. Sometimes I think that I would prefer if I could stay home more... but then that's what Above and Below is for, so it's better to just embrace the mad race and get out on the trail.

Edit: My initial plays of this were intro game x2, character play, and arcade. Those are all fine modes (I was surprised how pleasant arcade is), but after playing one campaign game my rating has shot up. Now I see what this experience offers, there are such well crafted stories here, and i have enough experience with the mechanisms that now i know how to prioritize actions better. It will take a couple of games to really get a handle of what to value, but once you play a few times, you will really begin to appreciate this games pace, even if building artifacts isn't quite as satisfying as building the town of Above and Below.

We have sometimes played with the two extra camps variant. This is absolutely a double edged sword. On the one hand, it is great to have just a little more time in the world, especially as we love to crush baddies. However, i definitely won my last game by having just those few extra turns. Even with the extra camps, the pace can be pushed quite fast by other players at the table, and it's still up to you to try and strand cards in your opponents hands. Unsure whether we'll keep playing that way or not.

Edit #2: Wow, my impressions of this game keep on changing. I'm keeping my high rating for now until I can at least finish my first campaign (very soon), but I am feeling that my rating is going to drop a bit after that. I really dislike the artifacts and the treasure cards. They don't feel useless, but they do feel more like a ticket card from Ticket to Ride than an ability to add to your character. This is a huge difference from Above and Below, though I'm sure that I dislike it more because of that comparison. Not that the cards are terrible, they are not, but the lack of excitement about the artifact and treasure cards is my main gripe with the game (a few mechanical nitpicks aside). The stories kind of make up for this, but they kind of don't as well, as you have to really go searching for the stories, where in Above and Below, there was always another one step away if you hit a bad one. Too much of this game is a lot of effort for only a somewhat satisfying payoff. I am still in love with it, BUT it's definitely going to settle lower than Above and Below for me. Mind you, there is still a ton of the stories that I have not read, and comparing it to it's sister game is somewhat of a fools errand being that they really are so different. Still worth playing, definitely my most played game of the last few months, but not at all my favorite game that I've played in the last year as I had hoped it might be.

Near and Far is very similar to other titles by this designer, but takes that basic feel and mechanics and transforms it into a sprawling world. I really enjoyed this game, but it didn't go over very well with the rest of my group. Hopefully I'll be able to get it to the table again.

RATING: 7.5
A great improvement on Above & Below, which only awkwardly superimposed story elements onto Euro mechanics. Here, the story not only makes more sense thematically, but is more woven into the basic character of the game, leveling up your character and shaping an overarching narrative that was lacking in A&B. 

The writing here is also better, and often very funny; with the inclusion of the map the whole world really comes to life. It's quite an impressive design, even if I'm still not convinced that these two genres (mechanic-oriented Euro, random event-oriented narrative) will ever properly mix.

I just finished my first character mode campaign (1v1). Very enjoyable and a great experience. It is true that the story-telling is better than Above and Below, but I feel like as a board game, it isn't quite as tight as Above and Below. In a weird way, it is a better experience, but I would probably not drag it out as often unless I was doing a campaign.

Hmmm... An admirable attempt to fit such a huge world into a box, but the game is essentially very light area control. Nowhere near as much fun as the basic village building system of A&B. The mechanics have noticably developed from what was first shown, and the overall aesthetics are, as always, stunning. The role playing elements of character development, whilst a good idea, do lack a great deal of variety - which sadly is one area that could be expanded the most easily - I already proposed a half-dozen new talents, but was sadly ignored... coins and gems do slow pretty freely, and I do think the combat mechanics could be made a little more interesting. Even just having party members able to set traps as a little PvP action, for example, would offer a nice little mixup to the standard RRG system.

I do like the A&B villager mechanisms introduced (bacon butties for all).

I think it may be an understatement to say that this is easily my favorite game of 2017. The game consists of adventuring to read from a book where you choose what your character does, gain treasures, craft items from resources, hire an outfit of adventurers... It's everything you could want if you love storytelling and RPG games, but aren't particularly skilled at crafting narratives. Great, great game.

First, the dislikes. I really, really dislike the information flow of the manual. All the information is there, yes, but it arrives in a manner that is terribly unintuitive to my mind. That plus the lack of an index makes finding information needlessly difficult. I'm also put off by the plethora of game pieces that make setup and tear-down a chore.

Once you get past that, the game definitely has a whimsical charm to it. The stories in the quest book are a treat, just like in "Above and Below." Indeed, they're better once you get into Campaign or Character mode and start getting special side quests or keywords that trigger potential secret actions for your character. Characters improve over multiple game sessions, a neat touch. I also appreciate how non-punitive the game is. Failure rarely results in any kind of negative outcome other than the ending of your turn. This encourages players to take risks, which is appropriate since we're playing dashing adventures.

All in all, this is a very fun game that perhaps falls a wee bit short of "Above and Below"'s lofty heights, if only because the underlying strategic engine isn't quite up to the level of its predecessor. Yet "Near and Far" has its charms and deserves your attention nonetheless.

This is a Euro style race game. Every player starts with 14 tent tokens. The first player to place their last tent triggers the last round of the game. Both my wife and I wish that the story telling element was more pronounced in the game. Regardless, the underlying game mechanics are solid.

Damn you Ryan and your ability to separate me from my money. You've done it again.

This is a far superior game to Above and Below. While I liked the former, this game is a lot more focused and plays faster with the stories better written and more well rounded.

Components and art are usual top notch quality you expect from Red Raven and I really dig the feeling of adventure in this one.

Oh and that atlas is an AWESOME idea.

In my opinion, Ryan Laukat's best Effort yet. I love the melding of area control, light worker placement, and story telling that creates a familiar yet different game experience like his other games tend to do.

Fantastic artwork as usual and I like how the components continue to act like mini expansions for Above and below to keep giving that game some fresh new mechanics without changing gameplay. 

Very happy I backed this one and my first Red Raven kickstarter.

For those who have played Ryan Laukat's games, this one will be very familiar.  It is a bit of a story telling game mixed up with resource collection and exploration.  We have only played the beginning game but it was really intriguing.  We are going to play the campaign mode next.

My rating started out at an 8 after the first play. After the second, I bumped it up to an 8.5. I've now played 5 times, and my rating has hit a 9. There's not much room for that rating to go up, but if this keeps up, it may enter my personal top 10. It's only my second Laukat game, but it won't be my last!

Experience: Need to play more to see if experience improves. So far I'm finding it very frustrating. Always seems like other players are doing more on their turns than I am on mine. Doesn't seem great with 4 players.

[b]Amazing[/b] illustration work, and I feel like I got my money's worth just from that. The game, however, is an absolute turd. I'm a sucker for narrative and games where you wander around branching maps, but the gameplay is just a bunch of dry, marginal VP accumulation, far less interesting than the so-so tableau/engine system in Above & Below; as appealing as the questbook is, that makes up ~5-10% of your game session, and doesn't tie in meaningfully with what else is going on.

After playing 4 games in Character/Story Mode with 2 players, I can say that the stories were not what I expected. They were okay, but not great, in my opinion. I'll have to go through more of the stories, and try the Campaign Mode, of course, but so far I have lowered my expectations on the stories. The game itself, however, is great, a very fun and satisfying Euro game, and I wouldn't hesitate to bring it to the table. I would warn players, however, before embarking on lengthy 4-10 game commitments of the Campaign/Character modes, if a grand story is what they truly seek. The story book is a little confusing to navigate in regards to choices and keywords.

RATING: 7.2
This story telling worker placement game is now also a campaign game. The map adds allot to the game and is an improvement over Above and Below. Some turns go by so quickly but then when people start getting stories read and exploring them, then the game really slows down. This game is a different worker placement and I like how the stories tie in on each other but someone who has played this game will know the stories and the best resaulting decision. I game can seem really slow if you don't get any adventures in during a play.

Game is a jack of all trades. Lots of great ideas and tries to be everything, but ultimately is disappointing in each respect. I wanted a heightened combat experience, or a heightened storytelling side, or a stronger campaign, or a stronger Euro, or a larger more epic-in-scale game experience overall, but everything mellowed out flat. It was a fun time, but I left feeling cheated of the fun I should have been having.

Maybe I've been playing too much Gloomhaven & Pandemic Legacy?

I need to play this again before I rate it, but I THINK I like it a lot.  Lots to do and explore, stats to buff, party members to assemble, very inventive and charmingly-written encounters... some of the best of the character-development elements of a Zelda-esque action-adventure translated into a board game.  Plus super charming art that I think would help span the gulf between me and some of my less game-oriented friends.

On first play, though, I couldn't get my mind into the headspace of a board game, where part of the appeal is that every square WON'T be uncovered, that every potential track of development WON'T be maxed out.  In video games of this type, you're going for filling every slot, pumping every stat, acquiring all the chests and powerups.  Maybe some version of this ultimately plays out across a campaign (a wonderful idea that I'd love to try - D&D lite!)...

Love the stories but I think the dueling mechanic (at least as it is implemented in the rules) is a bit silly.  It feels like it was tacked on in an attempt to make the worker placement portion of the game slightly more interesting.  However, I don't find dueling to be interesting OR fun and I'll likely be house ruling it for future plays.

Fun and different than above and below, but it's cool the characters can be used in either I think. It's kind of odd though how when we played the 'story' things got eaten up really quick so that all went too fast, and I barely got to do any of them. I'd like to play more to actually see how that works and how I can use it to get to my goals better.

Near & Far is an improvement from its predecessor Above & Below (but that says little coming from me). The game provides players with more focus, but without pinning them into a strategy, which embraces the 'choose your adventure' aspect of the game. The game is a decent length, but players don't seem to accomplish a great deal. The relics, though powerful and worth several points, rarely get used and provide little utility, which is a shame because their effects are useful and interesting. I wish the early game could be accelerated, allowing players to explore more of the map an utilize their adventures and relics more frequently. Though I'm still not a fan of the storybook-style of games, N&F is one of the better ones.

Man, I wanted to like this game but after 2 plays I still can't. One of my top 10 least liked games I own. 

It tries to be a euro-game and story-telling game at the same time and it just doesn't work. 

For a Euro-game, it just isn't polished enough. The randomness really kills this part for me. It feels like trying to play UNO competitively.

For a story-telling game, there just isn't enough story. 

I'd rather play a more focused game like Caverna where it is actually your skill determining whether you're gonna win OR Arabian Nights and just go with the flow of pure randomness and enjoy the story. 

It may be possible to combine the two but Near and Far definitely failed at this.


My wife likes it, though.

I really loved Above and Belows narrative (however disjointed it could be) with each player creating their own story through their actions, however in near and far it felt like there was a single story which we all raced to a participate in and then it was done and gone.  

Its a perfectly nice action selection game that bobs along at a nice pace and there are a wealth of options for your turns however I wanted more story, granted we did play the opening 'tutorial' scenario without any of the character stuff or any of the campaign stuff... but still it  very light on the story which was disappointing.

I am looking forward to playing as a campaign game however we are also playing through Gloomhaven, so near and far is going to have to cram in a whole lot of story and drama and adventure to top that!

EDIT:it took us over 3 hours to setup and finish our first game of Near and Far on the base game, then later we played the 1st map again. after that we jumped into character mode games with Rin and Grear and weve got 1 map left to finish the stories.. this game is incredible!! its the best thing on our shelves and i cant wait to play the campaign mode.

Enjoyed my first 2 plays of the campaign.  Quests remind me of Tales of the Arabian Nights, but executed better.  The side quests are done well too.

The major downside of my first play was that it seemed like those cool quests were an afterthought, and a means to get resources to drop your tents/hire workers/buy artifacts.  That stuff was fine, but I can get that in other games.  I wish there was more of an emphasis on the quest book.

Case in point, side quests.  If someone got a side quest, then the next quest location they go to isn't the quest for that location but the side quest which I don't mind, however, by going to that location, you use up the quest token there and so no one can go on the quest for that location, which may itself turn out to be a side quest.  So in the end you may never get to see all the quests, or a large number of them.  Are you really going to play through the whole campaign again???

The city where you build up your character is well done.  While not thematic, I do like that you can't go where someone else is unless you duel.  Helps to prevent groupthink by everyone going to the exact same places.

I think the quests are the fun part, but they don't get you journey points which is a bummer.  Other players kept going back and forth from the city out to the map to drop their tents down, not really going on quests and they had 20+ points than me at the end.

Pros:
- quests and sidequests are fun and interesting
- building up your character works well, albiet a bit of a grind for those early turns
- Dueling helps to keep all areas of the city in use
- took 2 hours max (second game was over in an hour and 15 minutes)
- I like the artwork style

Cons:
- quests, which are the fun part, didn't get you any journey points and were more of a means to an end
- Seems like there is an incentive to just hop out to the Map to drop tents for the sake of dropping them which isn't that fun, but which gets you points.
- Not a lot of ways to increase Skill level, so a lot of times you'd have 3 skill and have to make a check of 8 or something.
- For the campaign, you don't keep any of the artifacts you've built which is odd.  I built things, but I don't get to keep them?  I get it, it's not a legacy game, but it seems like I should be able to keep something.

Variants:
- side quests don't cause the book token to be removed
- add quests for all numbered locations

A great looking game with solid mechanisms theme and story elements, but one that is not for me. 
+ Great look, consistent thorough the game
+ Great theme with many different maps.
+ Nice mechanisms for building your team going on adventures. Many skills that interact and interesting choices for building the party. 
-	Rules are not obvious, take some time explaining and remembering. For this type of game that is medium weight hybrid it would be great if the rules where a bit easier to understand. 
-	An eye symbol is used for building houses. The number of eyes is the amount of the resource on the space you are building that you get. Eyes as a symbol for building, it one example of a thing you have to remember as the connection is far from clear. 
-	The adventures are quite good and interesting but reading English text is not something players in Sweden enjoy much. Apart from that they cut up the game and make downtime quite big for other players. This is what really make me not wanting to play the game again. It is a quite good worker placement with story breaks that make me loose immersion in the game. You could just read the options and have shorter brakes but they are a huge part of the appeal for the game so I don’t really like that option either. 
-	Start in a city and follow paths away from it exploring and building on free spaces further and further away from. After a while you have to take at least one turn of only moving x steps and doing nothing. That is very poor design that should be changes. 
-	Often you need to roll a die. You might have hearts that can mitigate the roll but usually there is about 50-50 if you succeed and may do something or just have to pass the turn. I horrible thing to have in a game imho.
-	Building buildings only gives one-time resources no real improvements or engine building there. Engine building is in party building and the items you get.

I liked playing it, because it felt fresh and different, but there are many other games I would rather play.

Thematic game with great art which conveys a sense of adventure and flows really well. The different stories are engaging and well-written. The components are of a very high quality. The learning curve is relatively steep, so it's a good idea to play the introductory scenario a couple of times before starting the campaign. A couple of maps include simple new mechanics, it would have been a good idea to include specific mechanics for each map. I particularly like the variety of treasure and objective cards, which give you varied and interesting bonuses.  The only problem is that there seems to be a very clear path to victory, but with Near and Far I'm more interested in the progression of the story and exploring the map than winning.

Many people have listed this game in their top games of 2017, but sadly I can't see it.  My only advice is that I do not believe this game plays well at all with 2 players; it may do better with 3 or 4.  For my money though, I will actually prefer Above and Below, as while the story is better in Near and Far, Above and Below actually features a good game to go along with it.  If all you want is great stories, then go for Tales of the Arabian Nights or Watson and Holmes.  If you want a good game, then pick Above and Below.

Caveat, I am a thematic gamer and I love game experiences. If you like (boring) cube pushers and mastering tight engines, you probably wont like this game. If you'r all about trashing your friends, you wont like this game.

Gorgeous-looing mix of eurogame and paragraph adventure game. Surprisingly, after two games (maps 1 and 2), it feels like the eurogame is the dominant part.

Mechanically intriguing, with the adventure part adding just a pinch of spice to an otherwise dry game.

I look forward to playing again.

This may not be a fair assessment, Played the once with four players.  It took over four hours. Luck was huge, especially in the beginning.  I was the last of four players.   Everyone kept beating me to where I needed to go. Bad dice rolls and being last made the game  brutally frustrating.

More going on than Above and Below, some of it a bit arbitary, but it's interesting to have a worker placement where one place is wandering off sticking flags in a map, and judging when best to return. The book of tales is still a frustration for being a wackily boring fruit machine that could just have been a deck of payout cards, which players could skim and get the measure of.

This is a big step forward from Above and below.  The map and travel aspects add a really fun puzzle to solve.  The stories make sense with the maps and character development.  I am looking forward to seeing how the campaign plays out with my family.

07-11-2017 - Eh, it was pretty good.  I like Above and Below, and part of what I like is the simplicity of it given the other things it accomplishes in fun.  Near and Far is the same experience, plus a bunch of other stuff to worry about and it may have complicated things too much for me to consider it to be worth it.  I'm giving it a 7 now and would play again, but I would expect my rating to change, just not sure which way.

RATING: N/A
In Near and Far, you and up to three friends explore many different maps in a search for the Last Ruin, recruiting adventurers, hunting for treasure, and competing to be the most storied traveler. You must collect food and equipment at town for long journeys to mysterious locales, making sure not to forget enough weapons to fight off bandits, living statues, and rusty robots! Sometimes in your travels you'll run into something unique and one of your friends will read what happens to you from a book of stories, giving you a choice of how to react, creating a new and memorable tale each time you play.

Near and Far is a sequel to Above and Below and includes a book of encounters. This time players read over ten game sessions to reach the end of the story. Each chapter is played on a completely new map with unique art and adventures.

RATING: 8
Excellent Game, but there are some elements that keep it from being perfect. The race to get the tents can detract players from going after other things in the game. The game rarely rewards risks. I think an expansion could potentially really improve some of this game's shortcomings. Also, I think that I may trying a certain number of turns instead of 'racing,' just to see how it goes.

If you're getting Near and Far strictly for storytelling, I think you will be disappointed in this game. In fact, you will probably only to go on about half as many story encounters as the game's predecessor Above and Below. However, despite that I still found Near and Far to be a pretty thematic game, and much more so than its predecessor, and I'm not just talking about each map having thematically-tied stories, or the character mode that lets you not only have thematically-tied stories but also have continuity between the stories. I'm talking about how rather than having a very Euro action point allowance + set collection scoring mechanism and then a tacked on adventuring to give you random resources to start your set collection as in Above and Below, Near and Far throughout gives a feeling you are going on a journey. With all the stats being relevant once you set out of town, ability to pick up packbirds, along with treasures, there is a greater feel that the non adventure part of the game involves actually preparing for your journey rather than just being completely separate (it would feel even more so if you had to collect bread to feed your adventurers when you go on a journey. Meanwhile, the actual journey actually requires to move around, and while like a I said the story elements are actually infrequent, it still feels like a journey. It makes sense your party would get worn down adventuring through unknown lands, and setting up a camp as a rest stop reduces that amount of wear. There are things you want to travel to besides the story elements, from resource nodes to point scoring locations to fighting off threats.

This game isn't that streamlined, but the basic principles aren't too complicated, and with some story elements and the good art I think you could get fairly new gamers into it if you can get over the hump of them being intimidated by all the pieces. The thing is, while it would be better if the game was balanced with a more elegant solution, I do think everything is there for a purpose. The dueling mechanism is essential in a 4 player game in case too many people take your spot. The mines are needed for some easy early resource generation and to aid those trying to play a rush game. The resource trading spot is necessary to ensure there can be a lot of resources with different uses  (something that Above and Below did not do well), but at the same time you aren't stuck if you get the resources you don't want. 

I saw a review that said the game makes you want to complete artifacts and do the stories, but it is more lucrative to place camps and that pack birds and treasures are pretty useless, and I have to disagree. That's not to say placing camps isn't a big way to get points in this game. However, there are a lot of things in the game that are situational, but useful in the right context. Packbirds are much less useful than getting resources to get another adventurer, but at times you just need that extra movement. The stories are the only cheap ways to get faction tokens if you need them, and anyways while usually the reward of a story isn't as great as just placing down another camp, the thing is stories can cost little or no health. Artifacts  allow you to get further stat boosts once you no longer have any slots for more adventurers, and give you a way to convert otherwise unused resources (including resources you would get from placing camps) into points. In my first game, I built my entire strategy around maxing out my reputation so that I could play my rare artifact that required such max reputation. This artifact gave me 3 attack, and so then allowed me to go around defeating multiple threats in a turn. When the other players caught onto my strategy, they tried to build camps around the threats to eliminate them, so most of my town actions involved picking up packbirds so that I could reach further threats, and subsequently this allowed me to reach far-reaching story encounters that the other players couldn't, and complete them at no cost.

I am a little worried that my general strategy won't vary too much from game to game. Perhaps there are maps that give you significantly different distributions of story rewards, and also make certain stats more or less valuable. Otherwise, while there are multiple paths to victory it would seem like you could do the same path every time.

While I haven't tried it with 3 yet, I would imagine this game works best at that player count. With 2 there isn't enough blocking going around in the town or of using other people's camps as a leapfrog to expand the reach of where you can get to. With 4 the game's downtime becomes a factor.

EDIT: The maps feel too samey. While the stories are different, they come too infrequently to make it feel like you are playing a different scenario. The going on a journey feel has soured for me since it feels like you are just alternating going on journey for as long as possible, and just go back to town for one turn just to full heal, rather than a preparation. The mechanisms that are there just to patch up balance for edge cases also annoys me more, as it makes the game feel like it has more options than it actually does. Confirmed this game seems best with 3.

Picking up where A&B left off, N&F is all the the game of its predecessor and then some. The stories location specific, can branch into side quests, and can also be character specific. The skill- and combat-based adventuring gives players more control over the stories, which makes building your party, your skills and your items and artifacts that much more fun. The tent building and town mechanisms are just more frosting on this delicious cake.

This is hands-down Ryan Laukat's finest game yet.

Kicks it up a notch from Above and Below, with more challenging euro type decisions, and different maps to explore.

One tip: we houseruled that you can't engage the same threat space more than once on a turn. Without this, folks can sometimes rush the endgame and win by beating 5 or 6 threats on a turn, which we found lame and unsatisfying.

This sequel to ‘Above and Below’ is better than the original in almost every way. The map book mechanic works really well at adding variety to the game and creates a strong overarching narrative when playing a campaign. There are less story book moments than the original and none of them are random but the quality is just as good. All of the pieces can also be used in ‘Above and Below’ which is a nice addition.

A very nice sequel to Above and Below. I like the attempts to add more depth to the stories (sidequests and keywords that affect future quests) and I love some of the concepts introduced here, but I'd just as soon play Above and Below. I'd say overall that Near and Far is better if you want more of a competitive strategy game with a touch of storytelling, and Above an Below is better for a less competitive, light Euro feel with frequent storytelling interludes. For me, Above and Below captures the whimsy of the series a little better, and Near and Far might take itself a bit too seriously, but both are excellent games.

Amazing metal Kickstarter coins and great art, graphics, and the story/quest were funny/entertaining. BUT...

Seems game is unbalanced and almost broken - when it comes to the threat-fighting. You can end the game super-quickly and in a super un-fun way that breaks the theme if not the game. This rule is the problem:

"They may also move across the same threat more than once in one turn, but must defeat another threat and pay any required heart cost each time."

UPDATE: If you house-rule the fighting of threats so that you can't backtrack over and over again - then it fixes it. But...not a fan of having to house-rule a game to fix something in a finished game.

It's pretty. It adds a storytelling element that's kind of fun. You even roll a die for skill checks and fighting (how the designer sneaked that one past the publisher is anyone's guess.) But this is a worker placement/resource management Euro at heart. It's just extra spiffy looking and with the aforementioned twist.

It's got the usual nonsensical rule about how only one person can go to the store at a time (or the mine or the bird factory, or whatever it's called) unless you have a duel. Because, obviously, that's how it is in the real world, where if you want to buy beets (I can't imagine why, but for the sake of argument) you have to punch anyone else who had the same idea.

Look, I know what you're thinking. In what sort of crazy world would TWO people want to buy beets at all, much less on the same day?! Um, the world of Near and Far, I imagine. Even though I didn't encounter any beets, I bet they're in there somewhere.

It feels like there is some sort of nefarious plot afoot in which designers try to make it seem like Eurogames are "about" something and contain "fun." I say, knock it off. Eurogamers aren't discerning enough to require fooling, and ATers and wargamers laugh at your feeble scheme. Be satisfied when people with decent taste in games can say, without a trace of irony, "Well, there were fleeting moments when I didn't feel like I was taking a math test."

The good news is that I met a robot and tried to rob an old man and got second place. The bad news is that I was not, I am fairly certain, playing War of the Ring.

Great looking game, and with the addition of plastic gems and metal coins, a pleasingly tactile game too. However, many of the "choose your own adventure" choices in this game come down to how good at the required dice roll you are, rather than what action you would prefer to do. The campaign mode could have been done far better (for instance, allowing players to keep World Cards for the remainder of the campaign, or even carrying over money/gems/faction tokens), and even the character mode isn't as memorable an experience as I'd hoped: my daughter and I had completed our required number of quests to advance to the final map, but have to play through an additional two games while my wife meets the same requisites, which really doesn't give us much to do. 

I often feel like I'm dragging my feet near the end of the game so the other players can grab a few more quests, and we've ended some games with 6-7 quests remaining on the board. The storytelling seems to be a big part of this game, rendered almost obsolete by the winning condition of using all of the tents first.

It's a reasonable game though, I still enjoy playing it, but it's a shame it's not... better.

I've played Above & Below and vaguely remember it.  I played Islebound but can't remember a THING about it.  Near and Far was far more enjoyable to me.

Another charming romp from Ryan Laukat. 

I don't think I enjoy this one quite as much as Above and Below -- probably because my large collection means it's unlikely that I'll ever play it enough to complete the campaign. This would be a real winner in a smaller collection.

Gorgeous components, especially with the metal coins from the Kickstarter campaign.

Definitely enjoy the theme and implementation of this one more so than Above and Below.  However, when it comes to adventure / story telling games, the best I've played to date has been Agents of SMERSH, and I don't feel the need to own another one.
Its strange, but I really have a hard time pulling the trigger on buying a Ryan Laukat game, even though the art is REALLY good!  My favorites so far have been City of Iron and Islebound.

Definitely an improvement over Above and Below. While I enjoyed A&B, I never thought it was that great of a design. It was like Ryan Lakat took two halves of two different games and smashed them together. It was a choose your own adventure game, but not really, and a pretty basic resource management Euro, but not really. Near and Far feels like the 2.0 of that system. While the choose your own adventure and resource management are definitely still there, this game also incorporates some worker placement and a little bit of route building. 

There are parts of this game that make it feel like a kitchen sink design (Card drafting, racing, risk management, etc.), which is a little unusual for a Red Raven game. Normally their games are fairly streamlined and simple, but this feels like it has a little bit of extra mechanisms rattling around in the engine for no discernible reason. 

Regardless, I enjoyed this game quite a bit. They fixed one of my biggest issues with A&B, which was how difficult resources were to come by, but one glaring flaw from that game still remains here, and that is with the book of encounters itself. I know that they wanted to make sure and have some passages describing the resolution of the choices you make, but a lot of the time it still doesn't make sense with what happens. For instance, I ran into a creature who was trying to sell me something, but when I turned him down, he basically said "Suit yourself," and gave me two food. I was a little disappointed to see the book of encounters receive only a slight tweak in this area, which is unfortunate, considering how much better this game would be if there were more possible outcomes.

Also, as an aside to my overall opinion of the game, I remember watching Rahdo's runthrough back when this was on Kickstarter, and I remember how the designers thought it was odd that he spent so much time in town as opposed to exploring, which was a red flag for some people after watching. I thought it was interesting, in retrospect, that they didn't seem to spend much time in town during play-testing, but I found myself playing similarly to Rahdo. I really feel like Red Raven Games would put out better quality games if they play-tested with more people outside their little circle. There definitely seems to be a slight twinge of amateur design in every game I play from Ryan Lakat. Sometimes it's easy to overlook, like with Near and Far, but other times it can really turn me off to a game. Just something to think about in case he ever reads this.

Still, I think Near and Far is really a return to form for Ryan Lakat and Red Raven Games. It's been awhile since they had a really good game on their hands, and I think this is one of them. The design is quite ambitious, and I'm really looking forward to playing through the entire campaign (If I ever get enough time). My rating could rise after experiencing the character development, but otherwise I think this is a very enjoyable game. Again, some design elements hold it back from greatness, but I think this is going to fire Above and Below for a lot of people. It does a lot of the same things in a more refined way, and I have to give credit to Ryan Lakat for moving away from the whole tableau-building aspect here that seems to be ever present in his games. It's always interesting to me to see how his designs continue to evolve and improve over time, and Near and Far is one of his best yet.

Really don't know what happened here. After about 6 turns i felt like there was nothing I could do. No money to recruit adventurers, not enough hearts to got out travelling and not enough skill to go to the mine anymore.  Basically sat and didn't do much for over an hour. Left very disappointed, might try again and see if it's better next time around, but doubt i will rush to play again.

The amazing sequel to one of my favorite games Above & Below came and I can't get enough of the story! Just like it's predecessor, Near & Far is a worker-placement/storytelling game with tons of replayability and fun. And I didn't think it was possible to make a better game design than A&B! While still maintaining the same spirit of adventuring, Near & Far digs in to the two types of games it's straddling: role-playing and point-driven Euro. The key differences here are multiple maps (where Above & Below had just one area: "Below"), multiple characters with their own unique quests, and multiple modes of playing: campaign which is playing through all the maps sequentially with their hazards and bosses, arcade which eliminates the story and only gives the rewards and finally, character, mentioned above. I think it works brilliantly with two players but I found that it meandered a little with four players. While Above & Below had a limited number of rounds, Near & Far has only one game end condition that can drag out the playtime. Still, what the design team has done to system is definitely an improvement and I can't wait to fully experience every inch of what this game has to offer!

It's a point salad dressed up as a scenario-based adventure campaign. You'll do a combination of moving around the different action spaces in town to earn different types of resources and/or earn VPs, and moving around the map outside town to earn different types of resources, and/or earn VPs. Then convert resources into points by buying artifact cards. It's a matter of preference and opportunity (in terms of what skills are available from the draft of adventurer tiles) that define your strategy, and then maximise their utility. You can invest a bunch in town before leaving, or race out of town early - it all seems to generate about the same points. Turns go fast, but every now and then the game comes to a crashing halt when someone enters a quest space, taking the necessary time to resolve the paragraph flavour with a dice roll to earn rewards. The paragraphs don't seem like they're progressing much of a cohesive story; just your typical set of fantasy encounters to justify the appropriateness of the rewards, but I haven't got into the game far enough to assess its long term effort. It's mostly a race to get out your campsites (either in town or on the map), and to get enough resource to buy your artifacts before the campsites run out, but there's not a lot of tension - there always seemed to be alternatives to earn equivalent points. I'd summarise it as being enjoyable to play, but non-compelling. In the end it has too many rules for family, and the cartoon art makes it hard for gamers to take its campaign credentials seriously given its competitors in its market.

The spiritual successor to Above and Below, Near and Far is a game about equipping your adventurers to explore the world. You start out by moving your pawn around in town to recruit adventurers and get some stuff for them. Then you move onto the map board to establish camps for money and gems, defeat bandits, and encounter stories. The stories provide text and rewards from a booklet similar to Above and Below, but they are fixed to given locations. To provide variety, the game comes with a number of different maps that are intended to be played sequentially, in a campaign.  While the stories are definitely more coherent than Above and Below, I usually play this game at 2-player, and I always feel like I'm missing out on the stories we don't experience.  The mechanics are solid but not nearly as clever as Above and Below.  I'd say I enjoy the two about the same--this one has better story, but less game.

Sequel to Above and Below.  Much more story driven.  So many modes...character mode, campaign mode, etc.  Character art work still will not be surpassed.  Love the in town options.  Really like the 'assemble a team' focus to go out into the world to accomplish tasks.  Don't care for the camp building aspect.  Game often ends far too quickly.  Thinking about applying some house rules to slow things down a bit.

RATING: 5
Only 1 game so far and it's certainly descent as you can expect from Red Raven Games, but I'm a bit worried about the replayability with the stories as on Map X it are always the same stories whom return. One of the big plusses of Above and Below was the big randomness of the stories so the chance of encountering the same story in 2 consecutive games was rather small.

Edit 08/10/2017: Why did I lower my rating dramatically?

The more I play Near and Far (we're playing a campaign), the more I'm convinced there is only 1 way to victory and that's collecting threats when travelling on the map, as by doing so you're putting down 2 tents in a single row and that increases the pace of the game significantly.

OK, you can argue that you have to take away the threats for your opponents, but I don't like that. I don't like games where a move of opponent X make I MUST do move Y, because for me that's negative gameplay = ameritrash, where I like games where everybody can pursue his own path (who are all equal!) as this is positive gameplay = eurogames.

I bought this to play with my son when his reading is up to the task (and to encourage him to get to that point, too!), so I was happy to learn the rules and play it at my game group. Very glad to say that the purchase looks like a sound one: the game is a light Euro with story-telling elements, which can be played in three modes (one-off, story-driven and character-driven). The simple mechanics are not taxing, but working out how to get all the resources you need to make your artefacts is a pleasing task; and there is some interaction with duelling and racing for trading posts. The stories seem fine, if brief - but then, I'm used to the behemoth that is Tales of the Arabian Nights in that regard and this has wa-a-a-ay more game than that does. So far, so good.

Really solid. This felt like a major improvement over Above and Below. The euro elements were better integrated into the adventuring theme, as the worker placementy town visits function as adventure prep. Each player gets a small character sheet, so when you have an encounter, it has the chance of giving you a connecting quest you mark on your sheet for your next encounter opportunity. This gives each player a cohesive plot arc.
The game also gives you a budget of "hearts" which are points you use to either move extra spaces, stake claims on the map for points, or most crucially you can spend them freely to increase your dice results so there's solid luck mitigation.

The other cool thing is in campaign mode, you save your characters session to session, and there's a book of maps where each game you play on a different map until you've played 10 times. Of course the concern there is that you'd need to have a consistent group across those sessions. However, leveling isn't so complicated that we couldn't fudge it and start a new character at the level of the others if we wanted to. If you didn't want that, the game has two other, different modes, "Character mode" which is about completing your own personal plots, and then a random encounter mode for a more similar questing experience to above and below. Each of which has it's own section in the encounter book, so you'll get a different story experience by playing each of the different modes.

I really want to like this game.  In my opinion, it seems like the way to play is character mode as it seems like the game is there to paint a tight story with several different endings based on your choices.  I need to play this mode and see if my rating goes up.  We have been playing campaign and while the stories are fun the rest of the game is just average and the play time with four players is to long.
  
Like:
-Stories are great
-Each map feels different
-Playing with the day side of town really opens up options

Dislike:
-Too long with 4 players
-Needs better player interaction
-No sense of urgency
-Not fun once the quests on the map are done

We are adding a few hose rules and will see how it goes.

RATING: 7
This game is quite fun. Each player is essentially alternating between two game phases: city actions and quests. While in the city, you aim to prepare your party as best you can, in as few turns as possible. Once you leave the city, you travel around, build camps, collect gold and gems, fight threats, and go on quests, all with the aim of maximizing your achievements before running out of "hearts" (at which point you must return to the city). At its core, the game really revolves around carefully managing your actions, balancing the amount of preparation you do versus how much you can accomplish once you leave the city. Traveling around also adds a bit of "push your luck" to the game, as you decide each turn whether to continue pushing forward or bail out and return to the city.

The gameplay itself is fun, though not groundbreaking. For us, it's really mostly about the story. Now, compared to Above and Below, while there is much more to do, there is quite a bit less storytelling per game. In fact, we actually house-ruled and added more encounter tokens to the board to increase the number of stories per game. But we still find A&B to be the overall better (and more fun) story-telling game.

Pros: Continuous and branching story lines are very interesting to follow. Game play is fun and provides a unique blend of "Euro"-y planning, push your luck, and story telling. Amazing, beautiful artwork. Very  compelling and creative stories. Overall, an amazing fantasy world that's just really charming and inviting to play.

Cons: Not enough story telling per game for our taste (adding quest tokens to the board can help). The game itself is a bit bi-polar - advancing the story and winning the game aren't always compatible (in fact, they often contradict). This can be confusing to some - it is very easy to get drawn into the story and focus on questing, but usually that will not be optimal (and may very well lose you the game). Finally, I'm a bit concerned about replayability - while there is an impressive amount of stories in the book (way more the A&B), the gameplay itself feels quite repetitive - go to the city, travel, repeat. We did get a little tired of it after a few games, and will probably wait a while before coming back to it. With A&B, we didn't have this issue - we were always compelled to play it again and never really felt we were tired of it.

Edit: We learned two important things from Rahdo's runthrough of this game, which really improved the game for us:

1. You MUST use the "advanced" side of the board - just ignore the "basic" side.

2. "Character mode" seems like the best way to go. Originally we tried campaign mode, but that just wasn't that interesting to us. We found it much more compelling to follow each character's story and see how it unfolds - highly recommended!

From what I was told, this game will be different in the storybook encounters idea than Above and Below, and more Arabian Nights style of decisions. Since my family enjoys the decision space of AN, this went on the wishlist, since as was pointed out: the encounters will make more sense and not so strange as how AN unfolds. 10 scenerio maps for 10 games to reach the end? Keeping the same character the whole time? I wonder how much of a sandbox is involved, or strict planning to get to the end. 120 mins each session sounds like a mini rpg. I can't wait for this one, it sounds like a lot of fun to be had...with a legacy format on top of that?

I really, really wanted to like this game. However, after three plays it's pretty clear the "5" rating on BGG fits my opinion of this game perfectly: Average game, slightly boring, take it or leave it.

Simple rules, quick to learn, and plays pretty fast.  Available actions are somewhat limited, you either get resources in town or go on a quest.  The most interesting part are the quests and the stories behind them but this also limits the replayability of the game.  Overall it's fun to play and has the right balance of luck vs strategy.  Fun to play at least once on each map.  Have not tried the world campaign mode.

This game is fantastic.  It combines light Euro game elements with story telling in a seamless way.  I liked Above and Below, but the campaign mode in Near and Far makes me less interested about whether I win or lose each game and more about enjoying the overall story.  One of the few games where I feel like I'm "in the world" as opposed to just playing a game.

The biggest flaw that I potentially see is that the number of quests is limited.  Of course, there are still 15-25 games without quest repeats (and any 1-2 hour game I play that many times I consider a success).  However, there are a couple fixes.  First, you might remember the same story 20 games later, but good luck remembering what the specific rewards are -- so it is definitely replayable using the quest book.  Second, I think (and hope) that the boardgamer/aspiring writers of the world will create new scenarios over the next few years.  I'd love to see Red Raven Games incentivize its fans to generate more material (while they work on the next great game!).

Incredibly high build quality (so many solid bits!), beautiful art, and great game flow. The events add great flavor and richness to a fun game of planning expeditions.

The different campaign modes and multitude of characters and maps should keep each session feeling fresh.

Very enjoyable! Minor storytelling aspect that gives some theme and provides variability to the different maps. The game play is fairly polished and the game is a good length. Looking forward to more plays and exploring the other game modes. 

I'm a bit hesitant to run out and buy it since my initial impressions of Above & Below and Islebound were also great, through my interest faded quickly with subsequent plays.

After getting past the first adventure and having mixed feelings, playing through character mode and starting the campaign showed us where the game really shines. It is essentially a refined euro-mechanic game with little player interaction and rewards efficient play with multiple paths to victory. Ive won my fair share of games with various strategies and enjoyed them all equally. 

I would not hesitate to recommend this game as it is for sure my favorite game design by Ryan Laukat.

RATING: 8.5
An interesting blend of story-telling, role-playing, engine building, point salad, resource management, race, economics, worker placement, and set collection - this throws in everything but the kitchen sink and somehow it all blends together wonderfully.

Only complaint - the rules are quite dense and will take a good 45 minutes to learn. The game is not hard at all when playing - and the turns go by very fast - but there are just so many small details to go over in the beginning that it's a slog until you get going... but once everyone knows how to play, I was really surprised by how fast this thing moves.

My rating will probably go up!

The story telling aspect is super fun, since Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective is one of our favorite games, this fit in perfectly as kind of a combo story/worker placement/racing game. There isn’t much player interaction (and almost no ability to be mean), which is great. The need to beat your opponents out of town and not spend too much time buying things, juxtaposed against the need to be in town buying things so you can be successful on the next expedition creates a great deal on tension and makes all of your choices feel meaningful. On a more superficial level, the game is also flat out gorgeous, which just adds to the charm.

Solid adventuring and storytelling experience with lovely art and theme. The underlying euro mechanisms are good (perhaps better than Above and Below) and the storytelling is great (also an incremental improvement over Above and Below). That said, I find the decisions a little less tight and the game is generally more wide open. Keep in mind, we've only played this at the 2-player count. Still, it is the campaign that makes this game particularly compelling for us. So far it has managed to really capture the adventuring feel. Overall, a worthy addition to our collection.

This is an adventure style game. Players spend time in town recruiting and outfitting a party, then go out and explore the world having encounters (with stories, simple decisions with dice- and skill-based outcomes). You repeat, back and forth between town and world, until someone ends the game by placing all their campsites (marking adventures explored or some actions in town). The little stories are entertaining, and surely will tie into some overall story in the campaign setting. Looking forward to playing this more!

RATING: 8
This is a kinda story-telling, kinda adventure, kinda worker placement game in the same world as most of Red Raven Games properties.  In this game players either perform tasks in a town via worker placement to prepare for adventures or they go on an adventure to collect other resources and/or score points.  And sometimes you go on an choose-your-own-adventure-style quest by reading a passage from a book, picking one of two choices, and testing an ability to see if you get even more resources.

At its core this is a pretty standard euro game.  There's several ways to get points and most of it is driven by collecting many different resources and turning those resources in for things that score you points.  But it also sort of brilliantly puts this coat of adventure veneer on top of all that.  You recruit a party of people with different stats, buy treasures, and roll dice to duel your opponents and fight threats while adventuring.  Plus there is the story mechanic which doesn't add much, I quickly grew pretty disinterested in the actual story snippets and made decisions based on my abilities and chance of success rather than playing a role.  But it is enough to give color to a game with reasonably strong mechanics and make those otherwise, to some, bland euro mechanics more attractive.

I also like that while you can play this one off or as a campaign with improving characters if ever you feel like you've exhausted the story book you can also play sans story with adventure cards to continue enjoying the mechanics without the need to read about the same Glogos fight over and over again.

Also, if you've played a Red Raven game before, you know all the art is done by the designer and you know what you are getting.  When it comes to the vibrant colors he uses, I love it.  The game is bright and colorful and I like looking at it.  The characters, just not a style I'm attracted to, but your results may vary.

RATING: N/A
Best with 3: Not too fast, not too competitive.

Notes to self:
Talent Selection: Fishing (1) or Piano Playing (4).  Meditation (4, food=hearts)? Later Potion Making? Taunting or Martial Arts?
Variant 1: Perhaps make it so that side quests in campaign mode that replace normal quests do not remove the book; however, the player who side-quested there cannot use the book for its map location quest.
Variant 2: Increase the number of books on the map.
Note: Keywords are a lot more common in the Character Mode stories than the Campaign Mode stories. Many of the Character Mode endings are highly dependent on keywords

Rulebook Errata:
GAME END (page 28):  "play ends with the player to the left of the first player so that players have an equal number of turns." This should say "play ends with the player to the right of the first player."
MYSTICS HUT (page 16): This section means to say that you can draw a card only if you have at least one pack animal. If you already have treasures in all of your available pack animal slots, you can still draw. You draw and decide if you want to keep the new treasure. If you do decide to keep it, you discard an old treasure to make room for the new.
SALOON: After a player recruits an adventurer, they immediately draw a new one from the bag so that there are five at the Saloon again.

Storybook Errata: (See Private)

Commonly missed rules and notes:
Artifact Cards:
* Party members of a Faction gives you a discount when hiring others of the same Faction. However, artifact cards with a Faction banner means that you must PAY that Faction token to play the card to your tableau. That banner on the artifact card once played does not count towards hiring discounts or towards gaining Chiefs.
* Reputation on artifact cards is not spent, but is a threshold that you must be at or above or at or below (for negative values)
* Nightmare Amulet and Crown of Cruelty may create player conflict.

Threat Cards: 
* Tents go on threat cards
* Swords on threat cards are not sword icon
* You can go back and forth over threat/treasure spaces multiple times in one turn (spending hearts, though for skipped spaces)
* If a threat is next to the town, the town is considered a tent, so if you put a tent on the other side of the threat (or treasure), it nullifies it.

Fighting:
* Be sure to always declare fighting honorably or dishonorably before you roll a duel (we have a house rule that if you forget, it's always honorably)

Campaign:
* Cards don't carry over when playing the campaign. Subquests that are written on your card do though.

Even one incomplete game session, and I can tell that the story element becomes a more significant factor than it was with Above & Below, especially as the stories are tied to specific locations on the map in campaign mode, or progressive through a narrative arc in character mode.  As the story events are random each time through the atlas page, and each character has their own arc, replayability is high.

Okay game that has some interesting choices. The main draw is the story and immersion factor, which is nice but a bit overly random. Feels really frustrating to get a hand full of negative reputation cards and then no matter what you do in the quests (like attacking / killing random people) you just randomly gain reputation. Wish there were a few tweaks to reduce randomness and make having cards less negative or easier to discard. Also wish there was more player interaction. Again, not bad, but not something I'll seek out unless I'm in for that very specific mood.

tl;dr: harder than expected

I quite liked [thing=172818][/thing] (and all the other Red Raven Games things I've played actually) and this game is supposedly a continuation of that game. Now, both games do have that adventure book and you have a similar system of recruiting adventurers with different skills. But the rest of the game around it, is quite different.
I found this game harder to play then expected. Not because the rules are complex, they are not, for a strategy game, but because there are many things to keep in mind and combine to be efficient.
I quite enjoyed my first play of this, even if I didn't do particularly well. The challenge is bloody good fun.

Very easy to learn and teach (I am terrible at teaching rules). Got it on the table with one friend who doesn't like board games and one who is familiar with them. They both really enjoyed it and we had a blast. The quests are playful and surprisingly deep. We only scratched the surface as this game has a whole lot to offer. Character mode, story/quest mode, skirmish/arcade mode - many ways to play and unlock the game. Hopefully will jump into the campaign soon!

The only thing I wish is that there would be more player interaction. You can duel at town but I wish you could go to your opponents' camps an cause some sort of ruckus. The ways to gain journey points are really cool and you can counter strategy and build your character to be specifically good in an area and create a play style that best suites you (attack focus, town focus, etc.)

Check this out!

The design of this game is really attractive, as it is in all Ryan Laukat games, and the story elements are fun too.

There are some undeniable rough edges to this one, but I'm inclined to give them a pass. Very few designers are crafting places like Ryan Laukat, and fewer still are able to realize them so beautifully. This is more coherent, more thoughtful, and more cleverly arranged than its predecessor. In particular I'm taken with the tempo, bouncing between stops in town and life on the road. A definite must for fans of Above and Below.

KS addition.

I like this game a lot.  Plenty to do in town and out in the world.  I like the quests but dislike that there are few of them.  I know the rules say you can add more but haven't chose to do so...yet.

I feel like you need a decent party before going out which makes me feel like I spend too much time in town.  I know that is probably not the intent of the game but that is how it seems to me.

A lot of victory points can come from building your artifacts which can be fun and challenging but that is not the goal of the game.

I know the goal of the game is score the most points but you want to be quickest to run out of tents.  I find that to not be as enjoyable as the questing and building of artifacts.

All in all, a great game experience.

Near and Far is a game from Ryan Laukat set in the Laukat universe. It has a lot of elements from his other games, so there will be some familiar things here. One of the interesting twists to the game is that there is a campaign mode or at least a lot of different maps. The "board" is actually a book with seven or eight different two-page maps. Additionally there are different modules that can be brought into play.

Like in several of his other games you build an adventuring party, each of whom has different skills. In this game the skills are swords (good for fighting), eyes (good for settling camps), hands (good for getting stuff/quests) and arrows (good for travelling). The game is split between a city location and the travelling map. In the city you have a way to get adventurers, get pack animals (kiwi), treasure cards, convert resources back and forth, and also get a few coins/gems. When you leave the city, you determine your "heart count" and then go adventuring in the countryside. This is where you can set up camps to get gems or gold, go on quests, set up trade routes, fight brigands, discover treasure, etc. You eventually will run low on hearts and won't be able to do much, which is when you'll teleport back to the city.

You start the game with a hand of goal cards, which reward you with cool abilities and points if you get the requisite stuffs. But uncompleted cards count a point against you. There's a way to get more of these as well.

I enjoyed the game a fair bit. It has a bit of what I don't like from Above and Below... all the text heavy adventures which can be really random... but it's not as prominent and you're better able to complete the quests by spending hearts if you get a bad die roll. As always I enjoyed Laukat's artwork.

This is the game I wanted Above and Below to be. Allow me to explain.

I liked Above and Below, but if you take away the story book, the game is incredibly bland and archetypal. It wouldn't be a bad game, but it wouldn't add anything new to the table. It would be a lightweight euro lost amongst the sea.

This game has an excellent story book AND unique mechanics. The heart system is pretty neat. You get x amount of "hearts" which can be expended to boost almost anything. Combat, movement, skill, whatever. It's yours to spend and prevents the dice from being totally chaotic and random.

The stories all tie together really well, which is another plus above A&B. While the stories in A&B all came together to build a vivid and fleshed out world, individually, they were all pretty disjointed. One story rarely has anything at all to do with another.

Lastly, if anyone else has this question, you can absolutely own both. This game has a few mechanics from A&B, but is definitely its own game. The map/camp mechanic reminds me of Orleans. 

It's a great game. The downtime is near nil. The world building and skills and party you assemble reminds me of D&D, but without the textbooks of rules. The only thing I'd like to see a little more of is player interaction. You're reading stories to each other throughout the game, which is nice, but ultimately, your character seems to be a bit unaware there are other characters around as well. There's also a little guilt in stealing the quest markers from opponents.

A rapid fire questing game that is more fun than it has any right to be!

The stories are cute and immersive. The journey mechanics make you feel like your character is travelling the land. And despite some potential imbalance with the threat deck, the game is fun.

Major tip - do not let anyone rush the threat deck. That will ensure a fun game for all.

Really looking forward to the expansion to bulk up some of the less useful parts of the game (pack animals, mine, and treasures).

Definitely better than Above and Below but unfortunately the integration of the stories still feels incidental. Basically, this is a fill your order cards game. Sure, there is a board and there are a bunch of cool things on it but mostly if you just focus on filling the high point cards exclusively, you will win the game. Even if you don't connect any of the marked goals on the board. That part was disappointing to me. Also the length/downtime isn't great. I'm not sure how the campaign plays. Maybe there is a sustained story arch that makes the game worthwhile but the one-off/first scenario was just meh.

Via Near and Far: Amber Mines - Backed on Kickstarter (2017)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Near and far is in my opinion an eurostyle game with a small experience influence. Not to marginalize the stores, but the mechanic to develope is good in itself. As usual a lot of choices. Who do I take on a journey. In what will I specialize do I grap the weapons or is skill my ambition? Is my agenda to harvest a lot to find artifacts. Do I aim for money to invest in new adventurers or is the trading route my way to score at the end of the game?
The game in itself is Light. The choices simple but the flow of the game runs in a tight ending of the game. Personally I like the adventures but also without it is a nice game. Is it my favourite Laukat? No but it is great to play this more often. 8.5

2.7 - Different, beautiful, possibly fun, and at first glance seems to have more replayability than Charterstone. I'd like to try something a bit different, and this game seems to fit the bill.

I thoroughly enjoyed my first play. I have the impression it's a little more streamlined and easier to explain compared to Above and Below. I'll happily play a full campaing (and more?).

I was nervous having watched the Watch-It-Played that the game would be overly complicated and finicky. However, once we got it on the table we did not find that to be the case really and are continuing to very much enjoy the overall experience! My wife and I are about 7 games in so far, including having played all the way through the character campaign with Rin and Shardling, a couple games of the world campaign, and the tutorial game with another couple.

Being a sequel to Above and Below will obviously invite comparison to that game, so I'll say that if you enjoyed exploring the world of Above and Below you'll find a lot to love here. That being said, it's a very different game. I wondered if Near and Far would somehow "replace" Above and Below in my collection, and am happy to report that it isn't trying to do that.
1) While both games are story-heavy, Near and Far is going for a more epic story whereas Above and Below's story feels both much smaller and more intimate--if you're doing it "right" ;) (i.e. naming your villagers and co-creating a meta narrative for your village along with your primary reader). 
And a note here: If you're not in it for the story-telling, I just can't imagine there's enough in either game to tempt you to the table. Some have noted that Near and Far is a more strategic game--which is true--but that's not what gives this game legs. 
2) Near and Far is also a tighter experience than Above and Below. This is partially due to the mitigation of the random elements in the adventures you'll go on, but it's also tied to the end game mechanic (which I vastly prefer in Near and Far).
3) Near and Far has so much content and offers a lot of replayability. In fact, you can play through every character campaign and the world campaign twice and still not experience everything on offer, partially through chance and partially through choice. That's a very good thing, because the world Red Raven has put on offer here is very much worth exploring.

Near and Far has been set up, ready to play on our game table for week now and I don't expect we'll be putting it back into its box anytime soon.

Pick your path story telling adventure sequel of the beloved Above and Below. Story mode and campaign mode or even a random arcade mode (neat idea) played on an opened out map book with references to the adventure book.  Has an area control aspect with the different factions of the recruits.  Familiar and recognizable art, wit, humor, and charm. Has a legacy component as you permanently level up your character.  The silhoutted town board for city actions is beautiful.

[microbadge=17587] We backed the Deluxe version on KS, and shortly before it arrived, I was a little nervous, since I heard complaints that the game had been changed post-KS. For example, in the previous rules, players placed camps on the map according to which of the four factions they were building for. At the end of the game, players got points if they had the most camps of one faction (or something along those lines). In the final version, players build camps in their own player color and receive a point for each camp built from their player board. As a response to changes such as these, some people have stated that they didn’t enjoy the game because it felt too simplified for them.

After playing the game just once, I was relieved to find that I was not one of the people who found the final version of the game not to their taste. In fact, Near and Far may end up being my favorite Laukat game!

Definitely an experience where the adventure you go on is a better indicator of how you did than the point total you compare at the end of the game.  The town efficiency puzzle is a perfectly acceptable light worker placement game... but the heart of this game is out on the road having encounters.  The campaigns make you push your efficiency and take chances so you can be the one to experience as much of the story as possible and that's a pretty neat trick.  Without the story this is an average Euro game, but if you get into the story it is pretty special.

This ties the stories to actual map locations, which is more thematically rich. They also give you several ways to play through the game. With one play under my belt, I am quite simply hungry for more!!

THIS LOOKS SO GORGEOUS! Note to gift givers: I really want the KICKSTARTER edition because it comes with the fancy metal coins and more lush, heavier stone markers. The regular version of the game has cheap looking plastic bits.

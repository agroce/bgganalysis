Nice little game. Simple rules but lots of strategy and replayability.

RATING: 5
This is an abstract game of selective worker placement and area control, with a "colored cube longitude and latitude" aspect that fell quite flat for me in my first play.  This themeless game reminds me of a number of euros from perhaps a decade ago wherein the designers assuredly designed "a game" that could be played, but neglected to focus on putting elevated levels, or conspicuously high levels,  of "fun" into the design.  

Hey, I designed a game, and one with area majorities for you to worry about!  Why do I have to alter it, adjust it, or modify it, so that it's lots of fun to play?  

Bottom line:  I feel like this game is an early draft of perhaps a better game, maybe even one actually connected to a theme.  As it is, this game felt very dull and abstract.

Territorial control using a five cube pentagon. Use of coins and other workers make the game a bit more strategic. It is always a bit of a mystery as to who is winning with the juice tokens. It is an enjoyable game which will get regular play.

I really like the general concept and core mechanic but it never elevated into a compelling game. It's like it got stuck in a concept or prototype phase.

Too much information and the perfect information present in the game make this a very AP prone game. Either way, it is not thematic and not very strategic (it is more tactical). The turn order is a huge influence but it is just a "pass to the left" token. 
I wanted to like this game, but it has lots of issues. Great production though.

This is a really neat abstract that is really colourful. I kind of think that some of the mechanics feel tacked on, but at the same time I feel the game would suffer if they were left out.

This is a terrific abstract game, with just a hint of theme!  Just the way I like 'em (Kingdom Builder, Medina, etc.).  I love the cube selection mechanism.  You get two cubes, but your opponents will always get one.  Then there's the decision where to place your assistants.  I like the puzzle quality to the game.  This game also forces you to consider the times when it would be wise to tie for first in a particular stall, or to come in second, rather than first.  Coming in second has benefits that are important for future turns.  That is cool!  This one will give you some of that delightful brain burn feeling.  Excellent game!

Certainly not so good as Fleet, but not so bad as Floating Market. It’s a very abstract game with no theme what so ever and the artwork ain’t that great neither. It all works, but there is nothing really new for me neither.

Basically a pure abstract.  It's area majority, but at a small level (gaining or tying for majority out of 4), with cascade effects (winning majority in one spot will help you win majority in an adjacent spot of your choice, which can repeat itself).  But most of the game is won on just placing your workers next to the higher point discs (randomly called juice wells?! at an attempt to paste on a theme) and trying to arrange for those workers to come off the board before another worker next the same disc is removed (up to 4 workers in different areas may be next to a disc, and only the first to be part of a completed area gets the disc).  The mechanic of getting cubes at the beginning of each round is kind of interesting, but the designer failed to make an interesting game around it.  Fresco gives a lot of the same feel (trying to get the right mixture of colored cubes to turn those into points), but with a lot more theme.

I like the interaction in the way cubes are chosen, but I need to see more information on the way the markets work with the powers to effect areas around them.

I really thought I was going to like this game, and there are some cool mechanisms going on, but it never ascended the "spreadsheet" feel for me, and just kind of felt like a math exercise.

Morroco is a largely themeless area control-ish game. There's a theme, but you barely notice it and for a large swath of the game, I didn't think of it at all.

There are two phases to each round. In the first each player moves the "rooftop pawn" to a new spot. They'll get cubes of the colors adjacent to that spot, while everyone else gets one cube of the color in that spot. This is important because those cubes will determine where you can place workers on the board.

In the second phase of the game, you'll place first one, then another, worker on the board. The board is broken up into "stalls" with four spots in each stall. In order to put a worker in a spot, you have to look at the cubes along the edge of the board and pay the combination of cubes that creates an intersection for the stall where you want to place. You may also have to spend an extra cube to put some special workers out.

At the beginning of the game, each spot in a stall borders a VP token (technically a "juice seller token" which literally could have been called anything). However, multiple spots from different stalls border the same tokens. So there's a race to "close" your stall first, as you get to pull the token your worker is next to when a stall closes. The other adjacent workers in other stalls will be left holding nothing. But buying juice (really? that's what we're doing?) isn't the only way to get points.

Closing a stall happens when the "worker points" equals the correct closing threshold. Generally a stall needs four points to close except when a neighboring closed stall has it's "overflow arrow" pointing towards it. That reduces the closing threshold by 1 worker point.

When a stall closes, there's a majority contest. Whoever has contributed the most "worker points" to the stall gets 5 points. They also get to put their stall marker on the spot. At the end of the game every stall marker in their largest contiguous group is worth 3 points. Additionally, they get to orient their stall marker so that the arrow points towards another open stall of their choice, which helps other stalls close faster. If there's a tie for first, then the tied players get the 5 VP, but the active player puts an "empty" stall out. It still has the arrow, but it doesn't count towards anyone's contiguous chain of stalls.

The second place player gets 2 VP's and a gold and a bodyguard. The gold can switch the cubes along the edge of the board, so that you can place workers in spots you otherwise couldn't reach. Alternatively it's a point at the end of the game. The bodyguard is simply a worker that counts as two worker points. If there's a tie for second place, the tied players gets one point, and they have to choose between a bodyguard or a gold.

Third place gives a point and the choice of a bodyguard or a gold.

Placing a worker or a bodyguard simply costs two cubes, the correct colors for the intersection you want to place at. There's also two "tourist" meeples you can place. I don't know why these are considered tourists thematically, nor what the bomb-like explosion shape of the meeple represents at all. Tourists initially behave like a normal worker, but they cost an extra cube to place. When a stall closes, the tourist transforms into a worker and moves into whatever stall the overflow arrow points at. Which can cause a daisy chain of closings if done right. But they're at the mercy of whoever has the majority in the tile, as that place directs the overflow arrow. After you use your tourists they are out of the game, so use them judiciously.

There is one other type of worker called cousins. You get two cousin tokens, each of which you may spend to place cousins. When the cousin tokens are spent, you're finished with cousins, so use them to good effect. When you place a cousin it costs an extra cube, but you immediately place a second worker (the cousin) for free in a spot in a neighboring stall immediately adjacent to the first cousin. It must go in the spot directly adjacent to the first cousin... so you're bordering the same juice seller token. Placing cousins can have potent effects, especially if it causes stalls to close. It's also a way to get into a spot you don't have the right color cubes to otherwise reach.

The game is fairly abstract, and a good bit thinkier than it appeared at first blush. It's definitely an interesting game. There's a lot of racing to finish things to get the juice tokens, or be the one to control a stall closing, or just to get into a closing stall to take part of the closing bonuses. Alliances are important, as closing stalls by yourself is inefficient. Often people have an incentive to help you just to help themselves, but you have to be careful to make sure that you keep other players in check lest they get too powerful.

I enjoyed my play. It was a little painful because I played with a highly AP-prone player and this is probably not a good game for that type. It made for a much too long game. I need to try this again without AP players and/or possibly with fewer players.

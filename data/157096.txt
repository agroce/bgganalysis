Juego de gestión de acciones con motor de cartas, apoyado en ciertos elementos de tablero, bastante original, siendo un juego de "civilizaciones" casi tan abstracto como los de cartas puros, (tipo Nations o TTA) no muy lejos de ese concepto. La escala hacia militar o científica es un puntazo. Y con bastante rejugabilidad con varias razas. Muy recomendable para los amantes del género :)

My first foray into civ boardgames. Historia is quite abstract, but with two interesting differences relatively to Through the Ages and Nations: there is a (tiny) world map, and a lot of upgrades/bonuses and government types are unlocked by the game progression are encoded in a tech by military matrix on the board, removing the need of a lot of cards present in TTA or Nations. For instance Age of Sail is an icon along the tech axis of the matrix, and makes all the regions of the world map adjacent for the player that acquires it.

Historia is a card/action selection driven game that is all about creating a VP engine, and most of the action is in getting the right wonder cards to be able to create strong combos to power up your advance. 

A military approach is tricky, at least at high player number, because it's relatively easy to thwart the advantages of territorial expansion, by denying exclusive control of a region, even temporarily. A military oriented strategy will create a lot of direct/take that interaction, which I find a plus.

At low player count it is possible that an isolated militaristic strategy might become overpowered, because the militaristic player can remove enemy cubes fast enough to take off on the VP track.

Going for a tech oriented is much harder to counter directly, and seems to create more of a multiplayer solitaire/race game. A player which totally neglects military becomes immune to military, which I find a problem in the game, and is probably the best strategy at higher player count, if enough players pursue a militaristic strategy to neutralize each other.

The game is completely deterministic in terms of turn order, action selection and resolution (each action is a card, all players having the same number and type of cards). But randomness exists through the draw of the wonder cards, leaders and advisors (which are bonus single shot actions). I found that this type of randomness increases re-playability without destroying strategic depth.

The game has strong catch-up mechanisms, by determining play and leader drafting turn order in reverse of the VP track position. Nevertheless the catch-up mechanisms are not so overbearing as to create very close final scores, so I think they reasonably well calibrated to prevent the game from being unforgiving to little mistakes. Still, they are strong enough to create gamey tactics of delaying VP acquisition to pick the best wonders. Still, in our game one player was first during all the game and created great combos with wonders.

There is one mistake that should not be made: missing the race for the 2 actions/turn milestone, which will seriously handicap a player for the rest of the game.

Interestingly, the game does allow some flexibility in strategy during play, which is also a plus.

The game turns play relatively fast during early and mid-game. Game progression is dictated by the revolution action, and so under player control. Nevertheless during late-game players can play 3 actions per turn, and the number of playable wonders slows the game to a crawl. Our initial 5p game lasted almost 4 hours, so caveat emptor.

In conclusion, I found Historia a very well made and balanced game. Graphically the game is not very immersive (no illustrated cards, a spartan matrix), but on the other hand it has a map where one can fight over territories. I think it's a great start for a civ game, I'm curious to see how it holds up against others in the genre.

I was very curious about this game, but unfortunately the first play was rather disappointing and left me unsure whether I will enjoy the game. These are first impressions after one play, so take everything with a grain of salt.

A lot of ideas which were exciting on paper seemed to not be work that well in practice. The civilisation matrix seems to offer the promise of charting very different evolutions for civilisations. However, with one of us playing military heavy and another wonder and tech heavy, we still followed a broadly similar track and although the actions being played were different, everything still felt very samey flavour wise. While the way card recovery works sounds great, in practice it means you often end up playing the same actions as everyone else because your choice is restricted.

One of our group complained that revolutions cut the flow of the turns too much and were unpredictable, but I found it manageable and it forced you to pay attention to other players (lost by two points because of it).

My main complaint has to do with the way wonders work, they have what feels like a reasonable impact, though perhaps not enough flavour, but the way they show up in game ended up meaning that whomever was playing first would get all of them and only leftovers would be left to the third player. This would be repeated every two turns and wonder building ignored the rest of the time.

All in all, Historia gets points in my book for trying to be innovative but I don't think it gets it quite right, and for me when looking for a short civ game Nations is still the one to go for.

Feels a bit unbalanced. restricted number of paths to win:

1 - buy wonders, stay behind, always be first in turn order, get points through tourism
2 - rush military, get lots of power cubes, dominate world map, do science last
3 - neglect military, go science only, get points by staying in utopia (needs wonders)
4 - go middle path, science = military, mix in a few wonders, basically do 1, 2 and 3

Simplified civ game with a peculiar card stack system. I had low expectations after kickstarting the game on a whim, but the initial impression was positive. And while others might dislike the graphics and the abstraction level, I like both. My only two worries are how much replayability there is and if King civbots are invincible (they certainly have seemed so in our plays).

After 4 plays in, I sold the game to make room for other, more exciting games. Will play again but will not seek out.

Wash, rinse, repeat for 3 hours. ZZZZZzzzzzz. Keep recycling through a few action cards to go up the zig zag (what else can one possibly do other than to go up the zig zag anyways?). Concordia is WAY better for recycling through a stack of action cards. And there are many better civ-lite games (eg The Golden Ages, Patchistory, Nations)

Bought and played the game at the Spiel 2014. I really like the concept with delevopment matrix and a mini world map where civilizations emerge. I ran away in militaly and won the the game with huge margin. Thus was left with a feeling that players need to stay close each other in development and I don't really see many paths to victory. Wonders seemed also be weak even if there were a lot of them. Disappointed.

I had this on my wishlist from the moment that I saw it. Luckily I was able to trade it.

Although it looks somehow strange the development-matrix is pretty elegant. The civbots are easy to manage and pretty tough - they simulate an opponent pretty well without the normal feeling of "being a fiddly mechanic to make the game work".

Pretty cool game.

There's a lot to like about this game - it tackles the short-Civ challenge head on and comes up with some new and interesting answers. It features some clever design approaches to simplifying the inherent complexity while retaining a noticable connection to the theme, including through the dashes of colour Leaders and Advisors add to the otherwise minimalist structure - and, admirably, they do so without overcomplicating matters.

But, for me, it's probably just a mite too abstract to really deliver any more than trace amounts of the grand sweep and glory if a proper Civ game.  The range of icons along the Civ track looks interesting to begin with but they can be pretty much ignored as they have no real affect on game play as it's the additional icons you really need to pay attention to.

RATING: 5
There is some neat stuff here, but I really felt like it wasn't quite developed to it's fullest potential.

I was really excited about the matrix, and people having varying civs based on their progress.  However, the only differences are a few extra points each scoring phase, which just felt really dull.  I was really hoping the matrix would introduce more uniqueness depending on player position on the matrix.

It also felt like military was especially strong, although that's tough to verify without repeat plays.  Being ahead of someone on military seemed hugely better than being ahead of them on tech, especially since the map is rife with points, and several of your action cards are useless if you're not ahead in military.

Overall, it seemed like something that could be really great, but just fell short.

RATING: 4
The game is far too fiddly. I'm constantly tapping and untapping cards that give me one point when used. One point! When the final score is over a hundred and fifty, one point is hardly something to care about. And the path to victory seemed to clearly be related to teching up as that gave one more actions per turn. In the end, the coolest thing about the game was the spreadsheet and it is utilised far too little.

This game is spreadsheet-like, and the matrix honestly isn’t interesting. It doesn’t feel like a civilization game at all, and it’s way too repetitive and long even with just 4 players (I would never ever play it with 6!) The hand management aspect is okay; it’s not something I generally enjoy, and the actions honestly felt lackluster – and you didn’t feel any joy once you had developed the tech so you could get a slightly modified and better action than you otherwise would. 

The military track seemed stronger than the science track, which is something I hate in Through the Ages too… And some of the wonders seemed much better than others and suited for specific strategies, so you better be early in turn order to ensure you can snag up the wonders you need as there will be fierce competition for those. So it can actually pay off to be a little behind in most of the game, just like it can with PG (not saying you should be last or anything, but if you’re leading by a few points throughout the first part of the game, I don’t think you’re going to win). The leaders are important too, sure, but the scoring of the areas you control on the map is too, and this is utilized by a military strategy.

All in all I was very underwhelmed by Historia. It’s repetitive and frankly downright boring…

First play: we used the events but no civbots in a 3 player game. I really had a good time playing this one. It has a power grid style turn order mechanic where the point track determines turn order. I was leading the entire game, which meant I went last because the other two players were trying to "stay behind" for turn order advantage. I wound up running away with it, so my advice would be to take your points when you can don't try and game the turn order (which I like). But the game really comes down to card play, where you have actions (cards) you want to do over and over but those actions become locked in you discard queue. Whenever someone plays the Revolution action, it ends the round, but the people who called for revolution get extra actions back, so you'll want to try and guess how long you can play real actions and time the revolution with the other players. Great stuff with how the game progresses and the military/tech advancements are unique and well done. Would definitely play again. 
--downtime is a killer in 6 player.

A descent civilization game. Every turn players play cards and take actions repeatedly 'till one player plays "Revolution". Players can either develop their tech level, military power, expand territory, trade, or even build a wonder. The which-card-to-play mechanic and civ-progress table is the essence of this game.

There are still several things I dislike:
1. Military-focused civs are way too strong than any other kind of civ since territory scoring is the most rewarding way to invest in this game.  
2. Wonders, advisers and some of the actions are mechanic-oriented designed, sometimes player may wonder "why this wonders/man can let me return a card/cube" during the game.
3. Territory control is really unique from other civ games, but totally loss its meaning after developing navigation. 

Solo variant is quiet interesting in this game. A little advice: civ bots will grow crazily if player does not catch up their military power.

It's not an epic civ game like TtA or Civilization, but with reasonable playtime and smooth playing experience, it's still an enjoyable game.

Had a really interesting/good play of this. Looks like most of the game-to-game variability is going to come from other players, not the usual Civ-style technological differentiation, which is appealing... if it works / provides good replayability.

Concern #1: It might not. (There are many points of interaction, though, so it might.)

Concern #2: Coming back from behind seems really tricky. I managed it from Age 2 -> 3, but had been building a Wonder engine in preparation for tourism; another player in our game looked entirely out of it by that point.

I've heard very poor reports from other players... though all of them were playing 5+ player games, sometimes with bots. Ours was 4p.

Opening might be scripted and warfare track when comparing to your neighbors is very important or a fourth of your role cards are useless.

Is it dryer than some other civ games? Sure, but it's also much shorter and easier, and it's not exactly flavorless.

UPDATE: Played a few solo turns against the AI bots, which are a clever addition, but it's still on the dry side as a solitaire exercise.

This is the one game I played at TotalCon that I'm most eager to play again. It took me a few rounds to get used to how the cards cycle back into your hand -- a great mechanism -- but by that time the game was over. I love how the progress matrix works and the visual style of the game. My only complaint at this point is how the conflict map seems like an afterthought and is relegated to a small corner of the board. That opinion might change after repeated play.

Not as dry as I feared it would be. The English rules are very fuzzy, many things left unexplained.

I liked the matrix, but not too fond off the hidden leaders and the advisors. Some decks are clearly better than others. 

After another play I'm a bit unsure what to think of it. There are many things to like here, the matrix, how the civbots work and how they improve the game, the action selection mechanism and the world map. On the other hand the wonder part of the game leaves me cold. I think it's borderline broken as it is now. It's very good to be last the first 2/3 of the game so you can get the best wonders, and in age two and three you might not get any wonders at all if you're the leader. Stupid design if you ask me.

The game runs a little bit too long as well, close to three hours with four players.

I hope we'll see more games featuring the matrix, lots of potential there.

2015-05-22 : Rather smooth and fast-playing Civ game that has little downtime. A point is deducted for the butt-ugly graphics - one of the worst I've ever seen - and the non-wrapping score track.

2015-06-05 : The new shiny wore off pretty quickly on this one as numerous problems with the game were discovered by the group on subsequent plays. Military is *way* overpowered and certain buildings of the second batch which allow you to quickly recycle cards are simply game-winners. The events are too powerfull as well : dealing out free upgrades just because you happen to have a particular action-card still in your hand.

The group's conclusion : nifty mechanics, lousy balance

SOLD IT! ($25)

Sort of a clunky civilization game that tends to play itself through repeated choices/actions (you build your empire through a series of action cards played on a conveyor belt). The process quickly becomes stale and confining. The eye catching technology matrix on the board is also not as exciting as I would of hoped for.

The game does work, but the final nail for me was the slanted scoring. The points gained from controlling territory far outweighs any score you can manage from technology/wonders, leading to fairly similar strategies.

I didn't find the game to be terribly balanced. The leaders certainly made trying to be Utopian out of the question. Military is by far the most powerful thing to do, it lets you place colonies with not threat that they get removed, you can remove others for points and science is easy to make up using the trade action. You need to hit the 4 and 5 science marks but after that they aren't to important until you hit 8 for navigation and then the 3rd card.

The leader going last is very unnerving as it can make it difficult to impossible to get wonders. Something to keep in mind that you need 10-11 wonders in age 3 for leaders. The advisers are annoying as well, since some are just upgrades of others. 

I'm not sure of the art. I like some aspects of it. The board is terribly unimpressive, which is disappointing because you spend so much time manipulating it.

This felt underdeveloped and lacking in variation. The turns felt railroaded due to how quickly they end and the strategy you were locked into (culture vs military). I'm absolutely stunned at the staticness of turn order. 

Since I’d made the “mistake” of jumping out for points early and dominating the Americas, I went last for the entire rest of the game. The result was that wonders were practically or literally a non-option for me. I got one which gave me +1VP when raiding and I used it. The players who held back in VPs/turn order used their positions to snarf up all the best wonders and get first choice on leaders. While I led most of the game, I griped the whole time about my inability to get wonders since they don’t refresh after every turn. I just knew that those extra free actions would win out in the end. And they did.

The game’s choices felt false to me as once you get on your track, your decisions are pretty much made for you. Stay behind the leader, get the best choices of wonders and leaders then make your push for victory at the end. At least in Power Grid you can choose to not build cities and reset your turn order. Here you’re locked into it. I'd mistakenly thought this was a hand-building game whereby you get new cards a la Concordia, but other than the occasional advisor, and without wonders to virtually add to your hand, your hand is static which means so are your decisions.

Long game (no, really...our first game was 3 hours long). But boy is it good...& those 3 hours didn't seem to be that long. Played with 6 players, there's enough going on that you can't really tell who is going to win until right to the very end. Very balanced, tight play...this has been extremely well designed. Still to try with a lower number of people (2 or 3) & would like to try the solo variant. Will be interesting to see how the dynamics change.

Also includes 2 expansions + Essen promo cards.

This looks dry like a desert but I like this game! The timing in the game can be really irritating if someone plays a revolution when you just played for instance the whip to get cubes back but not too much and it happens to almost everyone at times. At least in a six player game. Which, by the way, is way to long and to much chaos. I would much rather try to play it with 4 players again.
I like how the theme actually somewhat shines through even in the dryness.
The only REALLY horrible thing are the advisors that are WAY to swingy the way the rules are now. You can get an advisor the first turn that is impossible to activate until you have the Tourism-card that comes in the end game. Meanwhile your opponent can get a card that immediately gives him one extra firepower. TOTALLY NOT BALANCED! I guess someone has fixed this with a variant actually.
Current rating: 8 (this is considering that I really hope there is a good fix for the Advisor-swing)

I liked it quite a bit . However, I am convinced that the replay value is very low, as (with basically only 10 playing cards in play for each player) there will be an optimum path to move through the development grid which players will have figured out after a number of plays.
So if replay value would influence the rating, this would be considerably lower.

I liked it. I Think a 5 is fitting. Maybe a 6 with familiarity with the game (because of all the icons).

What I loved. I really want to play it a few more times to try different strategies I think there could be lots of ways to win the game (but maybe wrong there maybe only two be first in military or be first in science)

What I liked. Quick for a civ game. I liked how the balance between military and science is played. I liked how leaders and advisors played. 

What I disliked. Too many concepts that didn't gel. They threw the kitchen sink at this one. I don't mind complicated game with lots of concepts but the flow at times was a bit off. I don't think you should be allowed to start in the new world. It may have been more aggressive if everyone started in the old world. Too many wonders The whole generic cube resource made the game simple and quick but blah. 

What I hated. Military (even thou I won with it...) Military is so boring. I raid you and you loose nothing. I war on you and you loose one cube which you get back and a handful of vp (over the course of the game.). Raid should be a cube of opponent from his supply gets put into discard cubes and you get a cube back. and war should be the same as it is but the cube is permanently destroyed. That would be a nice aggressive variant.

RATING: 5
I generally applaud the attempts to bring Civilization games down to a level that can be played without sacrificing an entire day. The standard path seems to be to introduce military and science tracks and continue along those two axes. Historia is no different, except that it plots the axes on a combined 2-dimensional grid instead of viewing them as entirely distinct.

The effect of that, apart from making it look even more like a spreadsheet, is pretty much negligible. They are still two different axes, played and scored separately with a single exception. As such, I don't really see many different ways for the game to develop. Players are going to race up the two tracks, with a little differentiation due to wonders and leaders. Some developments seem to be fairly crucial so you cannot really ignore science, and military makes it much easier to score points (while I do think it's positive that those points don't necessarily come at the expense of another, weaker player). Wonders allow for some combo-building but they don't seem strong enough to shape the game on their own (which, I guess, is a good thing because otherwise why bother with the rest of the game). In summary, a dry spreadsheet mimicking the rise of civilizations that, in spite of using two axes, still feels very one-dimensional.

2014 : 1 to 5 players :

In Historia, the players guide their civilization through 12,000 years of human history, from the first sparks up to the development of Singularity. Civilizations discover new technology and expand over the planet; they trade with more developed neighbors to import new technologies or exploit the land to have more power for future actions. Civilizations develop their military and wage wars with each other. They build wonders to make their civilization stand above others and to eventually attract tourists and newcomers to their land to follow their leaders and use their national advisors.

Very streamlined play for an in depth Civ builder. Slight learning curve with iconography, but this does make it language independent.

"When to play what card" is the main mechanic (action/role selection) and that is a fun and meaty decision.  Wonder engine building is gratifying also.  Each society is themed well and the components are nice.

I have learned after Nations and this one that this kind of Civ experience is not for "us".  Lol

Played a game of Historia, interesting little game of Civ Lite with some meat (oxymoron), I thought that going military is a little stronger than going technology. I would suggest to take out the 6VP point for reaching max military or to put more bonus VP chits on the Tech tree size of the tree (lower right hand side) to make Technology development more attractive.

Losing all your territories due to war is very expensive VP wise and needs to be better balanced. Some the tech tree side of things occur too late to catch up, like tourism, which comes up a little too late to score more than once or twice off. 

There is some strange disconnect between the physical size of our civilization and your tech/military development as well. Its addressed in the VP awarded but it isn't intertwined as you would expect it to be.

Rated as a solo game (so sue me, that's what I got it for). The bots just seem imbalanced to me. The Easy ones are too easy, and even the Medium ones seem way too difficult. They maxed out the science and military early in the 3rd era, so their whole turns became gain 3 points, gain 4 points, gain 3 points... Very uninteresting.

Fairly unflavorful for a civ game. The different science levels don't change much (which is not really a bad thing, I guess, the different cards in Civilization don't have drastic effects either). Probably the whole experience is more flavorful with real people, but as a solo game, it's very dry.

Some light but much shade in this game. In the middle of the game, we had a leader, some in the middle and a player with least points. At the end of the game, the same ranks. No catch up or bash the leader possible. At the end, every player developped both military and tech to the max. The game progressed so symmetrical it was predictable and thus boring. Only the personalities cards and some wonders made a slight difference, deciding who won, went second or lost. I hardly see some replay value. When players start having two cards to play, downtime significantly rises.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles:
Eurogame amb tema de civilitzacions, cada jugador té un cert nombre de cartes a la mà (al inici tothom té les mateixes) i cada torn n'escull una en secret, que no torna a la mà fins que un jugador escull una carta en particular, que a més acaba la ronda. Les civilitzacions es desenvolupen en una especie de "graella" amb dos eixos: poder militar y tecnología i l'arbre tecnològic ve donat per la posició de la civilització en aquista graella.

Les mecàniques estan poc relacionades amb el tema i aquest sembla enganxat. La part de "conquesta" és poc rellevant i el minijoc de la graella fa pensar que hi pot haber poca diferenciació en tecnologies (tothom més o menys tindrà les mateixes, ja que el camí que seguirà tothom a la graella és molt similar). Dona més la sensació de un joc de cartes que no de un joc de civilitzacions. La part més interesant del joc és la de les cartes, que em recorda lleugerament a la gestió de les cartes d'ordre del Runewars. No crec que m'agradi, i certament no afegeix res nou...

I went for a low combat strategy to favor the civilization development but for me the game fell flat. Why?

I have mixed feelings about this game. The things it does well it does VERY well, but there are a lot of problems with it still.

The card mechanic is beautiful, the way cubes work is good, the way techs work is good, the way the rondel plays out the various stages of each age is good...

What are the problems? Well the military topping out means that if you have higher military strength then you can't be stopped - it makes for a very aggressive game. I think you could fix that by each player rolling a dice and adding that value to their combat figure. It still means military strength is dominant, but it comes with risks and no longer just means an auto win.

Also the monuments seem quite disjointed from the game - I would rather see them as upgrades to your deck where you are forced to throw out an old card to upgrade to the new one.

That said it's a civ which plays in under 2 hours so maybe I shouldn't be beating it up too much. It has a lot to achieve and it does ok.

Another of those civ-type games where you have to choose between developing your military or concentrating on science. At 2 hours it doesn't outstay its welcome and all strategies seem viable, you don't just develop military and pick on others (although that's one possibility). So it works just fine, although it is a bit dry in its mechanisms, mostly you're just playing a card and moving a marker over a square grid, like an RPG the narrative is all in the minds of the players.

Hard to rate after a single play.  Neat game design.

With 6 players, the player(s) who completely ignored the military aspects of the game clearly had a huge advantage . . . as there is no real penalty at a certain point to not having any military . . . while the military players clearly can negate each other on a crowded board.

My guess is this would play much better with 4.  Based on one play - concerned that certain strategies don't scale with number of players.

Juego de civilizaciones.

Tendremos que desarrollar nuestra civilización tecnológicamente, militarmente, adquiriendo maravillas y desplegándonos en un pequeño mapa que representa el mundo.

Todas estas acciones se realizan a través de un set de cartas que tienen dos opciones, una básica y otra avanzada. Para realizar estas acciones de las cartas hay que cumplir un requisito (en todas las avanzadas y en alguna carta incluso la opción básica). Este requisito es haber alcanzado una determinada posición tecnológica. Además de avanzar en este track, desplegar en el mapa, aumentar nuestra potencia militar, podemos jugar consejeros, conseguir maravillas etc.

El final de cada turno lo marcan los jugadores al utilizar una carta que hace que recojan parte de lo que habían usado hasta ese momento.

Esta chulo pero tiene pinta de que las partidas se vayan a parecer mucho unas a otras

Rating based off partial play. Iconography is a bit dense, but once grasped things begin to fall into place. I like the simplicity of the basic engine and mechanics. Certainly some strategy here, but many times the best play ends up being scripted given your current situation. I wasn't grabbed, but liked it enough that I would play a full game sometime.

A civilization game? Count me in! Oh wait...this one is very abstract in looks, feel and play and lacks serious variation. The game forces you down a military or cultural path and is scripted to urge you to rush for the two actions per turn technology. Furthermore; if you're last, by the grace of turn order, you get all the best wonders and leaders. Then a world map is tacked on where you hope you better not end up secluded from other players because this will limit your growth and action possibilities. On the positive side it does have a nice action selection card system, but otherwise this is a dry mediocre designer game.

Read rules Oct 2014

This rule book surprised me. I was expecting a civilization game but instead found the rules to a neat looking Euro. I won't try to quantify what I mean by that.

The game has you managing your deck of actions which are only slightly different for each player. Several key actions require you to spend power cubes which also need to be carefully managed. There is a small map where area control battles rage, and equally important the adjacency of everyone's civilizations are defined. Many actions require you to be adjacent or coexisting with an opponent.

Historia includes the familiar areas of civilization growth: military and technology. You can progress through each of these, but they are coupled. You may need to increase one before you can increase the other. This is rather elaborately depicted in a garish 'matrix' which dominates the board. There are coloured sections of the grid which grant different amounts of VP at the end of each round. I'm not convinced this concept is much better than two linear tracks, but it sure is ugly

Probably more troubling is that the technologies are encountered in the same order for each player. There is no sculpting of a tech-tree here, there is a set order you will acquire things and that will always be the same. It might be perfectly fine this way, but expectations from civilization games makes me want for choices and fun combinations in the technologies.

Still the game looks very solid. The card play and resource management bits seem to be full of agonizing decisions. I am a bit on the fence on this one, but one of my friends is quite keen on it so I'm sure we'll give it a play.

Absolutely amazing design and way more thematic than it might look. Played this with two and 3 Civbots and the bots wiped the floor with us, especially the one we had on "king" - probably don't do that in your first (few) game(s) because they'll steamroller you.

I only played this solo.  There's something unmistakenly missing about civ games where the map is not the focal point of the game.  The mini-map on this game doesn't qualify, in my world.  Also the symbology on the game board and cards I found to be confusing.  There was nothing exciting about this game, as a solo game.

RATING: 7
Combines Concordia-style card playing and a nice two dimensional military-science development track that forces players to develop their civilizations in a balanced way. Symbolics are very confusing early on, but once you get over that the game flows almost quickly. On the con side there's also the weird-sized, non-bookshelf-compatible game box and game flow that makes it hard to catch the leader. The game offers also a very competitive Amoebic Intelligence for those who want to play solo or add bots to multiplayer games.

The axes are a clever idea and I enjoyed the game quite a bit. Lots of fun and lots of stuff to do. Down time wasn't as bad as I feared it might be.

This is a very interesting game, but I certainly haven't got my head wrapped around it. Need proof? Here: I had a commanding lead for at least three quarters of the game, and came dead last out of six players. What makes it worse is that I'm not really sure how any of that happened.

RATING: 5.5
Usually when I don't like a game I can have some fun thinking of tweaks or changes to make it more enjoyable but I just can't think of anything for Historia.

The cardplay is unique and starts out interesting then just gets frustrating.

It seems like there's two strategies and you need to pick one at the start of the game and then try to get the wonders that support it. The wonders are perhaps the most crucial part of the game and seem unbalanced. 

All of the mini-expansion sounds interesting and I might try it again with them but I fear they may just be masking the fact that the core game is still on rails. Two very long and slow rails.

First of all my low rating. some days I will take it and somedays I will leave it.

So it still might find its way in my collection.
There is some stuff that I like . On the other hand it doesn't feel like there is something surprising you can do. 
Or cause others to rethink. It is a multiplayer solitaire that has some interactive mechanisms but it is good to be behind or in front with your neighbours.

After a couple of games I am not sure about the replayability. It is pretty clear that you need to advance equally in order to get two actions each turn.  and than the downtime starts to kick in.

there are probably some nice combo's to made with the wonders as well. I could rate it a seven because I won't turn a game down. Unless I could play another game instead. I will enjoy my play but in the end it lacks some soul.

In Historia, the players guide their civilization through 12,000 years of human history, from the first sparks up to the development of Singularity. Civilizations discover new technology and expand over the planet; they trade with more developed neighbors to import new technologies or exploit the land to have more power for future actions. Civilizations develop their military and wage wars with each other. They build wonders to make their civilization stand above others and to eventually attract tourists and newcomers to their land to follow their leaders and use their national advisors.

Historia is a civilization game for 1-6 players that takes 25 minutes per player. A set of action cards is available to the players to guide their civilization, and used actions form a discard queue from which they are taken back into a player's hand during the game. Wars and raids are carried out in a non-disruptive way. When modern times have been reached the game ends and the player with the most VPs wins.

RATING: 6
The Development Matrix is central to the gameplay and it seems interesting to look at. In theory, the game covers all human civilization from the ancient to the present-tech, obviously omitting the ideological struggle between Nazism and Socialism during the Second World War for apolitical reason. The game comes with a 12-page rulebook in English. The rest of the rulebook is in German and Italian. So the publisher's intent is obvious and ambitious with a very wide audience in mind. Other than the development matrix, the game board contains Government Bonus matrix, a map of the world, Turn Marker Track and Timeline Circle, Used Cube Pools, and a Victory Point Track rounding out the four edges of the board. Nicely done and everything is already there once you set up the game.

Each player leads his or her civilization rise to the power or dominance, starting at the lowest and leftmost square position on the Development Matrix. The two axis on the Matrix is Technology Level on the horizontal and Military Level on the vertical. The winner is the one who gains the highest victory points, attaining the highest level on both accounts as much as the civilization can (tribe or nation if you will), at the end of a 12-turns game, which is divided into 3 eras. Each era will have different Wonders (cards), which line up in Wonder Row for players to choose and pick up during Action round.

Core to the game is the play of Action or Advisor Cards. The number of action cards a player can play depends on his nation's Technology Level, meaning that a higher Technology Level results in more actions. The play of Action Cards are simultaneous by placing them face-down and they are revealed at the same time. Each Action Card has two action types available, Basic and Advanced. A civilization can only play the Advanced Action only after meeting the requirement, normally requiring a civilization having attained certain in Technology or Military level.

Guiding the civilization along the Development Matrix with the play of action cards, the players in turn perform the actions to increase the position of the Power Cube in the matrix. The actions are military, technology, art, exploit, expansion, trade, raid, war, tourism or revolution. I won't go into the details of them but you can vaguely figure them out what they are all about. Basically you play the cards to level-up your civilization. Combat, as well as the entire game, is dice-less; an automatic win for the civilization who has the higher military level at the time the war happens when both sides having the Power Cubes in the same territory on the World Map.

You gain points for winning a war, attaining specified levels on the matrix, government bonus (from Barbarians to Utopian), controlling territories, meeting leaders' vision about how civilization development should be, building wonders, etc. Solo and variant rules are included, spicing up the re-playability of the game. The difficulty level of the Civbot in the Solo rules, using Sid Meier's term like Chieftan, Noble or King, determines the number of Civbot cards it can play. My group felt that the "Civbots" might be too powerful at the highest difficulty level with 5 Civbot cards as it moves away from us very soon and we have no way to catch up. They are of course optional in a game and you don't have to use them if you don't want to.

The measurement of the Technology Level and Military Level for a civilization is thematic to the game appropriate. Nonetheless, as a wargamer, I feel a bit dry with the combat system and the pure play of cards in hand you currently have. The strategy is a bit limited in the beginning and it might be quite difficult for accomplishing some of the objectives specific to the civilizations. I cannot say anything about the balance of the gameplay because of that as I need more repeated plays for that. The game can generally live up to its name with a basic gameplay system as such. It is educational to the general, both children and adults. But taking history as a subject, it might be dry for some save for the dedicated as if he was reading a history book. There are many random elements enough for extending the longevity of the game. And, Historia is certainly no Sid Meier's but a "leveling-up" game.

Here's another way of doing a short civ. And I like it. Players have actions on cards they can use and recover at a later time. The "big spreadsheet" represents user progress on Technology and Military, while the small world map represents the spread of the population. Players can also build wonders that help in getting more points from their actions.

I must say that even though I am not a big fan of deck building / card driven games, I was pleasantly surprised by this. I'll definitely rotate it with Tempus as my short-civ of choice.

[b]Update[/b]: I ended up trading it away. It's a great game, but it just isn't the kind of thing that excites me these days.

Verdict: [b]Interesting, but history is messy.[/b] First off the artwork appeared as if the artist quit half way through the project. There were obvious errors (ziggurat drawn to look like tower of babel) and lackluster drawings. That was a big disappointment. The game play appeared solid at least. It plays in a lock-step fashion of working ones way up the grid to advance in culture and military. After our partial game I came away less impressed than before we started. It seems a good effort, but not a polished product. I might play it again, but first I'd suggest another civ game to play instead.

When this was proposed at game night, I joined in. I didn't expect I'd like it, as it looks dry as hell, but I wanted to at least try it out.

Turns out I really enjoyed it! I did terrible -- trailing in last place for most of the game and only catching up to the pack towards the end -- but I had a good time and really liked how the game worked.

It's about as abstract a civ game can get and still feel something like a civ game. What map there is is small and almost by-the-by, with most of the action taking place on a grid tracking military and technology on the axes. You have wonders and leaders and advisors, but they're all in service to this abstract grid or very vague actions. 

I like theme in my games, to feel like I am someone doing something tangible. And yet, this somehow worked for me. Maybe it was just that -- for once -- I was doing something other than climbing the ladder from hoplites to VR Troopers. Wars and battles, as with all other things here, are abstract and fairly painless, so you're not just luxuriating on the spectacular history of military conquest. But even beyond that, there's something about it that appeals to me.

There's also the fact that the score track goes to an inexplicable 133, which is novel.

One thing, however, that there was not enough abstraction to hide, was the fact that Historia is a giant sausage fest. Apparently even in vague, nebulous history there isn't any room for women.

Played once. Interesting game, I like the relatively simple card-play and the trickier way of getting back the cards you've played. It does feel very abstract unfortunately, and there's a lot of "one point here, two points there" which detracts from the main flow of the game.
Update after a second play: Not so keen on it anymore. The limited options in card play make the game feel repetitive rather quickly, and because many of the points come from lots of different small things, it is very hard to evaluate options. Unlikely to play again.

Good civ builder that uses a grid to represent progress. The bots make solo play interesting, but it still plays much better in multi-player. A bit of push your luck when playing cards as the first player to pass gets a bonus action and forces the end of the round.

Update: They came really close to making a great game here, but after three plays I rate it a 6. The matrix and the map are the best parts, and I hope to see them implemented in a better game. The map may not seem much, but I´m impressed with the way such i simple map gives you a belieavable sense of space, far better than a few hexagons with one or two buildings in them. On the downside there is no exploration or resources, but you can´t get everything in a playable civ-game. 

Unfortunately, the game runs too long, and in all three games I´ve had to wait for players with many wonders while they tap and untap ad nauseam. In our third game we used a couple of expansions that didn´t combine well with the mid-level bot, and I think this should have been addressed in the rules. I have a couple of other issues with the game as well, and all in all I´m not eager to play again. I hope for a next game with a similar matrix and map.
- - -
Much more interesting than it first seemed when I read about the game. The matrix is actually quite clever. The game puts the tech tree into context in a way that Progress fails to do. There is even a world map. I´ll be happy to play again, though it´s probably not a buy for me.

The card driven mechanism works well, smart system to get your cards back in hand. Develop in either technology or military or buy a wonder, that provides you some permanent bonuses.

The other thing is that the game takes slightly longer than it should.

Have only played it solo, and it is a bit flat when played that way.  Essentially you must pursue maximum military, which takes a good part of the tech matrix out of play.

Some nice choices in this race game.

Not interested. It seems that the designers went to great length to curb expansion and limit conflict (e.g. no damage from raids). What is the point of that? I also have a general issue with limiting civilization games by allowing only small local actions (looking at you Tempus). Seems more like a Eurogame than a Civgame. Somehow reminds me quite a bit of the recent Concordia.

Hmm, might reconsider. Anyway, I cannot (yet) respect this as a full civilization game since it seems too Euroish. I cannot imagine that allowing players to survive without military over the ages; it just doesn't make sense thematically, does it?

I'm always on the lookout for interesting civilization games that aren't spoiled by too much combat. Historia seems pretty good. It looks quite daunting, but the basic mechanism is actually pretty solid.

25 minutes per player? We took 90 minutes for our first two-player game. Perhaps it'll get faster with experience, even after adding CivBots, but it's solid enough to stand the 90 minute play time.

Maybe slightly frustrating though.

Really impressed with this game. It looked very dry and abstract, which it is, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. It ended up being a very interesting tableau-building/card-driven Civ game. There are a lot of interesting paths to go with in this game, and while I do think the game rewards those who go for the most balanced approach between technology and military, you can really tailor your civilization to how you want to play them. The game is a tad long for what it is, but I really appreciate the cerebral play this game has going for it. It doesn't quite unseat Nations for me as my top Civ board game, but it is a very good alternative.

UPDATE: Played again recently, and I'm still loving Historia. I may even reach for this over Nations depending on my mood (8->9).

Historia is an ambitious attempt of an epic civilization game within a short playing time. The players develop their civilizations in two dimensions: technology and military. It also has an interesting card mechanism where the order of how you play your development cards determines not only how your civilization develops but also how you get your cards back to your hand. I also appreciated the catchup mechanism - I was far behind after the first epoch but won clearly after the third. It may feel a bit long for what you get but as a civilization game it's very quick.

In this card driven game, players advance their civilization either militarily to the top or technologically to the right. Advancing on technology gives you more actions and more cards, while military allows you to conquer other territories. Generally when you play a card, you have to exhaust a cube, and at the end of the round you get to refresh your bottom two played cards, so your deck gets limited.

It's got some nice mechanices, and it plays cleanly. The problem is that this game takes excessively long. If you are playing this game for the first time, it's likely not to be an optimal game, so you could fall behind and stay behind which is not a lot of fun. I'm willing to play again, but not sure if it will be fun with less players.

"Wars and raids are carried out in a non-disruptive way."  That is true.  A hyper-aggressive player can't really do much damage to your ability to actively participate in the game.  But they can, and will, finish the game with a much, much higher score than you.  The game is inherently biased in favor of the all-out military approach, and it takes far too long for the science-heavy approach to become viable.  Furthermore, the central mechanism of the gameplay, i.e. the playing of the action cards, just isn't a whole lot of fun, and the color-specific advisors don't seem to be balanced very well.  There are much better civ lite games out there.

The civilization theme is very thin, and the graphic design and components, even if OK, contribute to increase the abstract feeling.

First of all, the game lasts more than 2 hours. 4 players games are close to 3 hours, which still is not long for a Civ game. 

It features very cool mechanisms that are very well integrated and seem quite balanced in every way. I found some of them to be very smart, like Revolutions being a way to recover some of the cards you used and many other small details that make the game work.

I've read/hard many complains about military being more powerful (and preferable) than tech, but I don't agree. Our first game was won by the sole player that did not finish the military tree. And while it's true that there are 3 actions you won't do, if the militarized player starts to do them, he will lose his advantage against other players who keep increasing the military or other development actions. Yes, the military track ends faster, but you get less cool things in the road, and if you keep increasing it, yes, you gain points but nothing else.

Problems:
-> The "2 actions per turn" benefit is a must. It forces you to rush there; if you delay too much, you might find yourself out of the race.
-> Replayability: in question. Even if there are a few variable elements, the tactics will be very similar. Yes, you will adapt to the Wonders and  era objectives, but at the end, you will be pushing either tech or military anyways.
-> I have not checked them thoroughly, but I'm not sure about the balance of the advisors decks.
-> There are artifacts that are better than others. Getting a good artifact combo can be a big thing, and in order to get it, you need to perform bad and have less points than anybody else :-/
-> The player/s who start in America will be isolated during half of the game. This will hamper his development, especially if there's only one there, but depending on the number of points there, it might be worth the while (not if there are 2 of them). It is something that will affect players in a big way, only because of their starting point.

The only big issue is replayability. The rest are problems I can live with.

Overall, it is a very enjoyable experience if you don't mind playing abstract games, but its appeal won't last.

The queue based card selection scheme leads to interesting decision making, and the wonders add some engine building on top of that.

There are some worrisome parts in the package:
- No real chance of juggling with the turn order. If you get ahead in points, you may end up being the last player for the entire game. This means that you will never get any wonders because other players take them all before your turn.
- Balance of the advisor decks, even with a corrected Schliemann.
- Slightly too long playing time, even with three players.

Not entirely convinced by all the concerns voiced about military. Especially shooting other players' cubes off the map takes a lot of actions, which could be used more effectively elsewhere.

The English rules are rather bad. A lot of rules are clearer and more precise in the German and Italian versions.

Some great ideas in the game, the card play is interesting, and the matrix is a really neat idea.
I do feel there are still some 'rough edges' in the game however, needing a bit more development maybe.
Also, iconography is not that clear and could have been better.

A true CIV game in two hours. Very interesting game which I need to explore more. Probably plays best with many players. I question if there will be a non military strategy that can work. Military seems indeed too strong. once you are in the lead there is little possibility to catch up

Wow, this is a game of inches. Every turn feels so tiny and the advancements in every "age"/round are so puny, it feels like players are standing still. Historia is what most people fear about head-y Euros. The game can be described as literally just pushing cubes around an over-complicated board with no goal or reason...it's pure agony for some. And the upgrades to the basic set of actions don't feel like upgrades, they feel even more limiting and worthless. I was fooled by the nice box, the beautiful artwork and the quality components; it seemed like a well-executed, play-tested game. I just didn't have any fun with this one. Maybe with some of the smaller expansions to this game, Historia might be worth playing again some day.

This is a very well designed game. You have a collection of cards that you can play, but you don't get them back until the end of the round or if you can get an action to do so (and you generally get them back in the same order they were played). On the board you have a technology and army track that you move up on (it is one blended track) and using your cards you move up this track, get cards that help you out, fight others, etc. The card mechanic is excellent and the icons are really well thought out, a lot of work went into this game (with the exception of the score track having numbers on each square!!!). You can play form 1-6 players with an AI system for any missing players which I am told is quite well done. It has a Through the Ages feel.

Historia is an action-selection game where each player has a hand full of action cards to play, and only gets actions cards back to play again at certain times in the game, oldest first.  The main action on the board is advancing on a two-dimensional track, moving right to indicate advances in technology and moving up to indicate advances in military.  The grid was trimmed along the edges such that at points you couldn't advance in technology unless you first advanced in military, and vice versa.  The technology generally made your actions cards better and gave you more actions per turn, while the military was mostly for knocking opponents' cubes off the map board.  The map board was the main source of points in the game--anyone could play cards to put more cubes on the map board, but you had to have more military than an opponent to knock an opponent out and score victory points, as VPs aren't awarded for shared regions.  There were also wonder cards available for purchase, most of which gave you extra VPs here and there, but a few powerful ones allowed players to take action cards back faster.  While I enjoyed the card play of the wonders, I found the map board to be too confrontational for my tastes (which is my usual complaint with Civ games).  I also found trying to execute a technology strategy frustrating, as three of the actions cards were completely useless--two required higher military than an opponent, and one required lower technology (and there were no cards where the reverse was true).

Much better game than it looks to be. Before playing it I thought it was quite dry and abstract game, but actually it has nice hand management aspect, area control and technology progression. And all the things connect well together and feel thematic. The art style is also something that will grow on you as you play. Definitely want to play more.

Historia is another entry in the line of card-based civilization games. It plays from 1-6 players, with any of the unoccupied seats run by a dummy player. Thematically, this game has the things one has come to expect in this genre: Wonders, Leaders, a Tech Tree, War, etc. Historia differentiates itself in a few ways. First, all players start with identical hands of cards. On a turn, a player plays a card to take an action. That card then remains in front of her until a game effect or another card play allows her to return it to her hand. This makes advanced planning crucial because it can slow down a player’s ability to adapt to what her opponents are doing.

A second unique feature comes in the tech tree. Instead of discovering individual technologies (i.e., Irrigation, Warfare, and similar things seen in other games), Historia presents the technologies as a large grid. One axis of the grid represents military strength, while the other is scientific/cultural advancement. I can play a card to boost my military strength, and I simply move my marker up one place on the military axis. This means the techs are generally really abstract, without names to represent advancements the civilization has made. One compelling feature of the format is that it also determines the type of government one’s civilization has. If I have low military strength and a high tech/culture rating, for example, I might have a Utopian Government. This will grant me certain benefits at the ends of game rounds and/or ages. However, the tree isn’t a square, so advancements along a given axis can be limited by advancements on another axis. It is a clever system, though as I mentioned, rather abstract.

Historia gives each player a specific civilization to control. Each civ comes with a deck of unique advisors that are randomly drawn at the start of each age. This (rather small) asymmetry is something I appreciate in games. The board also includes a tiny map of earth. A player’s position relative to other players on the map determines who can be attacked, and who can trade. Aggressions are interesting in this game. They give a reward to the winner, but there doesn’t seem to be a huge penalty to losing. Players can’t be wiped from the board, so it is possible to turtle up in a single territory and compete with a peaceful strategy. 

Overall, I enjoyed Historia. It was a bit of a puzzle to be solved, where the solution is mostly in the playing of cards. I’m not sure it will have a great deal of long-term replay value, particularly because of the simple two-dimensional nature of the tech tree. However, between the nation-specific advisors and the random subset of leaders and wonders available, there is plenty to sink my teeth into for a few plays.

There is a lot to like about historia. The chart is attractive, the map area is interesting. I like how new things get unlocked as you climb. I love the mechanism of how players all play their actions face down and then simultaneously reveal. Where this game sadly falls short is the endgame payoff. When you cap at the top of the chart, the game simply says, ok, next time you gain more you get 2 points. The game also doesn't do much to reward diversity. You either max out military and get certain benefits, or max out technology and get certain other benefits. Being in the middle seems unrewarding. The game also rewards VP for players who control areas on the map by themselves. Any player can drop a cube in there pretty easily to deny you the points, but you can only remove them if you have more military. If the two players in question are both capped at the top of the military chart, well, there's no recourse. Then, each age you get a leader card who gives you extra VP for meeting one or both of two requirements. Often times those requirements would not be possible to complete given what you had chosen to focus on previously, and often those choices were based on the leader you got in the previous round. The whole thing was riveting for the first three quarters of the game. Then, as the game came to a close, turn time expanded as the players who managed to grab the wonder cards took a long time resolving their effects, and then the game just ended without a sense of buildup or excitement.

A decent civilization game. 
Several things to like: How the actions are card plays, that have limited recycle capabilities, a bit of brinkmanship to play the Revolution card which recycles for everyone. The which card to play/recycle and the civ-progress matrix is the essence of the game. Having the cubes double for actions to take and board position is a nice trade off. The civbot dummy players seem to work reasonably well when you have less than a full load of players. However, a full complement is players is more interesting. 

Some things to dislike: The cards and scoring seem weighted to military and given you position some cards are worthless. It looks to be much harder to go with technology. 
The Wonders seem to have a wide range of value - which may be ok as a catch up mechanism and reason to hold back on scoring early. I'm still not convinced on them. 

All in all the game needed some more work. The events and some of the scoring expansions are needed to provide some variability to the board.

What soured our gaming experience was that we played with the event cards (highly not recommended). We played with two barbarian/bot players, which was interesting.

I look for two things in a game - interaction (between players, and with the game system), and meaningful decisions.  Historia, had it weighed in at 90 minutes, might have stuck around.  But as a 2.5 hour game I felt that it was lacking, so I traded it away.  It might deserve a 7/10, but at best it's only a "pretty good" game, it's not a great one.  I want to spend my time - and give space on my shelves - to great games, not pretty good ones.  I have LOTS of pretty good games that just take up space.  


The playing time is a bit of an issue for me.  Anything over 2 hours has to be pretty special. Maybe with more plays we could get it down to 2 hours, but Historia is not a short game (I saw one group of friends take 6 hours for their first game.  Ouch; I would have quit after 4).

I'm unconvinced about almost every aspect of the game. The map is too small (in terms of fiddliness; it represents the "right" amount of the world, but it's physically tight when there are a couple of cubes and the VP chit on, say, Central America.  

And the pieces on the tech chart too large. The tech chart seems MUCH more easily progressed along in one axis (military) than the other (science). Yet players are far better off having a large military - if you have lots of science points and not enough military ones, you can effectively IGNORE three of the action cards in your hand - they're useless to you.  You can quickly get to the point where - until Tourism opens up - a science approach will limit you to choosing from just 5 cards.

The player who gets to the top of the military tree first often ends up being unstoppable. As in, completely uncatchable, unraidable, undefeatable.  SO a big minus in the player interaction column too.

Era 1 almost felt bland and scripted; there was only so much that could be done, and only so much to do. Everyone does the same sort of things. It opens up some more in Era 2, but only in Era 3 do different approaches really emerge strongly. By which time players have so many options on their turns that things can start to drag.  SO Era 1 doesn't have enough meaningful decisions; Era 3 has too many!  I kind of wonder what the point to Era 1 is - the game might have been better with a (perhaps random) setup phase which allows the game to get going properly straight away.

The game also becomes quite fiddly, in terms of micromanaging your Wonders to get the best out of them; once a player has 5 or 6 wonders, and the ability to play 2 action cards a turn, things get quite slow.

BTW, the rulebook and player aid cards are 50% of a good job. But they could have been so much better for a game that plays quite a bit differently to most other games, and which relies on icons the meaning of which isn't always clear - for example, "use a cube" and "destroy a cube" are very similar in appearance (as are "use a Wonder" and "destroy a Wonder"), but FUNDAMENTALLY different in effect; in my first game I thought that my icons meant the former; when it dawned that they actually meant the latter it completely screwed my end of game scoring.  Then there are things printed on the board in red versus black (with little rhyme or reason as to the difference; red="instant", black="permanent effect" would have made MUCH more sense) and the science effects of "get a new action" versus "get a better version of an action you already have" ought to have been MUCH clearer. 

Overall, I find myself interested in the game, but equally find that the game isn't interesting enough to make me want to own it anymore.  SO before most KS backers have received their copies I've already traded mine away.

(addendum) I played it again, fearful that selling my copy might have been a terrible mistake.  It wasn't; the only terrible mistake was agreeing to play Historia again.  Once again, it felt like there were few decisions, that I was railroaded into making choices between certain paths rather than holding my own destiny in my hands, with some pretty sodding arbitrary effects of other players' actions having a huge negative impact on my own position (and score).  I hated it so much I've reduced my rating for Historia from 7 to 6 as a result!

This isn't the perfect Civ game, but it is one of the better ones. Deceptively simple. Rewards clever card play. It pays to balance warfare, tech, and wonder cards. Which is best at any given point in time greatly depends on your position relative to the other players. More interraction here than it seems, and not just on the military section of the board, which is pleasantly not-so-confrontational.

This is a difficult game for me to assess.  One the one hand, I'm not a big fan of dummy players, and, at lower player counts it seems essential to use the civbots to tighten up the board and provide some competition (admittedly, the civbots in this game are much less clunky than most games with dummy players), but, on the other hand, playing the game with 6 human players makes the game way too long.  

Nevertheless, there are so many interesting ideas in this game.  The development matrix is unique, I like the tension between using cubes to expand on board and needing them for actions, and the game of chicken that results from the possibility that someone will play a revolution card.  Some less desirable aspects include the events, which increase the possibility that someone will declare an early revolution that could upset your long-terms plans for a particular turn, making the game a little less strategic.  I'm also not a fan of the Wonders, particularly how you really need to acquire so many of them and then track the small benefits that each provides ("one point here, one point there") on 10+ Wonders (or more) by the end of the game.  It was also frustrating that, in the six player game, it was difficult to make up ground if you got behind.  This led to an end-game that was pretty anti-climactic.  I'm keeping it in my collection for the time being because I like so many of the ideas in it, I'm just not sure that it all comes together as well as I want it to.

Dec. 2014: This week I played both Historia and Patchistory for the first time.  Both games took around 3 hours (5-player Historia and 3-player Patchistory).  Both are civ that are suppose to grow/evolve.  My quick thoughts:
1) I like Historia's card play more than Patchistory's auction.
2) I like I like Patchistory's spacial patching more than Historia's world map with regions to be controlled.
3) I like Historia's visual representation of how your civ is growing war/scientific.
4) Most of all, I loved how you start small with Historia by only playing one card at a time and only having 4 cubes.  Then as time passes you get more cards to play and more cubes to use.
5) If I had to pick just one game, it'd be Historia.

I backed this on Giochistarter (not KS as that was vastly more expensive), having read the rules and thinking this sounded like a good "civ-lite" game with pretty streamlined mechanics and a very interesting card-driven system.

I've played the game 3 times since it arrived - and I enjoy it and don't regret buying it. But I have found it less engaging than I expected - and it wasn't exactly a big hit with my gaming groups (although certainly not generally hated either). It's definitely a good game that I'd usually be happy to play, but I am no longer excited by it.

RATING: 5.4
(+) A lot of 'structure' for a civilization game. Easy to explain and easy to learn.

(+) Occasionaly, some theming does shine through (like when a player changes gouvernment, another continent gets discovered after navigation gets developed or a technological development changes gameplay in another meaningful way (like the development of the wheel speeding the game up))


(-) The game lacks a 'soul': it is too abstract to feel like a typical 'civilization game', but the mechanics are not interesting enough to make it feel like a clever 'abstract game'.

(-) When playing with multiple players conditions in which you have to be first (most military, most technology, most wonders ...) are nearly impossible to achieve constantly, which makes a lot of wonders less than interesting. Also in such games, revolutions tend to be played each turn in the final third of the game.

(-) Due to the 'table' mechanic and the way action cards are designed, not a lot of playing styles develop during a game. You can expect some players to try to build up their military and dominate the world map (probably assisted by navigation technology) and others to focus on technology and wonders. The tech tree is painfully linear in this civilization game.

(-) The world map is small and unclear. The game board itself is rather small for a 6 player game. I'm not really fond of the grapics on the action cards: the logo's are small and the colors all similar so that it is not possible to get a quick overview of all the actions your opponents are playing

(-) The game is rather repetitive, especially in the beginning

(-) The mechanic in which leader cards give you - hard to obtain - objectives in order to score points at the end of the era is rather lame. There is little control over which kind of objective you might get and it is pretty luck-dependant whether your goals will fit your game or not. Maybe it is better to use the advanced rules in which the objectives are fixed from the start of the game.

(-) Quite some downtime when selecting action cards. Players on the rear of the turn order have a rather hard time trying to figure out what others might be playing (working through small or unclear iconography on upside-down cards in front of their opponents on the other side of the table) while players who are in front can quickly make more (too?) obvious choices.

All in all, I would really like to like this game, but I don't. If I want to play an abstract civilization game, I would much prefer to go for 'Through the Ages', which is a cleverly designed game with much more interesting mechanics.

Much of the production is very nice, but overall I suspect that this game may actually be bad. It felt bland to play, it looked like certain strategies were inherently stronger than others, and the race to victory doesn't seem to hold surprises. Is it the mythical goal of a "1 to 2 hour civ game" that dominated design here? For a less-intense-civ-than-TTA I'd have to say Nations every time over this.

Civilization on a spreadsheet - both a positive and negative selling point, but ultimately I haven't backed it because I'm not keen on being played for Kickstarter/Spieleschmiede earlybird offers, exclusives, expansions and pack levels. My loss I guess because I won't buy it retail either due to the missing crowd funding exclusives.

There are a lot of cool ideas in Historia, but I'm skeptical at this point. The game felt too long and repetitive for what I got out of it, and I don't see as much room for variability as I would like. I like games that give me interesting tactical puzzles and where I can't do everything that I want to do so that I have to make hard decisions. In Historia I felt like I could pretty much do everything I wanted to do, although I can see it being a bit more limiting with enough players if they play revolution aggressively enough.

Really good Civ game. More abstract than most and for those who fear that Civ games are like running a spreadsheet - this IS a spreadsheet! The player faces very interesting decisions, balancing choices between military strength, territorial gains, scientific advances, or manipulating Wonders. Most paths to victory seem reasonably balanced, and some players will be pleased that Military is not an overwhelming concern, so a player who ignores it, has every chance of winning. The use of Bots to enable solo play, or provide variety to multiplayer games, is really well done - the bots are quick and simple to operate. Well pleased with the purchase - fine game.

Quite unimpressed by this. It seems pretty long for what it is; if I'm going to play a good civilization game, give me Through the Ages any day. This took much longer than its 90 minute box time with 4, and while I do like that there is some area control with the board, it turns out that this also leads to a frustrating tit-for-tat with military strength. It's a must-have to choose your advisors, as some are clearly more helpful than others. I just felt like the various pieces should come together better than they did; it seems like ultimately this boils down to a race for technology and military and once someone has a bit of the upper hand, it's hard to overcome them.

1 play, 5er + 1 bot

This seems as if it could be a pretty cool civ game! It is abstracted, but there definitely is a geographical element here, there's a tech track, types of government, all driven by a action selection mechanism sort of like Rococo, Concordia, and Lewis & Clark -- except without a deck-building element. And it's all quite different from TTA, my favorite of the genre. A definite must-try-again, although maybe just with 4 (unless everyone is experienced), and try going without military this time? Or the advanced game, where you do more pre-planning at the start of game.

---------
3 solo games -- 5 civbots of varying strengths, different advisors each time:
1. 1 king, 2 nobles, 2 chieftains: easy win
2. 2 kings, 3 nobles: 2nd place, 10pts behind king winner
3. 5 kings: quick loss by elimination

Too difficult with all kings. The bots can eliminate one another at the beginning, but not as reliable with kings since their military strength grows so quickly. Probably best something set up like the 2nd game? However, I don't see how you can take any path other than ramping up your military as quickly as possible. In a game where you CAN be eliminated, you have to at least maintain parity. Which makes the solo game even less interesting than solo games usually are! However, I'll likely try at least once more ...

----
1 more solo -- 2 kings, 3 nobles:
Pretty easy win. You just have to get some of the civs to kill each other off, and push military HARD. A bit of luck, in keeping the bots' strength down, certainly helps! Definitely not a very interesting play, though. I expect the leaders and events would make things a bit more interesting. Along with other players, of course (I'm not really a solo gamer)!

If I were to use two words to describe this game to people it would be "spreadsheet civilization".  Which is a shame because those two words are going to immediately put a lot of people off because for some that sounds really dull.

In this game every player starts with the same set of action cards and number of cubes.  These cubes represent the sum of all your abstracted ability and resources.  Each player also has their own personal advisor deck that they get to draw cards from at certain technology thresholds and provide one-time improved actions as well as a leader card which represents goals that will give bonus points at the end of that age.

The game is played via simultaneous action selection.  Each player selects a card from their hand of unused ones and plays it to the table, when all have played they are revealed simultaneously and resolved in turn order.  Most of these cards require cubes (those universal resources) to resolve going to a used pool.  This is where the civilization matrix comes in and why I call it a spreadsheet civilization game.  The majority of the board is taken up by this large 16x16 grid (with some gaps along the edges).  The X-axis represents the technology level of your civilization and the Y-axis represents the military level.  Two of your cards increase you along these axis', when you get to certain levels on the technology track you can play more cards each turn, get new advisors, and use improved versions of your action cards.  Increasing in military allows you the ability to raid and go to war with neighbors on the small world map giving you points and claiming new territory for yourself.

There are also action cards that buy you new wonders for once-per-round bonuses, retrieve used cubes, and the most interesting one the Revolution card.  When one or more players play a Revolution card the round will end after everyone takes their turn.  Normally you only get your two oldest cards back, this card management makes for a lot of really interesting decisions in the game as you want to do actions in particular order, especially for things that are limited like the wonders, but also want to set yourself up with the proper cards the following turn.  The Revolution card however also reclaims itself and one other card of your choice.  So playing this card is almost like a game of chicken because having back any of your cards that you like is a very powerful ability.

I really enjoyed this game.  The mechanics managed to abstract the building of a civilization with the universal power cubes and civilization matrix while still keeping everything feeling reasonably thematic and not dry.  There are a TON of decisions to make at every point in the game with all you have the ability to do and there is a decent amount of interaction without being too mean.  You can raid a neighbor for points but it doesn't hurt them at all and even if you go to war, you can remove a cube of theirs from the map, but you can't remove the last one so there is no player elimination.

There are a few problems with the game as well though.  First of all, the rulebook is not very good and we had a lot of issues with poorly described rules.  The main one being that nowhere did it tell us which symbol Navigation was.  All of the technology levels are depicted with symbols.  A lot of them are self-explanatory and most of them don't matter because what you get at that level is also depicted with symbols (described on a player reference sheet) underneath.  However one rule is that when you hit the technology level for Navigation all spaces on the world map are considered adjacent for actions.  Well, nowhere does it say Navigation on the board and the symbol is not shown in the rulebook where this rule is mentioned.  Looking at the board technology level 11 is a compass...that must be navigation right?  Compasses are used by navigators to chart and measure voyages.  No, Navigation was level 8, the picture of the boat.  So a large portion of the game was hurt by players not being able to cross the map until 3 technology levels later than normal.  This was especially hard for the player who started in the western hemisphere when the other 3 started in the connected other 4 continents.

That isn't it either, everything is depicted with symbols in this game and many of them or specific rules interactions are not properly defined or described so we had to use our best judgement for a lot of it and after our Navigation example, we have no way of knowing if our best judgement was correct.  I also think the board could have done with being about 25% bigger, especially the world map section.  Everything was very small and hard to see or read, especially managing cubes for 4 players on a really tiny map once people started to expand and needed to see which areas shared a border.  I also get that they were going for this particular style but the dingy colors of everything really don't grab me in games.  They want it to look stylishly old but I think they just look...bad old.

However the game is good enough to get over and look past these quibbles.  There are even in-the-box ways to mix up the game a little bit with expert drafting rules for setup and an event card variant that has nasty events show up throughout the game.  Very good product.

The idea of creating a simple Civ game with not much more than about 10 cards per player plus a few Wonders and goals, is a good concept. It's a card game in which players decide when to score, although with some restrictions. 
I've got the impression that there are more advantages in getting bigger military investments than science ones, which probably isn't true as I played the game only once. My premiss is based on the fact that players cannot be overtaken from the board if they have a bigger military force than the opponents, and the amount of points received by the players for occupying the world regions is certainly among the most relevant part of the VP's total. The transitions in VP's that may result from this action may be 8 VP's between 2 players, which is more than enough and justifies extra attention.

The leaders coming out randomly may also unbalance the game a bit.

I would also prefer a different vicinity rule, something that would transfer more control to the players being attacked by the means of occupying the space, more than simply being adjacent to each region in the world by having navigation technology. Although thematic it turns the game a bit more unpredictable bringing more chaos.

Historia is a hand-management card game that ships with a huge board used primarily to record player progress along two tracks, science and military. Improving military power allows the use of angry actions on the tiny map, such as war (remove a weaker opponent's cube from a territory you share, gaining victory points); science provides additional actions and unlocks new ones.

Players simultaneously choose action cards, which are added to their queue after resolution, then recovered first-in-first-out based on various conditions. 

Generally speaking, the game's interaction comes from second-guessing other players' timings; if you select war and another player has bumped their military, it will fail. And, critically, you need to manoeuvre for position at the end of the phase, which is triggered by any player's "Revolution" card. 

I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. It's very much a low-interaction spreadsheet game of incremental efficiencies, with the second-guessing of other players being far less prevalent than I had hoped. Admittedly, this varies significantly by player, depending on strategy and relative position on the tracks. The only timing that is always important is the deliciously tense expectation of an imminent revolution.

There are elements I'm not at all convinced by, such as the advisors (some combination of random, unbalanced and unnecessary) and the wonders. In practice, the late game seems to degenerate into less of a hand-management game than a wonder-engine game, particularly as so many age 3 leaders have scoring conditions based on those wonders.

The leaders themselves force heterogeneous strategies, but also very much constrain emergent behaviour. The various crowdfunding expansions all just complicate the efficiency puzzle in various ways and can be added to increase the game weight, at the cost of providing even more game- and not player-driven incentives.

Like most of the heavy Giochix games, I've found it worse than hoped for but better than feared. Even if it could use a little more development, it's an excellent entry in the "tedious spreadsheet game" genre. Happy to play.

I had to choose between this and Nations. Not disappointed by my decision. Quite the civ experience. There's technology to choose from, military and area control decisions, and much to consider with multiple strategies to winning.

A game I really enjoyed in that you had a fistful of actions but really had two tracks either science of Military,  the piece looks like it had a stock market for the tech tree,  I really liked that each move on the science row produced different effects.  I want this one eventually.

Update:  Played again a second time......  Military was much more powerful than science and wonders.  the wonder track takes to long to get fully going.  The military track takes off early and can get a lot of vp's off the map .....  be careful of going to north by yourself as three of your actions cannot be used until later in the game.

Very interesting and fun game. My only concern is that the tech track, the core focus of the game, doesn't create enough variety in itself to give special powers (like those found in the wonders) to make replays without expansions interesting enough. The wonders, leaders, and advisors should give enough to differentiate player abilities but I just wish some of that special ability was tied into the tech tree or something like expanding on the map. Like maybe if the leaders had permanent abilities instead of one time things it would be even better. Outside of that though I thoroughly enjoyed it.

My first game left me not only good feedback. In three player the game was quick with different strategy by each player. The techtree which drive players through military and technology path is nice, but I fear it would became a bit dry soon. It is a clever idea the way to represent it. I will try to play it in 5 or 6 and catch main differences. Use of icons is massive over cards but worth. The games seems too abstract for my taste, for example you can see Elvis togheter with Nerone.
Second game was in four players and I prefered for the interaction. The game still its abstract nature, btw I like it.

tl;dr: insteresting puzzle

This was being hailed as a civ game with a decent playing time. It's not. It's a technology development game with a minor map of the world element. But I don't care, a good game is a good game. And this one certainly isn't bad.
You can evolve on the tech tree in both military and science direction. Most players will do a mix, but you can't max both. Maybe you can, but I have no idea of how you could pull that off. So you will have to focus on the one or the other.
Actions are played with action cards which improve depending on your position on the tech tracks. But most of all you need to manage the order in which you play them as that also influences the order in which you get them back. And that is the heart of the game: managing your action cards properly. And timing them so that the end of each age works for you. If you're not properly prepared for that, it can seriously screw with your plans and hurt your score.
I quite enjoy this game, but I don't love it. The action management bit is a fun and interesting puzzle, and I like the fact that you can ignore the map part.

Although there is a fair amount of iconography, after a few turns it is very easy to understand and the game flows very fast. There is almost no downtime between each player. The game also seems to be reasonably forgiving in that the moves you make in the first couple of turns don't make or break your chances of winning - there are many variables that influence the game and just the right amount of randomness in your advisor draw pile to make sure repeated play remains interesting.

The last time I was crushed by the bots in the hardest difficulty, great bot implementation by the way, very simple. I will play it a few more times and will try it multiplayer before a final verdict (will let it sleep for a few months to not burn it), but at first glance It doesn't look very special and the biggest flaw is that "it doesn't tell a story" which is a minus for a solo game. I like the mechanics though, and would like to see them in a more interesting game.

Hmmm... I'm ambivalent about this one after a single play.

I really like the player race up the grid with military on the y-axis and technology on the x-axis; it's novel and elegant.  I also like the hand management element, and I like that there's a geographic component (even though combat is a little half-baked).  The rules are also pretty easy to learn, despite the intimidating board and iconography.

But I REALLY didn't care for the wonders.  They're fiddly, they're unthematic, they take up a lot of space, they're easy to forget, they're devoid of player interaction, and they make the game needlessly longer and more complicated.

Oh, and what a bizarre scoring track that maxes out at 133!  That struck me as an odd oversight on the publisher's part that it wasn't a round number like 100.  It didn't affect my opinion of the game or anything, it's just... I'd never seen a scoring track that randomly comes to an end like that before.

This game is the best Civilization game !

Compare to Trough the ages : Historia is faster, with less abstration, or a different abstraction, world map contribute to it. Action cards offer an immense immersion impression (3 x i). And above all, it is played in 2 hours, so could be replayed again and again.

Compare to Nations : as Nations is a 'easy to play' copy of Through the ages, all that have been said before remain similar with better comparaison.

Compare to CIV (Avallon Hill) : with the respect due to ancients, Historia is better, due to global civilization game (not only antique world) and play time. (But, I loved the ancestor).

Compare to Sid Meier Civilization : it is a good game but a copy of computer alias. So why play this game ? So, Go to historia.

Compare to clash of cultures : as for nations, it is a copy of Sid Meier Civilization, and a bad copy. Pass your way...

Compare to others : lots, but it is above all.

Great civilization game with some fresh mechanics involving a civilization matrix and card management. Yes it is abstract, but it is quite thematic.

Definetly you need to try this one.

Historia is an abstract civilization game. Each player has a deck of action card, which can only be recovered via a few mechanisms, and the game mostly consists of moving your civilization marker across a grid which marks your civilization's progress in military (vertical axis) and technology/science (horizontal access). There is a world map, but you might overlook it on first glance as it occupies about 1/10th of the board.

On your turn, you play cards that improve your military strength, tech/science strength, put you on the map, trade with neighbors for tech, raid neighbors, or go to war with neighbors, get cards back, build wonders, or get points. Wonders give you free actions or bonuses, but may only trigger when certain actions happen or if you are first in tech or military. Each player has a personal deck of advisers and every round you get to pick a new leader who gives you goals for the round.

I can see that a lot of people may not care for the abstract nature of the game, but I found it to be a lot of fun.

A different take on Civ games because it focuses more on the mechanics of tech advancement than on expansion on the world map. You take actions from a limited pool of cards, and sometimes you can't retrieve all of your cards at the end of a turn, which limits what you can do later, so hand management and order of play are important. 
I've wanted to play it for a long time and finally got the chance. I'd say it's interesting and definitely worth playing for Civ addicts but it doesn't quite capture the experience I personally am looking for. I'd certainly play it again, though.

Historia is a great medium weight civ game. It's one of the few good civ games to tackle area control, and it does so in a way that still places the focus on improving your society. 

One of the more innovative mechanics is their use of a matrix where the y-axis is your military strength, and the your x-axis is your scientific knowledge. Advancing militarily allows you to more easily take territory, while advancing in science allows better usage of your action cards. 

You also have leaders and advisors, and most of the game is trying to figure out the most efficient way to play your cards or the best way to string up your actions.

There are a couple variants within the box which is always fun as well, including real world events that affect the game. A history buff will enjoy the plethora of wonders, leaders, advisors and events  that are all grounded in reality.

Played it with 3 players. I don't really like civilization games so this rating should not be taken too seriously :)
On your turn you simultaneously choose an action to play (get resources, get a monument, go to war, etc...). On the fourth round, the revolution card can be played to "end" the round.
You have many possibilities on your turn, so there are a lot of interesting decisions to make, although at some point, it becomes a bit dull since you mostly do the same on your turn.
Anyway I see a lot of winning strategies in this game so the replayability is certainly given, maybe I will give it another shot sometimes.

It's soooo long at 6 players. So long some players just shorten the play with revolutions ...

Heavy/long civ-game with a card mechanic, lots of rules, phases, but not much excitement for me...

[+] "tech tree" with military/science grid is a good idea, but for a 3rd of the game, there's not much differenciation between players
[-] bland components & artwork, theme does not shine, hard to teach, long game, just too convoluted for what it brings

Back-to-the-basics abstracted civilization game. Not the best of its kind, but certainly interesting to play.

Great game! It's simple enough to not require a lot of boardgames experience, yet it's complex enough to not feel trivial.

Civilization game. Manipulating your action card queue is important.

The giant spreadsheet looking board actually does a pretty good job of abstracting the tech/development race that is central to all games of this type. That being said, what it doesn't do is provide any details at all about how tthe technological gains are actually affecting the civilization. Every advance is just a point more of this or that. The hand management, which makes up the other half of the game is sort of interesting, but again the abstractions make it hard to identify with the civilizations in any meaningful way.

The game also goes on way too long. I know it is trying to span all of recorded human history, but the small hand of cards to manage and generic tech bonuses just aren't enough to carry a game of this scope.

So close to being a decent game. Love the abstraction in it, but that is also why it is just that little bit dull. The whole central progress chart needs to be more dynamic to stop it getting stale quickly.

The area control part of this game is one of the dumbest I've ever seen, and the rest of the game has some minor problems too, like way too strong catch-up. I really don't like it when purposfully staying behind is the optimal move. I want to do things and score points in my euros, let me do that! This is just a lazy way to balance the game.

Dryer than a popcorn fart?  Possibly for popcorn farters, but more of a gentle breeze for number crunchers.  Build your civ softly but carry a big army (stick).

The latest civ builder.  It started off promising but faded in the second half.

A couple of issues:  (1) lack of diversity of viable strategies, (2) long play time, (3) ramp up of actions gets too carried away in second half of game.

Somewhat similar in spirit to the recent Imperial Settlers, but far less engaging.

was ok for the first 2 ages, then it got silly. I feel wonders should be something exceptional; but in this game, you (in my game, 2 players out of 5) pile up lots of wonders (no matter what they do, just to increase the count). Then you score them with improved tourism, tap wonders to get the wonder-buying and wonder-scoring cards back into the hand, and play them again. Just plain silly for a civilization building game.

Oh look, a brand new game and already 3 expansions? Call me out. My desire to play it again just dropped another level.

From the dawn of human history, our tribes begin as caveman with nothing more than fire as we advance and discover our way to the age of singularity(ack pfft!). Select a leader, select a starting region and then we advance our way up the periodical table of discovery. Players choose Concordia style actions simultaneously to advance, build wonders, war, expand and such as long as their power cubes last until a civilization pushes for revolution. Some civs might choose to dominate with military, some may try to  survive peacefully with science and culture, others may choose a balance. The more you expand area control with your power cubes the less you have to advance your civilization--such a cool balancer. Smaller player groups will contend with AI civ robots of varying degrees of difficulty that is a very cool adjustment to make things very interesting. The board does a wonderful job at managing all the aspects of the game. 12,000 years in 90 minutes! Meesa likey.

Historia falls into the Concordia and Get Bit! family of games, in which players play cards to do stuff, and then eventually get their cards back to do the same stuff again.  Though your stuff-a-bility gets upgraded in this one once you reach a certain tech level.

I will eventually feel rage for having wasted time playing this game, but for now I'll have to settle for disappointed melancholy.

A very interesting take on the classic civ game. Low harmful interaction, good balance between warfare and science and a intruiging tech tree, a surprisingly good game.

Elegant, but dry. Manipulating turn order very important.  Like the art on the cards, but the board is a bit lacking. Get that it is a game about developing your tech, but I feel the mechanics with the world map could have been more involved, or left out.

Neat after first play, but there are questions on the variety of viable strategies and turn order staticness. More plays will tell...

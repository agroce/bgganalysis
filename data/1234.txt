Been playing this a lot. Some sessions have been hilarious, others dull and slightly awkward. Very dependent on the crowd. Uptight, serious people are usually not ideal, while someone prone to start rule quarrels can completely kill the fun for everyone. But when it works, it is excellent fun.

I've only played this one a couple times so far.  I think it needs a distinctly non-competitive group to play with, one more interested in building stories than "winning" the game.  Probably best with 8-12 year olds.

RATING: 6
Lots of fast thinking and non-stop chatter to get through the game!  Think I'd enjoy it more if we played by "house rules" and had more than 2 players since it is afterall a party type game.

This is another innovative little game that takes the right group of people and some heavy rules enforcement. I see a lot of love it/hate it reviews. The group I played with started making nonsense verse too much... the other players need to be fair, but also be willing to say 'enough is enough' with the absurd story lines. This games take a lot of on the fly creativity to be good at.

I love playing this game so much!  But I am a storyteller and can brazen through the most bizarre combinations.  I like how the game makes you fit your story to that which you have in your hands.  Of course, there are people who hate this game, who can't create stories out of air at a moments notice, and so I tend to play this once with most people and never again... which is sad, since I love it so much.  Maybe I should try with people who don't know me...

I found that I can play this with my friends at work!  Huzzah!  I have a group that will play this with me who aren't intimidated!

It was fun the first few times we played, but gets boring after several replays.  Easily manipulated rules if you are playing with highly competitive opponents that are more interested in winning than enjoying building a story.

RATING: 6
To have a good time you need people to be able to talk for a decent amount of time, yet also be willing to let the next person go. To win the game you need to interrupt people as much as possible and not let anyone else get a word in edgewise. A group who can navigate this dichotomy and play for the journey will find it worth their while.

With the right group this storytelling game is great fun as you try and steal the lead from each other by spotting your opponent dropping in one of your card features.

With the wrong group it's a complete disaster.

BGG на 65% не рекомендует играть вдвоём, но при правильном подходе, по-моему, можно. главное, как и в правилах написано, делать упор не на соревновательность, а на красивую историю. 

самое забавное - когда вскрывается карта финала, и выясняется, зачем автор залез-то собственно в эти дебри

My only real complaint about the game is the rule book: it is pointlessly wordy, and could easily have been reduced to two pages.

RATING: 8
A fun game of telling storys. Perfect when you and your friends have had a few beers to losen the tounge. The idea is to tell a fairy tale from beginning to the end. You get cards with words that are connected to the land of fairy tales. Use them to tell a story, but if you start repeating yourself, going against the told story or just stumbles on the words, the word goes to your neighbour. 

Perfect ending of a good game night.

Nice game where you try to make a fairy tale out of your cards. A party game that's so much better than Taboo (which I hate very much). A bit of fiddly rules but I guess it doesn't matter that much for that type of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
It works fine, for what it is. But on the story front, the cards tend to push people towards introducing tangents to the main plotline, and then they forget what the story was to that point, so it creates rather stream-of-consciousness tales. That already happens easily enough if you do a round-robin storytelling activity, without exacerbating it. So I'd rather just do it without the cards.

On the game front, it's not much of a game. You're too busy trying to listen for a key word to pop up that lots of people zone out as to what the story actually is, or you're too busy telling the tale, to really care about winning. (And it's not the sort of game where winning is really a consideration.) So, the "game" aspect doesn't really add anything to the experience. Or, if anything, it takes from it by distracting the players from the story.

So I'd suggest a straightforward round-robin storytelling activity over this. Or, if you want a game, playing Fiasco or Kingdom, or one of those types of storytelling games.

This game was almost ruined for me but one of my best friends. He just said random crap he could think of to play down his cards and win. Fortunately my wife and I were taking it a bit more seriously and weaved a pretty decent yarn. Definitely better than I was expecting it to be, though I find myself wishing the game could be made for different genres than just high fantasy.

I really want to like this game, but we are having a hard time trying to figure out exactly how to play. Maybe we just need more imaginative people to play with. I thought the stories would be easier to tell than they are, but I guess it just comes with practice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is a design gem of a game the success of which depends almost entirely on whom you decide to play with. Once Upon a Time NEEDS a group of imaginative storytellers who can stay focussed to succeed. If you have this, the open-ended play is fun and challenging. The option isn't really to win. It's to engage in creative storytelling using the materials in hand; literally the cards you've been dealt or have drawn. Success is the ability to stay on theme and topic. The game dies if there are players whose heads and attitudes are not really into making the game work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I love this game, but it takes the right people to play it.  It's not really meant to be a competitive game.  It's light, fluffy and funny.  We had one story which focused on flying fire-breathing man-eating sheep that could talk.  Quite a funny protagonist.

Surprisingly fun game.  When I heard "Storytelling game", I immediately thought "Oh no, please don't let this be like Tales of Arabian Night".  Luckily it is a short, compact game where it is players go back and forth trying to guide the story in their direction and try to get to the "Happy Ending". 

There is actually a decent amount of strategy, but the fun really is about making wacky stories and trying to piece together some semblance of cohesiveness with your cards.

The only issue I see is that the the Happy Endings can be vastly different and it gets people to twist the stories in completely different directions.  Although this would add to the zaniness and randomness of the story, I read a few reviews and came across an interesting variant where there is a single happy ending in the middle and everyone has to work towards that ending.

Story telling game. Tell a storu based on the cards in your hand. For each item/character/place/happening on a card you mention you get to discard that card. The first to get rid of all cards wins. Just make sure that you don't loose track while talking or you will have to draw new cards.

You have to have a good imagination to play this game, because otherwise it'll go very quickly and the game could be over in under 2 minutes or it'll drag on and people will lose interest. Go into it with a very open mind and a group of outgoing friends and it will for sure be a hit.

i got this for free.  i knew what it was about, and kinda expected to play it once and then give it away.  my lone play is with my fiancee, so a 2 player game.  we were going at it more like a collaboration than a competition.  it really shook a few creative cobwebs from both of us.  unnecessary details started to flow as the game went further, and after it was done we both talked about how our minds felt more open.  seems like a magnificent playing and teaching tool for kids.  not something i'd want to play all the time, and not something i'd want to play with many specific people, but it really provided a unique and fun experience.  highly recommended at least once.

The game could be rather good, but you need very special people to play it with. This one dosen't work well with people who are looking forward to win. It's not a party game.

One player with winning in mind can break this "game."  If you want to allow others to have a fair chance of participating, you have to stick closely to a general fantasy fairy tale setting and often drop phrases that you know can be interrupted, else players might never have a chance to participate.
Can become playable if everyone is drunk.

As I like Zombie Cinema/Zombeja!Ovella!, which is a finnish storytelling game about zombies, I though I might like Once upon a time as well, but not really. The stories don't really start to live their own lives, it is more just watching out who uses which words. And the same applies to the Darker Tales version.

This is an OK story-telling game.  I like the way that different players can co-opt the story and try to drive it towards their goal.  It does suffer a bit from vagueness in how players can use the cards in their story.

It could be amazing if everybody agrees to tell the most interesting story possible. It's ruined by having to police anyone going for a (cheap) win. Ridiculous box. A great resource for teachers.

(KIDS) I'm not sure how this works as a competitive game, but my 4 and 6 year old daughters and I have used the cards to cooperatively tell a complete story.  They absolutely love this exercise and this has already been requested again.  We do not use the "happy ever after" cards because the 4 year old is not yet able to read them.  A lot of fun for creative little minds.

EMOTICON REVIEW: :)

I love storyteling games.It is nice and relaxed for 2 players.

21,Sept.08
Recently I played in a group of 4 and it was not so good as I was expecting.I think the problem was that we were forcing ourselves to narrate any kind of crappy story when we should pass on our turn.We all agreed on that and next time we will approach it in a more relaxed attitude.The shy players will definitely have a problem expressing themselves.I also realized that it is not a game for competitive people because the level of interaction between the players is so high it would almost certainly lead to arguments.

If everyone is playing to win, Once Upon a Time will get awful, fast. If everyone decides to forgo the competitive element and cooperate in the creation of a good story, the game can be tons of fun.

Imagination and improvisation are two important traits to employ to enjoy this game and the stories that come out. So the fun-rate depends more on the players than on the game.

I love the idea of telling a story with cards, but the actual game play tends to break down.  I've instituted the house rule that you can draw more cards when you like, because too often a person is left with few cards and no real chance of getting back in the story.

A friend introducd us to Aye, Dark Overlord, which we thought was very fun. When I realised that this is the inspiration for ADO, I had to get this, as I think more of family and friends will enjoy the theme.

Unfortunately, I've yet to actually play it, as there's always so many new games I want to try, and this gets put at the back of the line. I really ought to do something about this.

This game varies a lot based on who you play with. People in it to win won't have too hard a time winning, without bringing any fun to the game. If you look at it more like a story that has to have some amount of time spent on each card, then the game becomes significantly more fun.

Fun filler for the creative minded.  However, it almost needs to be played not-so-competitively in order for it to be much fun.  If players are too focused on getting rid of their cards, the stories can just get stupid, with people nullifying parts of the story that someone before them had set up.  Fun game if you can get a group together that can keep the main elements of the story together though.

This one is storytelling game when you try to get rid of the differnt types cards (person, event, ending) by using them in the story told by the players, but playing and winning conditions are not clear enough - other players can decide if you did it properly. i don't like that about this game, but from the other hand it would be difficult to do it another way.

I love telling a good story.  The problem is a good story has direction and focus, building to an exciting or interesting climax.  When you put the story in the hands of several people all going in different directions, you get insanity.  And not the good kind.  The obnoxious kind.  I think, played in the perfect group of patient, creative, literate people this could be an 8, but as it is...

Jan. 26, 2010 -- I'm still not sure what to make of Once Upon A Time. As a roleplayer, it seems like the type of game I should really enjoy, but I actually found it very difficult to wrap my brain around the core concepts. Perhaps it's a little too open in the storytelling. Tentative rating of 5/10.

With the right group this can be a really fun game. You need people outgoing enough to pipe up and give an interesting story. Can be really enjoyable with some interesting creations. Needs about 4-5 to be really fun. They all need to be outgoing though because the quieter ones will end up being spectators.

Our group that likes making things up in Balderdash really loves this game.  The last couple of weeks the girls have been encouraging the guys to sit around and play the game and they will watch.  Not sure if this is because they feel uncreative, or that they just want to laugh at us.

I don't know that I am really creative, but what I feel I bring to the game is a tendency to recap what has gone on in a humorous way (which i actually stole from another player, but I can't imagine not doing it now from time to time), a tendency to elicit more details from other players, and finally a dark side to the stories (I tend to kill off a few characters to get stories back on track, our stories go all over the place.)

Not really a game, but more of a good time.

Okay, this game is all about the downtime.  Huge chunks of the games are just listening to stories.  But if you play with creative people this makes the time a lot of fun.  So my rating is really a result of my groups.  Don't play this if you don't like telling stories, it isn't really a game.

This seems like it ought to work better than it does.  It absolutely cannot be played as a competitive game, in my opinion, but it can be fun if everyone is mainly in it for the story. It gets a bump up in my rating because the cards are so well done.

This game is HIGHLY dependent on the players playing.  It&#039;s not your typical game.  With the wrong group of people, it wouldn&#039;t be any fun at all.  But with folks willing to open up and be creative and tell a story - it&#039;s very enjoyable - and usually good for a bunch of laughs!

I enjoy the crazy stories you can come up with in this game.  It's easy to play a decent number of people.  I find the cards in this edition more difficult to arrange so I can totally see.  I see they corrected that in the new edition.

RATING: 3
[resident copy] Alas, the notion of "collaboratively tell an interesting, in-genre story" is fiercely at odds with the game's mechanics, which reward keeping an iron grip over narrative control, often by mentioning no genre tropes other than those present in your hand. You can play this game for fun, or you can play it to win, but aiming for one directly interferes with the other.

RATING: 5
Production: Simple artwork; high-quality cards; good selection in the text.  I wish the text could somehow be side-indexed, though, as its tough to quickly rifle through one's hand in search of a card.  Play: I was surprised at how difficult it is to interrupt a story.  I found myself wanting strict rules, but also enjoying the stories that were being created.  I think the game can probably be played at varying levels of flexibility/strictness with the rules, so one's enjoyment could be directly affected by how in synch one is with one's fellow players.

Competitive storytelling, sort of.  You're all telling one story, trying to play cards from your hand and reaching your "end of story" card.  Play cards by mentioning the story element on them when you tell your story, or when someone else mentions the element, which lets you steal control of the story.

It does require some thinking on your feet and plenty of creativity of a different sort than "I can't get longest road...how do I get to 10 points *now*?"

An amazing game for even large groups -- if it's the right group. It can be competitive enough for the boardgamers, but cooperative enough for large groups and parties. Best for improvisers, theatrical types, and roleplayers who like storytelling already. The rules are sufficiently vague to allow a lot of experimentation, but this also makes rules lawyering more likely.

My edition has cards that are very nice with a few design problems: the type of the card (person, place, event, etc.) is very important, but this information is written in tiny cursive writing, and a tiny colored icon which is impossible to see from across the table. You can guess a card's type, but not all of them are obvious. Also, the words on the card are very important, but they're all printed only on the bottom. It's impossible to hold the cards in a reasonable way and be able to read all of them.

This is a great game with the right people. RPG-light! :-)

RATING: 3
The problem with this game is that a very good story teller can guarantee many aspects of a story swing his way, and if you go first, you win.  So house rules are required.  For example, if my ending is "And the blind boy fell down a well, punished."  I BEGIN my story with, "This is a story about a blind boy who, by way of being punished, fell down a well.  Let me tell you how it happened."  And I go through my remaining cards.  Even if someone interrupts me, ALL the players now have to end with MY ending unless by some rather genius play they can change that...  but I'd have ended it well before they get many cards off.

Last thing is the structure of the "Game" doesn't reward REAL storytelling, which places out disparate, apparently unrelated things and weaves them together seamlessly- hence the structure of real novels or deeper stories that reward readers (listeners).  Things have to align too quickly or you get interrupted, and that sort of story is for amateurs.

So as a GAME, this title is extremely weak, though it is novel and can be fun.

I like story-telling, unfortunately it's very difficult to find a group of people who can understand that it's not the winning that counts but the great story which they create. I played this game only once when everybody laughed and simply had fun. It has amazing art and I love that, as well as possibility of creating my own cards. ( What's wrong with putting atomic bomb in story alongside with princesses and spells?)

La idea es muy buena, pero tiene un problema y es que realmente funciona solo en grupos muy determinados...en la mayoría de grupos, desemboca en un cumulo de despropósitos. En cualquier caso siempre te da algún que otro gran momentazo al recordar los cuentos creados y en como deribaron en a saber que cosas.

Con un buen grupo que no busque solo ganar, que tenga ganas de echarle imaginación, ganas de crear buenas historias o en su defecto hilarantes...puede ser todo un punto.

No recomiendo jugar con demasiada gente pues se vuelve demasiado caótico..y las historias pierden gracia e interés.

RATING: 5
This doesn't quite work as a game, which is why I don't rate it higher. If you actually play it to win, it sucks both as a game and a story-telling exercise. If you play it with telling stories in mind, it's fun, but not really a game any more. Also marred (at least in the second edition) by some horrendous graphic design. The cards use hard-to-read scrolly fonts and have the card names at the bottom, making it impossible to fan them out. But, with the right crowd, it can be a fun thing to do.

C'era una volta. Inizio leggermente in attrito quando la parola passa da me ad altri giocatori... un po' d'imbarazzo e fantasia arrugginita. Mi preoccupo, ma nel giro di breve, aiutando i neofiti ad inserirsi usando correttemente le carte si riesce a sbloccare la situazione. E' nata una bella storia, finale di mia sorella che esaltata chiede un altra partita. La seconda fila liscissima e rivince lei. E' piaciuto a tutti, normalmente tornano a casa loro abbastanza presto e invece chiedono una terza partita. Al di la di chi vinca, quando propongo un gioco, indipendentemente da quale sia, se chiedono di rigiocarlo, è sempre una vittoria per me. 
La terza partita la vinco io con un finale azzeccatissimo. Come serata alternativa ci siamo divertiti molto anche se non si è trattato di un vero e proprio gioco "in scatola".

I've bought this to play with my wife and elder daughter (5yo), to stimulate her imagination and the ability to give structure to a tale.
We don't use all the rules, but we are having a lot of fun pulling out the unexpected from the quite common subjects of the cards.
I give it 8 for the idea, 7 for the rather unimaginative card subjects (some effort is needed to divert from well known, common tales); so, 7.5 the arithmetic mean.

Played two games with two gamers for a closer.  We did actually have a lot of fun playing it, especially the second one where we just ignored the fairy tale archetype and made a modern story about a couple graduate students from our college.  Did make it hard to use certain cards though, although it does allow for more creative uses (you could use This Item Can Talk with cell phones for example).

A card-directed version of a classic cooperative storytelling game.  You have to work the contents of your cards ("Princess", "A journey", "Monster") into a story, but other players can interrupt you using their cards and take control of the story.  The point is more to tell a fun story than to worry about who wins.

This can be a damn challenging game with the wrong people. It is a social story-telling activity allowing for dissenting motions by any player base on a loose set of criteria.

Should there be too much focus on debating a player's storytelling decisions, the game could really drag and the fun evaporate.

Card game on Bruno Faidutti's Best Games List.  
Even though I won this 6 out of the 7 plays, I really dislike (hate) this game.  It is just too chaotic to pay attention to & then remember the story line as well as try to figure out when it is okay to interrupt, and to remember what your own cards are, and to try to keep your own potential card connections in your head, and make a decent story on top of it all.  I don't like games of speed & dexterity this is almost what it is.

This is one of the very few adult games I despise.  I Must also say that it is a BIG hit with my gaming crowd.  They love it.  they don't like playing with me because all I do is kill all the previous characters to promote my own, and end the game as quickly as possible.  They say winning is not the point of the game, and I, getting it over with as quickly as possible, is.

I've played this game once. It uses a lot of mental energy, because you have to be able to improvise stories on the spot with very little preparation, and it is time-based. So I'd really need to be in the right sort of mood to play it, and feeling like I was able to do that at the time. So if you're not ready to be on a timed system where you have to make up stories off the top of your head quickly, this is not the game for you.

RATING: 1
Takes a certain mood to play this correctly. And I object to the winning condition - if a good yarn is told, then everyone wins. Doesn't really matter who uses all their cards first, as that's easy to do if you don't really care if what you're saying makes sense or not. *** UPDATE: Okay, okay. It's not a game. It's a tool for interactive storytelling. If it's played as a game, and winning quickly is what the players are focused on, OUaT blows up rather impressively. Nothing to see here if you're looking for a game, carry on. If you're looking for something to help the creatively-challenged tell a story, then look this pack of cards up. (Honestly, if you had more imagination then OUaT would be fairly useless. Just tell the story - you don't need this knights-and-ladies crutch to stick your creativity in a very small box.) Needless to say, even as an interactive storytelling exercise, this OUaT thingy is extremely group dependent.

Que chato.
Os jogadores recebem cartas e devem descarta-las contando estorias baseado nelas até a estoria terminar como descrito na "carta objetivo" que cada jogador recebe secretamente. Se não continuar a estoria com as cartas que tem o jogador recebe mais cartas. Tem uma quantidade razoável de texto em inglês que pode prejudicar bastante a jogabilidade.

Kártyakijátszós történet mesélős játék. A műfajból adódóan elég sandbox jellegű és a hangsúly inkább a fantázia megmozgatásán van, semmint azon, hogy ki nyer, bár erre is van szabály. Nekem nincs igazán társaságom ilyenre, illetve és is inkább csak egy-egy levezető mókázás miatt ülnék be. A stílusban nekem a dixit jobban bejön, inkább azt választom, ha ilyenre van igényem.

Haven't played yet. I think you shouldn't play the game with very competetive players. The scoring encourages you to tell your story in the most boring way (no adjectives or additional facts) so it is difficult to interupt you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.1
Great game.  If everyone plays for fun and judges "silliness" reasonably it works well.  If people want to play "competitively", it requires a neutral judge or judges to call people for silliness, rambling, etc.  Otherwise, it would just devolve into arguments about what is silly and what is not.

A variant that is almost required: people can trade in a card for two cards whenever the storyteller changes.  Otherwise, it's easy to be stuck with no interrupt cards and have virtually no chance of ever getting back into the game.

Great tool for storytelling (either helping write fiction or roleplaying games) & a fun game as well. If you don't like the fantasy setting, it's your game so feel free to take the iconic cards into other settings to tell your own stories. Really easy for people to get into as it's a mix of storytelling & Mad Libs.

Great open ended storytelling. The tug of war played with the story in players trying to reach their own endings can lead to a frustratingly divisive story and can make formulating a satisfactory ending (which ties up plot threads appropriately) difficult.
With the right group of people this is good fun, but the game itself isn't pulling much weight.

I don't think i would play it with serious gamers, but a fun time with kids  (rating 6, Sept 14).  UPDATE: Purely a game I would play only with my young niece when she visits from overseas, so it's quite limited.  That said, those times were very special.  As a general game, very unlikely I would play with adults, but possible a bit of short lived fun with other kids.  Therefore, rating of 5.276 (Feb 2015). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Gave this to my niece for Christmas, and we have played one session. It's really quite hard! The kids (aged 9 and 10) can't cope with having to maintain the story while adding their own cards - they tend to go off on a tangent. Sometimes you get stuck with a bunch of cards and you've got no idea how to get involved in the story. Occasionally, you manage to get a decent story going. It can also be quite funny as you reintroduce elements from previous stories. It pretty much succeeds in doing what it attempts to, but that's not really my sort of game.

An very promsing idea: players spin a story, weaving in elements given on their cards.  With the right people, this could be great, entertaining, and magical.  With the people I usually play with, they do the bare minimum one sentence per card with few frills, and the resulting story is more random than enchanting.

I agree with a previous commenter... this is more like an activity than a game.  It's very fun when you've got a group of people who enjoy improv.  Competing to win always kills the fun of the game.

This is a fun game, and it is very different from almost anything else that is out there. The game will play very differently depending on your group. I've played with middle school students, my parents, die-hard gamers, and regular folks in a community center. They all enjoyed themselves in different ways.
Some people have difficulty with the creative improvisation of the game. But I think they just need to practice more.

RATING: 5
It's fun to have an excuse to tell stories with friends, but it's a rather fragile system. If you play with creative people that aren't competitive, it's great! It's not much of a "game" though, as I think it's best not to try to win if it would hurt the story. It's a hard game to give a numerical rating, it can be both wonderful and awful depending on the group and setting. So I guess 5 is a nice average.

Play this story-telling card game with people you know, or don't play it at all. 
Great fun with the RIGHT crowd, and it really taps into that creative, improvisational part of your cranium.
Some of the stories you'll create will be forgotten as quickly as they came to mind, but others will linger.
My son and I came up with a tale about two idiot brothers who schemed to steal the crown from the local king so they could rule the land. They actually managed to get into the castle when a passing Duke assumed from their ridiculous behavior that they were actually talented "village idiot" street performers and invited them to appear in court.
In front of the king.
Who's crown they received when they inadvertently murdered him during their "act", making the court think they were masterminds of deception.
Then they realized running a kingdom was really hard, and it became such a burden that they eventually sacrificed themselves to a dragon, which the population again misunderstood as a great act of courage.

You can't get that kind of story from any other game.
But like I said, it has to be the right crowd.

[JAN 09] [Rating: 6]
I have a hard time to rate this game, because of its strange nature. As a social activity it is great, since there is seldom any game I don’t like of it. The problem comes with playing with competitive players and the game detracts to be a game about playing cards with a pseudo story laid out perfectly to match the cards. There should be something unique with the story and the cards are just there to help you bring it out. When it works, magic happens.

The cards themselves play on classic (or maybe stereotypical) stories, but as I said it shouldn’t be a hindrance for creative use. The problem is that you have so many cards and other players also have cards, which can easily make it hard to run all through the story. People will try to fit their story to their ending.

While I almost always enjoy the game, even with crappy stories, it doesn’t work very well as a game. When it is really fun it more like a free form experience. I think it plays best with 3 or 4 players.

[MAR 09] [Rating: 6]
It looks like our group have played the rules a little wrong, which make the game considerably longer, especially with more players. I am eager to try it out with the right rules, but there is at least no change in the rating until I try it with the right rules.

I knew this isn't a "game" for me, but sometimes you want to do others a favor. ;)

However, this is another "game" that I wouldn't call a game. It's just something you do to waste your time, having fun with a completely stupid story, made up by different people. Well, with a boring group, I guess playing this will be a real bad idea.

People who like telling a silly story may like it, but a game it is not.

It would be a great game with a great story teller. I would love to be good at this game. I found myself telling chessy stories to use my cards. It needs more than two players. It would be great for a creative writing class or group. I love fairy tales and the art is wonderful. 

This would be a great tool for teaching fairy tale motifs.

RATING: 4
Particularly uninspired for a storytelling game.  You'd think storytelling and gaming would go together fairly well, but every instance I've seen in print relies on a group judging mechanic of some sort, which can be awkward.  ONCE UPON A TIME, in particular, really suffers from a sort of slapped together simplistic approach.

I've played this with a bunch of live action role playing friends (where it played very well) as well as a more mundane group (where it worked not at all). Currently we don't have an appropriate group of friends to play with but I hope someday we will.

RATING: 6
This game isn't for everyone. On fun days, I'd easily rate this game much higher but it's just not an every-day game, unless you're an every-day story-teller.

For the most part, I only ever get to play this with my sister and we've created alternative rules and ways of playing. We try to make coherent stories - even if they are ridiculous - and we usually have fun. And after, we type out the stories so we can go back and laugh at them later.

Sometimes it's hard to let go and be creative and make stuff up on the spot but I think it's a great way to tap into one's inner child.

This is tricky to rate, because it isn't really, you know, a game in the sense that I usually use.  It's a pretty pure storytelling game--come up with outrageous tales that fit with the cards in your hand.  We end up not being too competitive when we are playing; we try to play cards but mostly it's about how the game is really funny. Some people get performance anxiety about coming up with stories on the spot, though. (1 play)

First of all, let's just get the caveat right out of the way: this game is highly, HIGHLY group dependant, meaning if you don't have a loose group of silly friends - this will be torture.  I don't know if I would consider Once Upon A Time a game much like I barely consider Werewolf a game, so this should really be thought of more as a "fun excercise."  However, with the right personalities in play, this is an unrivaled romp in halirity.  Hell, it's groupthink in action with all the beauty and none of the gamey-ness (well OK, there's a little)...

Oct08: Well now I know if anyone asks me what an "experience" game is, I have a perfect answer.  And yet, there's nothing wrong with this game at all.  As others have said, the stories are very memorable and the play is very enjoyable.  It takes the right type of crowd, so think about it before you spring this on someone.

Overall, I do recommend giving this a try.  I like games that stand out (Zendo?), and this one is in the same class.

Strategy: none. but creativity is a must!

Play/Wait Ratio: depends on the player.
Replayability: It all depends on who you play with. The game would suck with certain people, and would be great with others. Don't play it with boring people, or people with toilet humor! (unless it is late at night, I guess)

I heard about this card game from Orson Scott Card. I know a lot of people don't like this game but it's one of my favorite when played with the right group. It's important to remember the goal of the game is to tell a story not to win. You have to be very attentive in listening and remembering all the details. I imagine most people don't like the game because they are not following the rules or focusing on telling a good story. For fun for those that are creative.

I wish I could play this more.

Cool game, although the box it came in was a bit lame (x3 decks barely fitting in their box, cards prone to slip out while stored), also between Rory's Story Cubes and The Hobbit: Tales From the Green Dragon Inn this game never gets any attention.

RATING: 5
It works great in proper company.  There's a lot of laugh then.  But for me it might be difficult to gather proper players so I'm not considering buying it.

Also - to have real fun - put a great stress on logic of a story.

It works best with fewer number of players (3-4).  Slightly worse with 5-6 players.  And don't make a mistake trying to play it with no. of players even above the range indicated on the box (2-6).

EDIT: The game wears out rapidly.  I have enough.

I feel like I should like this game less than I do. It's way too freeform for me, and it also suffers from a frustrating randomness when your turn gets skipped because someone else had a card of a word the active player said. But in spite of that I find myself enjoying the game a fair amount, and have even suggested it myself once or twice. There's something about it that I really enjoy, that I can't express.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (February 2012)

Once upon a time seems like a good idea, however I don’t really like the game (if it can even be called a game). For me, this is not a game, there is no strategy, no end game. It is boring after a couple of minutes so it doesn’t grab my attention and I almost never want to play it.

With a special group this could be a blast, but as you can make a lame nonsense story to steal the tale it leaves me with a bad taste. The big problem for me is that the rules are not clearly defined about what is allowed and what isn’t to steal a story. I’m a competitive player and this “game” doesn’t agree with me because it doesn’t encourage wining. In this game winning is not important so I don’t like it. 

Bottom line, a clever activity that can entertain some people. Great to play with non-gamers. I don’t really have any desire to play this, I would play Dixit instead.

As I love flavourful games, this is top notch! You build your own story together and 'interupt' the storyline based on the location, item, event or adjective cards you have. This way you try to get the story to align with your hidden ending. Creative concept and a fantastic way to spend some time.

I love the idea of this game, but I seem to suck at it.  people are always telling me I'm doing it wrong.  I guess my idea of what constitutes a legitimate story is a little too weird.  I'm too ready to venture into the surreal.  :)

Es gibt 2 Arten dieses Spiel zu spielen:
1. Ziel ist ein schönes Märchen. Viele Leute spielen das so, doch das Problem ist, dass ich Märchen eigentlich langweilig finde.
2. Lustig und auf Sieg. Ziel ist eine witzige Geschichte, die auch mal sehr abstrus werden darf. Dann macht es Spass.

Absolutely wonderful. I have played games where the players laugh till it hurts, as our characters take on lives of their own and do things we never intended. Of course the game is ruined by people who don't/can't adhere to the spirit of the game, so don't play with those people. A great "I don't care who wins" game because getting there is such a blast.

RATING: 1
My rating this game a "1" may not apply to others, but every time I've played it, I've been able to easily fly through all the cards I have and end the game. I guess I've gamemastered too many RPGs, but I can easily stitch together a story on the fly and "win" this game, although all of us feel the game is lost when I do. Therefore, I just don't play this game any more. Even so, my wife has a fondness for the game, so we keep it around for her.

RATING: 5
Interesting story-building game.  I've found that it unfortunately has limited appeal in a lot of circles.  (My wife, for instance, hates the whole premise of having to make up and tell a story out loud.) Basically, you are dealt a hand of cards that are story elements straight out of a fairy tale (a princess, a forest, a monster, etc.), and the goal is to guide the story to include these elements (playing the card as you manage to incorporate it) until you empty your hand and finish the story.  Good, creative game especially for children and youth.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Not enough plays to really judge yet. It seems to be a "right brained game" but with enough structure around it to make it an actual game, rather than social experiment. The concept of playing cards to match story elements seemed to escape my kids, as did the concept that you didn't necessarily have to tell a story that matched every one of your cards.

Though one needs to have a certain mindset when playing this game I've found that if people want to have fun, "talk story" (as they say in Hawai'i), and drink wine.  It can be great for a couple of hours.  It is almost as much fun as The Adventures of Barron Munchousin.

RATING: 8
A fun game for a creative group that likes shared story-building. You use cards featuring various story elements like characters, locations, events, etc. to build up a story, leading toward the ending card you've been dealt. The whole time, the other players can heckle you with questions in an attempt to get you to mention something from one of their cards, so they can steal the story from you and take it in their own direction. A great game for storytelling clubs or teaching kids how to craft a narrative, and the art design is pleasing to look at with a bit of a storybook feel.

It's pretty hard to craft a good story, but it's fun seeing everyone try.  I'm personally pretty poor at it myself even though I thought I'd have this sort of thing in the bag.  I. Do. Not.  haha  It's still fun to hear everyone else make stuff up though!  Then jump in!  And fail at progressing the story!  haha  Fun game at the right times.

One player is the Storyteller, and creates a story using the ingredients on her cards. She tries to guide the plot towards her own ending. The other players try to use cards to interrupt her and become the new Storyteller. The winner is the first player to play out all her cards and end with her Happy Ever After card

This is a strong storytelling game that WILL NOT work in every situation. In fact it has more often been an average or simply "fine" experience with most groups.

Not that bad of a game. It's just like Dixit except you tell a story rather than a description of a card. Obviously you need creative people to make the game more enjoyable, the more ridiculous the story is, as long as it is still acceptable by the group, the more fun the storytelling process can be. The point of this game shouldn't be to win, but to get people to tell a great story.

I am bad at doing anything in real time, especially with how much you have to factor in loose ends in making your story here, so there is some bias there. However, mechanically you have to play this very much not to win and instead for the journey, as otherwise you would look for any excuse to force your opponents to pass so that it would get to your turn and you can play cards, and in addition you should almost never voluntarily pass.

Once Upon a Time is an oddball little game -- when it works, it's great; when it doesn't, it's a waste of time. The key ingredient is the group: Everyone has to buy into the game's central oddity, which is that if you play purely to win -- like you normally might -- you will win...but no one, yourself included, will have any fun.

A good game of Once is one where everyone is sort of playing to win but also sort of playing to see where the silly story goes, and no one tries to race to the ending right away. That's a tough sell for some groups.

5 / 5 - Great

An odd one to rate. It isn't really a game in the usual sense of the word: there's no strategy and winning isn't really the point of the exercise. It's all about using your imagination to tell a story and to try and steal that story off the current teller so you can finish it. And it's a hugely engaging, satisfying and often very funny experience. Just not really a game.

A good game... I just have to remember that not everyone has the same vision as I do for my story and it's as much about selling your idea of the story to others as it is actually telling the story.

A good game... bought for my daughter on Mother's Day 2013.  Hopefully it'll get more uses than just the first.

Each player gets a set of cards representing story elements (eg people, places, actions, etc) and an ending card. The first player starts telling a story playing cards as they mention the words on the cards. Other players may interrupt if the player uses a word on their card. To win the can the player must get rid of all their story cards and end with their specific ending (the ending must make sense in the broder context of the story).
This is a good chill out game or one to play with kids to encourage creative thinking.

More of an activity (80-90%) than a game (20-10%). But such a FUN activity. Especialyl when played with authors or story tellers. I had an AMAZINGLY good time with two other gamers who loved stories and it was just interruption and forgetting to interrupt due to good story telling and being interested in the story. GREAT time.

If you love telling stories, this is a must have.

[b]Review for 2003 edition:[/b]
Sheer genius of minimalism. Game of storytelling--or rather facilitating storytelling--where it can be more fun to let others win that combines the best of impro theatre and card games! Played with imaginative, eloquent and expressive people it can be a sublime experience. Highly recommended, but caveat emptor!, depending on your personality or gaming circle it can also be an utterly horrible game.

[b]2013 edition:[/b]
Tighter structure with expansions expounding on particular themes and closer matching between story and ending cards allows for stricter and more focused story telling, with related benefits and drawbacks.

RATING: 3
Not really what I play games for. As a game this one breaks down due to the vagueness of the interrupt rules, and also I found it easy enough to craft an actual story without remotely coming close to hitting any cards but my own. Other than that, yes, there is some amusement in the stories you weave but then this is less of a game than a facilitator for improvisation. Maybe with more cards? Either way - not my style of game, I'd rather play Dixit where using say stories for hints are less constrained and also - optional.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As said by many others, this one totally depends on your group. It can be a total blast, or a lead balloon.  I wish they had put the item names at the top of the cards, so you could hold them somewhat normally.  I have to hold them stacked inverted vertically, so I can see all the bottoms at one time.  Very awkward.  The rulebook seemed to go on for more than required.  My sense is that personal house rules that befit a particular group would be fine and appropriate.  Curiously, I could have rated this a Medium weight game, as a really creative crowd would amp up the "competitive" atmosphere.  Great fun and challenge.  This one is refreshingly unlike any other "traditional" card or boardgame.

Can't rate because I haven't played yet.  I've practiced by myself though.  I think I'm going to suck, because I can't seem to tell a spontaneous story that makes any sense, let alone one that is the least bit interesting.   I think I could be the master at the interrupt though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The idea of this game is solid: tell a story based on the cards you received. The competitive nature of this game leaves a lot to be desired: elements of the interrupting mechanic are completely useless, and it quickly becomes a race to use up all of your cards before someone starts yelling over the top of you with an interrupt card. Thus, games become quickly convoluted, and those that play to win often end the game with uninspired stories. 

However, if you all but ignore the win conditions and play just to have fun with creative, confident friends, you will get quite a few laughs out of this game; it's in these cases where the game truly shines. 

I'm waiting for my copy of Dixit: Odyssey to arrive, the competitive elements seem to be somewhat better designed.

I love the idea of this game! I read the rules and was desperately eager to play. When I finally got the chance (several times with separate groups, I realized the other players had little appreciation for the exceedingly loose rules format. Given the opportunity to create the guidelines ourselves, these groups proceeded to quickly abuse the lack of hard boundaries from different angles in order to win as quickly as possible. Too bad for me. I strongly conclude that enjoyment of this game is very dependent on the player group and it does not work well with players for whom defeating the competition is the desired experience. This is a wonderful game concept, and I hope I can play it with an appropriate group (open minded; playing for the enjoyment of it; comfortable with less boundaries) some time soon.

This one is pretty fun with the right group. The more creative and witty the group, the more fun and hilarious this game can be.

Not without charm, but extremely fragile, easily broken by even gentle game players (like my wife). To work, players need to agree to approach it more like an activity than a game.

If you play to win, you get ballyhooed by the people who wanted to "tell a story." If you try to "tell a story," you get interrupted by someone playing to win. The random cards and rules revolving around interrupting other players seem to encourage incoherent stories. There's a slippery slope once you let one player make some slightly implausible leap in the story: one thing leads to another, and pretty soon everyone's making ridiculous connections just to play their cards.

For some reason creating a game based on storytelling seems a difficult task.  Constructing a set of rules to determine the storytelling winner is usually a bit arbitrary.  With Once Upon a Time there is little incentive to tell an imaginative story if you are just trying to win. The rules for interrupting the storyteller whenever they mention something that matches one of your cards seems a bit broken.  You would often hold several cards which are very unlikely to be mentioned by another player so your cards could prevent you being able to interrupt the storyteller.  Players trying to win might restrict their language to avoid mentioning something on another player's card.  This game probably only works well if anyone plays to have fun and no one is actively trying to end the game in a hurry by playing all of their cards in quick succession.

It can be fun to play (so I perhaps like it a bit more than the rating indicates), but only if all the players make a kind of pact that telling an amusing story is the most important thing.

Just got this game (3/28/08) to play with by two girls who are 13 and 9.  Only a few plays, but they've been a LOT of fun!!  Yeah, the stories tend to go all over the place and we still haven't quite figured out when we're allowed (according to the rules) to play particular cards.  If a story mentions an evil witch, does that mean someone can take over the story by playing the "enemy" card?  If someone mentions an "island" can an interrupt occur with an "at sea" card?  Not sure, and like I just mentioned, the stories often don't really hang together, BUT these still produce a lot of giggles and laughs.  So much so that most "games" last 30 minutes with at least half of that time just laughing and saying, "Wait, why did she get turned into a mushroom again?!?"  I also really like how the game is _sort of_ collaborative, but at the same time the person who plays their ending card gets to feel like they are the final owner of the story.  Finally, every once and a while, a very creative story does emerge that hangs together, and that's just cool.  My girls have always loved to listen to books on tapes, and when they were younger I read and made up an awful lot of stories with them at nights.  This game is pretty perfect for us.  I'll be curious to see how it wears and whether it gets picked up by them when friends come over.

RATING: 9
One of my absolute favorite games. The only thing keeping me from giving it 10/10 is that it does not work with all players. Through the many years I've owned this game, I've played with a handful of people that really make this game shine. People that really enjoy creating unforgettable, insane and hilarious stories. Other times with other players, the game falls flat, the stories never take flight, and the players do not enjoy themselves. 

Once upon a time will never be better than the group you play it with. With some groups, you can play several hours straight without getting bored, and with other groups you decide to pack the game away after just one or two games. But still - this is probably the game that has provided me with some of my best gaming memories through the years.

RATING: 10
Beautiful art, wonderful and original idea and rules that are fun and good by themselves but easy to modify and make house rules. The single best game for people who thrive more on unstructured/loosely structured creativity and imagination rather than numbers and strict rules. A great game with incredible replay value whose only flaw is that it assumes the people playing are creative and charismatic--it's not a popular game with people who aren't.

like Once upon a time, Aye Dark Overlord, Are you the Traitor/Werewolf, the Resistance or any similar game, these are perhaps my favorite genre of game. They REQUIRE the right group. Right group is a euphemism for people who actually have some inkling of roleplaying, charisma, fun, wit, humor, exuberance, and amicability than this game wins wins wins. Which also means that if your group doesn't like these games, it might be time to get new friends rather than a new group because it's literally their fault and not the brilliant game.

I love this game. I love the original. I love the new ones even more (nostalgia aside). I already have the writers handbook and enchanting tales. I also have dark tales from the original.

In the non-structured, creative style of games, there is nothing better than this game. I would rather play this than a table top RPG any day.

I can't wait for this expansion, but I can only say one thing: keep the expansions coming. I can't say enough good things about this game or the beautiful new art in the new edition either.

The enjoyment of playing this greatly depends on the people you are playing with, and can be made better with some house ruling too. I love it, but sometimes it's frustrating not being able to overtake the story for 20 mins (here is where house-ruling can come in to help). Additionally, playing with people that don't like to improv or use any features of the story that others created is a bit of a drag too. But! When people are working together to create a silly, fantastic series of events, using each others characters and setting after taking over, with slight nudges towards their own directions... oooh this can be a witty, gloriously hilarious game!

The truest story telling game out there, because as players, that is exactly what you do here: You REALLY tell a story! More precisely said, you collectively make up a fairy tale based on your individual hand cards.

I totally adore the whole idea of the game, but in all honestly, I'm not always in the mood for that kind of social activity, and as much as I regret it, I cannot give the game mire than 6 points when adhering to BGG rating guide lines: Will play sporadically if in the right mood.

This game is not so much a game, but more a framework that helps the players tell a story. A lot of creativity is asked from the participants and hence this game is not for everyone.

Gets an A for uniqueness. This game should be viewed more as a co-op game. I think a rejiggering of the rules could increase the qualify of the experience. While the rule say you shouldn't just chain cards together as quickly as possible in a hot mess-- that the story should have a through thread. Actually preventing players from doing that is somewhat subjective, people have to call them on their BS. Honestly, if someone could be an impartial judge of the story and the goal was to create the most satisfying story line to score points that might be better. If it could have something like an Apples to Apples mechanic that might make it better. Like each player gets a chance to tell the next paragraph of the story and the judge chooses the best one.

The one playing of this I had with gamers I was bowled over by the quick creativity of the role players amongst the group who stole the floor whilst the more traditional gamers struggled along. Otherwise, I've only ever really used these as flash cards to make up stories with the kids, not in a game sense or as per the rules.

RATING: 7
Fun and creative. Elemental storytelling is the goal; not all the stories that result are classics, but it isn't the quality or the timelessness which counts. Players interact with each other to piece cards together and tell aloud a coherent story hopefully skewing the ending be able to place their own unique ending card and thus win the game. 

This game deserves a tin. I recommend obtaining a 2nd or later edition with the graphics.

RATING: 7
The idea behind the game is extremely simple, maybe even predictable, but the end result is a hybrid cross between a boardgame, a roleplaying game and traditional storytelling. The ruleset is very poor and could be vastly improved, but with the right group and state of mind, OUaT can be quite a unique experience.

This game is great fun just to play and it really is the taking part which is more enjoyable than just being able to put down your card last. I've had some hilarious games with this, tears rolling down my cheeks.

I was a little disappointed at the quality of the artwork however - could have been much better in my opinion.

RATING: 5
Once Upon a Time is literally a story-telling game--you're trying to make up a story involving the cards in your hand so that you can be the first to play them all.  Play passes to the next player either when the current player runs out of creativity and passes, or when the current player names a card in an opponent's hand, allowing that opponent to play the card and pick up where they left off.  Players are encouraged to question the storyteller about details, in hopes that he'll name a card they have.  This isn't really my type of game, as I'm a poor improvisor and speaker in general, and I don't like interrupting people.

This is a pretty fun time, but it's hard to call it a game. It gives you words on cards that you use to create a story, we end up just trying to tell the funniest story possible. We purposely try to keep it going as long as possible and no one really tries to win, because it doesn't feel like you won it just ends the game. If you just create a story and try to tie up all the loose ends from memory this is a pretty fun time, but if you want it to feel like an actual game you'll have to come up with some house rules.

I'd *like* to give this game a significantly higher rating, but can't due to the fact that it's so very, very dependent upon the right 'mood' to work.  Some games, like Carcassonne for example, you can play in a friendly mood, in an angry combative mood, when you're bored, etc.  Once Upon A Time requires that you be in a creative frame of mind, quick of wit, and generally well-disposed towards other players.  A bit of a tough sell, gorgeous as the production values are.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Although I love to pull out OUAT as filler, it's really an excuse for light story-telling and not a game you try to win.  I mean, if you want to win, just memorize the cards and tell boring stories that give few opportunities for interruptions ("Once upon a time, there was a WOODCUTTER.  The woodcutter lived in a COTTAGE." Etc.).  Beginning players also tend to create ridiculously incoherent stories, tedious to recall and wrap up.  So the game requires players who understand that the goal isn't to interrupt whenever possible and dump cards, but rather to allow the story to progress in some pleasing, coherent fashion until they see opportunities to add interesting complications using their cards.

This game, possibly more than any other I own, relies on the group you play with. People need to have good spoken language skills and imagination. It's no use playing with people who are not story tellers.

I admire the originality of the storytelling gameplay. However here is an excellent example of how much the mindset of your players can elevate or deflate the experience of a game. Assess your group and if they are verbally spontaneous and creative, with no qualms about entertaining, give this game a go. Personally, I find the topic chosen too childlike and I feel embarassed, preferring something I have more experience of and being able to narrate well, such as .....er....day in the life of a postman, shop assistant etc.

Straight up storytelling game. Mechanics of when you can play a card from your hand are a bit awkward, but with the right group of people, this can be a lot of fun. The key to having fun is to treat it more like a storytelling exercise than a game. This of course is at odds with the game mechanics themselves, which drive you to empty your hand of cards at the earliest opportunity.

The fact that there are two very different ways to interrupt stories often confuses people, but once you get over that hump, the game is a blast.

Take your fistful of cards, and try to collaborate a tale with the other players that tells a story which hopefully gets close to your ending line of the tale, so that you can put it into play and finish the tale for the win.

Play this with roleplayers, not boardgamers. Or at least, people who will buy in to the storytelling aspect rather than mechanically try to play one card per sentance. My rating is for a good group; played with people who don't "get it", this is closer to a 3.

Great concept -- the game is more of a device to enable group storytelling.  You cooperate to make a good story, but you want to ultimately steer it toward your "Happily Ever After" ending card.  Amusing.

It's not exactly a game, or at least it should not be taken very competitively as a game. Needs the right group of people, right moment and the right set of mind to be fully enjoyable experience. At its best it is very funny way to spend time with your friends.

The fun will depend on the group you're with.  I highly recommend adding the house rule where you can't play more than one card per sentence.  Otherwise you might get the one cheesy player that just tries to squeeze all the cards in their hand into a single sentence.

An extremely fun storytelling game with the right group of people/mindset.  You have to want to have fun and be creative in this game.  The rules are quick and light and extremely easy to "game."  So if your goal is to win, you can ditch cards as fast as you can and probably win, but no one will have fun.

RATING: N/A
+ Improvisational, engaging and creative
+ Hilarious twists and events throughout the story as players try their best to drive the story towards their secret ending
+ Tons of replayability
+ Simple ruleset, quick to play, makes for a good filler game
+ Definitely a lighter introduction into storytelling than Fiasco

- Not everyone is into storytelling or improv

Its pretty good on its own merits and absolutely brilliant if you have a group of players who are good storytellers and quick of wit. Great as a family game-- my children love to play even though I end up telling most of the story.

If you play it as a relaxed social experience with the cards acting as inspiration and enjoy the puzzle aspect of altering the story in a credible way to fit the cards you have, it is probably closer to an 8. If you play to try and dump your hand as quickly as possible then it is lower.

Intelligent storytelling game. Played more than a dozen times. This game requires creativity and quick thinking to keep the story on track or bring it back towards your intended ending. Excellent with adults, I am yet to try with children. Unique. You have "collaborative story-telling" and a game with a clear objective and winner. A daunting job, well-tackled by the designer.

Too much of a mixed bag to have higher. If playing with hyper competitive people who feel compelled to challenge and interrupt at every turn, it makes for an bad time.

Not a game in the normal BGG sense, it's a shared storytelling experience that is better if played with people who aren't focused on winning it as a game.  With people who are in the right spirit it can be a fun activity.  With people who aren't in the right spirit, it's boring and annoying.  The cards are useful as a language learning game also.  I can also say from experience that it's very hard playing with a group of people playing in their native language that you don't understand very well. :)

We usually (only) play this game on the train during a tour. The whole game rating is totally based on the players. When playing with fun players it could become very interesting as an otherwise unimpressive one. Something about others. This game is about innovation and originality, two things that most of Chinese people are lack of... Sometimes I even think that we really need these kinds of games to revive our next generation out of the very rigid and exam-heavy education system.

The good thing about OUAT is that many players will make the rules as they go along! It works real well with very young kids who just use the cards to make up a story. I've even used the cards to make a storytelling roleplaying games where the kids play spellcasters (they make up a spell based on a card they play, while the parent uses his cards as elements to tell an RPG).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A wonderful game to be played with friends who like telling stories, imagining fairy tales, or just talking. If your group doesn't like storytelling as well as playing card games, this game won't work for you. Builds shared experiences and running jokes - somehow the "duplicitous chef" keeps making its way back into our stories. Be sure to ban flashbacks.

RATING: 7
This is a card-driven storytelling game where the players are each dealt and ending card and a series of cards that cover events, moods, people, places, and things.  The game is all about telling a classic fairy tale using the cards in your hand.  The first person to play all the cards in their hand and successfully play their ending card wins, but if you mention something in your story that matches a card in someone else's hand they can interrupt your play and cause you to take a card.

This is a fun and mostly innocent game, but I have found that I have to be in the right (read: creative) mood and playing with other people who like to tell stories (and are moderately good at it).

This can be a very fun game, but the fun that your group derives from this game will be dependant on the personalities of the players.

But people who like to read, or who are imaginitive, or even those who like to talk, will probably have a blast with this game.

Once Upon a Time is not at all about winning or losing; it's about putting together a cool narrative. The ending cards are to be taken less as objectives and more as prompts for the kind of story you're trying to write. You'll naturally feel compelled to guide the story towards your ending, but if another person ends the story their way instead, you've still used your ending to introduce new elements into the plot that no one else would have thought of, because they weren't trying to do what you were.

I think the optimal number for this game is between 2 and 4. In larger games, the story always seems to become less cohesive as players fight for endings that seemingly have no connection to the story.

Even if you thrived in this kind of 'game' (improv?) and found others like you, it doesn't change the fact that winning the game and telling a good story are mutually exclusive. That's a fault with the game itself. You could tell a better story if you didn't have any rules or cards.

Interrupts should be used to tag-team and collectively tell a good story that's better than one you can come up with on your own, not to hijack the story into a patchwork of topics in order to win the game.

Still, the first of its genre I've tried, and I wonder how Winter Tales will compare.

This has nothing to do with storytelling, since there is supposedly a game involved, and the storytelling elements are constrained and cliche.

Excellent free form story telling game. People usually need a bit of time to warm up. Once they do, it can be magical.

I wish it were easier for those with few cards left in their hand to get back into the story. Players can be locked out if they lose control of the narrative. I usually house rule something to deal with this.

1) This is more an experience than a game.
2) Played with the right group, it's a whole lot of laughs. With the wrong group, it will fail miserably.
3) The rules need some 'house rules'. Some in the group will 'get' it, some won't.

Fun experience! I like it. 

Some things I think could be better:

1) card usability. I can't fan it out. I have to stack the cards on top of each other to see the words.

2) Subcategories on the cards are too small to see and use the interrupts on.

A nice and quite funy little storytelling cardgame. You get some cards at the begining, which you must get rid of to win the game. And to do this, you have to tell your story, using the plots, activities, objects depicted on your cards, finishing off with a story ending. Althought it sounds quite easy at first, everybody else has the same goal and they try to interrupt your story, to tell theirs :)

This is one of those games where, with the right people, it's hard to imagine having a better time. For everyone else, it can still be a lot of fun if the players are willing to be uninhibited story-tellers. It is an absolute ball with a bunch of 8-12 year olds though.

RATING: 1
This isn't really much of a "game", just an activity, since if played as an actual game (where winning is the objective) then the game is broken with the rules being completely subjective. That pretty much kills this for me. Far inferior to something like Dixit.

Storytelling is a fine basis for a social experience though that can provide some laughs. But the few rules there are don't lead to good stories IMO. I think you'd be better off sitting in a circle and improvising; the game actually gets in the way.

This game is fantastic if the following criteria are met: you have an extroverted and/or inebriated group, and everyone understands the spirit of the game is to have fun and get silly at times. I really recommend the create-your-own-story cards expansion to write in funny endings and  things. My group is very entertaining, and with our custom cards and creative attitudes this game can be hilarious and entertaining in the vein of Cards Against Humanity (but with more fun and  replayability).

Played this with a few friends and it was really fun! Can't wait to play it with my nephews, both of whom love reading and creative writing. It should be very entertaining. I expect you really need the right group of folks for this game though. If someone isn't really participating, the game could be a lot less amusing.

Update: My nephews LOVE this game!

There's plenty of fun in this one, as you make up stories and just have a good time trying to bend the story back to match your cards.  It's challenging to think on your feet, and the longer you play, the more you use the words on the cards, meaning the story hops around from person to person.  It's hard for me to say that I'd give any party game a 7, so my rating really is some pretty high praise.

Rating Once Upon a Time simply must take into account that this is not a game for everyone -- if even one person is lukewarm towards it, the entire game falls apart.  Great for some light roleplaying and, as the name suggests, storytelling.  Particularly compelling for kids, who aren't afraid to let their imaginations run wild.

RATING: 6
This is one of those "games" that isn't really so much a game as a party activity.  It is played by each player taking a hand of cards that have different parts of a story on them such as characters, places, events, things, etc.  A player is supposed to play cards from their hand putting a story together until another player is able to interrupt them or they get stuck.  A player can interrupt another using special interrupt cards or if the other player's story included a word the player had in their hand.  The first player who gets to their "ending" card (logically) wins.

I'm right on the verge of liking this game a lot less than the little bit I do.  The reason being that while I see the potential to have fun occasionally with this, I also haven't had a whole lot of fun with it just yet.  That's because I feel like people need to have the right attitude when playing it to have fun.  First of which is you can't really play it to win.  Anybody can string a set of words together that quickly gets them to the ending but it's more fun when everybody gets a turn and seeing where the story goes with different story tellers and different words they need to use.  Also, the one time I played there was a bit too much interruption.  Interruption is good to force people to elaborate on parts of their story and maybe lead someone into saying a word you want but it always became way too forced and constant in the games I've played.

Also, and this is true with any silly party game like this, you need people that are actually going to get into it.  If someone is just blandly stringing words together or isn't having any fun with it then nobody's going to have much fun.

After playing this game a few times, the most important and crucial aspect of the game is: do not treat it as a competitive game but rather a cooperative game where all your friends try to create the best story. If played competitively, you will often find the story being created go out of hand - random plot holes, absurd scenarios etc. If you do however create a great story - it will easily create some fun memories for the future for you to remember.

Also, one HUGE problem about this game is that the cards are geared toward telling "fairy-like" tales. It is almost impossible to make the story have a "modern" or "futuristic" feel as some of the cards will be impossible to play.

When my girlfriend bought this game (for her sister's family) I was not enthused. They only play games when we're visiting, and I'm trying to get the nephews (10 and 12) into strategy games. I didn't want to even consider this game. I didn't expect to enjoy it myself, and I was fairly certain that they wouldn't like it either. As it turns out, I liked it and most (brother-in law not so much) of the family did, too. Not only that, I wouldn't mind owning it myself. I'm fairly certain it would hit the table with some regularity.

As others have pointed out, winning really can't be your sole objective here or the game won't be much fun; however, I believe that it can be really nice as a family game. It offers a mechanism for for helping to stretch a child's imagination. Apart from that, I can see it as being even better as a party game to get everyone laughing and having a good time. Certainly, it would be a huge step up from (the execrable) Apples to Apples.

The rules are not written in a way that is super clear, and you can be pretty well frozen out of the story if you don't get any interrupt cards. Someone mentioned a variant that would give every player one interrupt card and that seems like it would help the game (perhaps even two might not be a bad idea).  Even with these negatives, the game is fun.

RATING: 6
This is a game that, perhaps even more than most games, requires a very specific group with whom to enjoy it.  And most certainly to a greater degree than the vast majority of games, it is the people playing this game that make it or break it.  I can see it appealing to a rather specific niche audience, with all others really having a strong dislike for it.  (Have I just said the same thing 3 times in a row?)  But for those who enjoy weaving a good yarn and improvising some tall tales, this is a great way to spend a little time with a group of two or more people.  In fact, it is sometimes more fun to sit and listen to another player's story than to win the game yourself.  My two chief complaints about this truly unique game are: I wish the base game had come with more cards, and I feel like they could have done a much better job with the art work.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 6/10

[Atlas Games 2nd (1995) edition] {Party; creativity, story-telling; optimal 4-6p} Once upon a time is a strange game, which everyone is very happy no matter you win/lose. However, it needs a group of creative players to make this game work. It's hilarious to see your friends telling a totally insensible story or getting some crazy ideas. It offers many player interactions and table talks. You can also know more about your friends with this game.

I'm not a big fan of improvisation, though I've gotten better over recent years. So I felt apprehensive when this got broken out over a New Years Eve dinner. But I gave it the ol' college try, and was surprised by how fun I found it. This is obviously one of those games that could be terrible with the wrong group, but the interrupting and stealing the story from someone so you could take it where you needed it to go worked well at keeping everyone involved. I think I need more practice, as I only had one chance at storytelling and found it too hard to interrupt people, but I think that would change with experience. A fun little party game.

Nice game. But depends on who you play with. Needs an imaginative crowd. Just played one game with my cousin and wife.

Really reccommend playing with two ending cards as some of those endings are just impossible to do... ...

RATING: 7
This game is unlike any of the others I own: it is basically a crowd-sourcing tool for fairy tale storylines. The ultimate goal is to tell a tall tale with your fellow story-tellers, using your hand of cards as a guide for characters, objects, places, and events that should be introduced into the story being told.

It appeals to the right-brained side of the population, since it challenges your improvisational creativity in a semi-competitive ruleset.  We have decided that this is a coop more than a game with winners and losers, because competition technically ruins the spirit of the game.  The goal is to tell a cohesive story, and to ultimately end the story with the ending you have in your hand of cards.  

If you are wanting a creative challenge, this is it.  Spin some yarn and have a good time!  A word of warning though.  If you have someone in your friend group that is competitive and can't let that go, this game should not be played. Furthermore, if you have someone that is unable/unwilling to speak up and contribute to a furious storm of fairy tale ideas (some introverts will do this), do not play this game.  They will not have a good time since they won't feel like they can share their ideas.

Love the idea of this game...but we can never make it work as planned. Usually someone's annoyed at being interrupted or doesn't agree with the the interruption.

Really quite a charming "experience game".  Having said that, I'm happy to report that there is in fact an authentic kernel of game to be found in the experience offered by OUaT, which is usually not the case in this type of design.  Comparably, it has been a much bigger hit with my children than 'Tales of the Arabian Nights' or 'Fabula', and it's clever enough to hold adults' interest as well.  (Better if played with the DT expansion and a sand-timer for rambling narrators!)

Is this a 9 or a 1? Difficult to say, as it may not be a boardgame at all, strictly speaking. It's more like an activity with a set of rules that can (and must) be bent as the "game" unfolds. Really serious gamers need to let go a bit here or it will not work. I'd guess that, depending on the crowd, this can vary from pure brilliance to outright torture. Verdict: If you like your rules & mechanics all neat and orderly with no room for interpretation, stay away. If you like creative & social games, do give it a try - you may love it.

I really enjoy this one, but more as an improv game than a board game or even a party game. It's tons of fun with the right crowd, but there's usually at least one person who's just not able to get into the spirit of the thing, swiftly muttering out the straightest line they can think of between the cards in their hand, dramatic structure be damned. You really need to think of "entertaining everyone else" as a victory condition here.

RATING: 3
The game is hurt by the existence of a "win" condition. The fun of this game, I assume, should come from a good story. Unfortunately, if players are just trying to burn cards as fast as possible, there is a desire to get from point A to point B as fast as possible.

RATING: 8
A fantastic game when played with the right group of people, but definitely one that requires just that.  The wrong players just don't 'get' what this game is all about but the rest of us adore it dearly.  Weaving tales like in the days of old! My only wish is that Atlas Games would produce more expansions to really make this game style travel from genre to genre.

A good storytelling game that [u]must[/u] be taken somewhat serious: the purpose of the game is to tell a story - it needs to be, at least, a story that everyone can follow. The players need to understand that the objective of the game isn't winning - the win is to make a good story, it is of little concern who will be the one to give it the ending.

In my experience, in the games players make every effort to insert his/her cards in the story, with no regard to the story itself. All is matters is trying to win. Therefore the stories in the end always were a Frankenstein-story: many parts that don't match forming something that no one in the table can remember exactly as it should goes from beginning to end. Sad, really.

Sure to be better & more chaotic with 4P+, this is a diverting 15 mins. when it's just the two of us.  We don't put much pressure on, and just enjoy the language practise.  We have the Korean edition, but Shenomad has to speak English when we play.

The main mechanic is weaving a tale that enables you to throw away held cards with people, places, things and situations on them.  Every time you mention a card you hold, you may discard it.  But mention someone else's card, or stall too long, and they can interrupt and take over your story.  Since each player is working toward a different "happily ever after" ending, getting your story hijacked can make it difficult to win.

Amazing game. Great back and forth action and I love seeing our twisted story take form.

However, the game does require some metagame courtesy. Some players won't pay enough attention and won't use interrupts. This means they'll forfeit their turn, even if they had opportunities. Passing frequently fixes this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love this game. Playing it feels like winning, regardless of who wins.

Of course, it requires everyone playing it be good at stories. If one player isn't good at storytelling on the fly, the pace really shuts down, and if a player is trying to "win", it will basically kill the game. Every player needs to care more about telling an interesting story than playing card as fast as possible to technically win. Heck, most players should be as descriptive as possible to give others the chance to interrupt.

Somewhat interesting as an activity, not so hot as a game.  If you're even remotely creative (and sometimes if you're not) you can easily jump in with your own topic and interrupt the flow of the game.  It takes the worst aspect of real-time gaming and exaggerates it until it creates a game that's too easily broken.  I would avoid unless you really like the art, or if you want to tinker with the cards and create your own story-based game.  Certainly something I try to stay away from.

Jeu où les joueurs doivent raconter en commun un conte de fées à l’aide de cartes (noms, lieux, évènements), le gagnant étant le 1e joueur à utiliser sa dernière carte. 

Un principe qui avait piqué ma curiosité mais qui s'est plutôt révélé une expérience discordante pour l'ensemble des joueurs pour les raisons suivantes :
1e) Seul les joueurs aguerris à l'oral et possédant une imagination fertile y brilleront.
2e) Les règles de pertinence et/ou d'interruption sont sujettes à interprétations, ce qui nous a entraînés dans des discussions irritantes sur leurs validités. 
Au final, j’ai échangé ma copie à un professeur de langue qui souhaitait l’utiliser avec ses élèves (et c’est sûrement mieux ainsi).

Great game with the right people. It really gives people who are inclined more towards the creative side a chance to have some fun with the cards. The competitive aspect is usually fun, but can sometimes detract from the enjoyable aspects of the storytelling itself.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/tag/outpost_mobile/user/Vroenis]Outpost mobile[/url].

Storytelling games really do have to be driven by the players, not just for the narrative content but in judging what are valid plays and what's just listing. The whole idea is to have fun, so there should be a lesser emphasis on winning. The object of the storytelling games is for everyone to have a laugh and enjoy being creative, as well as taking into account the varying levels of creativity or just comfort in being creative and adjusting the assessment bar accordingly.

The box the (3rd edition) game comes in is fairly large for a game that is essentially a deck of cards. While it's not as bad as the first print of Timeline, it's still mostly full of air. I appreciate that this is done because of retail shelf space and visibility, but I wonder if there aren't better solutions like POS display kits for example. I guess the problem is if the game is sold at any kind of mass market outlet or even just an independent store that shifts a lot of games, it's bound to be shelved in some way that reduces visibility. There may not be an easy solution, but I imagine with something like Once Upon A Time in particular, retailers should really be getting behind the game and either promoting it or increasing its visibility. Add to that an aspiration to always provide friendly customer service that encourages customers to ask for games, and we might be able to reduce some of these unnecessarily large retail boxes, particularly in an age when more and more shopping is being done online (almost half of my collection was purchased from online stores).

No idea what to make of this.  Clearly, it's an activity, not a game, but there is some structure....  Not likely to play again, as it's too devoid of competitive interest, and too campy as a pure activity.

You really have to play this game at least three times when teaching it to new people.  Once to teach the rules and explain that it is not a game.  The second time to let the people play the game and try to "win".  The third time you are really playing since everyone will have hopefully realized it is not a game but a story.

RATING: 8
Great, under two conditions:
a) you realise that you're playing co-operatively to win a good story, but you want the Most Valued Player award; you may have to spend the first game or so restraining those who are quite competitive
b) everyone can tell a story; if someone is just stammering all over the place and not saying anything, and that's just where their capacities are at, then unfortunately it just spoils it for everyone, and they have to either decide not to play, be told not to play, or the game avoided when they're around.

Absolutely far removed from my idea of fun. I like certain party games but here there are no rules to follow to judge what you are doing. It's to cahotic, everyone talks, am i allowed to go on with the storytelling, is this the right moment to interrupt you... no one knows, no one cares... it's just a wild mess of people talking.
Maybe with the correct people it's a good game.... i am not the correct people

Storytelling game that has no distinct set of rules about when the storyteller is taking too long or how many cards he/she is allowed to cram into one sentence.

Card driven story telling game.  Have played this three times (one play was with a game very similar) and the focus on the card play from hand diminishes any real storytelling and the rules lawyers kill any chance for fun.

You know, I thought this was an entertaining, well-thought-out storytelling game.. until I played with one friend who was too competitive for her own good.  After a couple of games of her throwing every card into a single sentence (and yes, I know that's illegal according to the rules...) and 'winning' in a single minute, I put it on my shelf of languishing games.

Not a game exactly, more an activity and a means to creative interactions. It catches my teen's interest and so I like it especially for that. It also is a good push to develop better story-telling abilities.

Quirky rules. Many games receive the comment that it is good only with the right group. Of all such games, this 'make up a fairy tale' game is the one tha comment most strongly applies to.

I love the idea of a story telling game.  I've only gotten to play it once so far, but I do enjoy it. 

Friends aren’t story tellers. Cards are in their own Deck box inside the HUGE box this game in.

So many surprisingly wonderful stories have been made with my friends and this game. A definite classic. If you don't like using/sharing your imagination with other people or are painfully socially awkward, this may not be for you. On the other hand, if you like that sort of thing, this game really lends itself to weave ridiculous stories that have everyone laughing. A very pleasant ride for a game. Making the story is more important than winning.

A great hit with my non-gamer family. I love card games, board games, and RPGs and this game hits a sweet spot as a warm-up game for any of those. Very often, the tribe just want to play a couple of games of this and nothing else :D We seem to get a lot of flying Princesses these days...

Not so easy for everyone to follow and after a few games you can feel the need of its expansions, in order to evade coming up with a story very similar to a previous one...

This is probably the most unique game I own.  My wife really enjoys it and I think most of my friends will, as well.  Similar to The Big Idea, or various party games where you aren't really interested in the game aspect as much as just having a good time and listening to people make fools of themselves.

RATING: 6
fun quasi-rpg game of telling stories by using plot elements available to you on the cards. i've used this as an icebreaker before, or as a way to stir the imagination when getting writer's block -- but there's not a lot of substance to this as a "game".

I can't really rate this as I haven't yet played with the full rules... but Hazel and I enjoy using the cards to play cooperatively to tell a story.  We each get a hand of cards and play one when its our turn to further the story until we get to a good ending place (usually once we've played all our cards).  Its great creative fun!

Sometimes this game works well. Most of the time it doesn't. This one is very dependent on the group dynamics and the cognitive flexibility of the players.

Great game when played with proper people, who like to role play from time to time. Its mechanic isn't perfect, you can easily exploit it - like keeping cards like 'princess' to the very end of a game, so you can save the story for yourself when nobody expect this.

It's all about people. I've found perfect group to play with, we got tons of fun, so my rating for Once Upon a time is 10.

Good idea, to make shared story telling into a game.  Just not enough structure to make it competitive and you really need the right group of like minded people to play it.  This is a very niche game. Most people I know hate it.

RATING: 5.6
This is a great concept for a game, and definitely produces entertainment proportional to people's twisted creativity, memory, and story integration skills.  Unfortunately, while you wait to break into the story, you have to keep scanning your cards &#8212; cards which we have to stack vertically to see what they are, due to a strange card layout &#8212; to catch that opportunity to break into the story.  Of course, while working so hard to break in, you miss details that would make your chunk of the story a smooth inclusion.  Also, once you blow most of your cards working toward your story end, you pretty much shoot your chances of actually reaching it if someone steals, or your ideas are exhausted temporarily.  This game would probably be an unstoppably good party game if the game were tweaked a little to disallow the hogging of a story &#8212; Let's face it:  Anyone fairly creative can keep the story in their court indefinitely, as long as others don't steal, and once you are familiar with the sorts of cards in the game, your story can wend carefully around those terms and concepts that allow people to swipe control.  The Game Cabinet variant helps address the Screwed-at-the-End syndrome, but I look for someone (maybe me &#8212; who knows? ;^) to solve the downtime problem of this game.
Finally, some people just aren't as good at telling stories, or making things up, as others, and keeping the game fairly handicapped can make it boring, while not handicapping frustrates and alienates

This game depends entirely on the people who are playing it. If they're good at ad-libbing things, then the game is an absolute blast. If they're not as good, it becomes a bit of a chore.

A good game, great for memory training and creativity. My only complaint is superficial with the advent of blank cards. The various 'actors' in the cards are light fantasy without heavy gravitas. I would place them in the Disney Fantasy rather than Grimm's or even the varied Mythologies of the world.  Grab some blank cards and add in more monsters. It'll spice it up.

Storytelling game that I never got the knack of. The rules state that the story should be plausible, but how plausible is a story that is pulled to different endings each time the turn changes? In the end, the story is a mish-mash of completely random stuff and nothing can hep it out of its misery.

My only real problem with this game is that it's tough to find the right mix of people to play the game.  I personally think it's a great deal of fun, but most people I introduce the game to turn their noses up to it.  Even after playing it, I find a lot of people just don't get the point of it.  Regardless, it can be an incrediably fun (and funny) game if you have the right mix of people and drinks.

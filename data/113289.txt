This is everything I love about Cards Against Humanity without the things I hate about Cards Against Humanity.  Having to pitch your card choice also adds a nice dynamic, which can often evolve into mudslinging your rival salesmen's products.

A silly, funny parlour game, which feels like it's lifted from "Whose Line Is It Anyway?". There's scope for bad feeling here, if your "funny" sales-pitches are never picked as the favourite, but with generous, witty players, this is a lot of fun. It could get tiresome though.

The game is very easy to pick up and play, I can explain the rules in under 40 seconds. The length of the game can be changed easily on the fly, too. I did think the box was a little ridiculously huge just to be holding cards, and I wish there were a few more cards, but other than that the game was a blast.

I don't usually enjoy party games very much, but Snake Oil is the silliest, the loudest and the craziest one I've ever played. 

The very idea of selling crazy infomercial kind of products is brilliant and it's capable of bringing out a strong social experience. On many levels Snake Oil reminds me of Cards Against Humanity - a game that I hate - but it's a way better game than that, because it doesn't have the same horrifying vulgarity.

I'm not often in the mood for party games, as I generally prefer other kinds of game... that's why I'm giving it a rating of 6,5. But when I want to play a party game, this is one I'll definitively pick up from the shelf.

With the right group, this is a 10 star party game. With the wrong group its a 6. If your group consists of creative, extroverts, with a witty sense of humor you can expect to laugh until your abs hurt. It does suffer from dull, uninspiring cards slowly monopolizing your hand after a few rounds, but getting a brand new hand usually refreshes the creativity. Also, this is one of those games where if you are keeping score, you are missing the point. If you laughed until it hurt, then you won.

Snake Oil is built on the Apples to Apples concept of offering the best match for a card drawn by another player.  That's where it ends with A to A; Snake Oil gives the game a huckster-ish sales theme, with each player making a pitch as to why their ludicrous product, assembled from two single word cards, is the best match. With players prepared to get into the spirit, this added dimension makes for a good deal of hilarity.  

The presentation of the game fits its theme nicely.  The cards are a little flimsy, the box insert is crap and the box is about twice as large as necessary.

My favourite non pen-and-paper party game. I have played a bad game of it before. But that doesn't hold back the hundreds of other times that I've had laugh-out-loud and amazing rounds of it. The hardest I've ever laughed at a board game ever. This for me was the CAH killer.

Good party game, but almost a bit too challenging for me to be continually creative, and so it loses some points there.  For others it might not wear off as fast, and it does create some funny moments.  Good but not great

This is a fun little party game with a similar theme to The Big Idea and other games with invention/selling as the main thrust.  We were given a copy by a friend whose cousin was the graphic designer for the game.  I didn't know what to expect, but ended up being very pleasantly surprised.  It works very well for creative groups.

It's a judge-based party game, so of course the final decision of "which one was best" is going to be decided however the judge wants it to be, be it because it was actually the best answer, or because the judge is mad at you for screwing them over earlier in the game. However, this human error flaw doesn't really impact the gameplay because everyone has so much fun pitching their product. Everyone gears up their pitch and sells it the best they can. Great with groups of people experienced with improv. Fun party game,

2010, 3-10p, AVOID, essentially an Apples to Apples type of party game -- you have a hand of single word cards and you make pairs of words (usually trying to be funny) and hope your pair is the favorite of the picker for that round. Blah!

RATING: 7
A nice party game where you are taking two cards and creating a product that you then have to sell to a specific kind of client (teacher, athlete, robot, etc.).  It is fun and funny but like card party games of this kind it does suffer from the whatever turns where you just pick cards out of your hand to get rid of them without thought of winning the round.

The game has the potential to encourage creativity and humour, and I have seen it do this. However, when I play I feel uncomfortable with the way points are distributed. I'm always worried about hurting someone's feelings. You know, that one person who's products never get chosen.

RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 9 players:

Inferior knockoff of The Big Idea. Can be made better through using Big Idea rules if you can't find a copy of The Big Idea or your group is too familiar with Big Idea cards.

First, the limitation of only being able to play EXACTLY 2 cards per invention is just nonsense. There is no good reason for this. This is where I suggest using Big Idea rules - play as many (or as few) cards as you like. The object should be to make the best/funniest invention, and this is just an artificial limitation that does not make you think more creatively.

Second, I was surprised by how much I didn't care for the role cards. There is a positive to them: if you've played a LOT of The Big Idea these definitely force you to think about your cards differently, which can be cool and interesting. However mostly what it means is on any given turn nobody is playing their BEST and funniest invention, simply because it's not suitable for the judge's role. This results in overall less laughs every round than The Big Idea. I went through the whole game with a hilarious invention and never got to play it simply because I could never make it work for any of the roles. This would be fun for a every-once-in-awhile-to-spice-things-up kind of play but I just don't think the longevity is as good WITH the roles.

Third, I think The Big Idea's mixup of adjectives and nouns is just better. Yeah in this game, any given card can work as either, but I just feel like there's less variety in the cards themselves. The judge role adds variety instead which I think is a weak substitute.

So certainly you can use these cards to play a fun game of The Big Idea. But with the rules as written it's just not as good.

RATING: 6
Fun party game with the right crowd. Creative extroverts seem to excel at the game, which requires some measure of ad-libbing your way through a sales pitch. It is full of laughs and silliness that can work really well with the right crowd. It is as simple as Apples to Apples (which I do not enjoy), but does not feel quite as subjective. Often the entire group agree which of the sales pitches was the best. It is simple and even works well with lots of people.

This completely displaced any Apples to Apples / Dixit-type games for me. It offers a framework for such unbridled creativity and humor. Like those other games, if you're not playing with a group that can do light improv, this isn't going to go well.

BUT IF YOU DO, it has the potential to be a great experience.

Overall a 7.  As a party game, an 8.  Using the Apples to Apples framework, this game lets you argue for your answer to the judge in the form of a sales pitch.  The judge takes on a new persona each round, so you always sell to a different personality type instead of the actual person at the table.

A Party Game of Fictional Products, where you have to convince a judge to pick your entry.

This game is definitely good for some laughs. Unfortunately, in the wrong hands it can get as raunchy as CAH (well, almost). Giving the sales pitch is the fun part of the game (with the right group), but it also turns the gameplay into a popularity contest since everyone knows who's selling what. Probably doesn't matter much since it is more about having fun than winning.

Very much in the vein of Apples to Apples (or CAH) with the addition of an explicit pitch "phase" to sell/explain your selected cards to the judging player. I kind of like this mechanic, but it's the exact opposite of the Dixit-style approach of anonymizing the selected cards (which I also like). Overall, though, I'm just not that into this kind of game.

I like this game, which is unusual because I don't like role-playing or acting. But somehow, I can pull it off in this game.

Nice.  Play with whatever hand size you need in order to have fun.

Quite often one gets a hand of fairly dull cards.  nose, hand, ring, tent... While it's true that better comedians might be able to work with that, it'd be nice if mortal players could draw back up from *two* draw decks: one for the mundane words, and one for the more unusual terms such as 'future', 'danger', 'regret', 'mistake', 'revenge', to give a better chance of a funny invention.

This game can be favorably compared to The Big Idea.  In each round, one player plays the role of a "customer", who is assigned a specific type like a clown, executioner, nurse, or couch potato. Each other player takes turns pitching a new product to that one person using any two cards (each containing one word) out of the 6 they'll have in their hand.  This can be hilarious or just crazy stupid, but with a creative group of people, I can hardly imagine having more fun.

It needs the right group but, if you can muster it, this is an amazing party game. I've had such a laugh playing this with friends. It's like CAH but you have to use imagination and a bit of patter rather than having the jokes cued up for you.

Fires Apples to Apples due to the creativity needed with this game

RATING: 7.75
I prefer this game over But Wait, There's More! for a few reasons: 1) replayability is there, whereas with But Wait it's pretty much absent; 2) you have more control and creative room to throw out your zany products, more time to consider what you have to say to deliver a good sales pitch. But Wait is more improv, and it can lead to many laughs as well, but with improv, once you've seen it, it's difficult to be more creative afterwards. Also, you have a very limited number of items to work with. With Snake Oil, you have all the different possible combinations to form the product you want.

Fantastic social game with an outgoing, creative crowd.

Okay game idea but it is so group dependant. My parties include alcohol and this game just falls flat each time. For groups who shun alcohol or just have natural salesmen it can be mildly entertaining but without one or two sober people to carry it, it just quickly falls flat for me.

My favourite of this type of 'judge picks' party game. The words on the cards are so well-chosen and can be combined in an infinitude of ways. I've found the game brings out people's creativity like no other game of its type. ACTUAL PROPER CREATIVITY too, not just 'pick the funniest two cards and hope for the best.'

If you've ever wanted to watch in mounting horror as your mother-in-law tries to sell a policeman on her terrifying new 'revenge virus' invention, this is the game for you.

Technically, this is not a game. People arbitrarily pick who gets a point each turn. Since you can't keep the identities of the salesmen secret, then all sorts of non-game factors can play into who gets the point. However, as a social activity, this can be a lot of fun with the right, out-going crowd. I'm glad I own a copy. But if they are going to sell this as a game, I have to rate it as one.

Snake Oil is a hilariously creative party game!  You choose two words to create a silly product to try and sale to a customer.  This is an Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity killer.  The combinations are endless as is the ability to be creative.  With that said I can't give it a 10 because not everyone will enjoy the improv skills needed to play this game.  Still loads of fun and family friendly.

Like Cheapass Games' The Big Idea, only with trivial Apples-to-Apples judging instead of a voting and investing game.

Some of my best laughs have been playing this game. The game is about having fun and a few laughs. If something like a not totally balanced scoring system is going to turn you off, you're missing the point.

Snake Oil is a mildly entertaining Apples to Apples variant.  On your turn you draw a card that gives a type of person, or occupation.  Everyone else around the table then looks at their hand of cards that features items.  They combine two item cards to create some strange product, which they then try to "sell" to you.  They do this by talking up how this product would benefit you.  You then decide which product is best, and then give your occupation card to the person who came up with the winning product.  The player with the most occupation cards at the end wins.

The same problem arises with this game as with all these types of games.  You often wind up with a handful of cards that don't work with the occupations being drawn.  So, turn after turn, you are forced to play nonsensical, and lame card combinations.  It's a game to play once in a very long while.  But let someone else buy it.

Such a fun party game. It operates similarly to Apples to Apples or Cards against Humanity, but the game itself is completely different. As a played, you get to sell your idea. The dumbest combination of cards can end up being the winner, if they are sold in a clever way.

My brother sold 'Hope Juice' to a priest as a low-cost alternative to holy water. My friend Carson sold 'Goggles Map' (he pronounced it like 'Google Maps' with a Swedish accent) to Santa, because Santa forgot about Sweden last year.

A fun party game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
This party game has a lot of similarities to Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity in that one player will judge which card combination is best and each other player will play two cards that are judged. The difference here is that the player who is judging is assigned a role or profession (e.g. hitchiker, astronaut, politician & etc) and each player around the table has a brief period to persuade the ‘judge’ that they should buy their card combination over those of the other salespersons. 

It can be a bit painful all round if you get cards (I think each player has a hand of six or eight to choose combinations from) the just plain old don’t work at all for the intended target.

This is an amusing enough diversion but not something I’d consider for purchase or even want to play all that often. Ordinarily, I’d choose Apples to Apples if I was playing with children or Cards Against Humanity if I was playing with deviants (that's pretty sums up my gaming groups)over Snake Oil.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really was surprised by how much humor this game delivers.  My first play was with my wife and children. They all really hammed it up on their crazy sales pitches.  Like Apples to Apples, the scoring system is really secondary to the laughs.  The game gives each player a chance to show some creativity which actually is something Apples to Apples doesn't have.  If you are looking for a party game which will allow you to learn about your fellow players this is a good choice.

More than likely my party game of choice, from here on out. Very much in the same feel as Apples to Apples, but the creativity, the pitches and the laughs feel so much more authentic than what comes about from Apples to Apples. For those with a quick-thinking mind, this is the game for you. Those individuals will have an idea with their set of words and have at it with a product perfect for their customer.

The big problem is seeing how many customers a player has won and pick another person so that person doesn't win.

More of an activity than a game you play to win.  The rules are so simple that they are printed on the edge of the box and if you've played any modern party game there is nothing new in how scoring works.  That being said it is incredibly funny in action.  You will need people who aren't afraid to be creative and look a bit silly.  The playtime is short and the scoring, while easy to play kingmaker at the end, is ultimately irrelevant.

[EDIT]
May be replaced by "But Wait There's More!" as the scoring in that game adds more of a game element which I find nice, YMMV.

Man. I do not think I have ever laughed as hard at a game night as I did during this game. It's kind of an Apples to Apples sort of experience, with a judge character. You combine two cards to create a specific product to sell to a character. Some of the memorable ones were selling a "Vomit Pocket" to a prom date, a "gun leg" to a soldier, and a "food storm" to a pregnant woman. Really exceeded my fairly low expectations.

7 Plays - A fantastic group game that gets people talking to each other, but in a much more creative way than "fill the blank" party games (aka cards against humanity). You're essentially pitching ridiculous sales ideas to random customers (but secretly also to the person who is going to pick the winning sales pitch). 

I also like that this is super family friendly, but can be made NSFW easily with people who are of that mind.

A game you can play with non-gamers. Very accessible. The fact that cards are viewed (opposed to hidden cards in Apples to Apples) means more communication taking place between the players.

   This is a very group specific game. If you have the right group of people it can be one of the most fun and entertaining game you could find. Must be an outgoing and creative bunch of gamers. If not, it will be a dust collector. 
   One flaw in the game is the scoring system. You could easily sway the way the game goes by voting or not voting for certain people. On the other hand, I had a "right group" to play one night and no one cared who won or loss. We simply enjoyed playing countless rounds of the game that night.

Mix up the deck of cards and deal eight to each player. Each card has a word on it. After one player chooses an occupation card, the rest put two cards together from their hand and make a 30-second sales pitch as to why that occupation needs to buy this particular product. My favorite sales pitch so far was when my daughter tried to sell Heaven Butter to a Priest. A fun party game suitable for all ages. This game works best with a bunch of creative, funny people.

Hey, this is a lot of fun with the right group of people!  Easily a party game and accomodating for virtually any number of players.  It has laughs, is extremely easy to learn and begin playing and doesn't require any gaming knowledge or players to remain focused on the game at all times.  Players can even drop in and out.  Fun party filler.

An immediate fave. Read a 2 sentence rules summary, and bought the game immediately. I wasn't wrong. Allows for such amazing ad-libbing and improv that a half-dozen new family tropes are created over a year of play. 'dad's food puppet' is now something we say. Don't ask.

very light, very fun, goes beyond winning and losing, and into just enjoying being silly around each other in a completely natural, not force-fed or stupid-stagey (cough*CardsAgainstHumanity*cough) way. And what could be better than that? Not much. Allows, gives permission for, people to relax.

This does absolutely not work for me. It is not a game, but an activity - which is ok in theory, but in this case just does not work. There are other games that work better at creating fun stories. In Snake Oil, all that depends on card draws. And of course the evaluation is extremely random. 
Bad, really bad.

A really good party game, actually. It reminds me of Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity, but this is much more entertaining in that it's not just picking the cards, but having to sell the cards. The pitches are where the fun is, and with the right group, you have some downright enjoyable moments. I'd be worried about long-term replayability with this one, but certainly, it can be fun for a while.

Storytelling game with points awarded arbitrarily, a la Apples to Apples. It's a variation on an old ESL activity I used to use, but it's not much fun when the point of the exercise is the game itself. Maybe I'm just jaded.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another great alternative to Cards Against Humanity, but it still suffers from the limited choices available in your hand at any given time. I suggest playing with a larger hand size than the rulebook allows, or create a house rule for mulliganing, or else you will end up with a lot of un-funny rounds.

RATING: N/A
Demo of a turn at GenCon 2012

It's like a lot of other, older games like Cheapass's The Big Idea or the mass market Adversity: you're trying to sell everyone on an idea. The twist here, though, is that each round when a player is the judge, they draw a random card that characterizes the target customer (e.g., pirate, person running away from something, etc.). Then everyone else, Apples to Apples like, picks a pair of their cards and then takes turns making their pitches. The chosen player wins the customer card. After everyone has had a turn as customer, the player with the most customer cards wins!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In the same vein as Apples to Apples, everyone is given a hand of 6 cards each with a word on them.  Every turn a new player picks a card from a stack of different customer personalities (i.e. Pirate, Pro Wrestler, Beach Bum, etc.) and each other player creates a product using two words (i.e. "Rubber Fish", "Space Diamond", "Meat String", etc.) and gives a pitch why the customer should buy his product over the others.

This is one of those games where the enjoyment scales with the people you play with.  It can adjust to how innocent or weird or vulgar the group you are playing with is.  And the more creative and enthusiastic the players are the more fun can be had as we try to sell these ridiculous products.

Definitely an interesting and potentially very enjoyable game.

This is one of those party games that would really flop with the wrong group, but absolutely shines with the right one. If you're willing to get a bit theatrical, can think on your feet, and relax the time constraints a bit one play-through is good for a lot of entertainment.

A suggestion for making it more fun: make a habit of getting into character when you are judging. It provides a mores specific target for sales pitches, and if you get your whole group doing it it's just fun.

Pretty much the same process as The Big Idea, simplified a bit. Similar to Apples to Apples, however each player must pitch his/her idea, so the judge knows which player supplies which idea.

The customer for the round draws a customer card and announces it. Inventors quickly combine two purple word cards from their hand to form a crazy new product to sell to that customer. When ready, each inventor quickly pitches his or her product directly to the customer. The customer decides which product to buy and gives the inventor of that product the round's customer card as the prize.

*Owned for school - single copy*  I pulled this one out to introduce to my class the other day, and they had a lot of fun with it.  We talked about snake oil salesmen and then pulled one character card and six (I think) of the descriptor cards as a class.  Everyone wrote a sales pitch, interested kids then came up to the front of the room to try to sell their item, and we voted on the best products.  So funny to see their personalities come out when they shared! 

My students have also pulled this one out to play on their own during our lunch game club and done very well with it.

A kind of story telling party game, this was a lot better than I'd expected. In an Apples to Apples style, the judge draws a card to tell the players who the customer is for that round (e.g. a billionaire, a vampire, a cheerleader). Everyone else combines two cards from their hand to create a product that would appeal to that customer, then has to persuade the judge that their product is the best, going around the table in turns. This leads to some funny inventions and creative sales techniques. Very entertaining and copes well with large groups without having everyone shouting over each other.

Group dependency is a must for this one.  Hilarity can ensue with relative ease, especially ones the icebreaking is complete.  Uptight groups - I'd rather do anything but this style of game.  Looser/perhaps a couple drinks in type of groups?  This will really pop.

Wish there was something other than apples to apples/CAH-style "scoring" that made it more meaningful, but who cares: it's a party game.

This makes Apples to Apples and Cards against Humanity obsolete. You use two cards to make a product that you have to sell to the customer. So you actually have to use your imagination and put yourself into the game, rather than just picking a card. Almost everyone I've played with has LOVED it. It's hilarious and an easy gateway game to get people hooked on the positive social interaction this game brings with it. This is definitely one everyone should own.

Even with the mitigation, there's too much luck.  And even with the options, there's too much doing what the dice tell me to do.

Backstabbing kinda makes it worthwhile though :)  

I wish the dice were custom made to have the 4/5/6 sides replaced by mayor token/bribe token/value cube.

RATING: 4
Kind of disappointing. In theory the game looks great: dice allocation/investment with a modifier mechanic that gives you more control over your rolls. In practice, however, you all too often have no choice of what to do with your dice, so the game just seems to play you.

Sometimes you can go bust in two rolls, whereas sometimes turns can go on for ten rolls, or more. The end result is that sometimes one player will basically lose his turn, and then has to watch the other player roll and roll and roll for five minutes. It's not a very fun experience. (To be fair, we weren't very aggressive with our Mayor tokens, so maybe more plays will bump this up for us once we learn to exploit them more.)

RATING: 8
Rated as 2-player filler.  I like push-your-luck games, but most of them are so weak on decisions that they leave me cold.  This one was better than the others who have entered my collection only to be quickly traded or sold away.

The only negative is that it really takes a while to remember what the dice do at different numbers.  There is a helpful player aid, but you have to use it an awful lot for a few plays to get it.

Capo Dei Capi is one of, if not the best "push your luck" games out there. Designed by Dr. Steve Finn (of Biblios fame), CdC puts you in the 1930s mob world of a major city where bribing officials and gambling on influence with various locales will make or break you. 

This 2-player only game requires a not only a a great deal of bluffing, but risk taking as well. Players take turns rolling the dice and placing money on various "locations" to buy more and more influence. Roll too many repeat numbers, however, and you bust. Few things are more frustrating in gaming as watching an entire turn of carefully placed influence vanish because you push for one more roll. 

There's a nice element of "blind" betting as well. Depending on the dice, players place blind influence on locales that may or may not be revealed by the other player (again, at the will of the dice) later on. 

Overall, Capo Dei Capi is a solid, quick game that rides a fine line between filler and "full" game. There's a significant amount of player interaction and the press-you-luck mechanic is perfect. A feather in the cap is the fact that it is 2-player only, which is fantastic for couples or a "heavy filler" for regular game night.

RATING: 5
Breathing new life into push your luck.  The use of mayor tokens to mess with other player or help out yourself, keeps both players active.  Some hidden points and some not brings a nice gambling/risk  feel to it.  Plays out in just the right amount of time.  I can understand the theme and how it fits to the game play but when I rolled a 4 and a 5 it didn't feel like extortion.  Finally, the price is great but it would be nice to have some different shape or size to some of the tokens to help distinguish them.

Fun, fast-playing two-player game. Like any dice game, luck can sometimes go against you, but there are a reasonable number of options available to mitigate pure luck. Not as strong a game as Biblios, but compared to many push-your-luck fillers, this is a game that will take quite a while to wear out its welcome.

RATING: 6
Our first play got mixed reviews. My wife had some of the worst luck ever, so guess who didn't like it. I just enjoyed trying to calculate my probability of busting, but otherwise, I didn't really see much "game" here. However, based on some other reviews, we may not have been giving the mayor actions as much consideration as we should have. We basically just used them to avoid busting, but maybe we should have been more strategic with them. I'm willing to give it one more try, but it may not stick around in my collection.

On our third play, my wife beat me 23 to 0 (while she was shopping on the Internet). That might be a record. So, the dice will be the ultimate factor in winning (if they are totally one-sided), but if they are "fair", then using the mayor powers does allow for some (very limited) decisions that I found interesting (besides just letting you reroll). But, I wouldn't really call this a "game"; it's more a sustitute for gambling that I find entertaining.

It was OK for what it is. The basic idea of just using the two dice works very well, you get a lot of actions and some choice from it. But so so so fiddly to remember all the actions and the mayor actions and oh took us longer to understand than to actually play.

The player aid is way to fiddly. All those rules need to be broken down onto those little marker cards. That is, make the markers big enough to show all the relevant 4/5/6 dice rules. Then add something to make all the mayor chip actions obvious. The rest of it was easy to follow, although some of the language was ambiguous.

Hard to catch up too. Once one player has bust out a couple of times, the other player needn't take many risks. I liked it. I wouldn't buy it myself but I'll play your copy.

Neat. But two things have inhibited me from playing again: (1) in the end the bribe markers didn't actually create any uncertainty about who was winning any of the locations, and (2) rolling well seems like a more important part of the strategy than any of the decisions.

RATING: 7.25
This is a nice 2-player push your luck game, with a mob theme and nice artwork.

The components are very solid, and the play has some interesting choices.

Mayor chips give players some nice option to achieve goals and/or avoid penalties, but they are scarce resources, to be used with consideration.

The Battle Line area control is weighted with assigned value cubes, which makes some tiles far more important than others.

Another solid game from Dr. Finn!

Squarely in the Can't Stop family of games, but more complex -- there's even a FAQ on the back of the player aid! I didn't really grok what makes this 2-player push-your-luck game different from similar, multi-player push-your-luck games. But rolling dice is fun.

RATING: 7.5
After 3 plays, I have to say, this is a neat game! I didn't particularly enjoy our first game because I thought the game would be more strategic. The rules are a little complex (for a filler) and they sort of fool you into thinking the game is deeper than it is. It's not deep at all. I'd say it's 70% luck and 30% skill. There are certainly some things that you can do to outmaneuver your opponent. But, a great player can easily lose to a poor player, time after time, with bad dice rolls. I don't think that makes it a bad game. It just makes it a mostly luck-based game. If you can accept that going in, then I think you'll enjoy this one. Some people, however, will never be able to accept it. I've seen comments that this game is a luck fest with no real decisions to make, and that the game plays you rather than you playing it. I can see the frustration, but I disagree. Don't get me wrong, this game can be really upsetting if you don't accept it as a simple filler. Nevertheless, the more you play the game, the more you learn how to manipulate the dice. It's not a particularly intuitive game, but that doesn't mean that certain elements are non-existent. I really like it!

Way too many references to the player aid for a game of this weight.  You may be able to get past this if you play a lot.  But if you leave it on the shelf even for a couple of weeks, you have to learn all the combinations all over again.  The set up time for a filler like this is also too long.  All of this combined makes this a light game that is not worth the time investment.

This is a small push-your-luck dice rolling area control game.  Each turn a player will roll two dice and what they come up as will dictate what you do, usually playing influence in a specific area.  If ever you are asked to place influence in the same area twice, roll doubles twice, or go off the end of a central track then you lose everything and your turn is over.

One mechanism I am not fond of in most games that have it, including this one, is the immediate ending mechanism.  Especially in a game as fluid as this where any given turn one player can do so much more than the other.  To also give a person the ability to get a whole extra turn and just end it without the other player being able to answer is just crappy.

This game is all luck and very little strategy in my opinion.  Almost the only decision you get to make is whether to go again or not.  Most of the dice rolls dictate exactly what you get to do, usually placing influence in one spot or another.  I guess that is another small decision but usually where to place the influence is a given based on what's already there.  It really just boils down to rolling dice for 30 minutes hoping you get luckier than your opponent.

:thumbsup: The fact that you can make your opponent re-roll by paying a mayor chip keeps you engaged even on your opponent's turn.
:thumbsup: It is exciting to press your luck freely for as long as you want with a danger that a failure will undo all of your progress. I much more prefer this over re-rolling dice Yahtzee-style trying to marginally improve your initial result.

:thumbsdown: The game can feel arbitrary, e.g. when on your turn you roll to place a value cube on a tile where your opponent has the majority. This can also immediately end the game (together with your turn). So even though you were not taking any risks in this example, you still lost your turn. And this feels arbitrary in a game that is otherwise about pushing your luck and risk management.
:thumbsdown: Some decisions are present, but they are purely mathematical, disguised as gambling. It's relatively easy to find out your exact odds of busting on any given turn. Consequently, the game can be solved and played flawlessly strictly following a chart, not that many would bother making one. So just don't think too much about it.

The design seems fine in that the push-your-luck element drives the main choices in the game, but it also seems like there are very few decisions to make related to the roll of the dice.  Every roll combination tells you how to place the dice, unless you roll both dice below 4 (and even then, it's one of two things).  The use of the mayor tokens may add another choice to your decision, but even then, it doesn't seem like enough to make the game interesting.  It's disappointing.

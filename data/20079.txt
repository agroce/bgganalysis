Reasonably good as a filler.  The sort of game I'd always be happy to play at the end of a gaming session.  One really good quality is that you can more or less play this until you get fed up with it - "shall we just go once more around with battles and then call it quits?"

Cards are a little difficult to follow - I'm sure that they could have been a little bit more user friendly....no big deal though as you soon get the hang of it.

There are a lot of these sort of short, naval card games around these days.  I have to say that this is not as much fun or as interesting as The Kaiser's Pirates, but it's nonetheless a goodish game if you like this sort of thing - if you hate wargames, then it won't be for you.

Historical flavor text on the cards was good for learning more on WWII.  Seems like the game needs at least 4 experienced players (and preferably 6) to get the most out of it.

I was very surprised.  A trick-taking card game with a WWII theme didn't sound too exciting, but it really is a blast.  Only drawback is that requires a lot (4-5) players to really shine and it takes a long time to play (but there are rules to cut the game-time down by 2/3).  However, it is great fun and generates a lot of table talk.

I played this twice at Origins 2008 and enjoyed it both times.  I think the battle deck is a little long at times, but the card play action and theme are a lot of fun.  I would like to try a seven player game sometime and a historically orginized card order.

This might be a little low, but the poor game came into our group under a thundercloud of rule confusion, for some reason.  It straightened out into a fair enough game, every time it's potentially come out for another go it's been overruled.

Update: Played again, some rule confusion again, but I've seen enough now to say that the mechanics here are fine.  I think familiarity with the deck is a must to play this with much skill, and so it's not a game I'd buy to play once in a longish while - you'd want to have runs at it to build or reinforce deck knowledge.  In this kind of game, card balance is especially important, and I don't have enough plays to tell whether that's an issue; all I can say is that we haven't found anything obviously broken as yet.

One card, multiple values, play them at the right time, be it Japanese or Allied, score some points and off to the next 'battle'.....

Couldn't be any simpler for a war theme card game.

This game is a little like top trumps, plus has the potential to let you actually learn about the Pacific campaign during the second World War. 
Hmmm, I know that doesn't sound like fun to most people but it really is! It plays well, and is easy to get started and learn. And with different game plays and a couple of little bits we didn't understand this game will definitely be one that gets played a lot.

RATING: 4
this rating might stick out like more of a sore thumb than it would if i had rated atlantic storm instead, but this was my first experience with the system.  decent cardstock from what i recall, great pics, great historical flavor text.  i think the icons, day/dusk colors, and especially the fate stuff could have been more clear but i'm sure it doesn't rate to be an issue with repeated play.  as for the game itself, it was sludging along at a snail's pace in my 5P game with four newbies.  hopefully just a beginner's thing, but it doesn't bode well for what's billed as a light and fast card game.  my biggest knock is in the gameplay, though, as i don't feel like a person gets to make many decisions in the game.  even with negotiation, you have a limited selection of cards and only a fraction of them will be playable on any given hand.  even if it flowed better, i don't see myself wanting to play this game.  i'd love to look over the cards, though.  wargamers might have a preference for this over other light card games, but i'm inclined to think it's just bad bias.

Arrived 3/08. I'm an Atlantic Storm fan. Played 4/08 with 4 players. Somewhat more complex than Storm with a lot more options...made lots of rules mistakes, but lots of battles went to the second round increasing the tension. 3 player still OK, but single powerful cards such as 'Mushahsi' tend to dominate play. 5 or 7 player may be most interesting, but rating well worth it.

This game has got a diferent mechanic to most of the games I've played (that is good). But as most of the games for 3 players, anytime 2 goes aginst the other his got not chance (and that is realy bad). It's a nice game, but it depends a lot with who you play it.

Played once as a 6-player game.  Maybe there is more control with fewer players, but I found Typhoon to be almost entirely random.  It also took 120 minutes to play.  

One player was unable to play a single card five battles in a row!  Wargamers and perhaps Card players are more accepting of this than I am.  Deciding to discard 1 card versus discarding your entire hand makes it difficult to actually manage your hand with any strategy in mind.  Especially since only the starting player gets to decide which suits/time of day/year of a battle are acceptable AND this criteria changes for every battle.

Great game that recently played well with 6. A few more twists than Atlantic Storm and more enjoyable according to most in our group.I was dealt often    enough so many of my ships went to the bottom to earn me last place. On a recent play with four, we discovered that when a player chooses to discard in a round, you'll get either a lopsided victory with few spoils or everybody backs down. I like this game with at least 5. We are playing the team game next and it seems like that will make the 4 player chrono-logical game much more enjoyable.

RATING: 8
Relatively light WWII card game set in the Pacific. Two card decks comprise the whole of the game. One is a series of "Battle" cards which depict a battle (EG. Midway, Iwo Jima, etc.) and the other deck is composed of "Force" cards which depict a submarine, surface ship or aircraft. Battle cards can be either day, night or either (dealer chooses) and state the name of the battle and the year in which it was fought. The dealer, after dealing six Force cards to each player or refilling a player's hand, deals two Battle cards and chooses one of them as the battle to be "fought." The deal rotates around the table until the Battle card deck has been exhausted and the players total the value of the cards they have accumulated through the "spoils of war" process to determine the winner.

Each Force card shows a picture of the unit along with stats for its use in air, surface or subsurface engagements (sometimes only one or perhaps all three). It will also list the year(s) it was available. Like the Battle cards some Force cards are night only, day only or either. Cards played must be applicable to the battle chosen by the dealer with respect to the year and whether it is day or night, and further whether the battle is an air, surface or subsurface engagement (which determines which of the stats on the card apply), or whether the battle is "combined" in which case all the numbers on the card are totalled. In addition to "calling" the battle, the dealer starts the play to the round by playing a card (sometimes two) which will be either Japanese or American. Each player in turn plays to the hand choosing which side to be on then the side with the highest total wins. Battle and most of the Force cards have a VP value and are the object of the game to collect. After the battle has been decided, the winner's Force cards will be discarded but the Battle card and the loser's Force cards are distributed among the winners as "spoils." The player who contributed the most to the winning side's total determines who gets what.

So, "trick taking" with several twists and dripping with theme. A little long for a "filler" and not quite meaty enough for a main game but for those nights when you have a bit more time at the end this fits the bill very well. There are definite dynamics regarding turn order and decision points as to which battles to highly contest and which to skip (you can always simply discard a card), but in the end it is a card game with a lot of unpredictability. Despite that, it is a fun game to play.

Good God, $40 for this? I've been tempted because I sorta liked Atlantic Storm, although almost nobody else I know did. I ran across it in my local game store the other day in its small box and said hey, I should check that out. How much is it? But I was absolutely floored by the price tag. Maybe I'll think about it mail-order.

This is my first comment (and rate) on a title that I do not actually own.  A copy is coming home, anyway...
The game is really fun to play and it's more than one game in the box. You can actually play in teams (Japanese against Allied) or everybody by themselves. Both the ways are really fun to play and very different to play. You can consider it a filler but maybe you could end up playing it more than initially expected...

[21/12/2016] Now I've got a copy. The game is a blast. Fun is the keyword here. And the game is unexpectedly very fun! In our group we find that the team play is the best one.

RATING: 7
I wasn't sure I'd like the Pacific theme as well as the Atlantic, but I do. The submarine war isn't as well known as in the Atlantic, so the choice of submerged as the setting of the battle doesn't quite seem as thematic to me, as the parent game.

The changes from AS are minor and are all for the better, in my opinion. The game works well, although I do think an appreciation for the history of the theme is crucial to really enjoy it to the fullest. When I've played with players purely as a game (with no theme benefit), its a little lukewarm.

The components, art and card stock are all great. This is one that I hope to play more, but I'm a little concerned will be hard to get to the table. I think you really want 6 players to make this work the best.

A fun, abstract, WWII based trick-taking game. The theme is very well integrated into the mechanics with the day/night time of battle, year restrictions, bonus cards and the fate rule. The people who think the theme is "thinly pasted on" have no idea what they're talking about, and probably don't know WW2 history at all.

IMO, this one is much better than its cousin [i]Atlantic Storm[/i] thanks to the day/night mechanic, leader cards, supplemental cards, and better historical flavor.

I'm usually a huge fan of Ben's designs, but this one is a big exception. It's a somewhat pointless trick-taking game in which you are likely to have most of your hand unplayable. Even if you can play a card, many times you have no alternate choice and thus no real decision.

RATING: 6
Essentially a trick-taking game where players play cards on either the Allies or Axis side of a battle, and the highest team total wins.   The highest individual player takes the loser's cards, and divvies them up to the winning side for points.   It's too long and pretty random, with too many special conditions (day, night, planes, ships, subs, events, year restrictions, etc) but still a pretty good card game.

Boring in gameplay. There are too many constraints to card play which means that players rarely have any real choices. What to play each turn is either obvious or forced.

The younger sister of Atlantic Storm. I always say that the most fun I've had playing games has been playing Typhoon or Storm. The game does offer strategy to experienced players who know the cards but, it really comes down to the fact that this is a card game! At the same time anyone who gets to far behind can still have a good time picking on the leader, and in that time they might be able to come back. The negotiation element in this game is superb. 

A lot of the time you won't know who the winner will be. 

This game's only flaw comes from being very hard to get into. Even after half the game new players are lost and still find it hard to make good choices. 

This game is good in many situations. Adding beer is always a plus. 

Play with 4-6

PT takes a few rounds to get your head wrapped around the cards but that's it.  The fun part is guessing other players intentions.  Table talk should be encouraged.

Comment posted after one play. There's something weird playing both the US and the Japanese in the same game, but the weirdest thing is when a battle is won with all the players playing cards for the same part: where's the enemy gone then? We tried it with 3 players (weak game) and it left me very cold. Invariably everyone played his strongest card or changed his whole hand of cards, with the last player almost always deciding the outcome. I had a very strong feeling as we were playing Briscola with different suits and the theme is pasted on. Beautiful cards however, but too much chaos driven. Must try it with more players.

A WWII-themed card game.  Battles are drawn from the deck and players bid cards on either the American or the Japanese side, with the most important player on the winning side divvying up the spoils.  There are several interesting characteristics of both the battles and the ships that can be played, building interesting complications on to this very simple structure.  Interesting, enjoyable, and I'd like to get to know it better. (1 play)

First played May 21st, 2008. Taught in 15min, played in 2.5 hours with 7 players. This will take a while to get use to. I'd recommend making cheat sheets for new players so it doesn't get too confusing. There are two decks, battle cards (40) and force (125) player cards. Each player gets an initial hand of 6 force cards. The starting player is dealt two battle cards and choose which one to play for. Battle cards are worth a certain number of victory points. Both card characteristics include VPs(0-7), night(black)/day(blue)/choose(can be played as either), year(41-45). There is one special battle card that lets you replay any previous battle. Battle cards also have an icon that denote extra hand limit cards (Green R = 1 extra; two 1/2 green; limit 9 total; some do not have a green icon). Force cards are either Allied(blue border) or Japan(red); have an suit(Air/Surface/Subarine) attack value in the upper left corner(some have a ? to indicate one die roll per ? or a plus sign to indicate they are played with other cards). The start player picks the battle time(day/night) if allowed and a suit where battle will take place(can pick combine). Only cards meeting the year, battle time and suit chosen will affect the outcome of the battle. Then starting with the start player, each plays one card, discards one card, or discards all hand cards in hopes of being part of the side that has the most force pts combine and utimatly the high contributor for the winning team. Some cards have a lightning bolt indicating it has a corresponding card that counters it(if played they get that card as a hidden VP). If there is a tie between sides then all force cards are turn over and placed under the battle card and the next player gets it as their battle card. If a side wins, then the player with the most force contributed gets the battle card and gives each contributing player a card and keeps the rest for himself(ties go to first played card). Once all battle cards are exhausted, the game ends with the winner with the most VPs. This playes too long for my preference, however it is put together pretty well.

I'd like another crack at this. There's quite a bit of symbology packed onto these cards (year, day/night, air/surface/sub, etc) that makes it tricky at first to figure out which ones in your hand are even eligible to play. Some very simple negotiation elements lend some flavor.

This game feels like it's close to being great, with a lot of interesting ideas... but maybe too many ideas. It would definitely get better with repeat plays as the players become more comfortable with the mechanics and things can flow smoother. We played with 6, which helped make things chaotic, but I suspect fewer players would be less interesting.

Very similar to Atlantic Storm, but Japanese vs. US as opposed to Allies vs. Germany.  Some cards are just way too powerful and I often felt like I couldn't add any real value to the battle or most of my cards were unplayable.  I have often wondered how much play testing was done on this game or Atlantic Storm.  For what this game is, it is way overpriced.  I'll be looking to unload my copy sometime soon.

(Rating based on several plays)

Strange game: combines party-game mechanics with wargaming theme. I think that 4 players is not enough to fully enjoy the game. Plays much better with 5 players. Card draw can spoil the fun - we actually had few situations where players negotiated between each other, but a couple of times all players decided to play on the same side and competed to get the most combat points to win the battle and claim the spoil. Also, we never had any Force card victimized by another. Game takes almost two hours to play - that's a bit too long for a filler game. I could play Combat Commander scenario in this time.

Although the theme might not be appealing to everyone, this game is suitable for many people : the mechanics are simple, there is much interaction between players, alliances barely last more than a few turns.

RATING: 7
I believe this game shines with more players, and I don't believe I would play with less than 5.  Players need to realize this is a battle game and be willing to jump out and oppose the lead player or first couple players.  It was funny to watch someone make a comment that if the second person didn't oppose the first, there was no chance to win.  He, as the second player, supported the first, the remaining three opposed, and us opposition forces won!  Different battles will lead to cardplay in different "suits" based on time of day and where the battle takes place (air, surface, underwater, combined) as well as potential cardplay that interacts with cards other people play.  This game can drag if people struggle to grasp the concept.  Only takes one to make that happen.  As in most card games, there is luck of the draw, but quite a bit can be mitigated over the 20 rounds of the game.  My favorite aspect about the game is the "fated" concept in which a person can play a card that captures/destroys an opponent's card and can swing a battle to their side.  I've seen 10 point swings as a result.

I have been a fan of Avalon Hill's Atlantic Storm for a few years now and I'm very happy to own a similar game without having to pay exorbitant prices on Ebay.  I enjoy the trick taking game with some light historical flavor.  I like the table talk that being able to play on either side of a trick can produce.  The modifications made to this from Atlantic Storm are interesting; I particularly like the "Fog" card but I'm not a fan of the "Renewed Battle" card.

RATING: 8
Pacific Typhoon is the new game using Atlantic Storm card game system. Interesting for its innovation and fast-pace game. The rules are actually easy to digest not as complex as it seems initially by the summary of play in the first few pages, though there are quite a few typos and ambiguities in some places (e.g. binocular shape for ship vs. "wide rectangle" shape for ship in the rulebook). The game is basically a card game but it is meaty enough to require players to develop and follow through a strategy. There are 40 battle (location) cards and 110 force cards (read air, surface and submarine weaponry, including some bonus and event cards). The round leader chooses the battle card among 2 at a time. Each battle card has a VP score, awarded to those who win the battle (see below on spoils). Each player is dealt 6 cards each round to hand and the round leader lead by calling the "suit" of battle. The "suit" represents the time, day and weaponry chosen for the battle. The time in year represents the battle historically fought and that those force cards with the "years" available (at the same or after the historical year) can participate in the battle. Some battles are fought at daytime and some at night, while some can be either ("twilight"). Each force cards itself indicate the day of battle that the force can join in (i.e. a day-only force could not join in a night battle), the combat values at each level (i.e. different at air-surface-subsurface or combined operations). A player can only commit to either the Japanese or the Allied side by playing those nations' cards in turn. At the end of each round, the side with the highest combat values in total win the battle. 

For the winning side, the player who contributed the highest combat values has the right to "divide" the battle "spoils" - the battle card itself plus the losing side's committed battle forces. Some forces have 0 VP while some can have 8. So naturally, the winning player would allocate the highest VP spoil card to himself first, and then the remaining spoil cards evenly among other players of the winning side. At the end of the game (after 20 battles are fought and completed), the player who has the highest VPs spoil cards is declared the winner. If there is a tied, the more battle cards won is the winner. If still tied, the one who has the earliest battle card is the winner (so you are encouraged to win the earlier battles even though they are generally with less VPs). 

The twists for this game lie in the use of the bonus and events cards at the right time, e.g. there is a big spoil card on the table, boosting your forces' combat values and thus your chance of winning the battle. The bonus cards should be attached to your force with the corresponding "parent" card type. Thus, a surface bonus card could not be applied to an air force card etc. Some are added with a +1 bonus if used in the right time of the day (i.e. day or night). While some others have a variable bonus amount by rolling a dice. 

For those who are the old-AH type mathematicians, the call for the correct type of attack with the already known forces discarded in previous battles may increase the chance that the other players or a particular side lacking the appropriate cards to follow "suit". But I suspect if there are many such "grognards" in casual plays. 

Another twist is to follow round leader's suit by placing your "bet" to the side you think it is going to win the battle, in the hope of sharing some spoils after the battle. Of course, you share the spoils only when you have at least 1 combat value contributed to the winning side (a "0" combat value earns you nothing). Obviously you want to be sure about the "trend" of each side winning a particular battle when people before you committed their sides and forces to the table respectively. If you bet the wrong side, your forces committed become the "spoils" to others...No kidding when you lost a battle with substantial forces committed by you. 

That's where the diplomacy and interactions among the players come in. There might not be enough "spoils" cards for the winning player to divide. So people have to talk to each other for securing a "share" if a certain combat value is required to win the battle. Spoils force cards are always kept hidden from the other players. For battle cards, they should always be shown openly as they have "resources" to boost a player's hand with an additional card, for an increased hand size up to 9. 

This is a competitive "game" and I emphasis it is a "game". It is because the battle locations appear randomly so you would feel that you are flying over time to battle (there is a chronological version for the "realist" though). There is also a team-play version for committing players to either side prior to the game. Overall, these add up more value to the game when you get tired of the original. I am pleased to have such a nice and short game (several games in an afternoon session are possible) with some historical chrome.

This game looked great but played a bit painfully the two times I have tried it. A five player game seems to drag on and feels like a trump card game instead of a "wargame". A friend said it well: Yeah, a normal deck card game with a theme thrown messily over the top of it. I find (as with many multi-player games) that the downtime between decisions is too long and my mind wanders off in the long breaks between moves. Not a fan, but love the theme.

My groups love trick-taking game, and this is a fun one to play when we have too many for a normal 4-person game like Spades.

I just wish it didn't run so long.  Playing half a game is the right length for it's depth, but unfortunately that just makes the scoring too random.

A trick-taking game with two "suits" and special powers and a few twists. It's not a wargame and doesn't feel like one. It's not what I would call fun. It's not what I would call deep. It's not what I would call a game I'd like to play more than, say, zero times a year. But it's better than a Euro any day, even if it doesn't exactly make me feel like I'm doing anything other than playing a regular old card game with ships and planes on for suits.

Pacific Typhoon is the follow-up game to Atlantic Storm.  It is a card game with a WWII Pacific Theme.  The components are very well done, with some nice vintage photos.  Some photo's could have been chosen better, like the Mutsu, but these are trifles.  Each player is involved in a historical battle as either the Japanese or American player.  The round leader picks the battle card, from a choice of two, the time (day or night) and then wether it is air, surface, sub-surface or combined. (think suit) Players proceed to lay out cards that fit the year of the battle, time and suit.  Table talk is encouraged and players try to vie to be on the winning side, either Japanese or American and be the high point scorer for that side, so they can distribute the prizes.  Play is quick and fun, as players try to persuede each other to join their side.  Surprises are numerous and cause much merriment or groans of agony!   PT is a light, game that can be played in an hour or two at most.  Everyone I have introduced to it has loved it from 17 year old girls to the old fogies.  Don't hesitate to add this one to your collecton. Atlantic Storm is great too, but will cost you a pretty penny on Ebay.

This sounds like an interesting card game.  It plays kind of long for a card game at ~1hr.

Each turn there is a cargo ship flipped over and players either support or attack the ship.  The player contributing the most decides how the spoils are distributed.

There are a couple of rules to spice it up. This game is gettable for theme, simplicity of rules but depth of play, and player interaction/negotiation.

[i]- Can't believe how well the theme ties in with the game play, especially since this is basically a trick taking game.
- The historical flavor text also has implications during the game since some cards can be eliminated if a specific card is played.
- This game took a few rounds to understand, but once it clicks all the different rules make sense.
- Having the ability to choose how your going to fight (air, land, sub each with their own values) really changes how a hand will be played, including who may ally with you.
- Temporary alliances: this game is all about forming alliances in the hopes of getting a share in the spoils. Love games where alliances are constantly shifting since there will only be one winner.[/i]

RATING: 6
A beautifully themed trick taking game. Each trick is playing to win a battle card, and that battle card is used to help define the suit. The need to have the exact suit, made up of time of day + year + the trick leader's choice of air/surface/sub/combined (each card has values in each) is reminiscent of Xactika, and the same luck issues permeate here. You either have a card that can be played or not. And if you do, is the card you play going to be on the winning side (Allies or Japanese). You really want to be the largest contributor to the winning side, as that will win the battle card and its VPs. You really don't want to add cards to the losing side, as those cards become VPs for the winning side, distributed per their contribution. So there's a lot of luck in the cards you get, and if you're going early in the trick, all you can do is play in hope as you don't know what those after you will do. The game is more fun with more players, with swings of fortune in each battle as the trick progresses. There's not much decision making to be made, and there's a bit of downtime each trick as people work out what's actually playable, and then whether it should be played, but the theme makes the game playable in the end.

A well done, themed trick taking game. 

The theme is well integrated with the game play. The different cards have different strengths for air, surface or submarine (suits). Battles can be for either day or night which limits what cards are available. Also by year which again limits the cards available.

Add in a couple of twists:
Players can play play different sides in different rounds. 
Some cards immediate capture other cards (are fated) or make a card stronger in a particular battle.
The battles act as victory points and as the game timer.
The lead person select one of two battles, the suit and time of day to limit what the other players can do.
The start player rotates so different players get a chance at the end of round stronger position.

Finally the VP allocation controlled by the player who put the largest card in leads to some negotiation
Looks to be best with 5 or 6 players

This is a fun naval card game to play (NOTE: This is not a game of playing fair).  You start with six Force cards.  First player starts the game by drawing two Battle cards.  Player chooses one Battle card discarding the other.  The Battle card may be 'Day', 'Night' or a choice of either.  If there is a choice decide if the battle is going to be Day or Night and will the battle be a Air, Surface, Sub or All.  Look at your Force cards carefully before choosing (The person choosing the battle is at a disadvantage due to their having to start the battle.).  The player chooses to play either a Allied Force card or Axis Force card or discard one Force card or their whole hand.  Play then proceeds to the player's left, with each player making the same decision to either fight, join or discard.  The winning side is determined by totaling the Allied points (air, surface, sub or all) and totaling the Axis points.  Compare the two with the winning side having the most points.  The winner of the battle is the player who played the most points on the winning side.  The winner collects the enemy Force cards and the Battle card.  The cards are then distributed by the winner to the winning team.  Remember it is the distribution of cards (not the points).  Some cards provide a player with the ability to increase their hand size.  Game ends when there are no more Battle cards to be drawn.  Who ever has the most points wins the game.

Mercifully, we pulled the plug on this game. Much as I love trick-taking games, this was far too slow and mentally fiddly. And who were we supposed to be playing: rival Gods pulling the strings of destiny perhaps?**Persuaded to play again, I'll raise my rating a tad, but my comments still stand. Oh, and I forgot to mention: it's too long.

Some interesting ideas, but just too random for me - a lot of the cards are just way better than others, and it often comes down to just the luck of timing - having the right card at the right time.

--Mar2008-- Interesting war-themed cardgame.  One isn't playing any role in particular, so it worried me: I thought it might have some of that "play random war materiel" vibe that Battlecards gives off.  Yet, instead, one has quite a delightful abstract cardgame, with the "war" theme helping one remember the ruleset.  I rather enjoyed my first play (with 4.)
--Nov2010-- Too long since my last play; it's definitely amusing, and something I'd hope to hit the table a bit more often.

WW2 themes generally don't appeal to me, but Pacific Tycoon manages to splice together trick taking fundaments and strategic play into some kind of trick taking/wargame hybrid. I'm a sucker for unusual games, and Pacific Typhoon is certainly that, but it also works really well. Ignore the theme; the gameplay is worth experiencing.

Fun little game. We enjoyed it, but I would say it was only a one trick pony. It's not a game that we tended to want to play again, and indeed we only ever played it once.

It is, afterall, just a card game, so I didn't expect too much. But, fun as card games go.

A chore.

It's not that there's no game, here. You get a hand of cards representing various military assets, and choose which ones to commit to a series of battles in the hopes of claiming spoils by being on the winning side.

The problem is, you either have something decent for the current battle, or you don't, and there's not a lot of thought going into the decision to participate. The thematic connect isn't solid enough for me to stay engaged. Card play is too restricted and it wears quickly.

I can't understand why I don't like this game as much as I don't.  It's not the most pleasant for me to play, but I can understand the play.  I'll never suggest playing it tho...ever!  See my rating comment for Atlantic Storm as these are essentially the same game.

[GMT 08 edition] {WWII; trick-taking, negotiation, partnership; optimal 5p} Pacific Typhoon is a thematic trick-taking game, but it's too expensive.  It's fun and interactive but it's too long for what it is.  Since there are more than 100 force cards in the deck, card-counting is not helpful.  On the other hand, negotiation skill (or table talk) is more essential to win the game.

The printing error of the rulebook is unforgivable. Other than that, the cards are nicely illustrated.  The icons and information are effective.  The photos do enhance game experiences.  They can recall players' memory about WWII.

IMHO, this game is far too expensive with the list price.

Pacific Typhoon is a fun romp that is all the more enjoyable because it plays better the more people you add, right up to the game's limit of seven players. Sure, in essence it's just a trick-taking card game, but the mechanics of being able to play to either side of a battle make this pretty unusual. And, yes, there's a heavy dose of luck, but skill is definitely rewarded. That said, there are a few flaws in this little gem. First, the game seems to last a few turns too many, although players can agree to "fix" this by dealing out three possible locations each turn, essentially cutting the game's length by one-third. I'm also not a fan of games in which get-the-leader play not only is a major part of the game, but built right into the cards, as is the case here. Finally, the game can be a tad fiddly: What year are we in? Remind me, is this day or night? Air, surface or submarine? What was the name of the card you played again? Is this the one that takes it out? Of, wait, we need to back up again ... I played a card with the wrong year! Despite these blemishes, Pacific Typhoon usually plays pretty smoothly with experienced players and the many good aspects - especially the great art/graphics, flavor text and overall nice blend of theme and mechanics - of the game far outweigh the quibbles I listed.

RATING: 7.5
This is a surprisingly light trick-taking game considering how historically thematic it is in capturing the Pacific Ocean theatre.  Year, day/night, air/surface/sub, and Japanese/Allies... these are the basic four considerations for each card play.  Plus there are event cards and "booster" cards that can be situationally played.  So a little more complicated that a trick-taking game with a standard deck of cards, but not hugely so.

RATING: 8
Very similar to Atantic Storm. A couple changes to the cards & the play of the game. All for the better, except we don't use the card that let's you redo a battle that someone has already won. We feel it's too powerful against someone who happens to be up at the time.

I am not a huge fan of battle games decided solely on cards so I am biased. The thing is that I did not have much fun playing it. It might attract fans of war-machines in general and their historic accuracy but, as a game, it sucks.

RATING: 6
[thing=20079][/thing] is a game that mix negotiation, card disputes and hand management. In short, the game represents the many battles between Japan and the USA in World War II. The player of the turn chooses one of two cards that will be the battle of the round (and each represents an historical naval or air battle, such as Pearl Harbor, Midway) this will be, at the start, the point card in dispute in the round. Then the player chooses if the battle will happen in the day or night (some cards can only be played in one or another) and which type of battle it will be: combat of airplanes, of ships or of submarines.

After the type of battle is decided, the first player opens by playing a card (or discarding). If the plays a card, we must choose one side: US or Japan. The next players, then, will choose which side they will be on (or if they will discard). The winner side gains the card of the battle and the cards played in the losing side - this is where the negotiation happens, specially after a few cards are already in the table, since you can see how many points changing the course of the battle (helping one or the other side) will be worth. Regardless of the winning side, the point cards are distributed by the first player - so he can use this to gain support for his side ("if you help me, I will give you [u]this[/u] card, but if you don't, I will give you [u]that[/u]"). After all the point cards are distributed between the players on the winning side, the turn passes to the next player, this new first player will start the whole thing again, deciding which battle will happen, when it will happen and which type will be.

The game has other details, like bonus cards, events, cards that destroy others, cards that gives resources (thus making the hand of card of the player bigger), the year that happens the battle (the battles go from '41 to '45, some cards can't be played in certain years), and so on, but the basics are this.

Play goes around until the last battle happens. The winner will be the player with the most points!

[thing=20079][/thing] proved itself as a nifty card game, full of options and decisions, interaction between players, playing up to 7 (but it really only works with 5 or more, with 3 or 4 the game seems lacking in the battles, as one high point card can decide everything, while with more players, three cards can beat one or two others, even if these would be of higher values). The quality of the cards is top notch, but I kind that expect this from GMT by now. It is really cool that every card has historical informations regarding the card itself - you now have something to do when the AP strikes someone at the table! All in all, a solid card game that deserves more attention.

After one play, I like it.  Although there is strategy there, I'm not able to tell how much the game will hinge on chaos and luck.  This game is a good example of having a decent base mechanic that is massaged nicely into a theme that drastically improves it.  If you're not that into the war in the Pacific, I wouldn't bother with this game, but if you have at least a passing fancy with the naval operations there, then this is worth a look.  There's lots of great flavor text on the card, and many little details are added to increase the theme, such as certain ships instantly sinking others, and some ships proving effective only in day combat.

(After 1 5p game Oct 2011)  A themed trick taking game with some interesting twists.  Axis vs. Allies, must match the year played, the time of day (day, night, twilight cards), the side to oppose and some bonus appliers - immediate strike (lightning bolt), 2 x damage for certain battles, etc.

20 battles minimum (carryover in ties) so it was long, but not too long.  Would play again - prefer to play this one a little faster.

This game is long for what it is (game was about 2 hours plus).  Though i enjoyed the historic accuracy of the game, it felt like long and drawn out as you were trying to negotiate with other players to join your side.  
Game seemed pretty abstract as you were jumping to different years and picking night and day periods. 
Would rather play a faster trick taking game then this.

A great game for people interested in WWII history. Victory conditions are awarded for battles and resources used in battles. Vehicle battle resources are restricted by the years they can be used and time of day in which they can fight. Their effectiveness depends on whether it is an air, land or sea battle. In each battle, the players declare sides by playing resource cards, the side with the highest total wins, and the most effective of the winning side distributes the spoils to the victors. Some very neat mechanics I have not explained very well.

This is a great card game, and although it has a war theme, isn't really a "wargame."  It's light, fun, and plays quickly enough.  Negotiating alliances every turn is a hoot, and so it doling out the "spoils."  It's a big hit every time I play it with a group!

Just a little bit more fiddly than Atlantic Storm, which is probably good for AS fans and less good for those who are playing this one without exposure to the original game.  There are more "events" that bend the normal rules, more opportunities to tune your hand, and some substantial changes in the graphic design of the cards (not all for the better.)  Still, this is essentially a re-make of Atlantic Storm and therefore a Good Thing.

While the theme is fair, the game manages to be too light for its duration yet at the same time be more fiddly than it should be.

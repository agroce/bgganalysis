Always liked this game, but rarely play it--wife isn't into the time period and it plays too long for her.  This whole card-driven mechanism was new to me when I purchased this early on and it's interesting to see how it's developed in other titles.  The Political Control markers were also a neat way of achieving a win if military success became unlikely--and it's historically reasonable.

Great game! Easy to get into for beginners and seems to have some nuance for veterans. I have the original expansion cards for this one.
Battle cards are fun and lend a nice narrative aspect to the battles. 
Make sure to incorporate Mark Herman's suggested battle deck amendment regarding the frontal attack / double envelopment switch. 

I think the game would benefit from incorporating a 1 strategy rated British general...maybe Alexander Leslie or even Tarleton?... to help with the dead hand aspect.

RATING: 9
This game has been passed by its successor Washington's War, but this is still a fantastic game, even beyond the scope of how revolutionary it was to gaming.  I am a complete fanatic for this era in history and read book after book.  This game captures the spirit of the war far more than its contemporaries.  Even minutae, such as Washington & Greene being able to retreat easier than other generals;the indecisiveness of most British generals; superior British training, Baron Von Stuben, Benedict Arnold's unpredictable treachary, British naval superiority, the sandbars in Charleston Bay, and such.  The strategy cards capture extensive details about the Revolution.  Playingwise, it is exceptional and groundbreaking, with it's card-driven system.  There are a few imperfections that Washington's War corrects, but overall, this game is far above its contemporaries and is a work of art as much as it is a game.

Note: This game used to be a '10' and and top of my list, but since Washington's War came out, I'd much rather play it.  If all we had was this, I would be happy to play, though.

RATING: 3
I believe that they got the balance very wrong.  Annoyingly luck-dependent because you can't do a thing unless you draw good cards.  A big pity because the game system has much potential, but as-is I'd consider it a broken game.  I'll try the sequels if I have a chance, though.

RATING: 10
Though quite old by now, it is still a great game with high re-playability. No two games are similar: in my 15+ games both sides managed to win overwhelmingly, win marginally and draw; in some games Washington was captured in the first round (Americans lose), in others the whole British force was annihilated... and then recovered etc. And though it is quite random, I love the battle card system for resolving battles: with a bit of imagination and role-playing you can just see all these Flank Right Attacks and Double Envelopments happenning in front of your eyes... Highly recommended!

We the People is a 2 player game of low complexity. It's a strategic level game of the American Revolution. Players will select either the American Rebels (how can you call an American a rebel?)or the British. Using a simple card-based and point-to-point movement system, brings to life the military and political aspects of the war for independence. Will the Declaration of Independence be finshied in time to have an impact on the war? Will Howe (not Gordie) leave himself open to a winter campaign in New Jersey? Will Benedict Arnold be remembered as a hero or traitor? Will George Washington get his needed supplies in time? Will the French (who can trust them?) fleet arrive in time to make a difference?

Expected playing time is about 1.5 - 2 hours.

This is the simplest of the card driven wargames. It's easy to learn and plays quickly. And it provides a narrative that closely resembles the history. HOWEVER, the cards can kill you more easily in this game than any other card driven game I've played. It is possible to draw a hand which contains no playable cards whatsoever. Extreme timing of certain events -- such as Declaration of Independence -- can also kill the game.

I still like playing it, though. Becuase it is over quickly, you can usually get in a rematch in the same session.

Two playings.  Wow!  This was my first completed CDG and I am stunned at how low density, low complexity, high strategy/tactics and heavy WtP, and I presume CDGs in general, is (are)!  Everything just works together, always more to do than you have actions for, enough luck that nothing is a foregone conclusion but not so much that the strategy is irrelevant, etc.  I hear Hannibal is even better, can't wait!

RATING: 8
The original of what has become one of my favorite boardgame concepts...card driven strategy games (CDG)! Unfortunately also introduced "tactical" cards for battles (carried over in Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage); and, at this embryonic stage of development, strategy cards that are either Ops or Event (not a choice between one or the other as in later games), and the event cards are only playable by one side or the other which means that players will have a number of useless cards each draw. Later games would correct all of this. Still, a great two player game that captures the feel of the Revolutionary War quite nicely! Of the two player CDGs, this is the shortest and most accessible. A most satisfying entre to the genre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My first card driven wargame. Certainly the genre has been tweaked, but I still have a soft spot for this title.

Yes it is annoying to get a hand of event cards for the other side (that you have to play, and can't do much on your turn) which is fixed in other games of this type.

But short play time, simple rules, asymmetric forces and goals - means I like to play this one.

RATING: 7.8
I like this game a lot.

It is the mother of the card driven wargames and set up many other games to come in the future.  

Set up is crucial, as it will effect the entire rest of the game.  You have to develop an idea of what will be out of reach for the Brits as the American side.  And you have to get on the offensive right off as the British and go for your 6.

I think it gives some historical flavor and a player can learn a lot about the early states and how the war was distributed amongst the states.  The cards act to give players tactical power and they give players options of battle moves.  It is important in this game to know how likely each card can be for the opponent.  This will influence your likelihood of winning in battle.

I would describe this game as historically important and a gem for its time.  I think it is "the" introductory CDW game.  Therefore, I own and am happy to own it, but rarely play it.  If you have a child I would think it would be an ideal game as a gateway into wargames or CDWs.  It is nicely done although could have more chrome.

This game is a joyful little game that plays out easily and rewards you with a pleasant after taste, and the memories of the start of our nation here in the US.

Just doing a routine comment update ... reading the below comment again maybe 10 years after I first wrote it is super-weird, I just don't use that voice anymore and it sounds really strange to me today.

Anyway, the thing to know about We the People is that it was a game that held incredible promise but just wasn't that good. The battle cards were instantly understood by most players as weird, gamey, and leading to odd and unhistorical outcomes. The card deck was really swingy because your opponent's events were just dead cards for you. The portrayal of the British was completely one-dimensional and they are at the mercy of just drawing a bunch of 3-ops cards.

The game won by being relatively short, low-complexity, and an innovative take on a topic with few games. We cut it a lot of slack for just not doing the heavy lifting required to turn it into an actual compelling game - something we can, in 2016, see as a pattern in the wreckage of half-developed Mark Herman games. But you know, it came out in 1994, and by the time it was retired from even semi-regular play in 1997 or 1998 even then we knew it had a lot of problems - problems which Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage turned around and resolved with grace and elegance when it came out in 1996. We the People was an important game in the history of board wargaming, but mainly because Mark Simonitch did the work in Hannibal.

---
We the People has assured its place in wargame history by the success of it's followups (most notably Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage). We the People scores tremendously for the wonderful flavor and successfully measured uncertainty imparted by the cards, as well as its successful abstraction of the "political" angle through the Political Control markers and related events. Another huge win is the playing time, which is only about 2 hours and the game is perfect at that length; it doesn't feel too long or too short, as many wargames do. The battle cards, alas, don't quite work (see Hannibal, where a just slightly tweaked version of the same system is a smashing success), and there is no really straightforward fix. The expansion event cards are hard to get these days, but still recommended as they can patch a couple (rather minor) holes in the system.

WtP has written gaming history, being the first true card-driven wargame. However, Mark Herman's design isn't without its teething problems. Applying various solutions and innovations found in its "successor" Hannibal by the means of variant rules ought to sort out these issues.

Next time I play I'll introduce:
- Hannibal-esque battle card sytem (double envelopment auto loss of initiative, Frontal Attack also  1 loss for the defender or something similar)
- Hannibal-esque two-staged casualty system 
- PC marker loss following major defeats
- increase across the board initiative ratings for counterattacks by 1 (WtP otherwise makes counterattacking too difficult - to the detriment of the defender).
- 5:1 overrun rule

The card deck could equally do with some tweaking. 
- add a strategic dimension and choice to the "Lord North" cards
- reduce the luck factor in regards to French intervention and other critical cards.

I'd also like to see cards having event/ops dual uses as happens to be the case with most CDGs. However, that would involve a rather major redesign.

I hope that Mark Herman will make the most of the past ten years of CDG design  experience with the upcoming WtP remake entitled "Washington's War". Then the game might even reach Hannibal-like greatness.

Right out of the box, I'd merely give it  ~6.5. With various tweaks I could see WtP becoming a 9 for me. For now I'll settle with 7.5.

Last point: I like the map look! Don't understand why some other BGGers consider it ugly.

RATING: 5
Interesting topic and assymetry. Similar to Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage but quicker playing. The geography of the east coast of North America is rather less interesting than the Med. Battles tend to be shorter as generals are limited to moving with only five armies. The Lord North cards (used for determining the end of the game) are a clever idea. The box cover art is rather iconic and I wish I'd bought a copy of this when I saw it in a FLGS in Finchley back in 2002 just for the box.

>12 plays with 2
>12 plays solo

The first, and IMHO still the most elegant CDG.  Reasonably true to history, with all the pluses of the CDG genre and none of the excess chrome / card play that mars later entries.

However, it suffers from being too elegant / simple. If the British aren't able to gain an upper hand in PC in the first turn, and can't move the their generals (because of poor hands with low Ops and too many American events) on subsequent turns there's little they can do to compensate. Once the board is covered by PCs, the only real way to change things is with moving armies, disrupting the continental congress, and then playing select events that allow Colonial PC to be removed.  This is a tricky chain to pull off.

Personally, I have seen this in 3 out of the 30 odd games I've played.  For example, I recently played the Brits over 8 turns, got no "3" ops cards for the first three turns, and only six "3" cards in the game.  This hurt because (a) 3 of the Brits 5 generals can't move unless a 3 is played, (b) the American was getting a lot of 3 cards and playing them for PC and reinforcements.  Worse still, some British hands had ridiculous numbers of pro American events (ie useless cards).  One turn had 5 useless events out of the 7 cards, and another had 4, all others had at least 2.

So doing the math, in a 56 card game, only 1 out of 10 cards let me move a decent general and 40% of my cards were completely worthless.

Simply put, this is a balance issue, is it historic, probably not.  And no one wants to play a 2-3 hour game where it slowly becomes obvious that they never had a chance of winning.  

WtP is a great game, I'd give it a 10 - except the broken British hand occurs too frequently - making me wary of pulling the game out and "always wanting to play it".

This is definitely the original CDG. Hannibal is a clear improvement, but WtP still holds its own alright.

The Battle Cards are still sometimes annoying to fiddle around with. The theme of the game goes a long way for me. I love that American Revolution stuff. 

But after playing games like Paths of Glory or even Twilight Struggle, I find that I want to do more with the cards than just "discard" or "play for the event". I like having multiple ways to play a card, and this game hadn't developed that stuff to the degree of the later games.

I respect it for the innovation and what came after. I still enjoy playing it, but have to consciously be willing to overlook a couple weaknesses.

Brilliant design, fatally flawed, but it was the first of the CDG.

OK, so the battle cards are a little bit chaotic even for my tastes- but that being said, it really simulates how outrageous fortune sometimes is in war- who's to say that Howe with 1 CU couldn't take down Washington with a full 5 CU retinue?  This is an honest classic, a great game that plays very smoothly while incoporating a lot of historical detail and flavor.  It's also a very easy game to teach and it only takes about half a game to get a feel for some of the more advanced strategic options that are possible.  I'd definitely recommend this is as a first card-driven wargame as it pretty compactly introduces a lot of the core mechanics and concepts you see in more complex games like Paths of Glory, Sword of Rome, and Wilderness War without bogging down too much in minutiae.  I wish I owned a copy!

After two games, one as the US and one GB, I was wondering why the Brits had no chance, but then discovered we'd misplayed the reinforcement rules for them, only allowing a force size equal to the played strategy card's value. This is a huge error.
I'm looking forward to playing again with the right rules. Maybe the upstart colonials can be put in their place after all.

060503: Played again, this time with correct rules (except for one little error), and things were looking grim for the British, taking military beating after beating, when Washington parked himself between two British PC-marked towns and within range of the best British general, Howe. With nine battle cards to eight, I fancied my chances of defeating the leader of the rebels, and so it turned out: Washington couldn't match my second Double Envelopment, so he was defeated and, with nowhere to retreat to, he had to surrender. Game over for the Americans. I think we learned a lesson from that game.

Wish it were in print. Great card driven intro, lots of strategy and replayability, love the theme, depsite the oldish cards and counters.  Its euro meets card driven area control game: my current favorite. Easy enough to intro to new playes, but lacks alot of the nuance and tactical stratgy of Wilderness War.
Hmmmm the chances of the British getting crab hands are pretty daunting. Still they only need 6 colonies not too hard of they take most of new England and a bit of the South.  The lack of 3 OP cards kill'em though and it drops my rating dwon from a 10, but a great game I want to play often!

Fun game with relatively simple rules, high strategy and luck factors and great hisotrical theme.  The cards are a bit uninspired when compared to Paths of Glory, etc., and incredibly ugly.  And while the counters are nice, the board is Avalon-ugly.

This granddaddy of the CDGs still delivers a fun, asymmetrical set of problems to each side. It is probably the simplist of the CDGs and, I think, holds it own against later games that suffer from chrome bloat. The PC isolation mechanic is brilliant, but my brain does not work that way, so I will always get my butt kicked. I also hate having to constantly count spaces within colonies and then add up the controlled colonies.

The original Card-Driven Wargame, and still one of the best.  Very colorful, it's simple enough to appeal to beginning gamers, yet interesting enough to appeal to more serious wargamers.  The combat cards can be annoying, but in reality they're not any more random than rolling dice and the idea is clever even if it does slow the game a bit.  But it's short enough anyway that that doesn't make much difference.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a decent, simple CDG with a relatively short playing time.

These days, however, I will always choose one of the more modern CDG's. The ops-or-event approach has been ditched in favor of multi-purpose cards for quite a while now with good reason. It's just too easy to get hosed on ops (especially the British) and/or get stuck with a handful of your opponent's cards. Though apparently certain designers haven't learned this lesson.

I think the battle card system, which works so wonderfully in Hannibal, doesn't quite work right here. No one uses Frontal Assaults if they can help it given how few troops you typically own. Plus, the distribution is just too wild when you consider that a typical army is going to be in the 6-9 card range, whereas in Hannibal it's almost always 10 or more. The upshot, when combined with the lack of a Reserve card, is that too many battles are won on the first or second play in all but the largest battles. It just doesn't work right.

It's also susceptible to gamey last turn tactics if you happen to have the year card in your hand that will end the game. This pretty much breaks it of any simulation value and definitely makes it just a game.

Introducing key innovations for wargames : great graphics, standup leaders and CARDS! Political control is a bit "eurogame-like". While the battle cards are fun, I don't think they really add much and I prefer the slight changes made in Hannibal and later improvements to the card-driven mechanics (Ops and events on the same cards, phased decks, etc). The game itself also lacks a bit of "dynamism", becoming staid and stagnate at times. Still a great introduction to the genre and it plays fast too.

Excellent game about political control of the 13 states during the Revolutionary War.  The combat system is not the focus of the game.  Those who like "combat" will rate this a bit lower because it is very silly.  Once you realize the game is about political control marker positioning and isolating opposing generals...the game really starts to take off.

The game that inspired a batch of very good and successful wargames. This game simulates the American War of Independance in an original and playable manner via a deck of cards. The cards control the events, military actions, and political influence of the war. The end of the game is triggered by either sudden death victory conditions, or a random &quot;war ends&quot; mechanic. Excellent stuff.

[Herman] The granddaddy of the card-driven mechanic wargames. Considering it was the pathfinder that created the series, it holds up pretty well after all this time. Unfortuntely the battle card system is broken and attrition is nonexistant. Still worth playing by my standards. I greatly appreciate the tweaks that Hannibal added, though.

pretty good "light" version of the Revolutionary war. More involved with political and event (Cards) play than actual battles. Basically a maneuver and bigger picture game which more of what the Revolutionary war was about - Washington lost alot of battles, won a few, but ultimately won the war. This game plays much that way, a few mistakes by you opponent and either side can win.

Played this one for the first time and was actually surprised by how much luck there was in the game. As the Americans, I won two or three very improbable battles against the British because I played the right card and I rolled the die well.

This is a great game to introduce new people to wargames. It&#039;s fun, fast, and exciting. It&#039;s also one of the most influential designs ever since it has lead to a whole host of games driven by cards. The game has certain aspects of the game Go and I&#039;ve always wondered if Mark based that - at least in part - on the games of Go he and I used to play at Victory Games when we worked there.

The design's age definitely shows, especially compared to more modern CDGs, but it's a worthy game in its own right.  I like the variable end time, the tight units, and the quick, unpredictable battles.  It's fast and streamlined.  The possibility of "dead hands" does hurt the game a bit, but not to the point where I'd avoid playing it.

The game that started the "card driven game" mechanism. Fast playing and fair-balanced, the lack of operations numbers on each card ( a problem rectified in the next "CDG" game, Hannibal ) leads frequently to one of the players simply not being able to use a card. That's really my only quibble, as it's an excellent game.

Home-made copy with all the expansion cards.  No Battle cards.  I use the dice-based combat system variant.

After 5 plays I'm finally ready to rate this game.  

I've realized that card-driven games just aren't my thing (I've played Hanibal several times and 1960 at least twice).  I find them to be overly-constrained and frustrating.  My chief complaint is their fragility.  With most of them (especially with We the People) it is only about every 3rd game that plays out in a satisfying fashion: with the card luck falling in a way that doesn't cause a blow-out for one side or the other.

Of my 5 plays of WtP - only one of them was really exciting and interesting.  One session, we sat down and playced two games back-to-back: one was a blow-out one way and the next was a blow-out the other.  It was a frustrating afternoon.

My last play went down to the wire (the British won by controlling exactly the 6 colonies needed to win) but it was still a frustrating game.  The first half the Americans got all the cards and then in the second half the British did.  The determining factor in who won the game was when the "game end" cards came up.

We used the dice-based combat results table for all but one play - the game would rate lower if we had used the combat-cards: they add nothing and lengthen the game considerably.

Boy, I've been playing this game PBEM and it does nothing for me.  Pure area control with army dressing.  On top of that, the events except for a few *huge* ones (like the French events) are incredibly tepid and boring.  CDGs have really evolved and, in my view, become much, much better, especially by adding flexibility by giving players multiple way to use cards.

Then you have battle cards, which are not good but not the deal breaker many other have said vs. the other problems I have with this game.  But you also have key event draws which can end the game for the Brits on the first or second deal.  Good times.

The game is especially very boring for the British.  They can move, usually, once a turn.  Fantastic.

RATING: 6
It plays fast, has the right amount of chrome, and can be a really nail-biting affair. However, many later CDGs improved upon the weaknesses of [i]We the People[/i], namely that this one is less exciting. The rules for political control markers are more rigid than in [i]Hannibal[/i] so once a marker is down it will rarely leave. Winning a battle gains you no political capital beyond clearing an area of troops and winter is brutal so the game is given to stagnation and battles are very few. Many cards cannot be used to move armies only adding to this problem; you'll rarely see a year as crazy and exciting as 1777 or 1781. Given the rigid nature of the cards, the luck of the draw is even more crucial here and one bad draw could spell your doom. The battles though are more tense because there are fewer cards, so there is a bit more bluff and risk.

On the historical front I find the lack of real British advantages to be quite annoying. Militia are more of a bonus than regulars, which is very very silly.

In conclusion I fear all of her descendants have surpassed her. I'd rate this game lower but I have to respect what this game wrought, and what it wrought is very good indeed.

The simplest of the card-driven wargames, which is no small virtue for a series that has seemingly gotten longer and more bloated with each new "evolution." The system does show some age -- graphics are on balance underwhelming (and the inability to see colony control because of the mismatch between PC counter shape and size and the underlaying space is just bone-headed), and I do miss the play as event OR operations aspect of most following games, but We the People still delivers a flavorful experience with minimal rules overhead and a quick play time. Rumors of a remake have persisted for years and I would value an even more streamlined version with an improved map, but with trends being as they are I expect we'll get a top-heavy design that will take twice as long to play while being only half so fun.

RATING: 6.99999
Brilliantly innovative and fatally flawed.

1) Issue - Americans drawing French Alliance and/or Declaration of Independence (DoI) on the first turn is a game ender. This is such a widely acknowledged major issue that many game conventions employ some simple house rule to avoid it, usually a redraw of Event cards or withholding DoI and French Intervention from the 1775 deal and inserting them into the draw pile starting 1776 either action being a tacit admission of this being a broken game if played with Standard Rules.

Fix - The DoI card is not playable and is a Discard for both players UNTIL the Americans win a battle as the original defender against a British attacking force of 3+ CUs OR win a battle if the Americans are the original attacker against ANY British force, even a single British CU with a general. The Event is then mandatory and must be played by either player as his next possible card play. Use a chit to indicate playability status, "DoI/No DoI".

Fix - The French Alliance card is not playable and is a Discard for both players UNTIL the Americans control 7 or more Colonies (control of Canada counts as 2 colonies toward this total) at any time. Once that number is reached the Event is mandatory and either player must play French Alliance as his next card play if holding the card. Once the requirement has been met the card remains playable (mandatory) regardless of any subsequent change in the number of colonies controlled by the Americans. It is incumbent upon the American player to note when the trigger level is achieved and call it; use a chit for "FA/No FA".

Until the Events are active the cards are discards for both players. Failure to play either card on the next Action Round as soon as it is active if the card is in one's hand constitutes an automatic loss for the offending player.

In addition, if either DoI and/or French Alliance is in the Discard pile at the time either or both become activated either player MAY discard any one card chosen from his hand to retrieve the relevant card and play it as his turn. The discard from the player's hand goes into the Discard pile and DoI or French Alliance is momentarily retrieved and the card is played as that turn's card and the Event occurs immediately. The British player still has the 1 PC placement option available before or after the Event occurs.

1.5) Issue - Events have no alternate use for Activation/Ops Value

Fix - An opponent's Event may either be discarded normally for no effect OR the card is voluntarily played as the opponent's Event (this also applies to all "North's Government Falls" cards) which allows the active player to place 1 PC of his own either before or after the enemy Event occurs (if the enemy Event occurs immediately it is removed per normal rules, if the enemy Event is a "reaction" type Event it is immediately given to the opponent in his hand for use by that player in the normal course of play including the alternate use for placement/activation instead of the actual Event if desired by the new owning player); Instead of playing one's own Event a player may alternately play a card with his Event without triggering the Event for either placement of one of his PCs OR for activation of any one of his own Generals alone or as a force after which the card goes back into the discard pile as an unused Event.
DoI and French Alliance can only be discarded by either player with no alternative use options for either player as long as it is not currently valid to be played as the Event BUT once French Alliance/DoI is activated although the American cannot choose an alternate use the British player still gets the 1 PC placement when either Event is played by him.


2) Issue - Occurrence of the Benedict Arnold Traitor Event is capricious regarding each individual game's historical narrative, overly punitive in its application and is ahistorical since the Americans did not have foreknowledge of Arnold being a traitor.

Fix - The British player secretly draws one chit from a total of 7, one each with the name of an American general other than Washington and one labeled No Traitor. The name on the drawn chit is the potential traitor and if the No Traitor chit is drawn there is no traitor available and the card is a Discard. To activate the Traitor card as the Event the British must have won at least one battle against any American Force of 3 CUs or larger _or_ have controlled 7 or more colonies at any time (control of Canada does not count toward this total) _or_ have caused the displacement of the Continental Congress. Other than the Chit Draw and fulfilling one of the three requirements for activation the rules for play of the card are followed and apply to the indicated traitor; If and when the Event is played the British player must reveal the name on the chit to validate its application. If the Event is not playable due to the British not having accomplished any one of the requirements the card is a discard for both players, the American would not get the 1 PC placement option until the Event has become "Active" due to the British having fullfilled one or more of the requirements and the Traitor card would be given to the British player as a "reaction" type Event. Use a chit for "Traitor/No Traitor" to indicate playability.


3) Issue - Placement of PCs from DoI is mandatory even if the American player determines that such placement is counter-productive.

Fix - American player is permitted to decline placement of any number of PCs from DoI when the Event occurs, any declined PCs are not playable at any later time, they are lost.


4) Issue - Double Envelopment Battle card is too powerful, there is no reason not to play it since it does not increase opponent's chance at gaining Initiative

Fix - Auto loss of initiative due to matched play of "Double Envelopment" occurs only against an equal or higher rated general; if DE is played against a lower rated general who matches the DE card the lower rated general must then roll to gain the initiative as for any other matched Battle Card. Consider "Double Envelopment" to represent any Surprise or Unorthodox tactic that would require an equally agile opposing general to qualify for an automatic counter.


5) Issue - No Interceptions by British Generals 

Fix - Allow interception attempt by any British general's force against an American force which consists of an equal or fewer number of CUs than are present in the space from which the interception attempt is made; the intercepting British general must attempt to intercept with as least as many CUs as are in the American force and with up to the entire number of CUs in the space. Any British or American general (except Washington and Greene who each have an inherant interception bonus) intercepts by rolling 1d6 equal to or less than his initiative rating into any adjacent space entered by a moving enemy force with a +1DRM (harder to achieve) applied if intercepting into a space containing an enemy PC and with the above minimum CU requirements for British Generals. Interception attempts by Howe against Washington receive a -1 DRM (easier to achieve) and are permitted regardless of the relative size of each force, the CU's in Howe's space do not need to equal Washington's CUs. The Howe vs. Washington -1 DRM and Enemy PC +1 DRM are cumulative.


6) Issue - Generals go back to the draw pile when two forces join 

Fix - Make it an option to allow multiple friendly generals to remain in the same space. Any one may be assigned by the owning player as commander (Exception: Washington is always the US commanding general). An extra general may be sent to the draw pile per normal rules if desired at the time the armies merge in the space but not later, once they merge they must remain until moved again or otherwise forced to be removed.


7) Issue - Want to use a card but not in the current turn. 

Fix - Allow either or both players to pass on the last cardplay in a turn and hold over one card as unplayed but the following turn all cards MUST be played/discarded by a player who uses this option; players may hold another card the turn following the one in which all cards are played with the same restriction the turn after that. If a "reaction" card is held it may be used if applicable to the opponent's actions that same turn similarly to the Held Card rules in Wilderness War.

YMMV

Played again recently after playing once or twice many years ago, as I wanted to try the "original" design in this family of card driven wargames in light of current designs.

I can understand the downside of the extra time it takes, and maybe after a number of battles it will get old. But for now, it is an interesting diversion.

   This game is a gem, a peach, smashing good fun. I'll need no other game about this war.
   I can't believe that this cool combat system could be replaced with a die roll system without hurting the game. The combats are cool, like the battle I won with five strait frontal assaults. One would never remember 'that cool fight where I rolled a five'. In any case, the game is more about using your actions cunningly, and the combat is a smaller element, but that card combat system is fun, cool & unique.

The earliest of the current flock of CDG Wargames. Really innovative card systems in this game. Excellent replay value and high production quality. I like this game a lot. Many say it has problems because it does not utilize separate card decks for each side; I have not found this to be a problem. Likewise a lot of people do not like the battle card system; whereas I really think that it is a strength of the game... I like underdog victories that can occur every now and then and the battle card system allows for this type of event!

First generation card-driven wargame (CDG). This is the game to play with people who've tired of Twilight Struggle but still want more. The cards are single use which minimises thought processes, but like the best single deck CDGs this game sticks to the golden rules by being (a) reasonably simple and (b) short. Many of the events are fairly humdrum in nature (most just add or remove Combat Units or PC markers) and the whole experience is  very 'swingy' with much hanging on the turn of the cards and the roll of the die, but I can live with that in a 2 hour game. It's a shame that later games in the genre went down the route of gratuitously increasing game length and complexity without reducing luck of the draw by incorporating a deck per player or at least some deck-building elements.

This first of the "card-driven" wargames is probably not as revolutionary (no pun intended) as some make it sound.  Cards have actually been driving the sequence of play of wargames for a long time (e.g. Empires of the Middle Ages, Source of the Nile, Assault on Hoth) and anyone who has ever played poker must have realized that a next step would be to move the cards into the players' hands.  Still, there is no debating that this game inspired a large number of imitations, all of them more complicated than WtP and in my opinion not as good.  The only problem I have with the design is that the major events are not tied to each other or to the situation on the board.  A corollary is that game balance is highly luck based, as the Americans have the advantage if the Declaration of Independence comes early, but the British have a big advantage if it comes late or not at all.  We solve these two problems with a house rule that mandates that the three major events fall in historical order: DoI, French, then European War.  Detractions not withstanding, the battle card resolution system works fine, although the criticism that the double envelopment card will always be played and the frontal attack will never be played is not without merit.  House rules should be easy to devise to address this issue for those who are bothered by it.  The game play is fun and fast (around two hours, although that is highly variable due to the variable end date).  Although very high level, the history is reasonably good, at least if the event cards fall in a believable way.  Probably the weakest elements on the historical front are the arbitrary stacking limits (Howe gets his big army in 1776, but they can't all move together) and the lack of underlying political attitudes (it is just as easy for the British to pacify a section of Massachusetts as a section of Georgia).  Given the simplicity of the errata-free rules, the entertaining nature of the system, and the lack of quality competition for this topic, this game is recommended to almost anyone interested in the subject matter.

Great and innovative game. However, it is knocked down from perfect for two reasons 1. There are many times when there are several cards in the British player's hand that are unplayable. 2. The proportions of the  various battle cards is exactly the opposite of what it should be i.e. it is easier to cancel out a less complicated maneuver than a more complicated maneuver

An historic system, but fairly broken imo.  The game is wildly lopsided for the Americans.  The Brits have no room at all for bad luck.  There are many 'dead' cards that can be unplayable if you get your opponents event.  If certain American events come out early, the game is almost un-winnable as the Brits... a wonderful groudwork for games like Hannibal to come, but way too luck driven for me...

I love CDWGs.  I love the idea of playing a CDWG in an hour. I love the American Revolution.  It should be the perfect game.  It suffers from some balance issues and the PCs switch around too quickly and that often feels too gamey.  Its a brillant effort and it still gets played but generally Hannibal improved on it.  It still merits play for 1) Revolution Timeperiod and 2) Shorter Playtime.  I'm curious and interested in the development of Washington's War.

RATING: 7.5
A classic. The old Avalon Hill company saved some of their best for just before they went toes-up. A lot of strategic options for both sides in this American War of Independence game. The knack lies in applying your knowledge of the game's mechanical subtelties to the cards you're dealt at the start of each game year, and playing accordingly. Just hope you don't draw the Declaration of Independence and French Alliance cards on the first turn while playing as the British.

A fine entry in a crowded genre: 2 player card-driven wargames.  I know We The People was the first, but I'm not sure that means it's the best.  We the People plays fairly quickly, and is fun.  It does show its age though, some cards are totally un-usable by one side or another, and the mechanics first shown here have been refined since.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
We the People is the genre-defining card-driven war game, and that fact alone means it deserves the respect of all gamers who have been swept up by later titles who have used this system (most notably Twilight Struggle and Hannibal). Apart from its influence on the hobby, it stands alone as a solid game in its own right. There aren't many games about the American Revolution, so it places itself in a niche with much demand. Rumors are the Washington's War is the superior game, but We the People has left an indelible mark on the hobby.

Traded for US War Plan Gold (unpunched) and US War Plan Black (punched)

We the People.  Punched, very nice copy.  

Minor wear on corners of box.  Completeness of all components has been verified by counting and by checking against list in rules as well as against another copy of the game.  Counters and cards are free of wear.  Strategy cards are sleeved (in a color matching box and rules accents); a few extra sleeves are included in case you somehow tear one.  Battle cards are sleeved in clear sleeves.  Cardboard box-wide insert is present and in fine shape (not too much else to say about a big piece of unfinished cardboard).  Map is in excellent shape without stains or wear.  Rules, Historical Commentary, and player aid card are all unmarked and unwrinkled.

We the People.  Punched, much-played copy. Counters in bag. Cards sleeved.

MISSING one piece, a British infantry unit that is 1 strength point on one side and 2 strength points on the other.  (The strength counters are completely generic and not a hard limit on deployments (although if, in actual history, the British had ever had more troops deployed than represented by the whole counter-mix, I think we’d all be speaking British today).

Otherwise, completeness of all components has been verified by counting and checking against list in rules as well as against another copy of the game   

Corners of top box lid have separated and been re-taped; box has a six-letter name (mine) written in permanent marker on the outside of the top lid, and the inside of the bottom lid, in letters roughly one-half inch high.  

Most Political Control markers show wear (in the form of small areas with lightening in color); all counters remain completely legible.  

The cards are currently sleeved (maroon for the Strategy cards, and half black and half white for the Battle cards). There is some wear to the edges of some of the Battle cards, but all cards (Strategy and Battle) are completely legible and functional.  

Except for minor wrinkling at the fold, the map is in excellent shape without stains or wear.  Rules wrinkled but unmarked.  Historical Commentary unwrinkled and unmarked.  Player aid card has been laminated.  Cardboard box-wide insert present and in fine shape (not too much else to say about a big piece of unfinished cardboard).

Playing this after its CDG progeny reveals some weaknesses, but it's still a good game.  Some compare it to Go; I think it plays remarkably similar to Hammer of the Scots.   WtP is the better game of the two, but I think I'd prefer to play HotS given the choice.  Hopefully, the WtP re-do (Washington's War) will have high Ops values on Event cards to make for tougher choices.

RATING: 6
No wonder the CDG system was refined (beginning right away with Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, though this earlier style still exists also) so that all cards have both an event and ops points. Here the cards can sometimes totally ruin your game, the ops/events ratio should lean more to the former. Out of the box this makes the game too lopsided to the US. I'd suggest some kind of mulligan rule and/or implementing the "ops queue" from the revised Washington's War. Out of the box the only redeeming factor for this is that it isn't too long a game.
I really like the battle cards, they don't slow the game down too much, and give nice tactical extra flavor (Brits have incentive to use the harder-to-move generals, who have better counterattack skills.

RATING: 6
The theme is appealing and very familiar as it is about the war for independence but I think I prefer Hannibal.  Most of the battles in my first game were very short and generally decided almost in the first or second play of the battle cards as there are too few battle cards in everyones' hands (often less than 8-9).  The differing rules for reinforcements as well as the sea advantage of the British are interesting twists to the game.  In my one game so far, Benjamin Franklin never convinced the French to join the Americans so the French forces sat tauntingly in the reinforcement box in front of me all game long...I pulled out the victory with my last card played in the game which was the only major battle event card played which allowed me to gain control of the three states I needed to reach nine and victory!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very well designed card-driven wargame.  This game should probably get an extra ratings boost for being the origin of the CDG genre but my rating simply reflects my own (very high) desire to play it again.  The asymmetrical forces, the use of battle cards and the all-important struggle for political control make this game quite unique from other wargames I've played (except, obviously, for Hannibal which was derived from it). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
War on the America independence.  Quite an unusual system at the time it was first published.  But the general feedback has been positive.  The Call to Assembly makes this game an interesting strategy adopted by both sides (The Loyalist and Independence Activists).

Game is lots of fun, and the focus is on political control.  So combat, while it seems simplistic, is only a prt of the game, not the whole game itself.  Poor hands can be anissue, but overall, the hands seem to balance themselves out.

A bit dated now, for a CDG.  This is especially true in the use of the cards as either operations *OR* events.  And the victory conditions were such that it is more difficult to win outright as the British.  In fact, games that I've played, draws were more common than British victories.  All this being said, I love the relative simplicity and would never get rid of my copy.This is one of two CDG's that my wife will play, no questions asked.  Twilight Struggle is the other.

First play; a couple of rule issues - 1) forgot that as British I could pull in as many combat units from reinforcement box as I needed (was just doing 1-3 per strategy card), 2) was not sure how to handle defeat of a General-less stack of combat units (do they get to retreat, or just surrender)?

Being the father of all CDG, this was a "must have" for me. It has only been recently that I finally got to play it.
An avid CDG player can inmediatly feel the improvement that the system has been using after this game's publication. The main one is the more limited options on the play of cards (especially for the british side).

This is one of the few wargames that I have that my wife likes to play.  (The game gets a +1 on the rating simply for that.)  It's by no means the deepest wargame out there, but it's a fun game to play and a game that's fairly well balanced.  If you can manage to score a copy somewhere, it's worth it.  

This game is the granddaddy of the card driven game system that is prevalent today, plays fairly fast for a wargame, and has a theme that keeps people interested (the American War of Independence).  Ironically enough, of all the introductory games that got released by AH in the early 90's (updates to Bulge, D-Day, Midway and Guadalcanal, along with the release of Mustangs), it's one of the few that didn't have the Smithsonian Institution stamp on it (can't remember if Mustangs did or not).

My only regret with WTP was to not get my hands on an extra set of cards (as well as the expansion cards) before AH got sold off to Hasbro.

WtP touches Natus in his sweet spot: elegant, relatively simple, thematic, 2-3 hrs, lots of interesting choices.  But the battle cards are a bummer; I like them, but the system is so brittle and unforgiving that it's hard to get into.  It SHOULD be cool, but it's not, even when you win. My other issue are the Event cards and their playability.  We used the variant whereby one could play an opponent's event for a political 1-op, but as the US player there were too many times where I had to discard cards rather than play them, in a game down to the wire.  This game should be an 8.5 or a 9 for me, but because of these intrinsic flaws, it's a 7.8.  Hopefully, they will be fixed in Washington's War.

Very playable, very fun. It's the ideal mix of theme and complexity for my taste. 
The first and simplest of the CDG, it's pitty that it was not followed by games of comparable simplicity but with each new game the level of complexity and playing time increased. Now destined for a reprint (with significant changes) as Washington's War.

Another good AH game.  It's point-to-point, card-driven mechanic was brought to its apogee in other games (Hannibal, notably), but this is still a nice showcase for it.  The American Revolution theme is assisted, rather than hindered, by the game mechanics.

This game has mechanics that, after exploring future card driven wargames, I thought were a bit clunky and inelegant.  However, upon giving it some critical thought, I see now that it is possible to see these things as pieces that fit nicely into the puzzle, and appreciate the unadulterated game.

I'm not a wargamer, and hate the thought of moving hundreds, or even tens, of chits, but I really like the card based, point to point system, and 2-3 hours is just the right length for me. The British have overwhelming troops but its hard to move. The Americans find it hard to keep troops on the board but easier to move. Between these two strategy bookends, the game is an area majority battle in each of the 13 states - placing your markers down either directly through card play or by judicious use of armed forces, taking advantage of the point-to-point geography to secure off areas and to isolate and kill off opponent markers. The game can have key swings, usually more as a result of good / unfortunate hands than an unlucky combat. There's a touch too much chrome to make it an "easy" pick up and play if it's languished on the shelf for a bit, but there's a lot of good decision angst and it's a good length for what it offers.

Components are somewhat below what I would have hoped for.  Much of the imoprtant information you need to check throughout the game is covered up by markers and armies.  I enjoy the historical simulation of the game, but think perhaps some of the landmark events should be more certain, rather than being left up to strategy card draws.  The gameplay itself is quite engaging and enjoyable, with rules that are pretty easy to learn, especially if someone who has played the game before teaches them to you.

I played this game at the 2006 WBC and fell in love with it. It took me another year and a half to secure a very nicely used copy on eBay, which I have played twice since.  As I get set to play game number three on my board this weekend, I will still be taken by the straightforward game play and charmed by the battle cards.

We the People was the game that convinced me that boardgaming could be educational, and it was also the game that pulled me headlong into the wargames.

Feels weird to play this after the intensity and realism (or rather, chrome) of Wilderness War or Paths of Glory. Slightly abstract slant with the tile-laying mechanic of the political markers seemingly more important than combat. Despite the dud hands, the "broken" combat cards and the constant PC control counting (I find the map very hard to read) it really is a fun game. I'm finding myself attracted to it the more I play it, and admire the sheer playability of the game. Highly recommend tracking a copy down.

RATING: 4
I know this is a classic, but I don't think I would have considered this good even during its time.  It doesn't even feel like a card-driven game (I know Memoir 44 best), since the bulk of the time you are just playing the 1-3 Operations cards, which don't really limit your options, just the strength of your options, and a good amount of the cards you draw are only useful for the other side and just discarded. The most interesting aspect of the game is that it is more area control than traditional wargame, where you are constantly placing political control markers and removing your opponents, but this is so divorced from the gameplay with the armies that is doesn't make a good well-rounded game experience.  The armies can be used to flip PC counters, but due to the fact that you need to avoid ending your turn with your armies in cities that don't have Winter Quarters, it's very hard to use your armies to alter the PC counters significantly.

--Jan2013-- This is pretty nice.  The control dynamics are interesting; the asymmetry is cool; there are a bunch of cool choices.  I suspect that if I was an American (and thus found the theme more compelling) I'd find it ever more interesting.

A good light war game that is still definitely a war game for better or for worse (expect a lot of thumbing through the rules on the first game).

Lots of tension and very evocative of the history.  To make the battles a little more interesting, play that the repulsion of a double envelopment results in an *automatic* counterattack.

RATING: 9.875
This is the game that brought about the card-driven wargame craze.  The simplicity is really something.  The political control struggle can feel like Chess or more specifically the game Go.  The game seems to have good mechanics: The Americans don't want to battle, the British has better generals but can't seem to move them, the Congress must be protected, the smaller colonies are essentially more valuable, the Americans must spread their troops and generals around to keep the moral up, the British fight better near ports, Gen. Washington gets a winter offensive ability, the British have to worry when their government is going to fall, the Amercicans wonder if the French will ever arrive, troops die off in the north if not protected during the winter, Americans have to worry about Benedict Arnold leaving and if Von Steuben will get the troops trained properly, the British have to wonder when the Declaration of Independence will be signed, the American have to worry about Indians and Tories, etc.  I think this would be a great game for teaching history or attempting to get Euro-gamers into some wargames.

Seminal but flawed masterpiece.  Paved the way for card based war games.  Fun othello strategy mixed in with heavy theme and tons of personality.  

Perhaps, too heavy on the luck of the draw when it comes to cards (too many dead cards).  This game has unfortunately been broken by the discovery of the spread out American unit strategy, but if you play with the knowledge that that destroys the game avoiding it to be a good sport, then it still holds up as a solid fun 2 player war game.

Update: It seems that there is an obscure wintering errata to limit the sprawl of American units.  50% chance of losing half of your units rounded up.

Wow, the first CDG -- truly historic! Even 17 years later, the mechanics hold up well; I can see the attraction here.

But it's not for me: I prefer my CDGs in the area-control realm (Twilight Struggle); this is too much of a war game for me; I have no clue about how to make good tactical/strategic plans in those games! And while it's kind of interesting, I also don't really like the battle system, which has a lot of shuffling and a feels very random.

I think We the People was a remarkable design considering what had come before. It does have a high luck factor. I've seen one player gets 7 playable cards year after year while the other gets 3 or 4, and that can be awfully difficult to overcome. I also think the battle card system takes too long for too little payoff, and would prefer a conventional CRT. Even with those quibbles, I enjoy playing the game.

A fair political control game, the two games I&#039;ve played seemed a bit unbalanced in favour of the American side. It&#039;s clear that the Strategy cards can seriously unbalance this game! This game could really do with a few less fiddly rules.

The earliest example of this particular CDG system, We The People is very easy to pick up and play and runs smoothly.  I have only played once, but based on my experience with the game, I don't see the overwhelming American advantage that many people complain about.  I love the simple mechanics for movement and political control.  My only complaint about the game is that the winning side takes no losses, since that is unrealistic and makes battles such as Guilford Courthouse impossible, since one side in any given battle will win with impunity.

The father of card-driven games.

This game was the first in what has become a very popular trend for wargaming. The typically hex-based maps were simplified into an abstract system of connected spaces, which are used for army movement and to keep track of who controls the provinces politically. The armies themselves are greatly simplified, but the general in charge of the army gains much importance through his ratings for combat effectiveness and overall strategic effectiveness. Typically, dice are used to resolve conflicts between troops, however a deck of battle cards are used instead, which captures the feel of conflict much better and gives approximately the same results seemingly without the bitterness that accompanies skewed die rolls. And lastly, the overall ebb and flow of the game is determined through the play of strategy cards, which ostensibly mark certain historical events during the Revolutionary War, but each card has multiple purposes depending on which side is attempting to use it.

very good game witch i even got my dad to play. i enjoy the battle cards and feel that only one deck with not all cards being able to be used helps slow down the pace of the game in the terms of history.

I love this game. Plays fast, has tough decisions, and always remains fun. Plus it fathered so many other excellent card-driven wargames.

Soon to be re-released by GMT as Washington's War, this one started it all with regards to card driven games.  An excellent game with more focus on obtaining political clout on the board over outright combat.

Less luck dependent and therefore better than it's successor - Washington's War. 

Until 2008-10-10: 40 plays

Love it.  Love CDGs.  only beef is the combat system, which I can live with.  I am from Massachusetts so the theme is close to my heart.

Liked the subject matter, even if the game had the odd rough corner.

This is just a terrific light Card Driven Wargame. The "war" aspects are far less than in many other wargames, as the Political Control/Isolation aspects are so important.

Classic game that one day I would love to play.  I guess I'm a little nervous becaue of the age of the game.  It would be great to play the game that gave rise to so many card driven war games.

Great Game. Rules are simple, but strategy is not so simple once you realize what all is going in the game at any one time

Great game. I was fortunate to buy this when it first came out having no idea what a gem I was getting. Not played all that often anymore but I have fond memories of the games that I have played. A must have for card driven game fans.

Seminal game, first of the CDGs. Still fun to play. Deserves and gets an extra point for influence.

First of the CDGs. A remarkable, innovative,  brilliant design that has aged well. Simple and elegant, unencumbered by the needless complexities of some more recent CDGs.

06/20/07 - We The People is a great, great game - probably my favorite CDG - except that it suffers from one highly unusual fatal flaw related to the battle cards.  It's not that battles can be won after the play of a single battle card.  I actually like that (because it's quick and losing usually isn't too detrimental).  It's the fact that battle cards must be collected, calculated, shuffled and dealt before that single-card play victory can be achieved.  This is EXTREMELY AGGRAVATING and it's kept me from returning to this otherwise incredible game.  Aside from this, I only have one other complaint about We The People, and then I'll tell you why it's good.  I never liked the separation between Ops cards and event cards.  All subsequent CDGs have put Ops and Events on the same card, forcing the player to decide between playing the event or the OPS.  I believe I would have preferred this for WTP too, but, after hearing a recent interview with Mark Herman, who's decided to keep this separation in Washington's War, I have a little more respect for it.  

WTP in all other respects is the finest CDG I've played.  At it's core is the political control system later used in Hannibal and For The People (as well as the upcoming Unhappy King Charles, I believe).  I find this core system amazingly compelling because it relies on a distinctly indirect relationship between the military game and your actual objective, which is political control of the 13 colonies.  The fact that you can't win the game by simply smashing your opponent's armies is wonderful.  The game also plays quicker than any other CDG, and it dispenses with some of the chrome that Hannibal added (which, in Hannibal's defense, was not necessarily unwarranted).  I think when Washington's War finally arrives, it's going to quickly shoot up to my all-time top 5, and stay there.

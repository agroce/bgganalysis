Here you have a game that concentrates solely on the best part of all civ games, i.e. climbing the tech tree. I've always enjoyed the research part the most, and Progress shines on that. The technology cards are nice and make sense most of the time. However, there is one major and a few minor complaints. 

The biggest flaw is the lack of player interaction. I am not asking for direct intervention rather than some kind of blocking mechanic and competition for getting the technologies you want. A Through the Ages type of market would have solved that problem. Now it is just a matter of top decking the cards you want. Research is fun as solitaire as well but still.

The minor flaws are related to certain cards, or actually "Atomic Theory" and "Combustion" to be precise. To me it just does not make sense that you can jump from Combustion to Atomic Theory, whereas in real life the discovery of electromagnetism and molecular chemistry led to the discovery of the atom. This relation between combustion and atomic theory also causes the second minor complaint I have, i.e. a possibility of abrupt game end. One only needs to play Combustion and have top decked Atomic Theory and Automobile  to trigger the game end. This was just what happened in our game. On the first round of Age IV on player was lucky enough to draw all three cards, and then on his next turn he played all three ending the game right there. No other player got more than one turn on Age IV. You can imagine how unsatisfactory this was.

Anyways, Progress is a fun game, maybe even above average. It is just a shame that these few flaws keep it from becoming an all time favourite of mine.

Played a print and play version with ages 1-4.  I thought the game was quite fun.  The strategy I thought was a bit limited, however, and I'm concerned that a majority of the fun that was had was due to being able to discover new technologies as we progressed through ages.  

I'm not sure that the replayability is here, as I think with a detailed knowledge of the tech tree the decisions made throughout the game will get quite simple.

It felt like Progress played me.  Draw cards and build affordable developments.  In the style of 7 Wonders, each development has a cost and commonly a precursor building that allows it to be built for free. Watch out for those.  Draw more cards and build what you can.  Draw more cards...I played and won a game doing just this, not bothering at all with research, which is supposed to be a significant element.  I think the game would be more interesting if certain technologies (irrigation? literacy? the wheel?) were critical to development.  Instead, they are all as dispensable as poetry or atheism. 

Production quality is decent and the artwork is very pleasing.

You know how in civ-building games there is that tech tree you work on to make your empire better than everyone else's? Is that your favorite part of the game? Then have I got a game for you. Progress is just that. You are building a tech tree. And nothing else. You place cards into your tableau either group use of some type of knowledge you've acquired or by have tech already constructed that meets that card's criteria. And that's really all there is to it. But it is awesome in the respect. We ended getting this game because an oversight in shipping with a previous game earned up us either a refund of the previous game's cost or this game at no charge. Just for giggles we took this. And ti was a good choice. You'll have to pay $$$ for your copy of course. But it will be $$$$ well spent.

RATING: 6.5
I was very stoked to get this game. Arrived yesterday and I immediately got three 2 player games in. Only played the base game until the end of Age III and without personalities or milestones.

By the end of the third game I had arrived from being very excited to "okay, that's a decent game but I guess I won't be super eager to play this for quite a time".

The game is very easy to explain and the components are all very functional and of good quality. The KS exclusive game board is a nice add on but neither the action nor the victory point tokens left the box at all. Totally not needed.

Gameplay is smooth but as the game progresses individual turns are getting longer and the other players might get bored. That's not such a big issue in a 2 player game but might get really bad with more people. Except for mooching off discarded technologies, there is basically no player interaction at all.

I might be wrong on the following point but to me it felt as if there was rather little tactics, let alone strategy, you could employ to have any effects to the outcome of the game. I had the impression that it did not matter whether you tried to acquire new technologies via achieving required techs first or just paid by discarding more cards.
Also in retrospective I can say that (to me) the draw of cards had a much higher impact on determining which techs to get than anything else. Coupled with that it seemed that winning or losing was rather due to chance than by actuallly playing well or poor, although I'm sure that real cracks would beat me to dust all the time. 

Nevertheless, in the end gameplay felt a little bit too samy to me and that individual player decisions had little overall impact.

It has very good potential but seems too loose. I think the mechanic of variant buy potential for each card is excessive. I would also like the game to be more tight, I felt I had too many easy options and could not decide my strategy. Other than that, it was enjoyable and gave a sense of development.

First Play: Mindful of the early feedback and split opinion over whether actions were a one way trip to victory or failure not to mention the issue of replayability, I entered my first game with significant trepidation. The KS expansions seem obviously unnecessary bolt ons and so were left in the box. 

Build quality is excellent, rules are pretty simple and clear. It's immediately apparent that this is an elaborate engine building card game and a pretty lonely experience at that. You build your own tech tree, there is no interaction with other players worth mentioning and with a slight adjustment for what cards are in the discard for your turn or any card you might draw mid turn, your move is based upon the cards in your hand. You cant play what you don't pick up. Luck of the draw plays a significant part in this.

Some people like these sort of games. I imagine 7 Wonders fans will love this. However I found it a dull souless experience. The action markers didn't have any correlation to end positions (the player with 5 actions came last) so I wouldn't say its broken, its just a game for people who enjoy reacting to the cards offered every turn. And that's not me. I wouldn't want to play this again.

Sold.

Played solo to learn the game. Good tech tree decisions to make. I can see this game being murder for those with AP as the options are infinite. Easy to learn, tough to see optimal strategies (after one play). Looking forward to playing with more players. The down time between turns may be a good thing. 

Two players works fine and is a good, fast way to learn/teach the game. Tried with 5 with 3 new players and it really drug. I would only play 5 with experienced players.

I haven't played 3 yet, but I'm betting it's this game's sweet spot.

Kickstarted the PnP (2014).

Played two games solo, one 2p game and one 3p game. Came away from all these plays with the same conclusion: the game works mechanically but has no spark, no umph, no soul. The mechanisms work, the artwork is awesome and evocative. The game moves at a good pace. But this doesn't amount in anything exciting or fun.

 It's too bad cause there was a lot of work put in this game. It's a game that would have made a splash 10 years ago. But not now. Not with the quality of design coming out. This game is too lifeless to stand out. You draw cards, play them, move up tracks and try to keep an eye on your opponents. But with the numerous cards each player has, it's not easy to keep track. And the end you don't care much cause it's easy to find an alternative solution to your obstacles. Perhaps too easy, and that doesn't make the game tense enough.

I don't recommend this game. But I give the designers and publisher thumbs up for effort. Please play test it further and develop it to bring life into this game.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Probably overstayed its welcome a little for me.  A game that definitely rewards repeated plays, as at first the tech tree can be a little daunting.  I had fun, but I felt like 7 wonders scratches the same itch, and is probably a little more interesting for me.  Something I would definitely try again, but I don't think I would ever play this with more than 3.

Backed on Kickstarter as PnP.  Need to print and try some day.

My BGG buddies rate as 4-5/10 and say:  A decent idea that gets repetitive fast, and didn't feel like the cards were balanced.  Multiplayer solitaire with potential runaway leader problem.

Others say:  Few choices --> the luck of card draws dictates the path you must take.  Downtime problems --> can't plan ahead due to game mechanics, important stuff changes at the start of your turn; for this reason, don't play with 4-5p.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A pure tech tree game, so there's a little bit of engine building there, but with all the random card draws, not much strategy seems to be involved. After a couple of solo games, it appears you can just ignore knowledge tokens entirely, they're too sparse to ever buy you anything. Bit tedious and no real sense of achievement.

First impressions positive; ran on a bit but confident it would speed up on further plays. Pretty much all the age 1 cards were in play, so some concern that it may feel a bit 'samey' after a few plays, but faster play and the expansions may help with that and more experience may suggest a different approach which would produce a different pattern of card use - it certainly appears pretty lucrative to be the first to exploit a new era.

Ok game where it's all about technologies and how they evolved into each other during men's history. The trick in this game (in my experience) is to find the right technology cards that support each other and try to outrace your opponent(s). If you like interaction between players then this game is probably not for you, because there hardly is any present in the game (save for the indirect "I take this technology so you cant get it anymore").

Further plays would suggest that (being a card game) one can be unlucky.  This poor luck can be mitigated by careful play.  BUT, increasing the number of actions you have is very important.                     2016-12-30

It seems an interesting mechanism. I am not sure (yet) whether my poor performance is down to poor strategy, poor decision-making or bad luck in the cards drawn.  In our most recent game (5-player) I feel that I was unlucky in not seeing any cards of either of the Age I technologies that give you an extra action until the very end of the Age.  I then failed to realise that the Age was on the point of ending (It is difficult to keep an eye on all the other players in a 5-player game.) and was 1-1.5 actions down on everyone else and was trying to catch up thereafter.

Neat card game where you can play cards in a race to have the highest value in several point scoring tracks. Cards are easier to play based upon having prerequisite cards.

Biggest sin is that there is very little player interaction and not much you can do on each other's turns. Changing the discard pile is all you can do to each other and the game is more tactical than strategic with card draw.

7 for now but won't hold up after repeated play

Multiplayer solitaire taken to an extreme level. Not a bad game but you really don't need other players here, they just increase the play time.

Getting another action early one seems a bit too important, either you get lucky and draw one in your start hand otherwise you really have to spend actions to draw through the card pile to find one as soon as possible.

Why would somebody design a new 7 wonders, only without the drafting and neighbor interaction mechanics? Didn't they know about it? I gotta say I love civilization style games and history, but this poor mix of 7 wonders and Innovation kind of baffles me. Both of these predecessors are way better and already existed, so this game is redundant. Not impressed.

A terrific game that discards the rest of Civ-type games and simply focusses on the tech tree and does it correctly.

My favorite part of civ games is always the tech tree.  Progress is a game that is just the tech tree.  I found this game to be a pleasure to play.

Easily teachable in just a few minutes and while there is no direct conflict, good players will use the abilities to draw, discard, and shuffle decks as a way to carefully interact with the other players.

Very solid, enjoyable game here!

Nice game, we have played it about 10-20 times with and without all the add-ons we received from kickstarter. I have got two complains;
1. For me there is a need for more interaction in this game. It is playing well till the time someone would like to deny you some cards by holding them in his/her hand.  
2. I am getting sometimes the feeling I am not playing but rather cards are playing - I have to play what I have got. 

Of course it is not the game is bad because we spent some time having fun with it. Those are just my feelings.

Reminds me of 7 Wonders in that players draft cards to develop technology that then allow you to take more advanced technologies in later rounds. But the main focus of the game is in developing just the tech tree, which makes the game less interesting than 7 Wonders. Players do need to draft particular cards to increase player abilities, like number of allowed actions per turn or hand size. But the decision between drafting cards for a particular ability over cards that follow your original tech tree plan is not difficult.

2014-11-03 : A Civ building game with a tech tree building mechanic. Here's an enumeration of the multitude of things wrong with it :

- You have no say in what direction you want to build, everything is dictated by the cards you get, so the game devolves into getting cards and then puzzling out what the most optimal build is you can do in your turn.

- It's extremely annoying that you can't plan ahead for your turn because the quick-draw and shuffle-draw actions ensure that you have to wait for the previous player to have finished his turn before you can start puzzling.  This alone adds 90 minutes to a game.

- Getting the 3rd action in your first turn is crucial and is entirely luck dependent.

- Unlike other games like Hansa Teutonica you can't even direct your hand-size/actions/draw cards engine - it's again all dependent on the random cards you get.

- The point spread between the most efficient puzzler who manages to build the largest tech-tree and the low score will only be a couple of points, so what decides who wins the game is where you are on the 3 score tracks. Advancing on one of the tracks is - again - entirely dependent on the cards you get, not on the choices you make.

Was this game ever play-tested ?

I was really excited about the game and wanted to like it, now, after my first and probably last play today, I'm just happy I didn't pick up a copy at Essen '14. 

I like Civilization games, I like tech-trees and I even don't mind multiplayer solitaire, but this game is just badly designed. If this would have been a playtesting game of a prototype, I'd have had a bunch of things to nag on (rich-get-richer problematic; unsatisfying as you might loose no matter what decisions you take - and there aren't even any dice in there...). At least the artwork is quite nice. Needless to say, that the two people I played with didn't like it either.

A pity, as I think there was potential there.

Backed the Kickstarter but I'm starting to realize that this isn't my type of game.

The main issue is that this is not, as the title, theme and art suggests, an engine building game. Instead it's a risktaking/valuating game where you chain cards from a common pool and much judge your chances of drawing the right card (meaning that you need to know which cards are in the draw pile, in the discard pile or have been claimed by other players). So you've got a high chance memory game, both aspects that I dislike.

And it can't be speeded up, you need to sit and watch the other player's turns in order to know where the cards are, making it definitely not my type of game.

Ezt is sikerült kipróbálni, hála az andurilos esseni próbanapnak és bithelver kollégának.
A játék nagyon szép, jó minőségű. Egységes a grafikája, minden logikus és használható.

Nincs túlbonyolítva, rutinosoknak ha azt mondanám, hogy a 7 wonders és a hansa teutonica szerelemgyereke, akkor már gyakorlatilag játszani is tudnának vele.

Három korszakot játszunk végig, és különféle felfedezéseket, találmányokat játszunk ki kártyák formájában. Eleinte csak két akciónk van körönként, amit később felfejleszthetünk. A két akcióval kártyát tehetünk le, többféleképpen húzhatunk új lapokat, illetve hosszabb távú fejlesztéseket indíthatunk. A kártyáknak van nyersanyagköltsége, amit hasonlóan kell prezentálni, mint a 7 wondersben, annyi különbséggel, hogy itt másik kártyákat is mellé tudsz dobni jolly nyersanyagként (kb, mint a race for the galaxyban). A kártyák felépítésük után négyféle dolog kombinációját adják jutalmul:
- bizonyos akciótípusokat tápolnak, amiket így a jövőben jobban tudunk végrehajtani (pl. többet húzúnk, lásd hansa teutonica)
- nyersanyagot adnak a következő építésekhez (lásd 7 wonders)
- győzelmi pontot adnak
- egy tracken tolnak. No igen, van három befolyásskálánk, ezeken kell minél előrébb lenni a játék végén, ez adja a pontok kb. felét vagy akár többet is.

Természetesen kártyát nem csak a nyersanyagköltség kifizetésével lehet lerakni, hanem 7 wonders szerű láncban is. Csak itt sokkal hosszabb és bonyolultabb láncok vannak, mert egyrészt koron belül is van láncolás, másrészt van olyan, hogy egyszerre több előfeltétele is van egy-egy lapnak.

Összességében egy könnyen tanulható, straight-forward tech-fa építős játék. Tetszett, hogy egyszerűen megtanulható, tetszett hogy lehet taktikusan játszani, mindig kihozni a maximumot a kezedből. Tetszett, hogy a speciális húzási mechanizmusnak köszönhetően szinte minden kártya lekerül minden korból, annak ellenére, hogy rftg-szerűen folyamatosan nyersanyagnak is használjuk őket.

Viszont nem tetszett a pontozás, illetve a játék vége. Mint írtam a pontok 50-70%-a a trackekből jön. Itt szinte mindenki egy-két lépésre volt egymástól. Általában a köröd végén elől voltál mindenből, de mire újra sorra kerültél már jócskán visszaestél. Nem lenne ezzel akkora baj, de nem igen lehetett a játék végét kiszámítani, ami egyszercsak nyaklevesszerűen lecsap. Simán lehet, hogy úgy fejezted be a körödet, hogy nyernéd a játékot 10 ponttal, de jönnek utánad ketten, hirtelen vége a játéknak, és buktad 10-zel. Ez így nem igazán tervezhető.

Kérdéses még, hogy mennyire taktika vagy stratégiai a játék. Első játékra mindenképp taktika, mert nem nagyon tudsz előre tervezni. Ha nagyon kiismered a lapokat, akkor elkezdheted skubizni a techtreet, és már az elején tervezgetni, hogy ha most leteszed a kereket és minden jól megy, akkor a végén ingyen le tudod tenni az evoluciós elméletet. Kérdés, hogy a laphúzás randomságával van-e ennek értelme. Látok rá némi esélyt, hogy van, mert egyik lap sem egyedi, mindből bent van 2-3 példány, és elég jól visszapörögnek a nyersanyagnak használt lapok. Szóval simán lehet, hogy hosszú távon ez egy mély stratégiai játék, miközben az első pár partyra, egy élvezhető, könnyen tanulható taktikai.

Nekem így elsőre egy vegyes érzelmekből kiátlagolt 7-es.

The concept of the game is really good but I feel like the extra actions people can get is just too powerful.

Also the game drag at 3p, even without using any expansions. We even used the extra action variant to try to increase the engine building speed. But having to always re-evaluate things on your turn based on the discard along with looking at the the tech tree consistently just made in between turns long

The actions in the game should have been setup so people are only doing 1 at a time.

I really wanted to like this game, and I'll probably give it another try, but for now it's been a disappointment.

The problem is the randomness combined with the mechanic of having the number of actions per turn as one of the things that it's possible to increase over the course of the game.

The game I played I simply never drew a card that allowed for an increase in the number of actions until about halfway through the game. The other players were already an action to two actions ahead of me by that point.

Now, it's possible to do well in terms of score with fewer actions, and I did come in a close second out of three players, but when you're only getting to do half as many things on your turn as the other players get to do on theirs, that's simply no fun.

Well constructed game, enjoyable to play but a little multi-player solitaire.  Some of the reward icons hard to discern. 5p too slow.  Played next using the tokens to allow 1 action per turn, went a lot quicker - can think in other peoples turns.  But the player who got the extra action cards first won - which seems a random draw of the cards event.  I love the idea of this game, but the gameplay doesn't lend itself to strategic decision-making - only tactical ones - and the victory point scoring seems divorced from the gameplay.

Players: 3 or 4, 5 could be long
Length: should not be more than 60 mins
Mechanics: set collection
Decisions: not much but enough
Opinion: you have to develop the technology, just that, but, in order to do that you play cards trying to benefit yourself from previously developed cards, otherwise you have to pay the full cost. Cannot say more about the objective of the game
The idea of the game is fun, you start knowing nothing and your goal is to know the best technologies, would say to build a tree, but you focus on the best technologies to score points. The order you discover technologies could be reasonable, but no need for that (for instance you can develop reading without knowing the alphabet), no problem with that.
This is a game a would like to like, but I'm afraid I don't. Not a bad game, but it's so much focused on one thing. You don't go for a specific strategy of developing any technology, but you go for the options you can that turn, turns are fast and easy, but you cannot choose a lot, well I have those 2 technologies, one is free the other one resource (which I have and don't spend), one gives me points, the other not... what to choose?
In a nutshell, is a fun idea but something is missing there

It's a good game, especially the first 5-6 runs. After that it becomes a bit mechanical and repetitive. The games also tend to get longer and a bit boring - in the first 30 min. you watch for the other players and try to stop them, but after that the each player turn gets too long and you start thinking your own actions and just rushing for the finish, without taking so much notice on others.
But it's a solid game with easy to get rules. It's somewhat luck dependent.

(11/02/2014) Comment based on one play.

This is a civilization-lite game using cards that emphasizes nothing but the tech tree! It is similar in feel to 7 Wonders, but there is no card drafting (more like card drawing, as there is a draw and discard piles to draw from) or effects from neighbors. It is essentially multi-player solitaire, with no interaction whatsoever, save the fact that there are fewer cards of each tech than there are number of players.

So, in a 3-player game, there are only two copies of each tech/progress card. If you are lucky enough to draw a tech/progress card and play it, that card may serve as a prerequisite for the next tech/progress card, which may be acquired for free or at significantly reduced cost. A player may buy the card outright, if they play enough "general" knowledge, in terms of card discards (each card has a value on it) and specific knowledge tokens that they have collected from prior tech/progress cards.

The game is played in three/four/five ages, depending on the complexity and game length desired. Each tech/progress card can be played as a tech/progress card that is played on the player's tableau area, or they can be discarded like currency, like in Glory to Rome or Traders of Carthage, where each card has a general knowledge value. To play a card, the early ages require expending X number of knowledge of a specific type. There are four general "tracks" of technology and associated knowledge: 1) General, 2) Cultural, 3) Scientific, and 4) Mechanical. As the cards progress, they begin to have prerequisites of requiring development of two prior technologies that are below the current one in the tech tree. If the player has both, they can play the new one for free. If the player has only one, they can pay the knowledge cost of the missing tech. Alternatively, as one of their actions, the player can "research" a tech card, where the tech becomes available for free after N number of turns as dictated by their progress tableau. In the meanwhile, the tech is now available to satisfy the prerequisite of newer tech. In this manner, players play successively more powerful and expensive tech. (This mechanism felt a bit cheap, allowing players to jump ahead without even completing the basic research that underlies the newest tech!)

Each card has three symbols that concern the player. The first symbol dictates an improvement in one area of their player tableau. The second symbol indicates moving up one step along one of three progress tracks, similar to ones you would find in Terra Mystica or Attila--at the end of the game, a schedule of VP is awarded for relative position on each of the tracks. The third symbol, if it exists, shows how many VP will be scored for this card at the end of the game.

As mentioned earlier, each player has a tableau that is similar to the one in Hansa Teutonica, with seven different tracks. The tableau is thick cardboard, with square holes punched out, to allow placement of a wooden cube to mark how far a player has progressed along a given track, much like the tech tree in Clash of Cultures. One track shows how many actions a player may take each turn. Much like Teutonica, the increase in the number of actions is non-linear, increasing in sequence like: 2, 2, 3, 3, 4. The second track shows how many cards may be researched at any given time. The third track shows how long research takes of each card--this starts at 4 turns, but drops to 1 turn at the other extreme, which means a player could research a new card once every turn! The fourth track shows how many "Quick Draws" they may take, which is a way of getting a few cards into one's hand. The fifth track shows how many times the discard pile of a given Age may be shuffled back into the draw pile, and allowing the drawing of X number of cards. The sixth track shows how many cards a player may draw from either the draw or discard deck of any currently active Age deck(s)--contrary to other games, drawing new cards in this manner ends the turn for the player. The seventh track shows how many cards a player may hold until the next turn. This starts at 5 cards, but grows steadily to 7 or 8 cards. The ability to cycle through and draw many cards is key to doing well, as having more cards in hand means more general knowledge that can be spent when playing a tech/progress card. However, making progress along these tracks is dependent on the tech/progress cards played, so the relationship is circular.

The game is relatively simple in terms of mechanics, and quick to play, with very little downtime. However, I could not get away from the feeling I was playing multi-player solitaire, watching and listening to the other players play out their cards, which had no impact on my play, other than watching out for tech/progress cards that were no longer available. It seems to scratch the civ-lite itch, in a 7 Wonders sort of way, but it is a lonely, boring exercise. It is a solid "7", but not sure if it will hold there. I'm willing to play a few more times, but suspect there is not much here to warrant a "7". It also has all the elements of economic snowball that I am not fond of, so it may soon drop from here.

(12/02/2014) Update, 2 plays. It is an economic snowball. Mechanically, it's not bad and the theme is good, but the play is mind-numbingly trivial and lacks substance. In our second game of four player, it was very obvious by the second age who had won. Those that luck out and get the "good" starting cards will do well. In a N-player game, there are usually N-1 cards that give you an extra action or allows you to draw more cards right off the start. If you get one, you're fine; if you don't, you will quickly fall behind your peers. The ability to draw more cards and hold more cards is huge, because it allows you to search to find those critical, essential, and limited cards. Find them and then your game is easy. If you don't get the good prerequisite cards, you could always research the card you want to play, but then you'd have to wait 3-4 turns to get the benefit. There are not many meaningful decisions beyond that. During the third age, we watched as the winning player spent longer and longer turns going through his 4-5 actions, while we twiddled our thumbs in frustration. It may be an okay game as a 2-player, but as a 3-player or 4-player, it is multi-player solitaire with a race to find the "good" cards and atrocious downtime. Here's another indictment of the lack of vetting of game design in the Kickstarter model--this game needed more playtesting or more polish, but as it stands, it is half-baked at best. I think I am done with this. I'm dropping it to a "5".

Y.A.K. (Yet Another Kickstarter) that shares the characteristics of so many Kickstarted games: the germ of a good idea, not enough development.

It works up to a point, but inevitably there's luck of the draw, especially in the final age, when positions on the all-important scoring tracks are being decided. I'm also not sure the sudden death ending was a good idea, better to have given everyone an equal number of turns.

If you research it, you'll probably find parallels to 7 Wonders, because of the layout of the cards and the costs requirements/prerequisites. It also has an option to use cards to build things like San Juan/RftG/The City (but is not the only way to build things). The cubes on the player mats and the progression through 3 ages reminded me a bit of Through the Ages. 

It is exceedingly non-confrontational (good for us). There's a hint of "you built that before I could" but some cards even have 2 copies, so it wasn't a big deal. If someone rushes the third age before you're ready, and your first age cards in development are wiped out, that could be bad (ours were built, none were in development, so it didn't affect us). Other than that, it's more about causing the game to end (like in Roll Through the Ages, building the last development a round before your opponent was going to make their big move). 

Politics and Military are mentioned as possible future expansions. There's no military or attacking the other player, not even in the 7 Wonders points tokens way.

We did not realize just how many cards we'd be building. At first we agonized over which card to build, and then we released we were building most everything. Discarded cards can be drawn again, so we picked up and built most every card (in the 1+ and 2+ player decks, there are more for more players, like 7 Wonders). 

Action points reined in the turns a little, but didn't feel overly scarce. I ramped up in actions pretty quickly, Sam may have felt differently. It definitely felt like a feast rather than famine game, especially with cards as far as the eye could see. 

Now that we have the gist of it, we'll have to play it again and see if there can be a focuses strategy, if we can make things happen on purpose rather than just playing what comes our way (we made some small choices, of course, but not to the extent of, say, a baking strategy in Agricola).

RATING: 4
I would best describe this game as 7 Wonders without the card drafting.  Instead you are using different card draw and discard actions to play your technologies and score points.

I liked this game, but in spite of a few niggles I had with it.  Firstly, I think it's a bit long - considering that all you are doing is playing cards to the table with no player interaction whatsoever, I think that this should play between maybe 45 and 90 minutes depending on player count.  Secondly (and this is related to the first), I think that you have too many player actions per turn.  Once you have upgraded your player board you can have 5 actions per turn, which takes far too long as you have a huge number of options.  The potential for AP is strong and I found myself getting a bit embarrassed as I tried desperately to stew over my alternatives while the other players were waiting.

Otherwise, I think this game is solid and could be fun to play with small player counts and experienced players.  It seems to me that the designer has taken a very good framework for a card game and kind of spoiled it with over-ambitiousness.  Would like to play again though.

EDIT - After 2nd play I'm still not so impressed.  The game is too long, only a 3 player game took around 2.5 hours.  I have no idea how they get 45 - 90 minutes on the box.  Shame really because this is a promising game.

This is an excellent "tech tree" game with the caveat that this should be played 2-player or 3-player with all experienced players. I doesn't scale great because adding players just adds time to the game. Sure, the cards in the decks are changed based on player count but it DRAAAAGS with more than 2 players. Also, the AP prone need not apply.

Way too much downtime even in a 2 player once you upgrade the amount of actions you get each turn. The tableu is a complete mess with tonnes of cards in front of you. There's no easy way to see what you've got and what you could research for free.

The only interaction is seeing what the other player has discarded, and checking to see if the other player may force the age to end soon or not.

Very dissapointing game that had so much promise.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (July 2016)

When I bought Progress: Evolution of Technology I thought I was buying Legacy: Gears of Time (a game I enjoy). It was a surprise to notice my mistake and worst of all it was an horror to notice the game publisher was NSKN Games. In the past I have had trouble unpunching their games. It was a complete nightmare to unpunch Exodus: Proxima Centauri (I sold the game solely by this issue, I really hated it and was very angry about it), it literally took me hours to do it, and I don’t remember which other game of theirs had the same issue (perhpas Praetor although to a lesser degree). So I was really scared of unpunching the game. I almost broke a rule of mine (I never sell unplayed games) but at the end I was pleasantly surprised. Unpunching Progress: Evolution of Technology was a joy and very easy to do. I´m very glad NSKN Games solved this issue so I can buy games from them again :D.

In civilization games, I really like to play with the tech tree, so I was keen on trying the game. It is a good theme for me.

The game components and art are ok. 

The rules are very easy to teach, you can do it under 15 minutes. Playtimes is around 90 minutes. It is best with 3 players, with more the downtime begins to be too much for me for such a simple game (light-medium weight).

Progress: Evolution of Technology comes with 3 mini expansions (a plus) that aren't on the table of contents (a minus). It was a pain to discover this. I thought my copy of the game was incomplete.

I really like games in which the cards can be used in multiple ways, in Progress: Evolution of Technology you can use play the card (paying it) or you can use it to pay for other cards. I’m not sure if this qualify as multiple uses ;), but I still like the game. The technologies work exactly like they do in 7 Wonders. You can get free technologies if you have the previous ones, and I’m not sure if this part is balanced or not, because luck of the draw can be too much in this regard, that is, a player can get all the technologies he needs just by drawing (luck), not planning. I’m worried this can lead to a runaway leader situation. Another source of concern is that I’m not 100% sure that the player´s tracks are balanced or not. It seems clear that having more action per turn is better, but some players will achieve this goal earlier and others won’t (again through luck). I need more plays to verify this point but I’m willing to play the game again soon!

The decisions aren’t very hard, but they aren’t too easy as well. There is some tension deciding what to build and, most of all, how to pay for it. Your opponents can take the cards from the discard pile!.

Player interaction is very low, this doesn’t bothers me in the least, but I know it bothers some people.

Bottom line, I was pleasantly surprised by Progress: Evolution of Technology. I enjoyed it and my desire to play it again is high. For now, I will keep it in my game collection and it is a borderline 6.5 for me. Perhaps it can get an upgraded rating with more plays. I have some worries about the game balance and the luck factor, but I liked it. I will play it again soon.

Current Rating: 6.5

Backed on KickStarter. I love the tech tree in Civ games, so this one sounded fantastic. The creators ran a great campaign, and the postcard they sent from Romania with a piece of card art on it after it funded was very cool. The art is fantastic, and it's on my pile of games to play soon.

On paper this game should work, but it runs inelegantly and anticlimactically, the ending losts all tenseness, converted in a pile of cards and actions. The technology tree promises an interesting play but it results irrelevant. No interaction here, only boredom and cards chains with a poor sense.

Yes, it works. I didn't dislike my play, since engine building is fun. But there are enough dislikes to keep me from rating this higher.

1. There is really no player interaction aside from watching the discard piles. I don't really require player interaction, but when you can't even see (or care) what another player is doing, that is a problem.

2. The artwork is ugly. The box art is one of the worst I've ever seen.

3. It is too long. As a filler length game, this would be fun. But no way do I want to do this for over an hour.

It seems like this would have been a better game had it gone through more rigorous development. This is part of the stigma attached (fair or not) to Kickstarter projects.

Nice idea, but the game drags on too long on the end without having significant changes during that time (just the +action slows play time quite a bit)

Just eliminating the "draw from discard pile" and having a priority on milestones will transform this in a simultaneous action selection keeping the time down in this multiplayer solitaire

Fun for one game, easy rules, but very oddly designed.  Basically, the whole tech tree is almost meaningless, because it's very easy to simply pay a bit extra to get any technology card at all.  Seems like a foolish design to me, though bear in mind I only played one time.

At the moment, my rating is based on the quality of the game's components, which are very good...except for the cards.  I'll change my rating to reflect on my thoughts of the game once I've played it a few times. 

(10/24/14)

Now that I've played the game, I have decided to drop the score to a flat 7.  I feel like it's an accurate ranking for the game's play and flow.

After a video Review: Seems similar to san juan for the card play but without the roles. Plays well with low amount of players, which is good for me.

You basically build technologies that will give you better or more actions, or that will increase competition on 3 tracks with other player to get more points. There is apparently a solo variant, and the game could feel as solo multiplayer due to the little interactions.

From user comments: Lot of Downtime with 3 or more players. Card abilities makes no sense with theme, Snowballing effect, which is less an issue in solo.
Unbalanced abilities, as getting more actions seems like the key to success. Little player interaction and No interesting choices.

This game works fine but it is too long and too dry. Sold my copy. 

After a four player and a three player game, I don't believe I will ever use the fourth age expansion again in anything but a solo or two player game.  The game just drags too long.  I do like the leader and the milestone mini-expansions to add a bit more flavor to the game as well as potential ways to combat on the three tracks too.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

After seeing a number of my geekbuddies have a poor experience in this one, I didn't have high hopes and was even planning on trying to sell mine without opening the shrink.  However, that may now have changed as I really enjoyed my two player game.  One must be aware to fight for the majorities and then try use the actions well to both prep oneself for the tech track to spend less cards if possible AND to not use/discard techs that are good for your opponents.  The additional modifiers to several different actions that can be achieved adds in a bit more interesting game play options.  This is a very DRY game with little interaction outside of denial (which should not be ignored).  The game may well feel repetitive as well over time and there might be a fair bit of downtime if one is also observant of denial of cards to opponents and have to review which cards they have played.  I'm not convinced there is a ton of replay value, but I'm willing to find out  now.

I love the tech tree mechanic in the game, and the theme, but the game takes too long -- especially if you add expansions. I would have kept my KS copy if it played quicker, but decided to trade it once I realized AP and player time increased as ages progressed due to the "benefit" of gaining more actions. Too bad. Great game otherwise.

as someone who has played Sid Meier's Civilization computer game since the late 80s when it came out, I was thrilled to find a board game that takes ONLY the technology development portion as the basis for a game. This game out of Romania does an awesome job of pulling you out of the tech tree while keeping you tied to it, as managing the decks (drawing and discard piles) is just as important as developing your technologies. this is an extremely popular game around our house, especially with those of us who are not war gamers by nature. however, hard core wargaming Civ players will not like it - beware.

Played with 4 players and the game dragged quite a lot.  Getting 4-5 actions in the later phases of this game really makes turns take awhile and since you don't particularly care what other players are doing (multiplayer solitaire) the game feels long for what it is.

I do really like the entire tech tree mechanic of instantly being able to get the next tech if you have the previous requirements.   However, I wish the tech tree was structured in a way that it made logical/strategic sense to focus on certain areas like if you wanted to develop faster you could focus just on the science track to boost development times.  This would make thematic sense and would add some strategic flair to this game.

This game is probably best at 2-3 players. Anything more is way too much downtime.

What he likes about it so much is the engine-building element. You start out with nothing, and are trying to develop the right cards to have what you need by the final age to be able to play the big cards.

Had high hopes for this, as the tech tree is the part of a civilization game I love, and this game has been described as only that.  Games problems:
 - Game End Condition: The immediate game end trigger allows abuse (I crushed everyone by doing this, but it didn't feel satisfying as I choose when it ended, and thy had no opportunity to respond, and one person had one less turn than everyone)
 - Random Card Draw: Sure, this is part of the game, but with how the draw/end turn action works, if I had non-ideal cards, I would play what I could, and to the big draw as my last action to promote luck management.  This seemed like the way to mitigate luck, but made the game feel like I was just putting out what I could other than planning.  I like a tactical game, but this felt like a lot of the decision making was based on draw more than I'd like.  The aspects that this degree of randomness bothered me on were:
 - - Player Powers.  At mercy of what you get for what powers/engine you go for.  There was usually a little choice, but not enough.
  - - Upgrade path.  For 1 Age I had great upgrade paths, but for the others, with drawing every turn, almost nothing.  Meanwhile, 1 player was all over the place with free upgrades.  There's ways around this, but it's an issue of draw-driven efficency to too high a degree.
 - Reference Sheet.  A very well done reference sheet, but the constant cross referencing of the sheet made for very tedious feeling gameplay.

I don't know how one would fix this game, other than boosting the draw/discard ability.  I feel you should be able to draw substantially more cards (but not keep more cards).  For sure at low levels.  At high levels probably still draw a lot more cards, but not keep numbers of cards close to what the regular draw/end-turn action gives you.  Discard pile manipulation is a step towards fixing this, but not enough.  For end game conditions, that's an easy fix... give everyone another turn, and possibly give all players equal turns (but if you did that, don't give late turn order players additional cards to start).  For player aids, if people are of different skill levels (or memorized familiarity), they're a necessary evil.  If of the same skill level, I'd support not using them (the important part being all players be on equal footing... I know the up tight gamers would hate not having the aids, but I'd love it).

A pure tech tree game. I played this game solo only, not much player elimination anyways. I liked working my way through the tech tree. You pretty much follow the path that the cards you draw dictate. It is a challange optimizing your card play and hand management to gain the maximum score. I quite like it after three plays, but I question if it has real staying power on more plays...

The idea of this game is fun, even though it's simply the tech tree of civilization, made into a boardgame.

This game has some cool ideas and a nice tech-tree to explore; but some problems with the rules ruin it.  First, increased actions/turn is too powerful and greatly throws the flow of the game out of balance.  Next,the age can change too quickly-- in one 2-p game we went to age 2 with the first card play.  Finally the cost of the cards are not calculated properly.  As it is, there is no reason to follow the tech-tree - just dump your hand for the symbols and build cards. This makes the game devolve into something like an elaborate Go-Fish.

A cool, 7 Wonderish civilization card game with quite satisfying combo-building, although I'm not sure whether it's truly balanced, ie. some of the technology paths feel a bit inferior. 

More fiddly and complex than 7 Wonders Duel, but quite solitairish; i.e. if you're looking for something not as in-your-face as 7 Wonders, you might want to check this out. There's a nice runthrough by Rahdo in YouTube, for example. As an added bonus this goes up to 5 players, enen though it's probably best with two.

A simplified civilization game, with mechanics quite similar to most card games - you either play a card (in various forms) or acquires cards every turns. 

While the artwork is gorgeous and you seem to have a lot of options every turn, you don't seem to have lots of strategic choices. You usually just play the cards you draw, as you can't really afford to wait for a specific card unless it's age 3 and your draw power goes up. Luck is a huge factor in the game, as you might just draw all the cards in the same tech tree, or you never draw a card that let you do extra actions- which is extremely vital in this game.

I love the concept of the game. The game-play is a bit brainless though.

Cool card play - theme is pretty tight-fitting.

Game is too long with 4 or 5 players.  Don't play with more than 3 unless you want a 4+ hour experience.

The rule that allows players to gain the benefits of the technology before finishing their research should be ignored; it's overpowered.  Also, players should always receive the same number of turns.

First of all: this was a PERFECT kickstarter, everything on time and arrived as it should be.

Concerning the game in general, this is my favorite setting. However, this game has not risen my enthusiasm. 
Graphics is good and tech tree is fun. 
The mechanics is pretty simple, with only research and wonders which create some problems. However, it is too much straightforward: the tech you have to discover are the ones which arrive for free and that you have in hand. The only interesting strategy is choosing what to research. Which ability to increase is an obvious (more actions) or irrelevant choice.
Concerning the setting, I hardly have the feeling of developing techs, there are too many and at the end I only see three long piles of cards. Symbols on the cards are thematic for some techs, but for most are far too abstract, it could be any symbol! It is not like Through The Ages where each discovered tech changes really your situation and at the end you remember for sure when did you discover it and the feelings.
Moreover, the possibility to draw cards from 4 different decks makes also the game less thematic and more "search for the right card".

Absolutely nothing new here.  Dull game.  Played once, and the game played me.  I just drew cards and if I was lucky to draw the right ones that chained for free, I played them.  

Simply nothing to the game, very boring, made very few decisions.

Nice concept as an idea for the game but badly implemented.

RATING: 5
The four player game using the fourth age was too long with too much downtime for me. Very little player interaction, the game seemed repetitive and provided few occasions when there were genuinely interesting decisions to be made. Only rated as high as five because it might be better with fewer players and using fewer ages.

"Clever and fun civ-themed tech tree card game. Not a good choice for AP-prone folks. Official solitaire variant is OK but not great."

What I like:
- Tech tree (and civ theme) is fun
- Relatively simple rules but deep gameplay
- No direct attacks
- The player boards lock the cubes in place

What I don't like:
- First play ran long (2.5 hrs) but should speed up
- Can inspire AP in those who are prone to it
- I'm not a fan of majority scoring, but here it's not a showstopper
- Aside from denial moves, rushing age shifts can mess with other players a bit

Clever design with lots of options. I love that there are 3 ways to invent each tech. The game length is highly variable. I have had 2p games end in 40 minutes, and others have taken almost 3 hours. It mostly depends on whether players move briskly or analyze deeply. 

My rating of 8 is holding up so far, because I am really enjoying it despite my general dislike of majority-based scoring, which is the key to winning this game.

The solo game hasn't really clicked for me. I suspect it might if I played it enough to really be able to squeeze every last point out, so I could celebrate new high scores. I can't explain why I can't get enthused about that.  

I would put the weight around 2.8, higher than BGG voters, due to depth, not complexity.

RATING: 8
I'm not getting the low ratings to this game. I found the downtime in a two or three-player game to be reasonable and certainly not overwhelming. I haven't played it with four or five players but I could see how that might be excessive. Either way, I have seen other games (like History of the World) which are rated higher than this one but have MUCH more of a downtime problem than this one. Some of the folks here say the game is "broken" but don't elaborate on how or why it is "broken". I always take such comments with a HUGE grain of salt.

Personally, I found the game to be a lot of fun with two and three players and (as Marco points out in his video review) the solitaire game is not something that appears "tacked on" but had real thought and consideration. 

It's not a perfect game, of course. There is a runaway leader problem that I'm not sure there is a fix for. Then again, you could simply concede the game at that point and try again.

Traded away after one play. The game didn't excite enough to merit keeping it. Great production but the game felt very automatic without many interesting decisions. This might improve with more plays but we weren't interested enough to keep going with it.

RATING: 8
First time we played this we played the short game (3 eras and no expansions) and with five players. Five players are too many, especially with beginners, you get too much downtime due to the complex progress-tree. With three players (like last try) you have enough time to plan your turn and still remember what you planned when it becomes your turn. With five players you will forget your plan several times over before it's your turn. Not to mention the boring wait. 

Except for too much downtime it felt like the game would soon be the same everytime, but that feeling disappeared next time we played. 

Last time we played we were only three players, and we played the full game, with all expansions, including era IV. We still had the feeling that it was difficult to plan ahead what paths do I want to chose, since it is too difficult to get hold of the next card. You also chose path from what you can build, rather than what bonuses you get from the cards. This adds some randomness and removes strategy from scoring. You end up concentrating on building as much as possible rather than following a strategy or trying to opt scoring. 

The cards that score 1p for each card of that type is too strong. Suddenly you have a card that will give you 5-10 points, when all the other cards score 0-3p. If someone manage to build one more of these cards than the others he will most probably win. 

but all in all I like this game.

Progress is basically Tech Tree: The Card Game.  Players draw tech cards randomly from a deck, and can pay for them either by discarding other tech cards for their discard value, spending permanent resources granted by some techs, or having specific techs out that give you a discount.  The tech cards, once played, either give you victory point tokens, let you advance on tracks that count for majorities at the end of the game, give you permanent resource tokens, or give you a bump on your action board, which lets you do certain actions (like drawing) better.  This whole package sounds appealing, but I found the game to be rather bland.  There aren't really card combos aside from 7 Wonders-style discounts, and all the cards did the same sorts of things.  I would have preferred card text that let various cards interact in interesting ways.

Civ game with just the tech tree. Like this quite a bit. It has the 7 wonders thing where some tech is free if you have another one already built. You can improve your options during the game by getting more tech, thereby improving your engine. Nice, though hubby is crazy good at it...

Tried solo as well - works quite well, liked it.

Imagine if after each move in Solitare you needed to wait for someone playing another game of Solitare to do their turn, or three other people for that matter. The tech tree is interesting and the game is fun, if you play solo. If however, you play with others the game slows down quite a bit. There's very little player interaction, literally just taking cards from shared piles, yet because of it you can't play simultaneously.
I'd rank the game a 4 as multiplayer and maybe a 7 as single player.

I bought the game because I liked the idea of a Tech-Tree game.  After playing one solitaire game, I did enjoy it but definitely agree with other commenters that this game is not suited for more than 3 players due to the lack of interaction between players is going to cause dead-time between turns for each player.

The game needs a mechanism where players can interfere with each other.

An engine building game at it's heart.  If you understand what the tech tree is, the game could become a race - since cards can be pulled from either the draw or discard or re-shuffled into the draw pile.  It just didn't scratch any particular gaming itch.

Rated after one play, with the included expansions. This is a worthy game and I will play it again. With the Industrial Revolution (Age IV) expansion it may run a bit long, but then first games always go slowly so I will withhold judgment until I've played some more. It is not for casual gamers because there are a lot of details to track. Also the rules are a bit complicated, especially with the expansions included. Experienced gamers will have no problem.

I played this for the first, and still only, time at our local club in December 2014 - one of them bought it at Essen, and 3 of the 5 players had played the previous night (the first game for each of them). To be honest, I'm not sure what I think of this - for now I am giving it the benefit of the doubt and a 7 rating, because I would be happy to play again and could see several ways I could have improved (I actually came second, with 31, although the winner - ironically the only other player whose first game it was - got 45), I think this rating is much more likely to go down than up in subsequent plays.

Firstly, the game is apparently supposed to play in 90 minutes, yet we took at least an hour more than that, despite playing only 3 ages. I can see this coming down significantly with experience (at least 4 of the players, including me, APed at various points, and there was a reluctance on the part of most players to trigger the end of the game), but 90 minutes for a 5p game still strikes me as very optimistic. As for the game itself, I didn't feel a lot of opportunity to really follow a strategy - you are very reliant on which cards you draw, at least early on, and you can never really improve any of your skills all that much before quite late in the game. The extra actions seem particularly crucial - having just 2 for more than the first few turns is pretty crippling. And there wasn't really a feeling of the technologies getting more exciting as the ages went by - they got more expensive, but just gave the same sort of combinations of things as before. (I see why this had to be the case from a game-design point of view, but it still felt like something was lacking.)

So overall I wasn't particularly impressed - and yet I can perhaps see some opportunities for developing a good "engine" (particularly as regards research, I tried to go for this but never once managed to take advantage of the fact that techs under research can still be used as prerequisites for other techs, and also didn't get enough skill advances on the two research tracks combined), and would be interested to play again. Certainly with fewer players next time, however!

The solo game is a lot of math with a little luck thrown in.  It's balanced but not interesting.  There are no tough choices, just calculation plus some luck.  Solo play is a 4/10.

The ability to swap with the time deck was put in to ensure that you can get any tech you need, but I think the rule is a mistake.  In the larger game, you have no guarantee of getting a particular tech, and there are lots of workarounds.  The potential interest in the game is tactically reacting to your hand, not examining a huge stack of available cards and computing the maximum point play.  But I don't know if that potential is reached with more than 1 player, I probably never will since the game seems overall pretty boring.

It's not an embarrassment of a design, but I see no particular reason to play it again.  Too bad, since it combines several good mechanics, has clean rules, and nice production quality.  But none of those make up for the absence of hard choices.  Everything works, but nothing is fun.

update: played 5 players, the game is a painful bore.  There is a huge amount of down time, little ability to plan ahead, and the variance of what you draw from the deck skyrockets.  There is also a huge, perhaps insurmountable, advantage to getting +1 action early in the game with no mitigation or workaround.  I think the game should probably be capped at 3 players, but 4 may be ok.  Saying that the game works for 5 is sloppy and irresponsible on the part of the designer.  5 player game is 2/10

Really impressed - great tech-tree card game.  If your favorite part of 7 Wonders is playing cards for free based on having the precursor in play, you will love this game.  My only gripe is that there is quite a bit of downtime between turns - there is very little player interaction, you can usually preplan your turn in advance, and all you care about during opponents' turns is what they put in the discard piles.  Halfway through the first game I already came up with a variant to play simultaneous turns - I really feel modern designers today really should always ask themselves "Why am I making this turn-based?"  There may also be an issue with runaway leaders, but need more plays to see if this will really detract from players' enjoyment.  Definitely looking forward to playing this one a lot more.

--Feb 2018-- Quite a lot better (I think) as an app then as a set of cards.  I expect one want (I know I did!) to have a pretty reliable tracker of the various scoring and technology-enhancing awards.  But most of us needed a couple tries at the end of the game to have any hope of getting them right.   Something easy and definitive would improve the experience.  (And, just as an example, having the same icons in the same location on each card would probably be better; then it'd be easier to fan the set in some direction and count totals.)

I like this game A LOT. I know it's far from perfect but I am a tech-tree fan and this game satisfies my needs. Quality components, some nice mechanisms and strategy, simple rules. 
In the cons is that as game progresses and the more people playing there is some considerable downtime between turns ,and rather little interaction between players. It gets better as players learn the rules and they use the downtime to plan their next turn, but I think 3 players is the best for this game. The 4th Age addition is theoritically nice but will cause the game to last to much. I wonder if anyone ever used it.

RATING: 7
Firstly I've got to say this was not just my best Kickstarter experience to date, it was an ideal experience. Perfect!

There's nothing particularly new to see here, but the attraction of the game is that it's not trying to do too much. You're progressing up a tech tree and gaining ability improvements (knowledge and enhanced actions), along the way. The trick is to try and shoot up a narrow tree rather than a great wide bushy one, and along the way improve what you need to improve and score as much as you can over your opponents.

Player interaction is thin here. Paper thin. It mostly involves fighting your opponents over three scoring categories. You can look to deny your opponents a card or two, but you probably won't bother because you've got your own problems to deal with. It's essential to keep an eye out for what's being discarded because you can also draw from the face up discard piles. This can further slow down play as players seed the discard payments with cards that are useful to their opponents at the bottom. On the plus side all this observation gives players something to do when it's not their turn and improves the player interaction a bit with experienced players.

I won't play this one with more than four players, and then only if they're reasonably quick players. (Three is probably ideal.) Turns get longer as play progresses and you get more actions. There's a lot of choices on your turn and because you're possibly drawing new cards on your turn they can't all be preplanned. Players with an eye on moving this along will be looking at the tech tree and have their first actions planned ahead. Otherwise it'll drag... a lot.

If you're lucky enough to play with people who keep it ticking along then it's a simple game to pick up and hard to master. Along the way is a decent puzzle. There's luck in the draw of the cards, almost no player interaction and it's not an exciting game with brilliant individual moves. However, with lots of choices and different paths to explore I'm still enjoying this one several plays in and look forward to exploring further. I haven't tried adding the Personalities or the Age IV deck yet, so there's a lot of life left in this one yet.

 2-3 feels like the best number of players to me but it does play 1-5 but I have played it solo and although I did enjoy it I'm not sure that it will have a lot of replayability for 1 player.
   I suspect 4+ players could easily result in quite a bit of slack time due to AP in the later stages of the game.

Wasted Potential

What sounds like a nice idea, to "unlock" a techtree becomes just a horrible expierence.

The game is very prone to downtimes, espacially if you play with more then 3 players. But even with 3 players a single slow player (cause he is new or tends to optimize his turns) can kill the game for all players.

The cards are very unintuitive.

The game is just a multiplayer-solitaire where the only interaction points are the discard piles at all, and even those interactions are minimal, but you STILL got to wait, till someone decides which cards he wants to discard.

Speaking of muliplayer-solitaire: The mechanic is to pile up cards from the bottom to the top. It doesn't matter if you start with fancy technology names like "burial", "pottery" or with an "ace" followed by a "two".


The game feels completly luckdriven, and there is almost no mechanic to stop an early leading player.


To be honest, this feels like most kickstarter-games. Nice idee, impressive artwork (artwork creates funds on kickstarter), but not enough playtesting (also testing with unexpierenced players).

Just save your money, grab some cards (or use windows) and play some solitaire. Same mechanic but it's over after 10 minutes, and you are able to do something productive or play a game, that gives you choices instead simulating choices.

RATING: 6
I was really intrigued by this game and in retrospect I probably shouldn't have been.  And sure enough, it was a bit underwhelming.  The reason I was so intrigued is because the pitch I heard was that this game was the technology phase of any civilization game without the rest of the game.  This immediately tickled the right parts of my brain because the technologies are my favorite part of any civilization game.  However, I like those parts because they give me new powers and abilities, which I also like.  If you take away the rest of the game then there is nothing for you to receive powers or abilities to affect.

What we end up with is a game that feels a lot like 7 Wonders but without the drafting, so for me, a worse 7 Wonders.  This is still a fine game, but for me it has already been done and a little bit better.  Each round players have a certain number of actions.  Those actions consist mostly of either drawing cards or playing technology.  If you have certain technologies in play already, others are free (just like in 7 Wonders).  Many of these technologies are worth points and they progress you on tracks that earn majority owners points at the end of the game.

Very straightforward and a bit uninteresting in the current landscape.  Their marketing is top notch though, there was a lot of buzz for this game and after playing it I can't imagine others won't feel the same way I did.

It is worth mentioning the game came with a few small in-the-box expansions that might make the game a little more intriguing.

I'm more than a little astonished that this got all the way through the design, playtesting, development, and publishing process without someone forcefully pointing out that adding players above two adds NOTHING to the game except downtime.

This should be a smaller, less expensive game: publish it with just enough components for 2 players.

Multi-player solitaire done perfectly.  This game is all about the tech-tree.  It's distilled down to it's basics and that's perfect for this game.

Fans of Dominion might like this zero interaction game. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them.

First, the actions you can take are dreary and sometimes counter intuitive. Development (future research) is the only interesting one. Discovery and Actions is probably something you can't get around of, drawing is something that should be somehow automatic.

Shuffling? Draw and discard? Yawn. Hand limit raising and multiple development feels like stretching some artificial non-thematic game mechanisms. How fun. Actions? 

Now, if the Technologies themselves gave special abilities (like in Innovation), they'd be more interesting. As it is, you just keep on piling prerequisites, picking up the odd point here and there. 

Oh, and the other stuff, the resources, are clearly underused and not to be sought out. Even with the Milestones improvement.

All in all, an underdeveloped, overproduced disappointment.

Have the Kickstarter edition (with extra status board, actions and victory points) for trade/sale.

My first game left me half and half. I like the idea but I feel like there is a bug in the progress of the game. I still can't understand how is possible to control and balance the difference between discovering a technology by paying its cost or by getting it for free if I satisfy the requirement. This gap should be reduced for example with a discount of 50% not 100% because at the end could be very frustrating. Moreover starting with 2 actions and gaining soon the third could be a winning factor. It would be better to start with the Quick Version option rule. There is also a downtime problem.

The design was interesting, but it over stayed its welcome.  I understand that we played with an expansion that added an age.  There were so many cards at the end that I had trouble keeping track of what I had.  Would play again, but with no more than 3 ages.

We were surprised how much we loved this game. It has an easy to master and elegantly designed hand management system which can be used to achieve victory through multiple paths. The theme glows through the game itself - when you invent a technology your skills are getting better and experience the "technological revolution" yourself. One of those games where the Kickstarter stretch goals are a must have - we can hardly imagine a game without going to Age IV and competing for the final cards or playing without the famous personalities (although, we never use the milestones anymore). Thanks to the plethora of cards in each Age two games will never be the same. The only negative is that with more people as the game goes by the high number of actions mean that the downtime will get longer. The sweet spot for this game is with 2 or 3. But with those numbers it shines perfectly. A must-have for the lovers of tablo-building and hand-management games.

It`s not a game it`s a multiplayer patience. There`s no interaction.

Interesing that you could play a card and pay for it, or play it for free if you have a building from the right evolution tree (both like in 7 wonders), but you also can play a card as an development. You need nothing to pay, only time (wait some rounds).

Unfortunately I have to say that I can agree with almost everything negative said about this game

- It is multiplayer solitaire. You have no ways to interact with your coplayers or interfere with their plans unless you are attentive enough to spot what your opponents are out for and then lucky enough to draw that card/these cards
- It is prone to AP even if you are paying attention to your plans only
- Thematically ... it is NOT. The prestige, population and military track could be called xyz-track and it'd still be the same. Apart from final score your position on any of the tracks doesn't influence the game mechanically at all
- Starting player is in the favourable position to possibly have one more turn than anyone else but definitely always has at least as many turns as the rest

+ The game works...mechanically
+ The whole Kickstarter Project was handled very professionally , from the Funding period til delivery and even beyond

Sorry - off it goes to the Trade-list without the slightest demur

Tech-tree, the game - and a really fun one, too! Setup moderately fast with a bit of organization, play time not too long and building up your civilization is just feeling great. The solo variant description of the german version has the time stack construction backwards, though, the results are far beyond the scale if I follow the printed rule. But other than that, the rule book looks good. Plays very well with two and is a really great experience. My wife totally loves to play it, it hits the table almost daily at the moment. The german version includes the three mini expansions, age IV, milestones and personalities.

This one really lacks any kind of flair that makes me want to play.  It's the kind of KS game that makes me wonder if anyone asked the designer "what makes this game unique and interesting enough to create?".

There's nothing wrong with it, the rules are good the game play is smooth but it just feels kind of lifeless.  I could also see downtime being a bit of an issue at higher counts.

I would never request to play this, which is a huge knock.

Hugely intricate in the strategy you have to play as you're planning forward to later stages in the game.  Ton of fun if you have 5 people to play with, but still certainly enjoyable with less.  Just make sure you set aside plenty of time to play this game as I have yet to have a game last less than 2 hours.

Either too much downtime when more players or the same smallish range of cards every time when fewer players. There's a problem with the mechanism to cross from one age to the next as well. The gameplay though is fairly fun.

Multi-player solitaire. What others do in their turn has almost no relevance to your own actions so after drawing your cards you decide most of your next turn in a few seconds and then sit waiting for the other players to complete their mechanical actions in turn. What they do is of no interest because there is no interaction. Serious runaway leader problem because progress is exponential with no feedback/braking mechanism. Hard to believe that this game has been playtested at all since few would willingly play it twice with the current rules.

Who would have thought that a game based solely on building a huge tech-tree could be so interesting? The choices regarding when to take cards from which deck, which cards to drop for your opponents to pick up and how fast you want to move to next era, are really interesting. Not entirely sure about replayability, but so far I am liking it!

What if somebody took a tech tree from a civilization game and made that the entirety of the game?  Turns out it  works quite well.  I was drawn to this title after falling in love with Andrei Novac's woefully underrated [gameid=107861], and this game was not a disappointment.  There's a procedural nature to both, not really in terms of gameplay, but rather in game flow, where you really want to have a good early game, use that to get your engine going in the midgame, and finally build on that structure to score big points in the endgame.  This isn't going to be for everybody, particularly since it has a way of punishing early screw-ups, but does give this game a very different feel from other titles in a very crowded genre.  It's a title that won't start to click until about halfway through your first play at the earliest, after which you will realize all the things you wish you had done differently.  As such, it's punitive for newbies, so plan on playing this game at least twice if you want to give it a fair shake.   If you're willing to put int that investement, this one's a really good title.

(April 2015 After 1 4p game) - Nice player aid describing all of the actions and items on your board.  First play was a little slow to "click" for me, but once I did away we went.

Be careful of AP players.  The 3 tracks = big points, tough to get lots of "harp points" elsewhere.  A game that will get better as you get familiar with the cards.

Making a tableau building card game based upon the tech tree of human civilization is a great idea. For the most part, I think Progress does a nice job with it. It plays simply and smoothly and unlocking better and better abilities to manipulate and search for more and more cards is a nice touch.

I found it a tad too simplistic though, or maybe just a tad too long. It was interesting figuring out the path of fastest growth in the first age, but entering age three I was just looking for keywords without any regard for what I was actually building. It also felt like I hadn't unlocked anything new, as I was still taking the exact same actions, just getting more cards to filter through when I did so. The game didn't really expand...just amplify, and I started getting bored as it was wrapping up.

Maybe I just like Innovation too much to look for a replacement.

Not an unpleasant game, but pretty typical of Kickstarter fare.  Seems like it could have been polished and turned into a good game, but as it is, it is a bit of a mess with too much going on and not enough meaningful decision making.

Also, the theme, which was so promising, is poorly integrated.

RATING: 6
I really like the idea behind this game, but it seems to lose something in the execution. It's more about puzzling out how to fit together whatever cards one happens to draw than about following any particular line of technology. As such, it is much more tactical than strategic. It gives me the feeling of a watered-down Race for the Galaxy without any 6-point developments to strive toward.

Of all the evolution of human invention card games, this one is most intuitive, has ease of play, and is actually fun. The basics are discovery by spending your cards or researching a technology with turn counters.  I appreciate designers that make a card useful even if it isn't useful.  I love the idea that by discarding a card you free up imagination. That makes so much sense--The less you are thinking about, the more you can think about. Discard pile management reminds me of gin rummy not playing a useful card which my wife loves. It will get samey.

played once with 4 players, got completely squashed as everyone else got additional actions built and never got to draw or pick any during first 2 ages -only solution when you know the risk is to draw cards during enough rounds so to get these extra actions, then make progress, else you get so fast behind.... maybe 4 players is just not the way it's meant to be played

While very similar to the original, I liked being able to pull up and reposition your machines, which isn't allowed in this version.  I could always just house rule it.

Factory Funner offers a nice puzzle to solve. The speed element is not for everyone, I am sure, but personally I found it exciting. It keeps the game fast paced and mitigates the problem of stalling since you cannot optimise the layout infinitely. Actually most of the time you are satisfied with finding a way to place the new machine into your factory in the first place. Finding the optimum is secondary.

On the visual side, the colour palette is slightly rich for my taste. Well saturated colours do look good in photos, but on the table things become quite busy making it hard to see what is going on. This might be intentional and definitely is not against the spirit of the game. Not a big thing though.

I reckon that in the long run Factory Funner faces the same fate with Galaxy Trucker. One day you reach a point when you become so good that the game ceases to give you the hardships you used to enjoy. Puzzle solved. That day Factory Funner becomes purely competitive but you need to find equally skilled mates to play with, which surely won't be easy, especially if you are the only one owning a copy. But that is a problem of distant future. Before actually getting there, I will just enjoy the journey.

I think I liked this better than the original.  The hexagons give you a bit more play in how to connect things and the scoring seemed more streamlined.  Still a very cool game.

Second play, I do like this one better than the original.

I previously had Factory Fun rated a 9, but with Factory Funner out, I had to give this one a 9 and bump the old one down, as I can't imagine playing the old one much with this around now.

Funner takes a lot of the frustration out (which is still fun!) and replaces it with pure fun, as you can now be much more creative and free with pipe laying. Also, you can't just pick everything up and move it any more (you can't move your machines in Funner), which eliminates those ridiculous turns you'd get in Factory Fun where someone rearranges their while factory. It wasn't really fun sitting and watching someone try to figure that out, and now you don't have to, as builds are generally simpler.

Overall, this is seriously fun stuff, and I can't imagine ever turning down a game.

Just about everyone else on BGG seems to think that this is an improvement on Factory Fun, but I haven't gotten nearly as much enjoyment out of this as I did from the original. It seems much harder to build an interesting chain of machines with the restriction against being able to move previously placed machines in place. I'm just not feeling it.

Fun competitive puzzler, some luck and many opportunities for clever planning and problem-solving. Low player interaction does not hurt my enjoyment of this game, as managing your own factory is difficult enough in most cases. End-game results are very satisfying to look at. Plays well solo, if more random due to lack of choices when receiving a machine.

Big fan of Factory Fun, will be interesting to see if this is an improvement or not.

I haven't played Factory Fun in several years, but this game feels nicer and I'm not sure that's a good thing here. More turn angst in Factory Fun as I remember it. Still fun to play and much easier to play as well since you can't move your machines around.

RATING: 8
Really nice new version with the primary difference being hexes instead of squares.   This is a little less intuitive but also a little more flexible.   Those are both a plus, since it makes the machine selection a little less obvious.   A few other minor tweaks - all for the better.

I don't know, it's like the unfunner version of "Galaxy Trucker". Given, the game works and I can see people who enjoy this, but my 2 plays are enough for me.

Sure, it's quite different to "Galaxy Trucker", but once everyone grabbed their tiles, it bogs down and the solitaire puzzling starts, which takes the most time, too.

It's very fiddly, too.

If you enjoy puzzle-type games, this one is terrific.  I was already a fan of the "original" version of the game - Factory Fun - but this one proves to be an improvement.

The game lends itself the a hex map extremely well,  The modified piping placement rules are a huge plus.  The prohibition on relocating placed machines is - oddly enough - a huge factor in keeping the game time manageable.  Some of the scoring tweaks also provided better balance.

Overall - extremely well done.

It's definitely "Factory Quicker".  Although I'm sad to see no "Renovation", I can totally appreciate that it slowed the game down a pile on its own.

Honestly, we enjoy this series enough I'm just going to keep ownership of both.

RATING: 8
Factory Funner turns squares into hexes and shrinks the size of the factory. The structure of the game is identical, except that it ends after 8 rounds rather than 10. In both games, players each turn over a machine at the beginning of a round, players claim the machine they want as quick as they can and then try to fit it into their factory so that all of the input colors and output colors align correctly. Having machines feed other machines gives you big bonuses at the end and doing this effectively is the key to winning. 

The differences in Factory Funner are subtle, but differentiate the game enough that I think it is worth keeping both. In Factory Fun, you can move a previously placed machine for a penalty, if you need to. In this new version, machines can never be moved once placed, so you need to space things to allow room for the unknown future placements you'll need to make. If you play it too tight to save money, you may find yourself stuck as the game progresses. Another subtle, but significant, change is that machines feeding each other only pay 3x points instead of 5x. This reduces the domination of this part of the scoring and so the efficiency of your builds count for a bit more, balancing - a little bit - the risk of building a tight, closed system. This is a nice variation if you are into the game, but just as in the original, you MUST like visualizing logistical puzzles in order to have any chance of enjoying this one.

"Man, Factory Funner is awesome. I love the quick puzzley gameplay, I love the whimsical nature of the pieces, and honestly I love the concept. I picked it up after playing it even though I got ruined the first time, and I'm always interested in playing another game once I've played it to try and get a better sense of how I could have done better. It's a super interesting concept, sure, but the delivery is more than I could have hoped for. I made a terrible mistake missing out on the Kickstarter (and thankfully managed to pick it up on eBay), but hopefully enough buzz will be generated for them to consider a second print run? If they do, I'd highly recommend it. It's really, just, great."

Enjoyed the game although I still prefer the original. This one plays even faster and the pieces are HUGE!!! Spatial puzzling skills are still required. Uncertain if I like the +1/-1 tokens for points when grabbing machines last (+1 point if you use the machine) and first (-1 point).

Played the prototype with Corné with the final rules. I was quite surprised that I enjoyed the game quite a bit actually. I normally dislike games with a speed element like the infamous Set. Here I could manage the speed element well of grabbing one of the tiles. Good tension between grabbing a tile too quickly or too slow. The game had good planning options too. Keep as many future options open. Game play is very quick. 30min. with 4 not too slow players. It is the kind of friendly puzzling game that my wife likes too.

Factory Funner is a re-implementation of van Moorsel's earlier game Factory Fun. Each turn, players take a machine to place on their board, scoring points for the machine, but negative points for the amount of pipes you need to use to connect the machine to its inputs and outputs. Bonus points are scored for connecting the outputs of one machine to the inputs of another. While there is a little bit of streamlining, the main way this varies from the original is that it uses hex tiles instead of squares. This provides a little bit more flexibility in terms of direction, but the game gives you a smaller board to work on to compensate. To me, the experience of playing either game is pretty similar--they both are games that I like to play from time to time, but generally wouldn't suggest.

One of the best from the month. I liked Factory Fun OK. I really love Factory Funner. It plays faster and hexes! The art is colorful and fun and there are a lot of options. You can't move the machine parts once they are down and that is perfect for me not to AP too much. I think this has potential to go up in rating I like it that much! Happy I have a copy! It is great!

Factory Fun has always been a favorite of mine.  I like Factory Funner even better!  There is much more flexibility in building your factory with this new version and the graphics on the tiles are visually easier to recognize.  Also, the machine names and artwork are very creative.  In my gaming circles, the original game was a 'love/hate' game.  Factory Funner should appeal to a wider audience, it's much more forgiving.

A favourite of the kids. I have a feeling we're still going to prefer to play with the speed auction variant over the snatch and work it out method of play every group I've played this with seems to employ. The hexes make for a small improvement over the squares & the new pipe design should improve rebuilding analysis paralysis with better clarity. Looking forward to getting my hands on the physical copy.

Changing to a hex grid should greatly increase strategic choices, and the few other rules tweaks should also help considerably.  It's a niche game for when you're in the mood for something like it, so it probably will not see frequent play at our house, but on the other hand, I suspect we'll still be playing it 30 years from now.  Just like the original. (Well, except that we'll be giving the original away.  But we don't regret having purchased it, even if it doesn't come out frequently.)

A sequel/update of Factory Fun that manages to both feel like more of a brain-burner and give the whole experience a breezier feel. Those hexes sure accomplish a lot. 

I was always a huge fan of the original, and I love this one just as much. If I was forced to keep only one...I don't know. That would be a tough choice. 

I'll keep both, all right?

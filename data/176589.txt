Simple little puzzle, nothing too taxing but better with more players rather than fewer. Lots of different cats in the boxes on the cards and you have a hidden stake in making one cat appear the most in the tableau of cards everyone is building in the centre of the table. Simple? Yeah, but cute cats and light quick fun make up for that.

Light game, my 4-year-old son can play with me.  Has a very similar feel to Chocoly.  Not a super compellingly addictive game, but a fun little filler.

Its deeper than it looks (which would not be hard).  Fun little light game to amuse (not sure of its staying power). (7.013, June 17)

The design is really cute and there's more strategy here than I expected. Whose card do I use and how obviously do I show, which color of cat I'm trying to collect? Really fun, especially with more players.

Cute kitties filler.  I like the double-sided cards and simple gameplay rules. With 5p it felt pretty random.  Happy to try again with fewer players.

感想：
1. 絕對是考運算的遊戲
2. 在蓋和被蓋之間，不斷去計算如何高分
3. 其實忍藏身份感覺意義不大？
4. 美術絕對是可愛

It's actually deeper than the cute design. You do have to try to figure out which other cats your opponents are and try to maximize your score while hiding their cats. Since there are always at least 3 cats on each card, it does take some analysis to pick up the right card to play.

Placing adorable cat tiles and trying to get them grouped together using clever placement and covering of parts of other tiles. 

There is an interesting method of choosing your own tile or an opponents tile to place.

Un juego sencillo de colocación de cartas unas sobre otras. Es divertido tratar de engañar a tus oponentes con el gato que te pertenece, pero en mi experiencia el engaño dura muy poco. El arte es característico de Aza Chen y se ve bonito.

Completely average game with cat art. Visually it is an eye strain.

Entertaining little filler. I always like this patching mechanism, and playing cards from your opponent's hand is a nice little twist.

Indifferent.

This is an amusing little game which is easy to teach and play. Although scoring on the Chihuahua is very tedious. Slight complaint about the color selection, some of the cats are harder to distinguish than others when taking a quick look at the game state

Played quite a few rounds of this with my students.  it was fun hearing the table-talk as we were sussing out what color cat each of us was playing.  Kind of a blind Carcassonne-like feeling in play.  Really high cute factor brought a couple players to the game that usually aren't interested in games.

Cat Box is a true delight. This game has taken me by surprise with it's immediacy and depth. Combining hidden scoring roles with a sort of area control mechanic.

Players are each given a card which is kept secret to them. It gives them a cat colour or a dog. The cats mean you have to that colour cat face up through card play, and get a bonus for a long chain of that colour. The dog is looking to make chains of three cats of the same colour and empty boxes showing.

Each card is made up of four quadrants, each will be filled with a cat, or one may be an empty box. Placing these cards you try to link up your colour while keeping it hidden that you are that colour. Cards must be placed in certain ways, and are double sided so you can play the card in your hand or any side of a card you can se in others hands.

There are also some tokens for a more advance game.

This game is a true treat. Plays well and quick and scales very well. Excellent.

Cute and reasonably quick. I don't know that I will be screaming to get it onto the table, but it does its job as filler. There's even a bit of hidden depth to the decision making, and the double-sided card mechanism is interesting.

RATING: 7.5
its artwork and easy yet deeper than expected gameplay have helped me get various non-players to the table, and hook them for more serious stuff... this is a filler, nice to look at, fast-playing, appealing to non-gamers, but at the same time good filler fun for geeks

Card play has a weird feeling to it.
It's not worth it to play on other people plan and your hidden role is too quickly discovered. Hard to determined if you have a real impact on your points or if it's up to the card draw.

RATING: 8
While very fun, this takes a little getting used to. After starting a game, we decided to stop and practice flipping ships for a few minutes before starting up again. Once we got our methods down, we manned our ships and vainly attempted to defend mother earth from those dastardly extra-terrestrials. But there were just too many and the mother ship…ohh the horror! But it was a lot of fun and will hit our table often.

The components, art direction are great and this dexterity game retails at a very reasonable price. The rules are a few pages, easy to learn and the game can be enjoyed by casual players, families and children. Be warned, stopping the invasion is not as easy as it looks.

A very good cooperative, dexterity game that plays like Galaga or Space Invaders. It has options to make the game a bit tougher and I really enjoyed my two plays. Not sure if it would last as a great game, but the few plays I tried were definitely a good time.

The game looks really nice (Always a big fan of Kwanchai Moriya art).  I found the game to be fun, but the ramp up to get more ships feels a bit wonky.  One of those games that I think will get kind of "samey" fast, but it will  be fun to play from time to time.

I love the artistry and have enjoyed playing the game with different player counts. Cooperative dexterity is a really neat genre because it doesn't punish players for singular mistakes. 

My only critique is the downtime in between turns especially late in the game, but the upside is that groups will literally cheer when the mothership is attacked and destroyed. I'm okay with that.

RATING: 7
Unique dex game - love the Space Invaders feel. Easy to recommend as an intro to the "genre", though I worry about its long-term prospects on my shelf. Most dex games rely on either highly variable scenarios/rules/etc or depth of skill to keep them going. Flipships doesn't appear to have much in the way of either.

That said, it is nice to have a purely cooperative dex game. Certainly adds to its appeal as an introductory game.

Also fair warning - the rulebook is extremely vague on a lot of key points (it doesn't even list the # of columns of ships you lay out, you just have to rely on the picture example). It's got a really simple ruleset so it's not too bad, but it is an annoyance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Co-op Space Invaders, what a great choice for a theme/mechanic. I stink at dexterity games and I think I would get sick of this pretty quickly if I tried to practice it by playing it solo. It's too simple to stay interesting for too long, but I've had fun cheering other people on when I've played in a group, so this can stick around in my collection for a while.

The first time I played this I goofed the rules for the final round, which sucked the life out of it. Next two games, got it right.. and got crushed. Game is very hard. It has a good amount of those fun moments where everyone is like YES you made that great shot or NOOO it deflected off the mother ship. 

Overall, I like it it, but I don't love it. It's pretty fun and light, but not a super star.  It's possible I just don't love dexterity flicking games as I don't love Catacombs either. If you want a dexterity game, get Junk Art. If you have that, and want more dexterity games, this is a fine contender for the flicking game in your collection.

This game is great fun if you like dexterity games.  The theme is amazing and really comes through in the game play.  Set up is a little fiddly for my tastes (YMMV), leading it getting played less than I would prefer. Without this issue I would rate it as a 9.  It's neat that you can play solo too, without any rule changes.

I really like the concept of this game because of its thematic vintage roots and also for the way it does something different for a dex game. I found this game hard to win and that is a good thing in my opinion. The artwork is functional (good but not stellar) and the components are as good as they need to be. I would have liked to see more variations in ship abilities for the players but that is a minor thing. I would be open to playing this one again for sure.

Who would have thought I’d like another dexterity game? This was Space Invaders the board game. In the beginning, I couldn’t hit the side of a barn standing 3 feet away, but by the end of the game, I was holding my own. This would be a great party/social game for non-gamers and there is enough here for hard core gamers to like it as well.

The demo guy was ready to fall asleep standing there, he had had a long weekend, I think. The game is cute, but there's not enough of a hook for me to get into it, and the flipping seemed just a little too random. I didn't even get to complete a game, so I won't rate it, but I don't expect to play it again. I'd go with Tumblin Dice or Crokinole for something like this.

Purchased and immediately played 5 games with my newphews, son, and brother in law who all had new and favorite games with them.  This thing was a HUGE hit, I’ve rarely seen grown men standing around a table and cheering like this is a football game with a clutch kick that just landed.  Two games we lost with one mothership health and felt like Super Bowl losers walking back to the lockers.  3 games we won and felt like super bowl winners going to Disney world.  

I am a little worried about the durability of the ships, hoping that one day they’ll offer an upgrade to plastic ships or something more durable.

RATING: 8
Good game, bit quality is a bit middling. Dexterity required seems next to impossible for an average group, as for the entire game only 2 hits were scored on the mothership, including at the end with 18+ flips happening at it.

Would play again though. It's nice and light, even if the iconography for the shield could be a bit clearer (we misinterpreted it as two hits for one player, not that it guards adjacent).

What a funny dexterity game, with a theme that reminds the Space Invaders feeling, the gameplay is very good, the components and design are great and it's a cooperative that when there's a hit everyone celebrates and if someone fails than everyone just laughs because fliping a space ship can be hard, but even if someone is terrible at the game it still has a great time.

Such a great dexterity game.   Takes several practice shots prior to your first game to dial in your aim.  Even then my shots aren't super precise, but I'll generally get in the vicinity that I'm aiming for.   The different types of enemy ships result in tactical choices.  Missing your shots completely also results in more tactical choices.   Easy to learn, quick to play.   Lots of fun.  So glad I picked up a copy.

Dexterity game! Didn't know that- but you are flicking your ships to try and land on the enemy ships that are trying to invade. You have to fend them off as a team. Then you have to go all in for the mother ship. The theme is there and reminded me of Enders Game or Space Invaders. Playing is fun, I can see my finger hurting after a while. I would like to play it again.

RATING: 7
If 'co-operative Space Invaders dexterity game' sounds fun to you, you'll like this - simple as that! Waves of alien cards approach Earth, some with special powers, and the players must flick (into the air rather than along the table) their tokens to land on and eliminate them. In order to win, all aliens must be eliminated before the Earth takes too much damage, but you must also land a sufficient number of tricky shots into the 'mothership' (a chunky box located behind the alien cards).

To spice things up, the players' ships have different powers - so one player might specialise in targeting the mothership while another can take out the trickier 'double hit' aliens. And as the Earth's health declines, the players get to flip more ships each round, which tends to produce a dramatic finish. There are also plentiful options for tailoring the difficulty level to the players' dexterity talents. 

It's not a game I'll want to play every week, but it delivers on its premise perfectly and has provided some great laughs.

Wow...I really enjoy this one.  Yes, the Mothership is hard.  It should be hard.  And you can set it to JUST ONE FLIP if you want to.  It's not a game that one needs to take completely seriously, but it's great to see who on your team can do different things and try to play to their strengths

This is my favorite dexterity game. The game being cooperative up to four players makes for a good time whether your flip leaves something to be desired, goes long or hits multiple enemy ships. The powers each players 3 different ships make for some very interesting gameplay. Quick to set up, learn and play. Love it!

Dexterity games are becoming more and more common these days, and they are, at times, a nice distraction from the strategic fare. Admittedly, Flip Ships was the second one of such kind that entered my collection, since I found my sampling at the demo booth to be quite enjoyable. The premise of this design takes the concept of space invaders, defending against waves of ships, but abstracts in into cards that you must then flip your ship tokens onto. It succeeds in this respect, adding some novel variety through intangible spaceship abilities (some ships can re-flip, some can hit multiple adjacent cards, etc.). However, neither the theme nor the dexterity mechanisms are as accessible or immediately appealing as Junk Art. 

(+) Bright, vivid art on the components. 
(+) Successful implementation of the space invaders theme, but does not convolute it with rules but instead creates the barrier through the dexterity challenge. 
(+) Despite being cooperative, the dexterity element still allows the game play experience to retain some semblance of achievement.  

(-) Flipping and aiming successfully can be tough. 
(-) Scenario can be repetitive. 
(-) The game does not offer much depth or replay-ability, only to bolster your high score. Such is the curse of the cooperative game. Novel with new groups, and that’s about as much legs it can have.

This is the only dexterity game I own but its the only one I want to own. You can literally set it up at a party and do a practice flick and suddenly a whole group of people will be like "what is this I want in?" As long as at least one of you knows the rules, the other players are usually just happy to be there and flick haha. We had a game where 3 of us knew the rules and one person swapped in for someone who had to step out and she still had a blast. Also, this pairs super well with the Top Gun soundtrack! Super fun game!

"Flip Ships" is a bizarre game that doesn't work on any level. A dexterity that tries to be more than what it is with player powers and extraneous rules.

Easy to explain, difficult to get good at.  Part of the trouble with a dexterity game is that it feels a lot like luck, because we aren't mechanical and can't fine-tune our movements to make small corrections.  Still, it is fun, and doesn't feel bad when the mothership wins because not a lot is invested in strategizing.

Against all odds, Flip Ships manages to feel almost tactical. It's obviously very silly, and gets everyone hollering about how bad a shot you are. But the combination of your ship abilities vs. the enemies arrayed against you does give you something minor to think about while you're failing. Not the sort of thing I'd build an evening around, but a decent way to blow off some steam or fill the time between entrees.

I had high hopes for this one, but for me the game was much less fun than I expected. I'm not saying it's a bad game, per se, but it's a cooperative dexterity game. If you have one or two people playing who really suck at dexterity games, you're not going to win even on the easiest of settings. Flicking into the mothership from a yard away is extremely hard to do, even for decent dexterity players.

Basically it's a tiddly-winks variant with a Space Invaders theme thrown on.

However it's fun to play, and you really feel a sense of skill and achievement if you manage to to flip a Token into the mother-ship (cup). My record is 4/10 shots in practice.

Some of the iconography could've been made more prominent. For example the Shield card has a ))) icon shoved in one corner.  This could've adorned the card via artwork alone!!!

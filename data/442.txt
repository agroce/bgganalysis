140202 Only played against the AI but its an interesting game.  I suspect it would be a lot more fun in person actually rolling dice, but I'm not 100% sure about it.  Its not compelling enough for me to pay $50+ for a copy in the USA at the moment, at least not until I've played the other SDJ winners.

I have to admit that being a cycling fan myself my view on the game might be a bit biased. On the other hand, it also gives me a certain insight and makes me more critical regarding the implementation of the theme.

The first thing you will notice is that the game ('92 edition) does not look as sexy when compared with some newer games. However, I liked the humour in the art and the graphical design works. The game is a real pleasure to play with all essential information clearly visible.

You could describe the game as a roll-and-move, but this is way too simplified take on the matter. Players have quite a bit of control over the fluctuation of probability. You can push your luck or take matters into your own hands and make safe moves. The key here is to time your moves right, and tactics play a big role. This simulates a real race nicely where team tactics is crucial. Drafting is transformed well into a table top format as well, i.e., you save energy and get kind of free ride.

Of course, you do not have a total control and you should be prepared for unforeseen events. But this just adds to the fun and makes the game less deterministic, which in my opinion is a plus.

Sturz!!!! Hogy gebedne meg, annyiszor húztam, hogy nem is számoltam már a végén:) Persze totálisan elvesztettem, a csapatom 4 tagja lett az utolsó 4. Ennél nagyobb arányban ebben a játékban nem is lehet veszíteni. És ennek ellenére is tetszik, pedig ilyen könnyed játékok ritkán fognak meg. Tetszik benne, hogy a néhány perces szabályismertetés ellenére egész sok taktikai lehetőséget rejt. Szélárnyék, szökés, és egyebek, csupa jó ötlet, és mindez egy több, mint 30 éves játéknál. Pl. A Snow tailst kenterbe veri. A Formula D-vel kb. egyszintűnek érzem, talán még jobb is kicsit. Egyedül a kártyákkal van gondom, a túl nagy szerencsefaktor miatt tilos nekiülni úgy, hogy komolyan vesszük. Sturz.

10/13/08 - A neat racing game that offers a great deal in a simple package.   For us the game was a combitation of Ave Caesar and Formula De.   We played the Advanced Game with Sprint Points.  The road conditions, two types of movement and chance cards melded well.   Not a bike racing fan, but a racing game fan and this was accessible, innovative with movement and easy to learn.   A fun game.

Pretty decent racing game which surprisingly captures the spirit of a cycling race very well. There is an enormous amount of luck involved with the dice and the events. However it's not a total luckfest because the energy cards together with clever movement add enough tactics to keep the game interesting. Scoring is a bit too elaborate for a game of this weight.

This is a Spiel des Jahres winner that I expected to enjoy. I actually like roll-and-move games when there is a twist that adds some strategy. Plus I had a lot of friends who talked about how enjoyable the game is. While I do like this game's simplicity and how it throws some interesting wrinkles into a basic mechanism, I don't love it. The drafting decisions seem quite obvious, and that takes away most of the strategy. Perhaps it's just the simple beginners difficulty we played, or the confusing German-to-English translation of the rules, but I'm still missing the wow. At least the theme is relatively unique and there's a lot of variability offered simply with the one board. Never fear, I'm not giving up on the game yet. Hopefully with more play (and trying the advanced rules) I will find the exciting stuff that others enjoy in this game.

Fairly fun race game.  Some tense decisions when playing movement cards.  Drafting other bikes is one of the main elements of the game.

NOTE: Using all of the movement cards seems to be too much for a short race such as the race that runs from Start #2, cobblestone, mountain, downhill, and finishing at Letter C.  I'm not sure which ones or how many cards to take out to balance out the short track race.

Rating based on one play (2-player) of the basic game.  Expect this to go up with advanced/professional rules and more players.  Die rolling of course involved luck, but deciding when to draft, when to use your movement cards, and when to roll the dice is the meat of the game, so the luck is forgiven.

A luck-driven dice-based racing game.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in this particular game I found it unsatisfying.  I especially do not like the chance cards since you can be completely screwed for several turns for doing nothing more than rolling sevens.  Not nearly as clever or engaging as Ave Caesar or Daytona 500 -- or even Turfmaster or Formula De.  Glad I was able to try this before wasting my money on it.

A really fine cycling game which always entertains.  

Don't be put off by the dice, this is very far from 'roll & move' and timing the use your power/energy cards well is crucial.  

We don't use the 'event' cards or the doping rules and recommend you don't either - the game is much better without them.

RATING: 6
I love racing games, and this was long one of my favorites, but over the years it's now more a game I pull out for nostalgia, as other games have definitely surpassed it in the racing genre.

It does manage to do some neat things via the drafting rules, but the game really shows its age with the basic roll and move mechanism, random events, etc. The game really ends up boiling down to luck, getting a good roll at an opportune time. The rolls can be extremely swingy as well, as movement is based on a 2d6 roll (that can be mitigated, to be fair, by some card play).

Overall, still a fun enough racing game if you're a fan of the genre, but I feel it just runs too long for such a luck-based game. I'd still play it for nostalgia sake though.

RATING: 4
UR does manage to capture the essence of the Tour de France & Co. That said, it's too much of a dice-fest for me. I would have prefered something exclusively card-driven. And shorter! Even going from C to A across the mountain takes a good amount of time.

Anyway, for a light game, I find it does not really have the liveliness and fun I  look for. Really, I think this game hasn't aged well and wouldn't have much chance in today's market. Shows you how much games have become over the last decade. Nowadays, it would never have the slightest chance of becoming the Spiel des Jahres.

Grand Prix F1 is better IMO. Though I profess that I'm not much of a race game fan...

RATING: 6
I initially rated this a 5, but having thought a little more about it I changed it to a 6. However, it is likely to go down again. The reason is that, while the game actually was okay, we played the Tour de France route. Even if that setup is probably the most interesting (as you need to take into account lots of mountains, cobblestone and other terrain), it was slightly longer than what I found fitting for what the game offers in terms of mechanics, gameplay and overall enjoyment. It didn’t seem there was a lot of progress, so I think it would be better not to play the longest scenario (TdF); therefore, I’d love to play the game again just to be sure about my rating.

Speaking of the rating, I’m expecting it to only decrease and not increase. The reason is the randomness. True, Um Reifenbreite features a lot of neat mechanics: it offers a lot of tactical decisions as to then to play your cards, when to form a breakaway, when to follow, how to place yourself in clever positions so the other players don’t stick to your wheel. The pointsystem is a good idea; you don’t win the game simply by crossing the line first – you get points for the final positions of each of your riders. This means that you cannot neglect any riders and need to take care of them all, which is a very clever twist on the racing games. I actually finished first and second in my game, but I also came in last (because of a horrible last round in which the dice gods hated me) – so I ended up losing by 2 points! And this is exactly why I don’t think it’s a great game, and probably won’t think either if I’m playing some of the shorter scenarios; the dice simply determine too much. It’s downright impossible to win if you roll poorly, even if you play great. I’m especially hating the part on the top of the mountain where you’re about to ride downhill; here, one lousy pip on the die means whether you start your next turn on the mountain space and get a -6 movement penalty for your next move or whether you’re starting on the first downhill section space and get +5 to your next move… Come on, that’s ridiculous!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A SdJ winning race game from 1992 with an interesting drafting (or slipstreaming) mechanic. Following riders can draft providing that they end up directly behind the rider that began the turn in front of them and only move the same number of spaces. Alternatively, roll 2d6 to move or breakaway using at least one card instead of a die. There is also an option to 'cheat' by declaring a 6 instead of rolling the die but there is a chance that someone may have taken a photo of you doing it which you'll only find out at the end of the race. This is much more than a simple roll-&-move and really feels like a bike race with the peleton breaking up and reforming. The board allows a good variety of races to be played. There is a fair amount of luck in the shorter races (half or three-quarters of a lap, 45-60 minutes) but this should even out over longer distances (one and a half laps, 90 minutes +).

There's something cheerful about this light game with great theme, some strategy and luck!  I think it's a fun racing game experience. The theme is pretty strong. However, I think the event cards aren't fun, and I don't ever use them. So maybe elements of the game are a bit dated. And it's a bit lighter then I usually am looking for these days. I don't play it often any more. Still, I think the game sets up a race with strategic and tactical play, so I think it's a keeper.

Enjoyable dice/card-driven [u]racing[/u] game with an amazing cartoon board. A fast tactical game who feels like a real bicycle race. Very nice mechanic which allow riders to draft and the multiple kinds of road surfaces. Its recommended using the Advanced rules and the Professional rules brings lots of variation as well (I use only the "Switching the Lead" rule; no sprints rewards). I play without the Chance and Photo cards. High amount of luck but big fun as well in this game.
Works [color=red]solitaire[/color] too. For two player sessions each player can play with only one team, to control two teams each or to play with neutral teams.
[i]Optional house rules (to reduce the luck): 1. Three Re-roll tokens for each player; 2. After each complete turn any rider can move backwards one square (to catch a drafting square or a better place).[/i]

This is one of the few games I've recently tried that incorporates its theme fully and in a way that works.  I really felt like I was riding a cycling race in the Olympics - the early leaders that fade, the peloton driving the pace, the breakaway cyclists that race to win.  Not to mention pileup crashes!

The rules are simple, and I see why this won the SdJ years ago, because it seems like an ideal family game.  It also teaches you that who finishes first isn't always the winner - the team win is what you want.  Great game that deserves an American reprint.

Cycling game designed for the Tour de France, with 4 teams of 4 riders. The four riders have different power cards, which implies that they have different abilities. The power cards are used to replace a role of a die with a 5 or 6. Each turn 2 dice are rolled to determine the number of squares a rider can advance. The rules say that you have to play such a card before throwing the dice, but this implies that these power cards may be wasted because you would have thrown a 5 or 6 anyway. In my opinion it's better to role the 2 dice first, and then decide whether or not to use a power card. The power cards allow moulding the riders to reality in a modest degree.
Riders can slipstream by just following the rider in front of them, except if this rider announces that he is going on a break-away. It is also impossible to follow a rider when he is on a different type of road (flat, uphill, downhill, cobble stones). The uphill and cobbled parts of the road contain numbers which need to be deducted from the dice throw, while the numbers on the downhill parts are added. This leads to the strange phenomenon that a rider who just goes over the top of a mountain with other riders in his wheel will almost allways escape, since he can add 5 to his dice role, while the one in his wheel has to deduct 6. Escaping uphill is a lot more difficult, since slipstreaming is allowed, and there is deduction from the values thrown. The game probably functions better if no slipstreaming is allowed uphill.
The game is played on a board. It does contain different starting and finish positions, so as to enable you to design different tracks. But this is clearly less flexible than when one can build a track starting from different parts which can be arranged in any order one likes.

At first, I didn't give this game enough credit for rewarding tactical play. The tactics are few, however, and you use them repeatedly and tediously. Also, don't use the event cards; these just augment the luck, of which there's already plenty.

A die rolling race game that works.  Players are team managers of four cyclists in a bicycle race.  Riders roll two six sided dice to move, and cyclists of any team directly behind can choose to draft or not (ie. follow!).  A hand full of team energy cards can be used to substitute a die roll and possibly force a breakaway (no drafting!).  Tons of team tactics, terrain, events, cheating(!) etc in a wonderfully elegant game. The game can be tuned for a quick sprint, or a long race, or even a series of races.  Play with all the rules to get the full flavour (especially the "swap positions" rule).  Deserving of the 1992 Spiel des Jahres.

Looks like a cute simple game if you see the graphics - but don't let that fool you. It's a calculating race game that has plenty of tricky maneuvers to keep you busy for a serious game. Clever mechanisms for falling, drafting, and breaking away make it really feel like a bike race. Recommended.

The game has a great cartoonish look, and the little stand-up cyclists look fantastic.   It really looks like a pack of bicyclists in a race.   Gameplay is less exciting, however - it's just a roll and move game, where each player has the same hand of cards that can be used to substitute for some rolls.   The drafting idea is well-implemented, but the game just becomes tedious after a while.  It takes a long time to move 16 bikers around the track, and there are many spaces which penalize movement even further (hills, cobblestone).   In the end, I get the same feel from Ave Ceaser or Q-Jet in about a quarter of the time.

an entertaining cycle racing game from so long ago that even I was a child when it first hit the world as Homas Tour.  Despite the apparent randomness of the dice the game is more about hand management and getting your team of bikes in the right place at the right time.  Some people take this game very seriously with all sorts of bike race simulation rules tacked on.  But played in the standard advanced version but without the random event cards and you have a clean and enjoyable race game.  Ave Cesar with a bit more going for it.

7/26/11  I try to play Um Reifenbreite every July when the Tour de France is going on. We played last night. Heading up the first mountain, I was in third place and had all 4 members of my team together. Josh got one rider over the summit, then Dean crashed, taking my whole team with him. The rest of the race was just trying to play catch-up. Josh held on for the individual win, but I got 2nd, 3rd and 4th. My final rider came in 9th so I won the overall game. I still love this game, but I think I may be ready to use one of the variants on BGG eliminating the chance cards. They can be funny, but it feels very old-school. (BGG rating=8)

Childhood memories. I even created a cycling game of my own on big boards and with a full peloton, based on the rules of Demarrage. Later, together with my best friend, it became a smaller version with LEGO parts to keep it playable on a table.

For several years I didn't play the game anymore, until I got in touch with Ludo Nauws, collector of cycling board games. With him and others, we played Homas Tour with pro rules, developed by Ruben in 't Groen. I would give that version a score of 10, as it really feels like a cycling race without getting too complex or costing a whole day to play one race.

Fun little racing game. Each player controls a team of four bike racers, attempting to bring them in to finish as high in the standings as possible. Drafting is the key tactic, with your whole team if possible. Save the energy cards for tough spots (climbing mountains, especially near the top) and for sprinting to break away from opponents who draft your boys. I recommend avoiding the chance cards - they add a significant amount of luck to the game and can ruin a well-planned strategy.

Roll and move plus random event cards seems much like a slew of other forgettable games of the era. Um Reifenbreite isn't quite as bad as that sounds, however. There are some (admittedly simple) tactics like slipstreaming that can be used to mitigate the luck of the dice in a number of select cases.

When played on a short track the game can be a nice diversion but it cannot really compete with more modern games of its class.

Very fun bike racing game, but don't take it seriously.  Great use of the roll and move mechanism, although a tighter bell curve (or a couple of reroll cards added) might cut down the luck factor.  Good simulation of different bicycling tactics, drafting, the peleton, turns, etc. are all modeled effectively in this game.  Its not too complex, definitely an easier game than Leader 1.  Only complaint is that luck can sometimes overpower strategy a little bit.  If you don't take the game too seriously, its great.  Some tough decisions and clever moves, along with a lot of dice rolling and card drawing.

A good game and deserving SDJ winner

Actually captures the feel of racing nicely and adds some nice realism in the game with terrain effects like climbing hills, cobblestone etc. and also falls, which can affect the others around you. 

Drafting is the key here and there is lots of opportunity to get in on it. Decisions are mostly obvious however the game is FUN and one of the better race games I have played along with Carabande and Formula De. 

About the right amount of luck here versus gametime and the system is very 'tweakable' and some variants are provided with the rules that allow things like "cheating" and other tweaks. The board has a good layout allowing adjustable gametime based on different length races which is a nice feature. Scales excellent from 2-4 and probably 3 best as 4 can bog down just a tad so picking a shorter race for 4 helps it to not wear out its welcome.

Great game for a gateway tool and/or family game and still interesting and fun for gamers to play with them. Movement is usually pretty obvious but timing the cards and some other little decisions seems to keep you interested. This is also easy to learn/teach and only 40 to 90 minutes depending on race chosen and number of players.

Tidbit - My personal houserule is to have each team start with only 5 cards and pick up one every round, works well and allows a little more drafting than starting with all cards which will minimize the drafting effect as opponents will have a card to stop it most of the time.

Bicycle racing game, SdJ winner in 1992. I am a bit torn on Um Reifenbreite. On one hand, it's reasonably fun and it does seem to capture the unique flavor of bicycle racing (as opposed to other kinds of racing). On the other hand, the game plays slowly and it's random and not really very deep. It is a game I am willing to play once in a while, but it's not really my kind of game and therefore won't ever be a favorite.

The fun factor doesn't wear off that way and I strongly doubt that luck would even out on a longer track.

Fun game! While 3 players is OK - we added a fifth team member, I think this is best for 4 players.  I strongly visiting Mark Jackson's site for the condensed rules.  Also note the FAQ - the Mass Fall card is incorrectly translated on the Game Cabinet.  Too bad people don't go back and fix these sorts of mistakes...

All in all I find this game to be clever and fun.  Sort of reminds me of Formula De.

Fast game of moderate strategy.

Read my review
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/165913

I was ecstatic about it.

Update 2009-12-09 :
Rating stays at 7 but I actually don't propose it anymore. It remains a very good cycling game and it catches the spirit with the "gamers" rules


At the time I wrote the review I was truly amazed by this game. Now having played some 150 more gamesI am not anymore. It is too light for my taste. I know I raved about the difficulty settings to ma make it more a gamers game but the truth is that if you want to play a gamers game you don't pick Um reifenbreite. You'll play 18xx, a splotter, a wallace.  If you want to play a gamers game in less than an hour you pick Chicago Express.

One of the best cycling games there is. And a way better example of racing games than for example Formula Dé. This game has nicely written rules: things are easy to understand and you don't have to remember anything. And if you compare this to 'Flamme Rouge' only thing this new cycling game does better is the chance to do your own tracks: Um Reifenbreite has only one gameboard which isn't as flexible. But all the rest is made better in Um Reifenbreite. And that's amazing!

RATING: 6.9
Roll and move game with lots of funny rule details and added strategy - still the result is largely dependent on the die rolls. The game is a bit dated but still fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
[2010.Dec.03] A bicycle racing game that is dominated by the roll-and-move mechanism. It's not unfun to play, but unlucky rolling can affect a player's experience for the worse, in my opinion.

RATING: 9
This one has a really novel slipstream/drafting idea that matches realistically with cycling and the tour racing genre.  Like with any dice-driven racing games, playing your card(s) in a timely fashion and skillfully can "improve" your odds or probabilities of your fate.  The fun factor really peaks when someone causes a big, massive crash or pileup somewhere... heh, heh, heh  :)  I'm not a huge fan of racing games in general, but I really enjoy this one a great deal better than the likes of Formula De.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Really enjoyable bike racing game which is dice dependent but generally seems to equal out over time (unless you're Dave VanderArk).  Use of energy cards can help boost your riders up the mountains or break away from your opponents if you wish to prevent them from drafting your movement.  This game is starting to lose some rating points as there seems to be a prevalence of runaway winners.  I've really been in only one game where the outcome was in doubt out of five.  That's not really promising.

I'm surprised this isn't one of the few racing games that is constantly in print. Maybe its the theme, or maybe it's the awesome artwork that is used, but it just seems like this game is too good of a game to languish on the shelves. It always seem to me that race games are either too simple, or too complex. The dichotomy there is always a difficult hurdle when designing a racing game. Do you go with something that is quick to pick up and play through (like a race actually is), or do you make it more complex and intricate so that you show every bit of how that race would happen and risk making the game slwo down to a crawl in the process. Um Reifenbreite is actually one of those rare games that has some teeth, but also plays really fast and is a lot of fun to boot. In my book having this and Ave Ceasar basically means I don't need to look for another racing game. The drafting rules, always important in bicycle racing game, are easy to understand and move the game a quick pace. The rules for the pelaton and outriders are also a great simulation of what a race would be like in real life. Controlling four different pieces and playing a game to score the most points really just makes this game shine. If you are looking for a good race game that is a great simulation of what it represents, but not too much that it kills the theme, look no further.

I've played a couple of short practice games, and read the commentary on BGG about the chance cards. I can see not using them and simply using a roll of 2 to be a crash. Game looks great when the cyclists are in a bunch. I shouldn't be surprised by that, really...

I know about bicycle races next to nothing, not counting the occasional glimpses while clicking through sports channels. Also the game doesn't look too promising, rather bland grid and dice rolling, how good can it be? Very, as it turned out. The whole team aspect, with the drafting and breaking away rules, the power cards, cheating and event cards give the game unexpected level of strategic complexity, while it still remains light and fun. Thanks to the cleverly constructed map, there are many different race routes to choose from, so it's highly replayable.

I'm not a huge fan of the original rules, although my main gripes are with the chance cards. I've tried several alternatives, but haven't found the right one yet that limits luck to a more human-like factor. Still a fun game that does a good representation of a cycling race. I would recommend the real cycling fans to try the so-called Homas Tour Pro rules set, it makes it a better game in my opinion.

Excellent, strongly-themed Tour de France-style bike racing game.  The game has a few more rules than most Euro games, but there's nothing superfluous -- they all make perfect sense in the context of the game (easy to remember), and contribute to the overall atmosphere.  Also, many of these rules are optional, so you can easily leave them out for a simpler game (the yellow jersey rule, for example).  Use the cheating rules though -- they're fun! Scoring is a bit fiddly; try my new format Score Sheet to make things easier (English, French, and German versions are available for download from the files area).

Solid racing game that mitigates the very prevalent dice luck by allowing you to drift off of those in front of you and by giving you cards to spend to guarantee results when you really need them. Because you're controlling an entire team of cyclists, a few bad rolls won't sink your chances. The game is much more about placement and opportunism than rolling high numbers. Perhaps a bit long when doing a full circuit, but the board can easily be broken down into shorter segments.

I should really rate this an 8.9
With such a huge collection, it is hard to find a game that I always want to play, but Um Reifenbreite sure comes close. Unlike most race game wherein you just go all-out to get your marker across the finish line, UR requires you to manage the positions of four separate riders in order to achieve victory in the game.  The player who expends all of his resources to get one cyclist across the finish line first may well find himself losing to a player who brought all cyclists in together in a later position.
This combined with its variable board, rider-specific energy cards and varied terrain makes Um Reifenbreite a winner in my book!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Dice fest, with cards added, that introduce some control, but not nearly enough to make the game strategic. The decisions that the potential use of  cards bring introduce downtime, and if people start thinking too much, than the game becomes painfully slow and unbearably boring. There is some screwage available for people who like nastier games. Luck decides in the end.

Seems to be a very good racing game. Yes, there is a lot of dice rolling and luck because of the chance cards but it fits game well and most importantly: playing is fun! 

You definitely want to have 4 players and play a bit longer route with 3 sprints and naturally play with advanced rules. There is quite a bit of tiny rule details that are easily forgotten. At least most of the rules are intuitive and capture well the bicycle racing theme.

Already an excellent race game with a clever way of controlling luck, for cycling fans it will mean heaven -the tactics and little disgraces of the sport are very sharply put into the game mechanics.

RATING: 7
It's a fun cycling game where luck rules the roost but you have two means to manage it - one-use-only cards which get played instead of rolling, and the ability to slipstream when the bike in front of you rolls well. Getting your team bunched together and organised at the start of the race can make a huge difference, where your cyclists can take turns spending their individualised cards to keep the speed high and minimise your luck. Regardless, you still need to roll well. Good thematcc fun though, which we pull out mainly around Tour De France time.

I'm not a huge fan of race games, but I found this to be one of the more appealing titles in the genre.  Here you control your team of four cyclists, and will score points for the exact place among all sixteen that each of your racers finishes.  The most interesting aspect of the game is the drafting rules--you can move with a cyclist who is directly in front of you, but only if you can end up directly behind the same cyclist with the same number of moves when the move is over.  A lot of the game revolves around trying to make sure you can draft effectively without allowing other people to do so as well.  The movement itself is a simple roll-and-move, but you have a hand full of one-use high-numbered cards that you can use to replace one or both of your dice at some point during the race.  If you are a fan of race games, this classic is definitely worth a try.

The best roll-and-move game of all time, and so much more than that. This is a gamer's roll and move game.

Very nice combination of (1) dice rolling, (2) resource/card management, (3) positioning benefits for slipstreaming the leader and/or who moves first and (4) terrain effects adding strategy to positioning and movement.

I have gone back and forth over the past two years on whether Homas Tour Pro or Leader 1 Hell of the North is the better game.

Using the Homas Tour Pro (HTP) rules I can play a long track, solitaire games using 15 riders, three per team, and finish in 60 minutes. Homas Tour Pro is less of a brain burner than the Leader 1 family, has a lower setup time and has fewer track clogging situations.
 
I prefer the organic expanding and contracting of the peloton in Homas Tour Pro and the wild swings of position order due to the chain of slipstreaming. I think it looks more like a cycling race. I also feel like Homas Tour Pro provides a better chance for any type of rider to win any type of stage, mountain or flat. You may feel that is less realistic, but it makes for a better gaming experience. 

The Leader 1 family is also great, but the peloton isn't quite right yet. Once you combine Leader 1 Hell of the North with the Peloton Expansion v4 rules in the community files section, you have the best cycling game I have come across to date.

Ok, I understand that this is old and revered and bleh bleh but I didn't enjoy this even a bit until the very end of the game. 
Too many luck-dependent factors and fiddly gameplay with certain type of players kill the joy very quickly.

The artwork looks depressing and pseudo-funny to my eyes. I tried to avoid looking it. Those men pictured there made me feel kind of sick...

I'd try this with 3 players some day to get the final verdict. Let's just leave this for a while, shall we...

Wonderful cycling race game. Easy to play and exciting to the end but with a significant amount of luck (falls*) in the Chance cards that often determine the fates of the riders more than the tactics of the players. This is getting close to be uprated to an 8.

Yes, it's a game with the luck of dice, but it also has so much more:

All this from a cycling race game.
Good fun.

17-02-2015. Rated after 2 plays. Dutch version of Um Reifenbreite, a cycling racing-game in which you play as a team of cyclists traversing different kind of terrains (some easier downhill, some uphill and more painful).

Um Reifenbreite would be a simple roll-and-move game if they wouldn't have added the 'follow' mechanism and the 'movement cards'. Normal moving is done by rolling two dice and adding/substracing the terrain modifier (+ for downhill, - for uphill). Instead of a die roll you can substitute with a higher number card.

Moving cyclists are resolved in order, so the cyclist in front moves first. If you and a cyclist directly behind your cyclist you are moving are on the same terrain, they may decide to follow and place their cyclist directly behind yours again without rolling forgoing their turn. If you roll a 7, you get a chance card. Some are basically move X spaces forward, or lose a turn (with that cyclist), but some are horrible as a potential disqualification for the front-runner!

I think Um Reifenbreite is an excellent racing game. It looks horrible though, a graphical overhaul would really improve the game :). The mechanisms are rock solid and highly enjoyable. The terrain, follow mechanisms and interaction make the game very fun. The last thing, I didn't like was all the chance cards. Some are fun, but some are gamebreaking and I'd remove those.

RATING: 9
This game is great. The difficulty can be easily adapted to suit the player's needs, as the rulebook adds more and more layers of 'complexity' to the game. But even with the expert rules, it doesn't get too hard or fiddly.

Cycling fans will immediately recognise the typical elements from the sport: Hills and cobblestone roads break up the group of cyclists, allowing the best to take the lead. Movement is decided by dice, but each of the cyclists has got [i]power cards[/i] which allow him to change the die result to a more favorable one, or even break away from those coming behind him. Another thing that mitigates the luck of the roll is the opportunity to take advantage of another player's good roll by following in his wheel - which in turn can be avoided by clever positioning of your own cyclists. 

There's also rules for cheating by letting your cyclist get pulled by a team car (which may or may not result in disqualification at the end of the race if you get caught by the race jury) and chance cards which add in random events (a flat tyre, cyclists falling, cyclists moving faster because they're being cheered on by their family,...)

You've got different ways of scoring (sprinting points in the mid of the race, a great [i]Tour[/i] in which points are gathered by each team's main cyclist in multiple races. The game comes with four predetermined races, but players are encouraged to come up with their own tracks.

Such a delightful journey, feels somewhat laid back and easygoing all the way through. I think I can say I've never not enjoyed a game of this...always a success (except for with my wife, who hates it with a burning passion--she's never played it, but the drawings remind her of a forced French immersion schooling or something like that...I've never delved into that one, but feel like there are probably angry Newfoundland nuns somewhere in the story).

I like that there are a lot of rules to add in or not, that the race track is determined by you, that you help each other by racing in lines (drafting), and changing leaders even with opponents to keep up a good run.

feels casual and enjoyable and breezy. I don't get too worked up about it, but neither do I look at the clock during play.

BGG has lost my comments for this game - what I remember saying was that it was a good dice rolling sport simulation - worth playing once a year in June.

This is a great game. The theme may not excite everyone but there's a fair amount of strategy involved. In fact, it's deeply tactical especially if you play the advanced/professional game.

The luck (or lack thereof) of the dice is mitigated to some degree by the energy cards. I like how the chance cards really adds some 'reality' to the game. EG: If all riders choose to draft, they'll eventually fall over if the rider at the front causes a mass fall.

One of the best racing games around (beats Formula De hands down!).

Nekem ugyanazt az élményt adta, mint a Formula D. Ebben a versenyzőkhöz adott kártyák tetszettek, illetve a 4 versenyző egy csapatban lehetőség, így egy kicsit lehet a kockadobás adta szerencsén csökkenteni, bár ez is ugyanúgy nagy szerencsefüggő játék, mint az autóversenyes változat. A szerencsekártyákat viszont kicsit erősnek éreztem. Nagyon sok olyan van benne, amivel egyáltalán nem lép az adott játékos. Szerintem ez túl drasztikus, én minimum egy kockányi lépéslehetőséget adnék, esetleg 1-2 lépéspontot mindenképp. A játék kivitelezése a korához képest nagyon korrekt, de a szerencsekártyák puritán szöveges megoldása ront az összképen. Szép ikonokkal is meg lehetett volna ezt oldani.

A really well-implemented game, especially considering how old it is. Truly captures the sense of a bicycle race. I like playing with stages and terrain and having to balance your riders so that you win or lose as a team. The drafting mechanic is simple, yet well-done. With roll-and-move at its heart, there's a fair bit of luck. In particular, the mountains make it pretty swingy, but in a fun way.

Takes too long for a game with a huge amount of luck.  There's a good amount of luck with the dice rolling, which is fine, but a random card every time you roll a seven that completely changes the outcome?  That's not usually good even in a short game, much less one that takes over an hour to play.

At its time, Um Reifenbreite was a good racing game with a solid theme. I enjoyed it a lot during college (when I bought it in an outlet sale). A few years later, I played it again with the Tour de France going on. It was just plain awful. Roll dice, move a cyclist, follow high scores, and repeat. Nothing wrong with that per se, but not something to play for 90 minutes. With 45 minutes, this would be an enjoyable game to play once in a while. Currently, it is far too long for what it is. The best way to cherish my memories with this game is to never play it again.

For a game that begins so hesitantly with an "Um", it sure ends up being a definitively great racing game - right on par with "Formula De Mini" (henceforward referred to as "FDM"), as far as I'm concerned (although the literal English translation, "Only one nut but a bright yellow shirt", makes very little sense).  In fact, although it is a very comparable game to FDM both from a "fast and fun" point of view and a (rather disappointingly caricature) graphical perspective, it at the same time manages to be a very different game.  In fact, it somehow succeeds in capturing various aspects of bicycle racing, such as drafting and the challenge of going up and down hills, in a brilliantly simple system.  Like FDM, it has some weird, cartoonish graphic designs on the boards, but at least in this game they add to the entertainment value.  My major gripes with the game are that there are few meaningful decisions to make (other than when to play cards) and the game tends to drag on a bit long since, to get the full experience, you really need to play with 4 players and do a lap of the entire circuit.  But the biggest point in its favour is that it takes a form of racing that is even more boring than Formula One and turns it into a fun and exciting experience.    Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7/10

Frustration awakened by the use of the dice, but with a little tinkering (we say doubles of 1's 2's and 3's allow one single dice roll to add to the score) this is levelled out a little and a great game. Also it can balance out a bit as we play one race as part of a tour de france e.g. we played 8 races in total.

RATING: 6.5
[Jumbo 2nd (2003) Edition] {Bicycle race; roll-and-move, variable-player-order, utility cards; optimal 4p} {6 basic rules, 6.5 advanced rules, 7 professional rules} A very interesting family racing game. A good alternative for car racing games.

It has a strong bicycle theme and good graphics.  The board and bits aren't sturdy enough. It has to be well protected to have a longer life.

The rules are easy to understand although they are long.  Advanced rules are always preferred.  However, for basic game is also fun for new players.  It's one of the few games that allow cheating in the game play :)

It's very funny in playing the game.  The card draw, drafting and blocking allows strong player interaction.  Very small down time and players are always involved.

It provides certain amount of strategy though it's dice driven.  However, carefully planning the route, determining when to draft and using the energy cards wisely are more important.  Besides, each team has 4 riders and the luck is averaged a bit. This is where it differs from most of other racing games, in which each player just needs to move one pawn toward the goal first.

If time is of no concern, route Giro d'Italia and Tour de France should be used. They provide more strategic options and are funnier. The 2 short routes can be used for introducing the games to the new players and to learn new rules. The short routes are more luck-dependence because there are few energy cards and bad dice-rolls will seriously impact the position.

I hate not liking this more. I wanted to like it more because it looks like so much fun and offers the epic feel of a real bicycle race. Unfortunately, when it was all over I had to admit that the dice-rolling and chance cards injected too much luck for the game to be ultimately satisfying. 

Breaking Away is a much better game. When I find players who aren't interested in all the math, I'll pull out Ave Caesar. Unfortunately, Um Reifenbreite falls between the cracks.

For a game that is massively dependant on dice rolling, this was genuinely enjoyable and had a good number of tense moments. The difference between making the top of the mountain and falling one short is too much (minus 6 or plus 5, separated by one space!) but with only really that minor quibble, it's a clever and fun game that does a good job of abstracting out the terrain and drafting.

RATING: N/A
A race game-eket nem igazán kedvelem. Ezeknél a játékoknál inkább az számít, hogy mennyire tudja a játék visszaadni az eredeti verseny hangulatát. 

Ebben a játékban van olyan, hogy 
- valaki beáll a szélárnyékba, és követi versenytársát
- energiakártyák segítségével szökési kísérletet lehet végrehajtani, hogy elhagyd a bolyt.
- az emelkedőn lassabban, a lejtőn gyorsabban lehet haladni
- időnként bukás történik, amikor is a közvetlenül mögöttem jövők is elesnek, a távolabbról érkező viszont meg tudja kerülni az elesett versenyzőket
- kizárást kockáztatva a versenyző a kisérő autóba kapaszkodhat, hogy energiát takarítson meg

A szabály szerteágazó egy kicsit, bár bonyolultanak egyáltalán nem mondanám. A bevezető szabályokat csak az első partira ajánlom, amikor még a szabályokat tanuljuk, utána viszont mindenképpen full szabállya kell játszani.

Eddig én sem játszottam full szabállyal, de az már kiderült, hogy anélkül a szerencse szerepe magasabb a kelleténél. Jelen pillanatban úgy látom, hogy a full szabállya van már benne annyi taktikázási lehetőség, hogy a szerencse szerepét minimalizálni lehessen. (De erre egy következő partiban fog csak fény derülni...)

The luck factor is just too high for my tastes. I honestly like the general look and feel of the game, the components and all are great. The action cards mitigate the luck to some extent, but not nearly enough. It is still a 2D6 roll and move game.

Lots of luck, but a surprising number of strategic choices on top of the basic roll-and-move framework. I'd put it right up there with any race game I've ever played.

A fathers day present and great fun.  My six year old loves playing it - and playing with the advanced rules is helping his maths without him even realising!

I am a cycling fan, and this game is great for the 340 days of the year that don't contain the Tour de France.  The game is simple enough to teach people quickly, and it isn't so simple as to not be enjoyable.

Played once with advance rules of cards and terrain modifiers.  Interesting game, but still not as fun as Breaking Away for me!

A cycling race game that I like a lot. There is some luck involved with dice rolling and the cards, but there also strategic decisions involved. During play you have a real race feeling.

One of the better racing games I've played (better than for example Formula De). This game is very versatile: you can choose from several different race courses (short and long), you can add the effects of biking over different kinds of surfaces and you can even decide to allow cheating. An older game well worth picking up.

RATING: 7
Wonderful racing game.
We don't use the event cards, though, as we thought it introduced way too much randomness into the game. 
So here's our houserule:
Whenever you roll 7 (and that includes 7s that are the result of an Energy Card   a die roll), reroll just one die. If you roll 1, you fall (and cause others "behind" you to fall).
That's it.

Played twice (with 3 and 4 players). The first play had some wrong rules - the correct ones actually improve the game, which is a relief. However, it remains a bit long for what it is, and since I am no big fan of either racing games or cycling, I doubt I will be tempted to play it again.

Not a bad racing game. Similar to the rest, distinguishes itself from some by including energy cards with certain limitations as well as chance cards that are good or (mostly) bad. Quick and simple, but there are better racing options out there.

Neat drafting mechanic that rescues this game from being a dice fest.  Basic rules make for a light filler while the advanced rules add a decent amount of complexity.

What a great blend of luck, risk assessment and chaos. A tidy little package, this game is lots of fun to play with very little downtime. The amount of luck and chaos, which can be rather harsh, still feels about right given the brisk pace and short game length. Also love the drafting and simple terrain features to help add to the feel of bicycling.

Again the same commentary: played this a lot with my son and his best friend (and the father of that friend who happened to be MY best friend).

My son now has children of his own (12 and 6) and it's time I show them what there daddy liked so much.

Pity my daughter in law doesn't like "sport games" very much.

Having played Leader 1 first I can see where that game had borrowed many of its mechanics from.  It shares quite a few similarities with Um Reifenbreite.  I like the hand management aspect and the choice to use your card(s) or to rely on the die roll.  The chance deck does make the game rather random but it also adds a bit of humor into the experience.  Having certain track sections that will modify your movement is an interesting touch as well.  What I didn't care for, however, was how the requirement for a break away.  There should be a bigger penalty than just spending an energy card.  A good but somewhat outdated bicycle simulation, I can see why it won the SdJ.

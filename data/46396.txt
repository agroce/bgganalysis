Gorgeous game materials. Better scoring mechanism than the original (the same as Extreme).

Neverthless, i like it less than Ubongo, because it is not a light game anymore. Even the easy puzzles are quite challenging (at least to me). We had one player who could finish only 1 in 9 puzzles.

This was much more difficult than I expected.   In fact, in our first game not a single player could complete the hardest puzzle size in a reasonable amount of time.    I'd be curious to see how good you could get at this game over time.

I actually find the difficulty attractive, because the original game can get boring fast.

If you find Ubongo too easy, this is the game for you!  It is surprising how much more difficult it is when you have to work in 3D.  I enjoy it, but my family dislikes it, so it rarely gets played.

RATING: 5
While I enjoy the other Ubongos, this one just upped the difficulty a little too high for me.  I think I may have completed one puzzle the entire game, which doesn't exactly make for a fun time!

RATING: 7
Something in my childhood must have prepared my brain for this game - probably my dad's collection of spatial puzzles / brainteasers - because my first and only time playing, I solved 7 of my 9 puzzles, most of them in 75 seconds or less. We were using the "hard" side.

This definitely stoked my confidence in my spatial skills, but it also meant I ended up sitting around a lot waiting for the timer. The actual puzzle-solving under time pressure was a great deal of fun.

Ubongo is a great series of games but this one is hardcore! There is no chance you will be able to put the pieces together when you play for the first time. You can try upside-down, inside-out and nothing. The only solicitation is that other players usually have the same results :-)

If you liked Ubongo or Ubongo Extreme but have enough of them - try this one. It's an unforgettable and rare expierence.

Is harder than Ubongo Extreme.  You look at the 3 pieces and think 'there can't be that many ways these 3 pieces go together'.  1 min 20 later you are still trying to do it..

3D Ubongo is very complicated. It is really hard to make even one successful puzzle in time. It is not my taste.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quite difficult at first..
It's an OK version of Ubongo, but the original one remains the best in my eyes - scoring system is what makes the original smart, fun and the best version out there.  In all other cases (including Ubongo 3D) it's just the competition who is better at solving puzzles..

Oh, and I'll repeat from my session report:
"Scoring is screwed - in theory gives a chance to players who are a bit weaker at solving puzzles, but at a cost of insane randomness... Who wins is a lottery, especially when the level of players is similar."

Initial Rating: 7.0 (April 2012)

I think this is a great game, so you could wonder why I give it a 6.0 rating? That´s because this is a very hard game for me and I don´t want to play it often. I will play it but I need to be in the mood :D.

As the game is so hard for me, the game stops to be fun and begins to be an exercise in frustration, I think this is one of the few games that I need to play with players around my skill level, otherwise the game is no fun because you never accomplish anything, you don’t finish any puzzle. In general I prefer to play with better players so I can get better, but this game is an exception to that rule.

The game components are awesome, all of them are very well done and when you are playing, the player boards looks gorgeous. This is by far the hardest Ubongo game I have played, although I have not played yet the Ubongo Xtreme game (a game I own).

This kind of game is very hard for me, but I’m improving.

On the negative side, I don´t like the way the game manages the scoring, however in our games this has not been an issue because the owner of the game is so much better than me. BUT I can see how the scoring can be a turn down for me if two players have the same skill, then the game is decided mostly by luck, a huge minus for me.

Overall a very good game that can frustrate the hell out of you, but I want to own it and play it from time to time.

Current Rating: 6.0

RATING: 6
Despite the comments on BGG, I'd say that this is actually easier than Ubongo Extreme.  It's sort of irrelevant - Ubongo is playable on a family/kid level and both 3D & Extreme are probably going to be reserved for gamers in my group.  From there, I prefer the slowburn but solvable 3D puzzles versus the blank stares that I can often get in Extreme.

Finally the perfect Ubongo version for me. Plain Ubongo is fun but sometimes the puzzles are too easy, i.e. luck enters play. Ubongo BMM was ridiculously easy. Ubongo 3D on the easy side is a nice challenge while the difficult side is so hard that satisfaction is guaranteed when a puzzle is solved. Only drawback - here even more than with the rest of the series - is that unequal skills will lead to frustration. I haven't tried Ubongo Extreme but having played 3D I don't see any need for the Extreme version anymore. The blocks add a whole new tactile experience that I will miss in 2D Ubongo from now on. Nonetheless, Ubongo still will have its spot when 3D is too hard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Rating reflects my desire to play the game, not really the merit of the game itself. This is a very challenging puzzle game, for me it is by far the most difficult of the series. All of the Ubongo games I've played (except for the original) have been too much for me.

If you think of the Ubongo series as a fun, social game that you can enjoy while chatting with friends, this is not that game. Not only will your brain hurt after playing this, you would likely have not spoken a word to any of the other players except to taunt the other 3 in the rare instance that you can solve one of the puzzles within the allotted time. However, if you actually get enjoyment (like me) out of solving these complex puzzle challenges in 3D, you may actually enjoy this excellently produced game that really pushes the genre to the next level (no pun intended).

Can you solve puzzles in 3D?  Now puzzles are created with different 3D shapes and must be completed at 2 blocks high within the borders.  I've only played the 3 piece side which is challenging, but I've found it easier than Ubongo Extrem to this point.  Perhaps giving the 4 piece side might present a harder challenge...;-)

3rd best game of 2009 and one of my favorites to play with non-gamers.
AWESOME achievement. It has ridiculous amount of puzzles, I don't think I've even done all the easy ones yet. Top quality components, the Tetris feel makes it more approachable than other Ubongos. It's the best puzzle game ever made and one of the best games to play with non-gamers. Takes about a minute to teach.

2-Player Comment:

This 3D variation of Ubongo has players racing to complete three dimensional puzzles. Probably more challenging overall than its predecessor. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The idea is simple - take 3 or 4 three-dimensional pieces and use them to solve puzzles. I should have gotten the hint when I had trouble even FINDING the pieces I needed to solve my puzzle! I literally sat there for 20 minutes and could not figure out one puzzle. Michelle, who is normally a wiz at these kind of games, struggled as well (though she was able to solve 2 puzzles in her 20 minutes, she could not solve the one that stumped me! I felt somewhat redeemed :-) I have enough trouble with the 2D version, so I'll give this one a pass, thanks.

Probably the best Ubongo that I have played (haven't played Extreme). Some of the puzzles are really hard, which gives this game longetivity as you try to get them solved. If there were some real puzzle-solving action (see La Boca) instead of just moving and turning the blocks around, this would be gold.

EDIT. 20.06.17.
The more I've played this, the more frustrating this game becomes. I consider myself pretty good at three dimensional perception, but every time I play this it feels like this has nothing to do with it, just stack those blocks and see what happens, rinse and repeat. Maybe it's because of the race element?

RATING: 8
Best of the Ubongo series. I thought at first that it would be too easy when there is only 2 levels to be built and some pieces are even just in one level. It's not. I had trouble even on some 3 piece puzzles and 4 pieces felt close to impossible sometimes (there are solutions included probably just because of this feeling...).

Hard. Maybe even tougher than Ubongo das Duell. Even though it's only two levels of blocks, you really need to rewire your brain for this. Uses the same scoring scheme as Ubongo Extrem, so it's pretty much a crapshoot. 

There seems to be a huge variance in the runtime of the sandtimer. The copy we tried in Essen had a timer of less than 90 seconds, while the local copy had 114 seconds.

Wow this is tough! The original Ubongo is still tough and fun to play. But this adds a whole new 3-dimensional level to the tough puzzles. I do miss the gem board though...this game has you pull out of a bag a number of blue and amber gems that equal the number of rounds in the game and they just sit in the middle of the table and inevitably get moved. A nice simple board to hold those gems would have been nice. The first time we played my wife couldn't solve a single puzzle. While playing that time, I took a phone call that went on for awhile, when I returned she announced she finally solved one. It's a great puzzle game that really tests your spacial skills.

I reckon this one's taken Ubongo a step too far. Even the easy 3 piece side is hit and miss, easy or hard dependent on the board you get and whether you get lucky with the initial configurations you try. After that, there's just so many ways things can fit that it can be really tough completing a board in the time given. Which leads to much frustration rather than enjoyment if you're all equally experienced novices at the game, so it fails in the light filler occasional type game category. If you work at it and get better at the 3D challenge, you'll have the satisfaction of completing boards, but no one will be able to compete with you, again detracting from overall player enjoyment. As a result, I found the game annoying and won't be seeking it as an alternative to the more enjoyable and equally competitive standard edition. On the plus side, the scoring mechanism seems easier and improved (set points for completing, plus random points from the bag) and can be carried over to the original.

X2 copies.  This does have enough pieces to play duel style however I love this game and wanted enough to play duel style with 4 players so the whole family can join in the fun.

I'm totally aware this can be played with 4 players however I feel like everyone playing a different puzzle does not give an accurate representation of skill as everyone racing on the same puzzle.

So far the best Ubongo I've played. Also this is the toughest Ubongo...

Well, the harder the better. Still has the basic problem that another player may get a bit easier puzzle than the others (for example it has a piece that fits in only one way). Point system is same as in Ubongo Extreme, which is extremely great!

The box is unnecessarily large. Oh come on, the production costs and price may have cut a bit with use of common sense. Ridiculous.

This game is quite tough but I probably did better at this game than extreme on first few plays.  I have only played the easier side thus far and it is a great mental puzzle game that really is true to its name as you are thinking 3-dimensionaly.  If you aren't a type person who can visualize objects in 3d then this might be a bit too frustrating.  This was very frustration for my wife at first but then she was getting the hang of it a bit more with additional puzzle work.  If you enjoy Ubongo extreme and do well at it then you will definitely love this game.  If you enjoy Ubongo extreme but get frustrated at time then this game might trend to be a little more frustrating than fun as it is more difficult and has a different type of mental visualization .  It's definitely in the category "games for Math majors". Can't wait to play on the difficult side unfortunately I'm not sure I'll have anyone to play with.  All in all love this game and and might even be more fun than extreme as long as you are not playing with overly frustrated players.   


The quality of this game is awesome all pieces fit together perfectly (unlike Ubongo extreme)

Similar to Code Omega in flow of play. Each player gets a card, a dice is rolled telling each player which pieces to play with, and a timer is started. Each piece is a three dimensional tetris piece, no more than 2 cubes (stories??) high. Each card has a marked off area. You must place the cubes into the marked off area such that the entire area is filled and no piece extends beyond the area. The 3D shape is always two stories high.

Scoring mechanism has a random element to it, so the best player could very well lose, but more often than not will win. I found this a bit more of a brain burner than Code Omega.

I should start off stating that I am very much biased toward this series specifically and this style of game in general.  When I first heard about this, there was no doubt that it would be added to my collection.  I suppose it is only a matter of time until it is more easily available (read that as affordable).  

As for the game, I've seen some post that it is by far the most difficult of the games.  I suppose it is more difficult than the base game.  I'm not convinced it is more difficult than the B side of Das Duell.  To me, at least, it feels as though the three piece sides are about the same level of difficulty as the B sides of Ubongo Extrem.  That seems about right, particularly given the three dimensionality of the game.  

What more can you say?  If you like Ubongo, it's more of the same. [12/29/2009]

Holy crap is this game a mind-f*ck.  I've played all of the Ubongo games up to this point, and I've done pretty well with the lot.  Even Ubongo Extreme threw me for a loop for a while, but I got the hang of it.  This, on the other hand, is a red-assed beatdown.  My wife and I played head to head at BGG.con 2009, and while she was able to get the spatial reasoning to get 8/9 of her puzzles, I didn't get half of them done -- and that's with the 180 second time limit.  

One nice advantage of this game over previous Ubongo games is that there is a printed solution booklet so you can can't declare "It's impossible", but it sure is rubbing salt in the wound to look up the solution for the figure just to find that you weren't even close.

The components are great, and I hope that Z-man or another U.S. company can pick this one up soon.

Wow, I really stink at this game! Actually, I think I may have done better with this than with the Extreme version, though.

It's more of the same, but in 3-D! The puzzles seem to be pretty difficult. I, at least, needed some extra time to solve several of them, and I never did solve many others! The scoring is just like Ubongo Extreme, so I find it equally elegant and annoying. Yes, it's nice and simple compared to the scoring system (game-in-a-game) of the original game. But the randomness of the gem draw from the bag gets to be kind of frustrating -- I solve few enough of these first or second; when I do, I hate it when I end up drawing a crappy amber gem!

The game is great if you like the others in the series but are looking for a different challenge. I do wish, however, that they'd used more colors -- 1 per shape -- so it would be easier finding the pieces you need for a specific puzzle.

tl;dr: fun, but not that challenging. Or is it?

So after the success that was [thing=31479][/thing] we also got this version. 3D promises to add a new dimension of challenge, but by having square shapes, the options are lower than with hexagons in 2D it seems.
In any case, this came out weird. For Myriam and I this is a very easy version where we can usually solve (the 3 piece) puzzle within 10 or 15 seconds. Most other players seem incapable of finishing on time though. That's puzzling to me. Why is this so much easier for some, yet harder than the Extreme version for others? I guess it's the extra dimension that requires a different part of the brain? I don't know.
So while this is not as challenging, I do still really enjoy playing this.

Rated the same as regular Ubongo. It's more fun as it is much more challenging but this can also deter some people who just 'don't get it' and find nothing but frustration in the game.

Ubongo 3D was next and unlike the wonderful Ubongo and Ubongo: Das Duell, Ubongo 3D was no fun at all, at least for my weak brain. The players seemed fairly well split between being amazingly fast at completing these three-dimensional puzzles and being totally inept at them. I try to tell myself that I didn’t just dislike the game because I fell into the latter category, but who am I fooling? I’ll stick to two-dimensional Ubongo and Ubongo: Das Duell, which are perfect for those of us who can’t operate at that higher plane.

The last publication in the trilogy of big box Ubongo puzzles, this takes the cake. Supposedly the hardest game in the series, Ubongo 3D challenges players with building a 2-level high three dimensional structure with odd shape blocks. The shapes of the blocks are reminiscent of Rumis or Blokus 3D, but game play is different. Ubongo 3D retains the scoring method of Ubongo extreme instead of the original Ubongo. So no silly player mat. I actually found 3D (3 block version) to be a little easier than Ubongo extreme in some cases. However, just like all the other Ubongos in the series, there is a pulse of satisfaction whenever the blocks click together on the map. Great conclusion to the series!

The reason I've rated this game as low as I have is because I'm not good with competitive puzzle games, and I'm even worse when it comes to spatial games like this.  The fact that, in the only game I've played of this title, 46 points separated me from the winner indicates that this is not, and very likely will never become, my sort of game.  Kudos to you who can process this kind of game, because it breaks me.

I like spatial puzzles and I'm a fan of the original Ubongo (or Expedition Pyramide), so this is a fun way to ratchet things up a notch. The scoring system is a bit wonky, since it relies on luck of the draw. Nothing in the way of interaction and some players are likely to be very frustrated by the difficulty of the challenges presented here.

Very challenging.  However, I think with each new derivation of Ubongo the game itself appeals to less and less people.  The series feels like it's getting niche simply because the majority of the puzzles can only be solved by those that have a knack for spatial problems.  I play games to have fun and hopefully to feel better about myself, not to be frustrated in thinking that I've accomplished nothing.

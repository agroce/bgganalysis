Overall, this is a fast playing, good game about modern combat in the Pacific Rim that offers both players a lot of choices.  The adapted War at Sea system works well, the counters look good, and the rules are simple to grasp.  I do take issue with the designer's argument that the whereabouts of both sides assets will be known as U.S. CVN battlegroups practice "getting lost" in the Pacific and are quite good at it during exercises.  The other issue is that both sides can only do one op when in reality I think multiple ops would be going on across the theater.  I can see why these things were done for the sake of game play and it works, so my issues are minor.  I would hope to see a supplement someday with F-35 counters, Australian F-18s, etc. .

Played once, i like the op/action system. Sounds simple but you have to think strategically...i didn't and the US got whupped, made me want to play the game again straight away. I really want to see this expanded beyond it's current map area and forces involved, it's a fantastic "what if" game. Fairly specific genre, i'd say you need an interest in the subject to get full enjoyment out of it.

On the way! 06/2008.  An interesting system with area movement, War at Sea combat mechanics, and a turn based on military/political options.  Game plays smooth and quick and gives a nice overview of this possible what if conflict. Update: still having trouble as the USA player countering the Spratlys First strategy.  A good game that I continue to play, but some of the timing of the random events can be killers! :angry:  The other day, I had Japan bail on the first turn! :what:

This is a deep game, but not a complex one.  Graphically, it's terrific.  The rules are simple and clear.  The Developer's Notes claim it's a combination of WAR AT SEA and SIXTH FLEET and I think that's an apt description.  It's fast-playing.  Even with two rookie players, it can be finished in a few hours.  Experienced players could move much faster.  One nit:  I'd like to have seen a VP point and Turn Record track on the map.  Those aspects have to be tracked on a separate piece of paper.

Simple, bloody game that can very much be driven by the dice and random events.  But it plays very quickly and generates a really cool narrative.  Like reading a Tom Clancy Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book (written while he was still focusing on WWIII-type stuff).

A modernized version of "War at Sea" that explores a what-if conflict with the People's Republic of China and the United States. Major land events, such as an invasion of South Korea, are handled as events. Very simple but enlightening. Map is a combination of "Twilight Struggle" and "War at Sea." Unique and different.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very interesting topic, though the scenario doesn't seem realistic for 2014, (even for something published in 2008.) Overly simplistic - Victory in the Pacific doesn't feel right for the 21st century. Fair amount of chrome, though much of it comes in the form of random events that can have a huge, game-determining effect. Still, I'd like to play some more and use the expansion rules. Will probably get the new edition when they publish it.

UPDATE: Improving the rating a little. 2nd game went much better for me. I kept the US fleet concentrated in the Marianas and was able to (barely) hold the PRC at bay through B2 strikes, airlifts and rebasings to Taiwan. PRC eventually took Taiwan thru random event, but I recovered it after wiping out almost the entire PRC military and winning in Korea. Allied losses were not insignificant, but PRC's were devastating. Majority of random events that occurred favored the US.

VitP may have been brilliant in its day but those obsolete and random mechanics have no place in a modern wargame. This is also another Decision Games game where the random events table has a heavy hand in the gameplay. Nevertheless, I like the premise. You want to explore the optimal strategic options because they are interesting. But the thing is, it's not that many. For all the randomness of the events table and dice, the strategic options are not that varied. 

P.S. Sign that the game could have done with more playtesting - a random event that ends the game with no satisfactory conclusion. I mean, come on. The probability of it happening is not that low and it just should have been excised from the game.

I like this system. Easy to play and every game is different. Allies gain the upper hand if they arrive in force with three carrier groups or more.

PRC must strike hard and fast. They can pressurize the Allied player with the russians and making moves in Korea.

Need to play again.

Modern Warfare is NOT my favorite period of play, but when this came out in 2006 in Strategy & Tactics, my son and I tried it out, and we loved the game system. We have played several times. And we have tried the later game based on the same system....FALKLANDS. Loved it. And I am not a Modern period fan. We are looking forward to playing RED DRAGON GREEN CRESCENT game of the same system in their new Modern War publication.

The game is not without its quirks, but I find that I have enjoyed it immensely.  It's an extremely simple game to pick up and play -- and I do like it for what it is -- but it makes me pine for a full-blown hex-and-counter treatment of the same subject matter.

Rating after 1 f2f game without having read the rules. Kind of a fresh approach to contemporary wargaming, this was a fun game. Kind of like 2nd Fleet with 1/5 of the rules. The random events (some small and some very big) are great and I'll be playing more once S&T decides to send me my copy.

Interesting concept, that focus on strategic deployments.
The necessity to browse continualy the list of the available actions to choose among them what you will do is a bit boring, but with a little practice I suppose you know them by hart.
I wanted to see more and I bought the extension, supposedly a uptdate of the ODB and situation.

It's a cartoon, but a good one.  The operations system focuses the players' attention on the decisionmaking process and keeps things moving at a good clip.  Combat is easy to execute and bloody enough to be satisfying.  One of 2008's better titles.

What a great game system. I am especially please how the design team has been open to suggestions - such as making specialized bonus VPs for going after a random target the Chi-Com player is given at the beginning of the game - so the Imperialist have no idea what the true goal of the Communists is...

I cannot recommend this game for purchase or play.

This is based upon three plays of the game using the updated rules, an interest in the game subject, and desire for the game system to work.

My three principle problems with the game are:

(1) The game consists of 30 PRC-US operstions cycles means the inconceivable and unrealsitic inactivity of units. In effect, it suggests that the PRC, the US, and their allies are unable to conduct simultaneous operations. 
(2) The overly simplistic combat system: a strategic level game does not necessarily mean simple.
(3) Game play is just a massive PRC attack on Taiwan countered by a massive US defense.
 
What forced me to stop play was the realisation that despite having the US CVX and a CVN supported by SAGs, SSKs and SSNs in the Taiwan Strait contested by s single PRC stealth SSK, the US carriers were unable to intercept PRC airstrikes (op 5) or airborne assault (op4) upon Taiwan from Central China.

This game is an interesting study in an alternative future where China is an adversary of the West.  The game has a limited number of operations for each side and the pressure is on China to change the world in 30 ops or less.  In short, it's a smashing game and well worth checking out.

RATING: 8
A very fun game with a lot of random elements, so there is a very high replay factor.  I'm still torn on the "one op per day" system, but for the game system it works.  The variant counters and rules that appeared in a later S&T magazine takes the game well into the 2020 period.

Novel and addictive to play. Alternating actions give it a chess-like quality. How much good the game is at forecasting what a 21st century war in the Pacific Rim might look like is probably another question . . .

Only part way through initial play, but so far, an interesting and entertaining game.  Simple rules somewhat akin to War at Sea with limited options/actions.  Chinese are almost like the Japanese in Victory in the Pacific in WWII.  Must move fast before the Allies gather their strength. Ordered the update kit for additional options.  Love the "Rods from God" option.

RATING: 9
Awesome game by Bruce Costello.  Very interesting, novel approach.  Random events and operations cycles create an interesting, fluid game tension.  Tremendously fun and challenging to play, no set script...terrific graphics, outstanding look at modern navies in the pacific.  Unbelievably exciting game.  An instant classic.

Very belated update:  I stand by the above, but with one caveat.  The game as written, out of the wrapper, has a play balance flaw.  There is a gambit whereby, barring only incredibly bad dice rolls, the PRC cannot lose.  That is using the standard rules.  If you don't know the gambit, the game is as I described above.  Once you figure it out, there is a play balance problem.

Based upon the threads in the CSW and the BGG folder, nobody besides the designer and myself appears to have posted the gambit (and I deleted my post of it), so until you figure it out, don't worry about it too much.

Fix: When you pull together the optional rules, including flexible victory conditions, and the upgrade kit, the gambit is no longer possible, so I recommend using the optionals and/or the upgrade kit, and the game is a 10 in my book...very fun to play, very challenging for both sides.

And a deluxe boxed version is coming soon.

May not be the best written rules I ever seen. I don't like the "End of the World" event. But : excellent components, theme, fast to play. A very good game (when I write variants for a game, it means that I really like it and for this one I already wrote 4 variants). Thumbs up !

It's hard to find much to like about this. Garish colour choices on the map, average counters, rules layout reminiscent of Command Mag games from 2 decades ago.

Laughably pompous developer notes hide a War at Sea rip off - mere humans cannot understand the totality of this game apparently. Unfortunately, its finely crafted quantum mechanical system allows you to answer NONE of the interesting questions about 21st Century war. No limited intelligence, no cyber warfare, no satellite warfare, just combat factors and dice. 

No worries, perhaps it's a great game? Well, yes, if you like games where about 1 game in 5 will end in a random loss for both players, no matter what they do.

Rubbish
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First off avoid this game if you dislike lots of friction in a war game.

Then I think it's a little discriminating that the game assumes the Chinese are the aggressors. I don't think they would attack the Americans, why would they damage their own property? Apart from that the situation portrayed in the game is certainly interesting.

Of course there aren't many strategic options for the Chinese since they are trying to achieve a few goals as fast as possible and the Americans are mostly reacting to that. However, the play resolves around the random event table and the player reacting best to (not necessarily benefiting most from) these events will win. Luck resulting from these should equal itself out over the course of the game.

Is it really a surprise that the WAR AT SEA system works in a modern environment? Not really, since it is a strategic system and the unit ratings abstract in all technological equipment. It doesn't matter whether a higher attack value comes from more advanced aircraft, ECCM equipped missiles, etc.

As a final comment I have to note that the game does only resemble 6TH FLEET in the portrayal of politics factors and in its focus on contemporary conflict. Otherwise the game/combat system in RED DRAGON RISING doesn't have much in common with 6TH FLEET.

This may be a mistake given my strategic level experience is limited to Hearts of Iron III, but this is SUPERBLY INTERESTING TO ME! This scenario bounces around my head all the time.

If I only get to try out, start to finish, one 'wargame', it would be this one I think. Most of the others I've tagged I could probably get a basic grasp on easy, and as they're based on history, understand how they're likely to turn out given adequate play. This one though, it's all in the air if designed well.

RATING: N/A
Interesting game. Plays easy. There are many different ways to make a move. It is actually hard remembering all that you can do until you have played it a few times. As the games says China has the initiative. The U.S. and its allies need to figure out how to regroup and position themselves. I cannot wait for S&T to add Green Crescent. This would add a much more interesting component and wider variant to the game. I was disappointed that Decision decided not to push it through as a P-500 and instead decided to publish it in Modern Warfare. Well, I have subscribed to Modern Warfare now. 

I think they should also wargame a potential conflict ranging from North Africa to the Levant (Egypt, Israel, Syria), to Arabia (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Yemen), to the Black Sea (Georgia and Ukraine), over to the Persian Gulf (Iraq and Iran), out to the Himalaya Mountains (Pakistan and India). There are many factors involved for a real potential conflict in this region. It would be interesting to see the powers played out especially with a Syria-Iran nexus; Pakistan and Russia lining on the side of Iran; Georgia, India, and Saudi Arabia on the side of the U.S. and Israel; and the Iraq-Persian Gulf region being a contested area. Moreover, what would Lebanon, Turkey, and Afghanistan do with their own internal strife (Maronites vs. Shiia, Kurds and Turkish government, Taliban and Afghani government respectively)? This is truly where the next conflict lies.

Interesting system. Fast playing wargame with plenty of randomness. The player that plans/reacts the best for all the bad stuff (random events) that can happen will win this one.

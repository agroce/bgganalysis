RATING: 6
7+ plays / 2,3,5 players

LIKE: quick and light, good decisions
DISLIKE: some obvious strategies (so far). could use some cheap re-fill sheets.

OVERALL: I like this game for what it is! A good, math-based filler for everyone to pickup and enjoy. Better table talk emerges with 3 than 2 players. Great for non-gamers and gamers alike since games with heavy luck and mild strategy seem to be a good design formula here.

RATING: 8
For a dice game that is fun, friendly and fast, it's really great. It plays in perhaps 10 min (depending on the number of players) - especially so if you've played a few times. It's very approachable - anyone who enjoys Yahtzee is likely to love this one. And there is enough think to it - really all risk calculation. I really like it.

Being a fan of dice games Qwixx hit the sweetspot for me. Quick game in which your earlier decision affect your play proggressively. Not meaty enough to gain a higher rating but definitely worth the time.

I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

A quick roll and write game that doesn't really strike a chord with me. Sure, it's simple and fast but it's one of those games where I don't really see the point of playing.

It's not bad but it's very forgettable.

Qwixx plays quickly and keeps everyone involved, it doesn't ask me to roll the dice, set two aside and re-roll the rest.  These are all plus points.  On the negative side, it seems that it would be easy to write a computer programme to play Qwixx optimally, relieving me of the need to ever play it again.

Quick, clever, simple dice rolling game.  Six dice, two white.  Everyone uses the white total.  The roller additionally uses one white and one coloured.  The totals are crossed off on score sheet, but you can never put a cross to the left of your existing crosses.  Good fun and interesting choices.

Super fast filler, with almost no components: six dice, a score pad.
Every round the turn player rolls the dice, and can cross two values on his score pad (made of 4 colored rows), while every other player can cross one. Values must be crossed from left to right. If the turn player can't or won't place at least a cross, must cross a "misthrow".
Game ends when one player crosses 4 misthrow, or when two rows are completed. The player with most points is of course the winner.

Qwixx has (obviously) a very high dependance on luck, and choices are almost non-existent: one must just try to cross the farthest numbers to the left, and that doesn't require great amounts of thought.

Anyway, the game plays very fast, and can be somewhat enjoyable. But Yatzee seem better...

It's strongest aspect is that people are involved every turn but the game kinda feels like it plays itself as the best decision is usually obvious. While I do enjoy this game (because it's short and rolling dice is fun) I'd suggest Rolling America as it's in the same category but a better game.

Dice rolling fun that any number can play (provided you have the scoresheets). I like how every player is involved on each roll as they can cross off a number that matches the white dice. Keeps the game moving at a nice clip. Kids especially seem to enjoy this game. Keeper!

I just love simple dice games like this that include some real decisions. It has those tough tactical moments when you will sit there trying to decide whether to jump down the line on a row or just hold off. Then it also has a few of those exciting "I can't believe it" moments when you roll and get exactly what you needed. Granted, as a dice game, there are going to be times when a player is completely hosed by their roll. But usually those moments come because a player made an earlier decision that made the current roll difficult. This will be played a lot in the future, and I'll be happy to play it.

Qwixx is a well done quick dice game, whose biggest flaw is its missing flavor and craziness. You're usually offered a few options and even with bad luck there's usually a way left for you to win the game.
It's over so quickly you won't get bored, but the excitement isn't too big either.

Works really well due to a couple of rules: 1) everyone can score on each player's turn, and 2) there's no re-rolling. So while there's nothing shockingly new, it really fires on all cylinders.

Simple game of rolling 6 dice of which two are white and the others are the colours of the rows you are trying to complete. On your go you must cross something off the track or take a penalty. You can even advance on others goes using the numbers on the white dice. Two tracks go 12 to 2 and two are the opposite. Just like Lost Cities if you skip a number then you can't go back to it later. 3 Plays.

RATING: 7
This game is a great Yahtzee replacement for your Hasbro-loving family. This is a neat little game of probabilities, with some good choice points - do you fill all of your rows quickly, risking penalties on all but the most improbable of rolls? Or do you leave a row or two open and "safe" but accruing less points? While there isn't "interaction" in the traditional sense, players are engaged on each other's turns and you must keep an eye on what your opponents are doing if you want to maximize your score.

I think this is the only true filler dice game I have (10-15 minutes), so it fills another nice niche there.

Qwixx is tailor-made for non-gamers who have only played and like games like Yahtzee and the like. This little filler doesn’t offer many interesting decisions, and even though it isn’t entirely random and some tactical decisions are required, there isn’t a lot you can do to influence the game… After my first game we played it twice more, which is often a promising sign, but I think it was more because of the fact that we didn’t have time for any other games before one of the guys had to leave (it’s a very quick game which lasts for 5-7 minutes). Having played the game three times now, I don’t need to play it again, but if we have 5 minutes I guess I would be up for it if the other people insisted.

Quite fun for such a simple dice game. Wife and I can usually play 4 games in abut an hour which is wonderful. The turns move super quick and the decisions about what to cross off based on the scoring rules add a nice twist. With that said, the scoring always seems to be close too.

I'll likely laminate the scoresheets and very happy to have the expansions as well for a little variety. This may replace Can't Stop for me just because it is a lightweight dice game that is more portable, faster, and has some playing variety with the expansions.

Bit of a silly dice game, to be honest. I think I understand the appeal (because there's no difficult rules involved): it's all just crossing off numbers and hoping to roll for a good stretch. In the same category I prefer Doodle City which is without doubt the more involved offering. 

Add 1 to the rate when playing with non-gamers, though.

Fun gateway game for those who like Yahtzee. The fun thing is that all players are involved on every other players' turn so there is no downtime. It is also quick at roughly 15 minutes. The reason it is rated a 6 is because it begins to feel a bit samey after multiple plays.

RATING: 8
This is one of those games that so simple it doesn't seem like it should be fun or that gamers would get into it.  But au contraire, mon ami!  It has just enough depth to become fiercely addictive, so beware.

Dice are rolled, boxes are checked off your score card, but you always have to work left to right, which creates tough choices.  Don't like your options?  Take a penalty box.  Knowing how deep to "invest" in a color is key, as is deciding when to take a penalty.

I love that this is fast, portable, and inexpensive.  Worthy of its SdJ nomination, in my opinion.  My only disappointment with the compact little Gamewright edition is I wish it had come with 4 little golf pencils - then it would have had everything you need.  All that being said, any game where I rack up 5 plays in the first month is one I know will be a mainstay at our gaming table.

Played a number of games on New Year's Eve with some friends. I love the fast startup time and the fact that it even intrigues non-gamers. The zero downtime is another asset for more light settings like the one mentioned. I guess I would not use it for a dedicated game night (only as filler) but in social settings that's a perfect game. Would love to play again.

Let's play something quick? How about Qwixx? No.

Your turn in Qwixx: roll 6 dice, then take the best 1 or 2 combinations of 2 dice based on basic probability and mark it off on your score pad, pass the dice to the next player, fill up enough numbers on your score pad that you beg mercilessly for the game to end.
A game that is super quick and yet still has you begging for it to end? Yeah, there is NO GAME HERE. You always just choose the best option based on probability. The game is ENTIRELY just luck and that is what determines the winner. This is not a game, it is just rolling dice once a turn for a dozen turns.

Somehow everyone i play this game with likes it a lot but i have to say that the decisions to be made are quite obvious which is the reason for the relatively low rating. however, since it only takes around 15 minutes and can be played with everyone, it hits the table quite often without really convincing or detering me for more games. its just a small okayish game that does not take too much space on my shelf!

I read the directions out loud to my 16 year old daughter and she decided that it was too complicated for her tired ADD brain. My ADD brain wasn't too keen on it at that time, either. Maybe when we're both fresh and our brains are working a little bit better we'll try again. After all, I spent good money on this dang thing. It looks like it might be a bit like Yahtzee?

I've played Qwixx with 2 players only, so my rating might change once I play it with more players. The game itself feels more like an activity than a game. There are no real decisions and there isn't even a nice push-your-luck component. It feels more like playing Bingo and I would always prefer playing [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/117942/zooloretto-the-dice-game]Zooloretto: The Dice Game[/url] or [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34320/shanghaien]Shanghaien[/url] instead of this one.

Kinda fun game to play with the kids.  Like with any dice game, a good bit of luck.  The only problem is that we seem to mirror each others game sheets for the first half of the game.  It takes a good many turns around the table before each person has rolled and selected the colored/white dice combo enough so that the scorepad results diverge.

Dice trowing game.

Mechanism
You have 2 colorless dice and 4 different color die. On your turn throw the dice and if you choose cross out a matching number of colorless set from any of 4 colors. Then cross over matching number of any one color die + either of the colorless ones. Also all other players may cross over the sum of colorless dice if they want.

Two colors go from 2 to 12 and other two descend from 12 to 2.
After you cross out "red 8" and red is descending toward 2 you cant cross over "red 9" anymore. The more you cross on single color the more you get points.
Find good balance between maximizing crosses and speed to check out before game ends.

RATING: 6
(thanks, Mary!)   A quick dice chucker that aims to be a Yahtzee killer and pretty much succeeds.   All players are involved in the first part of each turn, and then the active player gets the option to make another combo for themselves.   There is a push-your-luck element as you are working on ladders in each color, but cannot backtrack.   For a families who like rolling dice and marking off scoresheets, this is a quick and satisfying little game.  For gamers, I'm not sure that it is good enough to be a popular filler for more than a few plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
After three games with 2, the dramatic arc seemed follow this pattern:

A. Tense: Should I mark a number now, or wait for one closer to the left?
B. Obvious: That 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 is precisely what I needed.
C. Do nothing: I really need a 12 or 2. No? Oh well.
C. Do nothing: I really need a 12 or 2. No? Oh well.
C. Do nothing: I really need a 12 or 2. No? Oh well.
C. Do nothing: I really need a 12 or 2. No? Oh well. Game's over.

In other words, anticlimactic. Other problems:

1. Locking a row didn't seem like a decision. If you get a 12 or 2, you either can't lock yet or you obviously should.
2. If a 12 or 2 comes up on the white dice, which row to lock is simply a calculation, not a risk-taking decision.
3. The risk-taking and tension didn't last the whole game. If you're behind on a row and the game is nearing a close, you can't elect to take a bigger risk to try to get a 12 or 2 to jump ahead of others.

To learn more about what simple dice games are capable of, I recommend Dice Games Properly Explained by Reiner Knizia.

Really simple dice game. It's fine, but in my opinion, nothing overly special. I think it would have been improved by having a communal board (with player tokens) instead of individual player sheets, so it would be easy to see the progress of the other players. For quick dice games, I'd rather play Can't Stop. I also think Rolling Japan is supposed to be better and despite it having no North American distribution at the moment, it would probably be better to PnP it or wait than picking up Qwixx.

I found this surprisingly fun for the push-your-luck aspect of selecting dice and for how you get to use dice on other players' turns, so you're constantly engaged. So, it's quick, keeps people engaged in the game and with each other, and the tension increases towards game end as everyone is trying to roll double 1s or 6s. A lot of fun packed into 20 minutes of minimal rules and components.

The game I play the most. A great filler. So easy to ge to the table, and the playing time is just perfect. Since it is a dice game, you are of course dependent on luck, but you have much more control than you would think after the first play. For instance, if you choose to cross out a number on another player's turn, you get fewer choices when it's your turn (where you HAVE to cross out at least one number). Every one I played with, loves it, and have bought it. That's a very good sign.

I really love this game. It is one of the best fillers available for a number of reasons. First is its length; although some 4-player games can run closer to 30 minutes, largely depending on if people are paying attention or not, my wife and I can knock out a game in 10-12 minutes tops. The next good thing about it though is that even when a game is on the long side, each player has to pay attention to every turn, to decide if they want to take a number or not, so it doesn't feel like it drags. The final thing I'll mention, which I was pleasantly surprised by, is the depth. Yes, it's a dice game so in theory every roll could be horrible, but that usually doesn't happen; if you're good with probability, and have a little luck, and if your opponents are the same, each game will be very close and, I've found, very satisfying. Highly recommend!

RATING: 6.5
Components: the dice I like
Complex: easy
Weight: light
Players: more than 2 so you can use more dice
Length: less than 30 mins
Mechanics: roll dice, select dice :)
Decisions: apparently only decide if you use dice or not, but you have more than that
Opinion: I liked it, small and fast game. You roll 6 dice (2 white and 1 on the colors of the game) and decide if you use them to score points. The point is that, once you start on one color, you cannot use the numbers on the left of that color (red and yellow go from low to high, and blue and green from high to low), so if you use a 7 red... you cannot use a 8 red anymore.
The player rolling the dice can use the sum of the 2 white dice, and 1 white with another color (if no number is used a minus mark), while the rest of the players can use the 2 white dice (this is why I prefer to play with more than 2 players, so more rolls are done, at least with the 2 white).
And you roll and tick numbers until someone gets 4 minus marks or 2 colors are finished, then everyone scores points depending on the ticks on each color and the minus marks (just a note that, to finish one color, you have to get the number on the left, and have at least 5 other numbers on that color).
Fast game to play, explain and start playing, and sum a bit, enough to be entertained during several minutes

Fantastic light game. Same ilk as Yahtzee but the probabilistic strategy is harder and it feels more like press-your-luck. Fun, easy to play. Plus, I can't avoid liking the triangular number scoring.

RATING: 7
Great as a convention filler; easy for someone to jump into, keeps you a little engaged on other people's turns, etc. I have yet to play much outside BGG.con.

Preferred variant: You take a misroll if you don't use a colored die on your turn, even if you do use the two white dice together. This raises the pressure a little and decreases the number of times that the active player just checks off the same number as everybody else and passes the dice.

RATING: 7
Nice filler with simple rules. It combines Bingo-ish  with push your luck sensations, so even non-gamers can relate and participate. The duration of 1 game is not that long, so expect a couple of games played back to back.

(Only played once, 4-player)

This game is boooooring.

I have seen it likened to Yahtzee, as in 'if you like Yahtzee you might like this'. I wouldn't have considered myself someone who particularly likes Yahtzee, having played Qwixx however, makes me really appreciate Yahtzee more. 
In Yahtzee there's choice and anticipation: you've decided what to go for and are hoping for the right dice-roll. In Qwixx there's none of that, you roll once and that's it. You get to choose a combination of dice, but it's not so much of a choice, more a default decision really.

What a good dice game! It's a favorite at home, we play it every time we can. Gameplay is really simple and fun, you can do things on other players' turns. Rules are straightforward, it plays really fast, so fast that you can easily play three or four games in a row.

It's the perfect filler!

Mindenki kap egy pontozólapot és egy tollat, amivel dobásaikat jelölik.  A lapon van négy színes sor. Ebből kettő, a sárga és a piros 2-től kezdve növekszik 12-ig, míg a másik kettő, a zöld és a kék 12-től kezdve csökken 2-ig. A jelölések balról
jobbra történnek, de nem kell számról számra haladni, több számot is ki lehet hagyni.
A játék nagyon egyszerű játékmenettel rendelkezik. Az aktív játékos dob a 4 db színes  és a 2 db fehér kockával. A két darab fehér kocka eredményét összeadjuk, ezt az eredményt nem csak az aktív játékos, hanem a többi játékos is bejelölheti a lapján bármelyik sorba, de ez nem kötelező. Ezen kívül az aktív játékos összeadhatja bármelyik fehér kocka értékét bármelyik színes kocka értékével, és annak a színnek megfelelő sorában bejelölheti. Ez sem kötelező, viszont ha az aktív játékos nem jelöli be sem a fehér kockákat, sem a fehér és valamelyik színes kocka összegét, akkor egy „Téves
dobás” hibát kell a lap alján jelölnie, ami a játék végén 5 pont levonást jelent. 

A pontokat annak megfelelően kapják meg, minél több x-et tudunk jelölni egy sorba. 

Sokan a kockapókerrel (Yatzee) hasonlítják össze. A kockapókernél 5 kockával dobunk, és csak a dobó
játékos jelölhet. De miután itt mindenki tud jelölni, ezért szórakoztatóbb közbe, de a kockapókernél több a választási lehetőség. Ez könnyedebb gyorsabb. Kezdő társasozókkal jó szórakozás lehet, de nálam nem éri el azt a szintet, amit egy SDJ jelöltől elvárnék.

This is a great little filler game, very portable, quick to play, and easy to learn. While I don't generally like randomness, especially with dice, there's enough strategy in when to use which dice rolls that there's a semblance of control and thought involved that I enjoy. Usually gets played a couple times back-to-back with novice and expert gamers alike.

Light dice rolling game in which the current player rolls two white dice and four differently colored dice.  Each color corresponds to a track on a score sheet.  Two tracks count up from 2 to 12 and two count down from 12 to 2.  Everybody at the table can mark off a number on one of the tracks based on what was rolled on the white dice.  The current player can also mark off a number based on matching up the corresponding color die with one of the white dice.  The current player must mark at least one thing off or take a -5 point penalty.  Once a box is marked off, you can't mark off anything in that row that's to the left of it.  You can only take the right-most column (2 or 12, depending on the color) when you have at least 5 boxes checked off for that color.  When you do, that row is blocked off for the rest of the game.  When two rows are blocked off, the game ends.  Triangular scoring (1/3/6/10/etc).

Fun light family game. It was better than expected. When I saw the box contents I thought I had made a mistake buying it. It only comes with 6 dice! But after reading the rules I saw that there was more than meet the eye. 

Qwixx is a simple but fun game, the rules can be explained under 2 minutes. The gameplay is around 20 minutes. It is a good game for casual gamers. You do have some decisions to make, but they are obvious most of the time. It has lots and lots of luck, but as the game is so light and quick I don’t mind.

Bottom line, a fun and quick game for the family. I already sold my copy as these days I prefer heavy games, but I won’t say no to a game of Qwixx. Filler material.

Qwixx is an excellent little dice game that can be played quickly and keeps everyone involved, even when they're not the ones rolling the dice.  This is no Yahtzee clone (as I assumed it would be) as it has quite a bit going for it in terms of decision making.  A very good game for what it is.  I think having everyone involved on every turn is what bumps the score up a bit more for me.

RATING: 5
Each turn you roll six dice - four colored and two white. You have a scoring pad in front of you that has two colors counting up from 2 to 12 and two colors counting down from 12 to 2. You check off boxes always going left to right and you can never go back. When you roll, you add the white dice and all players have an opportunity to check a box of any color that matches the value. Then the player whose turn it is can pair a colored die with either of the white dice to check off a box of that color/number combo. When 5 boxes in a row are checked, if you roll the last number in the line you can close off the row and remove the die. When two rows are closed the game ends. Players get points for each row depending on how many boxes are checked. Every turn where you couldn't check a box is -5 points.

It plays faster than Yahtzee.

Qwixx.   Well, the name says it all.  This is a brief, very lightly math oriented exercise, more than it is a game, in my opinion.

This, however, does not mean it isn't fun.  As a light filler and gateway "game" it really works-- and does lend itself to some tough decision making every now and again.  It has a good presentation and solid dice.  Perhaps most importantly, it feels familiar to most first-time players somehow, yet, is quite distinct insofar as its mechanic.  A nice trick.  

Finally, you really can't beat the small footprint and low price-point.  Solid.

RATING: 6
Such an easy game, such a short rule and we still managed to mess up the game end condition. The game ends when the second of four rows gets locked. We missed that a player only can lock a row when he crosses the last box (either on a 2 or a 12). Playing with this rule probably makes the game better. 
Still, from the 2012 short dice games, I prefer playing  [gameid=117942] or [gameid=118023] instead. Qwixx' principle of one roll for all players doesn't satisfy me. Having a bad roll when it's your turn is too decisive.

Petit filler familial très bon dans la catégorie ultra-léger. Comme le dirait le Magnet, un excellent jeu "de chalet". À jouer avec matante Solange, après une journée de ski, avec un verre de vin, au chalet. Bon remplacement à un Yum ou un Yatzee à quelqu'un qui ne connaît pas les jeux de société modernes et qui est allergique à autre chose que des dés à 6 faces ou au quatuor coeur-carreau-trèfle-pique. Le fait de pouvoir jouer les dés blancs pendant le tour des autres est minime mais suffisant pour nous garder intéressé constamment et éviter l'attente. Les décisions chance VS hasard sont correctes. Plus simple, plus accessible et moins long que Can't Stop. Je préfère Can't Stop, mais au chalet avec un verre de vin (ou plus), ce sera très bon. 6/10, bon mais seulement dans le contexte approprié.

所詮、ダイスの目次第、と思ってしまうのでゲームとして楽しめない自分がいる。
ダイスの目に対して今回は耐えようとか、今回は仕方ない、とか選択肢はあるのだが、再度プレイする気になれない。無機質なゲームな点が嫌い。無機質なゲームならば、数字をそろえるゲームでは「ラッキーナンバー」の方がすっきりしていて１０倍好き。

A kockapókert gyerekkoromban nagyon szerettem, de most már  nem igazán hoz lázba. Itt nincs újradobálás, csak ikszelgetni kell, nagyon kevés szabály van, gyorsan megtanulható, és gyorsan le is játszható. Nekem azért ez már picit kevés.

A decent quick dice rolling game that will always be better than Yahtzee in my opinion. Still just a simple dice luck game. Roll dice, assign colors to mark off a sum on one of the four color rows, then mark an additional mark off the sum if the active player. Score the most points to win.

This is a fine little dice chucking filler!  Plays quickly and you still get the groans over the numbers rolled...:-)  Roll 6 dice of which two are white and the other four are each a different color.  Everyone can use the number rolled on the white dice to mark off on their sheet and the active player can use a white die and colored die of their choice to mark another number off on their sheet.  Trick is that you must go in order when marking off numbers and you can't go back if you skip some in the sequence.  Two colors go forward and two go backward.  The more numbers in each color one has marked off, the greater the score.

In order to extend the longevity of the game and not have to print off more score sheets, I laminated five of the score sheets and put five short dry erase markers with an eraser on the end in the box.  Works perfectly!

RATING: 9.5
Once you know what you are doing the game is super simple. You have to make decisions about whether to keep particular combos or not and there are decisions each go. It's ok.

After a few plays this is a great game, there are decisions for make , it's light and small and is perfect for a restaurant or bar while waiting.

After 14 games, this is the perfect pub game. It does not matter that you could win if you roll perfectly. No one does roll perfectly. Its dice, it does not matter if you get beer on them, everyone is involved in every roll, its fun, there is banter when someone rolls something you don't want, good quick decisions one way or the other. Perfect.

BTW The Translated rules are really bad.
This game is really simple and is great but the  rules do not tell you what you are doing at the start. There should not be a learning curve for something like this. Once we know what we are doing we can explain this to people in a minute, but reading the rules it took about 10 minutes and some plays to figure out what it was on about. Far too over explained and explained in such a dry way.

On your turn roll all 6 dice. You must make 1 combination of 2 dice and mark that score on your pad. If you dont do that you have to take a 'miss' which counts -5 at the end. You can take first the score from the white dice and then optionally a combination of 1 white and 1 coloured die. You can use the white dice to mark off any colour, with the combination of 1 white and 1 coloured die you have to make on that colour. You must mark off from left to right so you cannot mark off to the left of a number you have already marked off.

When it isn;'t your turn you can use other players white dice ONLY to mark off numbers on your own sheet following hte same rules.

If you roll the last number on a row (eitehr a 2 or a 12 dependent on the colour) AND you have ALREADY marked off 5 in that row, you may mark of the last box for a bonus count AND remove the die of the colour you completed from the game stopping the other players from using that any more in the game. 

The game ends when either 2 rows have been locked OR someone has marked off 4 missed.

This is now our go to game at parties and Christmas. There's a little bit of skill and a little bit of luck. Enough so that no one minds losing, since they can blame the luck part, and anyone winning can claim they had the skill that round. It can be taught to anyone in a few minutes with a few dummy rolls, and is entertaining throughout the afternoon. We especially like the new dry erase version.

Quick and easy dice game but difficult to win! This one keeps Pickomino from our table... we laminated some sheets so we don't need to buy these booklets again and again... Note: the newer Deluxe version already contains these laminated sheets. The good thing about the game is the fact that there is no down time for the other players. Everyone may cross off a number during someone else's turn. One of our most played games! Still the best game in its genre.

Another light dice game that requires attention to probabilities, maximising certain rows for larger scores and some limited dice management.

This one is great though with games taking 5-15 minutes to play, hence the name, and all players have something to look for with each roll. 

Quixx also allows for some relatively quick endgame triggers, which can be pursued by the players if they feel they are in a winnign position. 

I rate this in the top echelon of quick dice rollers without theme.

This is my preferred alternative to Yahtzee.  It still involves rolling dice and crossing things off a score sheet.  But, it also includes some player interaction, and you are always part of the action, even when someone else is rolling.

A step up from Yahtzee with a nice mechanic with the white dice that keeps everyone involved during each player's turn.  

Nice magnetized flipbox and score sheets.  A good, light backpack game.

A simple dice game in Amigo card game size. No downtime because everyone acts on everyone's turn and there are no rerolls either.

RATING: 8
Speedy and very clever dice game in which players must tick off values in four sequences (2 to 12 in two colours, 12 to 2 in two other colours) in order to score. Once a value of the sequence has been ticked, earlier values in the sequences can't be ticked anymore. The more ticks in a single sequence, the higher the score (each successive tick means a higher increase as well).

Each round a player throws the dice, one in the colour of each sequence and two white ones: the sum of the whites CAN be used by all players and then the throwing player can also use one value out of combining a white die and a coloured one. If the throwing player ticks nothing there will be a penalty, otherwise players don't have to tick any value if they don't want to.

The resulting flexibility allows players to concentrate on sequences and leave out others, giving them some leeway if they don't want to rush things... nonetheless, this strategy can obviously backfire if one player wants to end up the game quickly for a low but sufficient score.

RATING: 8
This is a game that takes quite a few plays to appreciate. After the first game, we were like, that's it? It's solitaire and it's quite boring. But, we tried the ipad app a few more times and liked it much better. Absolutely not solitaire, as you have to watch closely what your opponent is doing. 
There are lots of interesting ideas here. 1. The fact that you close the row for EVERYBODY is very cool. 2. You can close it only after having five numbers in that row, so you can't just quickly finish the game at will for everybody else. 3. When you close a row it gives you an extra cross which incentivizes you to try that. 4. You can effectively skip your turn waiting for that perfect throw, especially if you're not the active player, but skip too many and you will be behind. 

The cons for me would be that the game suffers just a little bit from the runaway leader problem, in my opinion, and that it's a bit luck dependent (think Battle Line level of luck). 

Is it a game that you must have? I would say, no. But it's fun and short and pretty cutthroat, so my score reflects that.

[b]Qwixx[/b] was received in a trade (12/18/14)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]The definitive, quick dice filler and one I would recommend to anyone. It is the ultimate restaurant game since it doesn't take up any room, it plays quickly and you're engaged on everyone's turn. We've also played this a lot when we only have 10 minutes and want to get a game in. For some this will be heresy (well at least Mat), but this is the game Yahtzee has always wanted to be. There are just enough decisions in Qwixx to make it feel more like a game instead of an activity (see Yahtzee). Gamewright did a great job producing this game, it's small and compact making it easy to travel with. 

I know a lot of people will not agree, but I think Qwixx deserved to win the Speil Des Jahres. Qwixx is an excellent family game that anyone can learn and play within minutes.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Quick dice filler that you can play anywhere, with anyone.
- Great twist on the standard dice rolling game, the scoring adds some decisions and tension to the game.
- For such a simple game it is quite fun.

This is a fun filler that I may keep in my car to play when we are out at a restaurant or cafe. The choices are not that difficult, but there is some tension in the decisions you have to make. You need to balance taking white dice when it is not your turn with possibly limiting the rolls that will help you when you have to take dice on your turn or suffer a -5 penalty.[/i]

Excellent and clever dice game! This game comes with a pad of paper, dice and rules. If you can laminate a few score sheets, one for each of 5 players and use dry erase pens, the game should last a very long time.

On a players turn, they roll the dice. All players can choose to keep the roll on the white dice. But the active player may keep the white dice roll or keep a colored die roll. Players are trying to collect the most numbers of each color (red, blue, green and yellow) before one color of die is closed out. This happens when someone has collected a 6th die roll in a color and says he is closing out the die. Fun game!

RATING: 8
This is a future classic and potential cross-over hit. While gamers like theme the general public don't seem to so much; my family, for example, would much rather play a complicated new game with a standard pack of playing cards than try to wrap their heads round the brain-melting complexity of King if Tokyo.

Qwixx uses standard D6 and set of rules that is actually easier than Yahtzee; so nothing here that will stress out a delicate muggle. It plays quickly and gets pretty tense at the end as your options start to run out.

A really elegant little game and lots of fun.

Further thoughts: this keeps getting better. Plays very differently with higher player counts. The very slow accumulation which works so well with 2 players will leave you last with 5 or 6. Great fun. Only thing is a bit of a lack of interaction.

Another of my favorite games. If you're sensing a theme, there is one: I don't like long, agonizing turns for players. I don't mind strategy; I just don't want to watch you make your decisions. And Qwixx has a low amount of that, thank God. Fun, short, but very fun and engaging. Another perfect, pocket-sized game that can be played in under fifteen minutes. A great antidote to break up the tension after a heavy Euro.

What a pleasant little game for only 6 dice and a scoresheet. I'm not sure there's enough race-type tension in the game for it to be lastingly good, nor is there significant groan/cheer factor given all dice affect all players, but there's a nice decision to make on many turns about whether to skip spaces or take the hit. And there's pleasure when the dice roll perfectly and you can tick off a space without missing a space. In effect, it hits that bingo itch but includes decision making. A nice filler that'll hit the table for a while.

Qwixx is a filler dice game in which players are trying to score runs of dice results. Each scoresheet has four tracks, with the red and yellow tracks going from 1 to 12, and the green and blue tracks going from 12 to 1. On a player's turn, he will roll six dice--four colored dice and two neutral dice. Players can mark the sum of the neutral dice on one of their tracks, provided that no spaces after that value have already been marked. The rolling player can either take the neutral dice value, or use one of the colored dice with a neutral die to mark the appropriate box, following those same rules. However, if the rolling player can do neither he takes a penalty. Players score triangularly for the number of boxes marked in each track. There really aren't a ton of decisions to be made in this game, but as a super-quick filler there are worse options.

It's a good filler of using dice as wild and for one color to mark off in order.  It's easy and quick to play with some press-your-luck towards later rounds to avoid negative numbers.

Qwixx is everything a dice filler should be - short, tactical, satisfying, and containing a touch of press-your-luck. All players are involved on every turn, so the game has nearly zero downtime. This will be a perfect game to introduce to non-gamers and will serve as a filler for the gamer folk.

Uses a shut-the-box mechanic but adds more complexity, more options and played interaction.  Very simple to learn and play however, it is enjoyable as a filler game.  Games last 10 to 15 minutes which is perfect for this type of game.  This is a game of chance so there is luck involved when going for it on a color to close it out but this is part of the charm of the game.  there may be a perfect strategy to play but I think it will take many many plays to figure it out.  It doesn't look like much and is theme-less but it is good for what it is.

It is such a small game but it was a blast with everyone I played so far! Always (I repeat: always) we had another play right after. It's very quick but allows more tactical moves than you would expect. Of course it is based on luck but that is what makes a lot of fun. Underestimated game that could become a classical starter.

I am dumbstruck that this was nominated for SdJ. Take Yatzee, dumb it down, then dumb it down another notch and you have Qwixx. Decisions are obvious. Decisions are boring. Tension is nil. (Plus, strangely, players don't even get the same number of turns.) The only entertainment is in criticising and guessing what on earth people find appealing about this game. If you want a good dice game then try Mr. Knizia's Heckmeck am Bratwurmeck, or Can't Stop, or ...

Quick, easy-to-pick-up game. Especially with the alternative scoring systems available to this game, it's up there as an easy to learn, fun to play and with enough variables to really come up with a tactical approach.

RATING: 7.5
Quick filler. Everybody takes turn rolling dice: four colored dice and two clear. You add up the two clear dice and decide if you want to check off a box on your score sheet matching that sum: your sheet has four rows in each color, two rows ascend from 2 through 12, and two descend. You cannot mark off a box if there are any boxes to the right already marked on that row. The roller may additionally combine a colored die with a clear to mark off a box in that color's row. If the roller does not mark off any boxes, s/he loses 5 points. You can't mark off the last column unless you already have at least five marks in that row. Doing so gets you an additional mark, and locks that color for ALL PLAYERS. The game continues until two rows/colors are locked or someone takes their fourth -5. At the end, each row scores points logarithmically according to the number of marks. Fine and short game.

UPDATE: I picked up the "deluxe" edition and I do not recommend it. Yes, it comes with laminated score sheets, dry erase markers, and a felt covering on the inside box top (for rolling dice onto). However, it only supports four players, it does not come with a wiping cloth, and without one it's impossible to completely clean the score sheets.

Nifty filler with interesting manipulation of your 4 tracks to maximize your options and manage risk with dice rolls a la Catan, Machi Koro.

Isn't there a first-player advantage the game is ignoring? And the simultaneity (or not) of crossing numbers out might matter.

Played this in the aftermath of GF's birthday. Was fun. Won't miss it never being played again. Our reaction at 3am was "hey it's like bingo" "but you have to think!"

The goal of the game is to fill the most boxes you can, until two rows are filled - so you balance between risk taking, slow building, manageing the odds of all the rows and occasionally looking at what other people are doing. It works, is kinda amusing, but as everybody does their own thing (okay not entirely, but) it seems best as a time waster (airplane, travel, ...)

RATING: 7
Played once with 4P. Players roll dice during their turn, then cross off combinations from their scoresheet. There are two twists: the first is that there is an order in which numbers can be cross off, and players can't turn back to cross off previous numbers. Secondly, players can use combinations rolled during other players' turns. This comes off a fancier, slightly more complex version of Can't Stop. It's just a lot of luck and dice-rolling, but it's still a nice, fluffy filler.

Very good for what it is. It is quick, fast, and easy to learn. It is not deep, there is a decent ammount of decision making (for the type of game this is! And for its 10 minute time frame!), but more of the push-your-luck-kind than strategic planning.
It plays great with mixed groups, providing just enough to keep gamers interested and little enough to not overwhelm non-gamers. *But* it can confuse people who are very easily confused.
On the down-side, some people (especially old people, it seems) seem to find the scoring confusing and the yellow die is very hard to read.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Sounds like a slightly heavier descendant of Can't Stop, which sounds good. Plays up to 5 as well.

Played it with my 8yo daughter and then since then with wife and friend. I like this quite a bit. I'll call it a super filler - everyone is engaged on every turn, some mathy decisions to make as well as risk. A great little dice game.

Kipróbálhattam a harmadik Év Játéka jelöltet. Nos, ha az Augustusnál a "csodálatomat" fejeztem ki, hogy lehet ilyen játék jelölt, akkor ide nehéz lesz jelzőket találni. Ezek után nem lepődnék meg, ha a Zombie Dice is jelölt lenne valamikor. Hihetetlen egyszerű kockajáték a Qwixx. Úgy gondolom majdnem triviális mit csinálok a kidobott kockáimmal, nagy döntési helyzet nem sok van. Tiszta szerencse. Témája sincs, illetve otthon is legyártható. Ha már pénzt kérnek érte illetve volna mondjuk műanyag fordítgatós pontozót készíteni hozzá. Az, hogy jobb-e mondjuk a Can't Stopnál azért nehéz megítélnem, mert már rég játszottam amazzal.

This is a fun little push-your-luck dice game, but it's hard to believe it was nominated for the SdJ! It only takes about 10 minutes, though, so it's benign enough I guess.

[b]--- Rules Summary ---[/b]
There are 2 white dice, and 4 colored dice (red, yellow, green, blue). Players each have a score sheet with one row for each colored die, with boxes numbered 2 -> 12 or 12 -> 2 (and one extra box on the right, with a Lock).

[u]Your Turn[/u]
- Roll all dice and:
1. Announce the sum of the white dice. ALL players [i]may[/i] use this number on any colored row of their score sheet.
2. Sum ONE colored die and ONE white die: YOU may use this number on the row matching the colored die.
- If you don't like either sum, check one of your 4 Penalty Boxes instead.
- Pass the dice to the left.

To use a number, a player checks the box for its number ... but ONLY if no box in that row further to the left has been checked. For example, in a row 2 -> 12, if the 5 has been checked then 2-4 are off limits.

Once a player has at least 5 boxes checked in a row, may Lock the row: after this round, that colored die is removed from the game.

[u]End of Game[/u]
The game ends when any 2 colors have been locked, or if a player has marked all 4 Penalty Boxes. 
- Each player counts the number of checks per row (including the Lock) and scores VP according to a VP table ... more checks = more points.
- Subtract 5VP per checked Penalty Box
Highest VP wins!

[NSV 2012 edition] {Abstract; dice; scalable} Qwixx is a short dice filler: light weight and short.  Luck driven, but fun.  This game is not totally luck drive because there are a few dice rolls.

Player interaction comes from closing down colour rows.

Quick and simple dice rolling game. Each turn the player rolls six dice, four coloured and two white. Each player then has the option of crossing off a number on one of their four rows using the total of the two white dice. The player who rolled can then also add one of the white dice to one of the coloured dice to cross of a number on that specific colours row. The only rule in regards to crossing off a number is that it can never be to the right of an already crossed off number. The object is to cross off as many numbers in a row as possible and victory points are awarded for achieving this. Despite its simplicity there's a bit more to 'Qwixx' than meets the eye, especially when considering when to use the white dice to cross of a number. As with all dice rolling games, there's a lot of luck involved but that seems to add to the enjoyment of this game rather than detract from it.

Print-and-play version.

For such a simple system, with easy rules, this game plays out very interesting. I enjoy the decisions a lot more than I thought I would at first. The more I play the more I realize there is to ponder as you decide whether or not to cross off those numbers. It's a press-your-luck mechanic that feels different. So that's something, right?

It's a keeper. But only as a filler for the right crowd. It also works great for travel with a bigger group. You can pull it out waiting at a bus station, on a train, in a park, etc.

Simple little Yahtzee style dice game with a few decisions to be made. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
You probably already own this game if you have a set of multi-colored dice.  You only need red, yellow, blue, green and two white dice.  Write the colors on a sheet with red and yellow followed by 2 through 12 and blue and green followed by 12 through 2.  On your turn you roll the dice.  Everyone can use the two white dice (if they want) and only the active player can take a colored dice and one of the white dice.  You add the two dice and scratch off one of the numbers on your list.  White dice can be any color.  Once you scratch off a number you can no longer scratch off anything to it's left.  The more numbers you scratch off the higher your score (you'll need a scoring chart), and after you scratch five off you can scratch off the rightmost number to lock that color, no one can score it again.  If the active player can't, or won't take dice they lose five points and get a mark.  If two dice are locked or anybody gets four marks, the game is over.  

There's more thought involved than yahtzee for example, but a lot of it comes down to getting the right dice.

Qwixx is a very fun, fast dice game that works perfectly for a light filler. There's not too much strategy behind it, you just have to understand basic probability and be able to recognize a good roll or not. But there is enough depth to keep you thinking the entire game, and even though it's dice, very rarely do you get a roll that absolutely sucks. The game really shines however in that all players are engaged every roll, so there's no down-time where people are sitting around waiting for their turn. Definitely one to pull out for a few minutes between heavy games, or play with a group of non-gamers to whet their appetites. Excellent game!

I seriously don't understand how this stands at 6.5, let alone got a nomination for SdJ. There is a great definition for euro vs ameritrash that equates euro with careful planning and ameritrash with high drama. Qwixx has neither.

One of the best light dice fillers I have played in a long time. After being disappointed by both Martian Dice and Las Vegas I lost my interest in the "genre". But this I like! The biggest advantage that Qwixx has over its competitors, is that it has less downtime. It manages this by (1) making each player roll the dice only once and (2) making each roll interesting for all players. Very simple, and not unlike a dice version of Lost Cities, but it is hard to put this game down after one play. The family loves it.

Grabbed this as an add-on item when I was getting some other items from Amazon last week. I am always looking for short warm-up games to keep handy for game nights, and it immediately fit the bill! It was so fun, we played it twice and almost played it again, but we had other games to get to. Simple but with a touch of strategy to keep it interesting. Good travel/pub game!

Terrific dice game that has everything going for it.  It's quick, compact, easy to learn & most importantly fun.  I like how everyone stays involved even when it is not their turn.  The components and packaging are superb (Gamewright edition).  The dice are nice and colorful.  As are the score sheets.  The magnetic box is a nice touch.  The rules are well written with many play examples.  Winner.

Egyzseru kockajatek, ahol 4 szinkodos sorban gyujtunk 2d6 eredmenyeket. Mindenki X-elhet egyet a ket feher kocka eredmenye szerint, az epp soron levo jatekos ezen felul kombinalhat egy feheret a negy szines kocka egyikevel. A trukk, hogy 2 sorban novekvo, 2-ben csokkeno sorrendben vannak a szamok es ha kihagyunk valamit, kesobb mar nem X-elhetjuk. Megis megeri sietni, mert aki a szesoertekkel elsokent fejezi be a sort, az bonuszt kap es ki is veszi az adott szint a jatekbol.

Commented after the first play, lots of us were newbies. Quite simple, but yet tactic game. I'd like to try this again.

Tried this again after a year later. First we played with wrong rules and started from the beginning. We had the rules correct now, but the wrongly played play affected our style. This combined with the hurry meant, that the game was not enjoyable as it could have been. Dropped the rating from 7 to 6.

Two new plays, very fast plays this time. Nice filler, when everyone knows the rules and doesn't think too much, but I don't think I will suggest this game.

I like approachable dice games with enough going on to make it more about making decisions than it is about getting the right roll, and Qwixx is a game that fits that category.  Typically, a bad die roll for you is a bad die roll for everyone, since you share part of your roll each turn with everyone else in the game, but choosing when to lock yourself in for a particular color is a neat tension.  It might not prove to be a lasting game (I suspect that the game will still go to the players who get that perfect roll that they don't need to share on their own turn), but in the meantime, I'm intrigued.

oh pleaase, don't tell me this is gonna win the SdJ! it's an innocent shallow dice game that can give you a small amount of fun but not more. There are, it's true, some moments when you have to take interesting decisions, but the game is as repetitive as it can be. Also, the number of situations you can face seem really low. Compare it to Wurfel Bingo, this is a very pale replica.
Besides, i never like very much the fact that you have to use a block of pre-printed sheets to play a game and then you have to rely on your copies.
Many many more games where worthier to be nominated for SdJ

Ice cold German design proffers tight numberyness. This type of design appeals greatly to me. I'd also like to add Rolling Japan to the collection as it's the same game with groovy maps.

2016: I think Cathala's excellent looking Dice Stars is the one to get next - 'Qwixx with theme'

2017: The world's gone notepad mad, with Noch Mal, Dice Stars and many more spewing forth from the big german pubs. Don't they know those little pads give us nightmares when running low?

Feels to me like Lost Cities the dice game without any theme and lighter decisions. 

It's simple (light), quick,  fun and engaging. 
Love the idea of using the white dice in each round for each player, this keeps you involved. Love also that in almost each turn you have a decision to make even if not every decision is that important or difficult.

I'm not sure that I would live my life over again, but I would nearly always play Qwixx.  That's got to count for something.

[i]Update[/i]:

A warning to my opponents of yore: Of the 20 times that I've played, only the last two were 100% according to the rules.  I was horribly mis-taught my first game, and I then went on to repeatedly teach the game incorrectly - with my explanations periodically getting more accurate, but never (until today) fully correct.

Mental scarring aside, this doesn't change my rating.  Quixx is a simple but ingenious design that should come with ten times as many score sheets.  It deserves to be played frequently and with gusto, and always at least twice in a row.

6.5 after 3 plays

A risk-reward balancing game that is easy to learn. Players need to watch one another's developments down each colour path as they can be locked out. At the same time, players need to weigh up the opportunity costs of jumping ahead too quickly and missing scoring opportunities. The late game may be a little luck-driven.

A nice quick dice filler.  More interaction and less down time than the likes of Yatzee or Can't Stop... but I can't shake the feeling that those games are a bit more exciting to play.  That being said there are clearly more interesting and regular decisions in Qwixx so there is a good chance I would usually play it before those others, especially with more than 2 players!

Four colored and two white dice. A scoresheet and a pen. That’s all there is inside this game. O, and a small sheet with the rules on it. Can a game with such a small amount of components be any fun at all? The answer is yes, it can be a lot of fun. Even when the rules are very simple, they will cause that you have to make some tough decisions. This is a filler-family-game like it’s meant to be. Pure fun. It also scales very well with any amount of players.

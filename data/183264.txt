Very light but cute, family weight push your luck game. Lots of luck with the dice, but still interesting choices to make with how many dice you roll, which effects how many tokens you get.

RATING: 7.6
A simple push your luck game of dice chucking and sending your team of terrified investigators through a haunted mansion with excellent artwork. Definitely keep the 'Friend' die out if you're playing with all adults or gamers, and use it with young ones, it takes away some of the few decisions that are here, leaving you with only the number of allotted dice you roll for a move.

This would be good for kids, but too simple for adults.  Some nice ideas, but the decision to push-your-luck never seems to create much tension as choosing to roll 4 dice gives you a pretty good chance to make your number and continue to collect "Spookies".

I love Haba games. They make great kids games and I had high hopes for this. It looks really cute and I thought it would offer some interesting risk/reward decisions. The game looked to have a lot of potential. I was excited about it but I'm quite disappointed.

This game is broken. My 7 year old exploited it. It's possible we have misinterpreted the rules, but we have tried multiple interpretations of the rules and all of them leave the game broken or at best no fun at all.

The brokenness: On our turn, we just roll four dice to climb all the way to the top of the house where we sit and continue to roll all four dice until we finally fail to roll a 12 and it usually takes a while to fail. We net many "spookies" and then pay the paltry fine of a couple of spookies once we finally fail to the roll a 12 while at in the attic. In a typical game, the winner was decided before it got back to the person that went first. My 5 an 7 year boys quickly realized this game is broke.

We experimented with other interpretations of the rules and even with house rules, but finally said, we shouldn't have to fiddle with a game this much to get it to work and we gave up on it.

If I'm missing something, please leave a comment and I'd be totally willing to change my rating.

Scccouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuubidoubid ou !!!!!!!! Oui, OK, je viens de fêter mes 38 ans et c'est un dessin animé de mon époque. Scoubidou, c'est un chien, et il a un copain, c'est Sammy et ils n'ont peur de rien ... tant qu'il n'y a pas un fantôme dans les environs. Spookies, c'est grosso modo la même chose. Avec votre chien Bonflair et ses 4 amis, tentez d'arriver en haut de la maison hantée pour gagner des jetons fantômes sans avoir peur. C'est du jeu familial, c'est du stop-ou-encore. C'est fun. Et pour de vrai, ça ne fait pas peur. Hey, qui a fait du bruit ? C'est toi, Sammy?

Even lighter than Can't Stop, but shares the same stripped down push-your-luck fun. At some point in every game, someone will always yell, "NO!!! I knew I shouldn't have rolled again!"

RATING: 6
I very much like the simplicity of this game. It plays fast, but has a lot of tension. The fact that the chips come with a very wide range in points, and of course the fact that rolling dice is the only mechanism, the luck factor is quite high. But that is ok for such a game. This is a push your luck game that has a couple of innovations. When you fail, you need to put won chips on the game board, which again other players may pick up. In our three games so far, this rule makes the game very exciting, and the leader is changing all the time. Also, I like that you for each step up, you may decide how many dice you should use. The fewer dice, the less chance of success, but the upside is higher if you succeed. A lot of fun, and a little deeper than it might appear at the first glance of it. I would never say no to play this game as a filler. Glad I'm having it in my collection.

The haunted house theme, the custom dice, the press-your-luck gameplay, it all adds up to another solid and worthy addition to Haba's library.  Collecting those little chits and turning them over in the end to see who won is fun.  Failing your roll and leaving chits on a space then makes that space all the more valuable, adding another layer of luck-pressing.

Le visuel est attractif, mais la mécanique (choix du nombre de dés pour gagner des jetons / addition des 2 valeurs maximales) nuit à l'immersion et rend le jeu ennuyant.

Really didn't like this one. It was really nice to look at, but it was not as accessible or intuitive as it should have been. It was easy and light, but I was constantly checking about dropping and picking up tiles when you bust or land on them. It was annoying and tedious. Disappointing.

Entertaining little push-your-luck game for kids. The ability to use a different number of dice to adjust the probabilities is a nice touch. The new Haba manuals are exceptional.

Fun dice-rolling, push-your-luck game with the kids (5 and 7).  Nice art.  Impeccable Haba components.

I play with two girls, and the five playing pieces include three boys, one girl, and a dog.  C'mon Haba.  You can do better than that.

[b]Spookies[/b] was traded away in a math trade 5/1/16. (Received Sticheln)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6/8 -> 4)[/COLOR]

[i]Another swing and miss. My family really enjoyed this game out of the gate and then... nothing, it just sat on our shelf collecting dust. I tried to get it back out, but no one was interested. A year ago I wrote that it would be easy to burn out on playing and we did. We also began to notice was that the luck of drawing the point tokens could really influence the game. You could end up getting the majority of tokens, but if they were mostly 1's and 2's you could lose to someone who got lucky and drew all the 5's. Things also fizzled out as you played since getting to the really high floors was extremely difficult so you normally wouldn't push your luck and instead just wait for your next turn and try moving up again without fear of a penalty.

Spookies failed to capture that one more roll mentality unlike Can't Stop which excels in that regard. In the end there just wasn't enough there to hold our interest so it has since been traded.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great artwork and components that are cartoony and fun. I like the theme chosen for the game (a haunted house with a Scooby Doo feel to it).
- A family friendly push your luck game, my wife and kids love it and even my 6 yo can play with a little bit of help.
- Simple ruleset, but there are decisions to make since you choose the amount of dice to roll knowing that fewer dice means a higher reward. Of course the really juicy rewards are high up so you could roll lots of dice trying to get up high before really pushing your luck (no matter how many dice you roll you always use the two highest).
- I think this will be fun to bring out once and a while, if played too many times in a row I could see getting burnt out on it. 
- Spookies is a great compliment to Incan Gold in our collection since both games use different mechanics and play out quite differently even though they are both push your luck games.
- I prefer Spookies over other push your luck dice games I've played (which include: Can't Stop, Excape and Pickomino).

Overall I think this is a very good light, family weight push your luck dice game. Personally my favorite is still Diamant/Incan Gold, but I'm happy to have Spookies in our collection.[/i]

A push your luck game of kids and a dog trying to sneak into a haunted house. How far can they make it before they get too scared and have to leave.
The kids will be trying to make it to higher and higher floors by rolling a number on their die or dice that is equal too or greater than the next floor in the house.
But no matter how many dice you roll, you take the sum of the best 2 dice.

On your turn you roll a die which will show which kid or dog you may move. Then you choose how many dice you would like to roll (One, two or three dice).
The rewards are greater if you choose less dice.

The rewards are in the form of Spookie tokens. Little tokens with a ghost on one side and a number of points on the other.
If a player pushes their luck too far and doesn't roll high enough, then that character is sent back a level.
Players can push their way higher and higher in the house and gathering spookie tokens from each floor they pass by and land on.
You may never look at the points however, not until the game is over.
You never really no if you should push for more spookies or not.

Once the tokens are all taken, the game ends and you finally reveal the tokens and count up points.

Rating this as a game for very young children. Playing it with my daughter who is 4. She can follow the rules but can't really grasp the strategy such as it is, which is to be expected. She seems to enjoy rolling the dice and counting up the score though. I suspect it probably gets better with more players.

This is off course very, very light and very luck dependent, but as it is press-your-luck, something I like very much, and it doesn't take long to play, so I'll gladly play this again.

RATING: 6
First improv session with my 5yo: Understood most aspects of the game, rolling for which character, counting die pips, following payout chart and recognizing if roll is higher than printed floor number. 
The concept I had to drop was counting only the highest 2 dice, so allowed to count all rolled; and there was growing intolerance to waiting as turns became bloated, but the biggest resistance was giving up ghosts when failing the roll target.
Thankfully there is a strong enough narrative for him to act out on his own, so not a total waste of money....

Based on reports of people who have played Can't Stop this feels like a diluted version of it. 

Firstly - it's about collecting points and points come in face down tokens (value 1,2,3,5!). So just here everything is diluted and the objective made less of focus of a game - I mean we're getting higher and higher up the spooky mansion, but doesn't really matter how high you get, but how much points you end up with. You can chose how much you risk, so never a lot. Failing isn't that costly - costs some tokens, but not many. 

So despite the nice theme and accessibility the game just lacks the tension and excitement such games should have. So much is just random instead of being rewarded for pulling off big risks.  

EDIT: Down to 1.0 because of the crime of diluting risk taking from a risk taking game. WHY?

Spookies is the kind of game that comes along and puts a smile on my face. Why? Because it’s easy to learn, easy to teach, plays quickly, and most importantly, is a lot of FUN. Make no mistake, Spookies is a dice-rolling, push-your-luck game that involves A LOT of luck, but that’s okay because it’s meant to be a light-hearted experience and games only last 15-20 minutes. I like the dual nature of the push-your-luck component in that the choice to continue involves both how many dice to use and how high to attempt to climb through the house. There is also the higher risk associated with failing in that the progress gained during the turn can be lost as well as a penalty of leaving behind some scoring chips if the failure is less than the current level. The double push-your-luck and extra risk associated with failing turn this light game into something a bit deeper, but not a game that requires too much thought that it would slow down turns. I also like that everybody has a chance to win due to the hidden score system and range of point values on the chips. Overall, Spookies is an engaging and fun game that’s great for friends and family or as a quick escape between heavier games.

Excellent push your luck dice game geared towards kids, but entertains adults, too. Full of a little angst and hopefully good for teaching them to take some risks. Hidden scoring keeps leader unknown - though the more VP tokens you collect, the more chance everyone knows you have.

tl;dr: fine family game, but with a high dose of luck

A push your luck game. Roll the die, move the dude up in the house to score points. Push your luck and fail to move, lose some points. Yes, very basic, very simple, very family friendly. It's fine, it works well, it's not unenjoyable, but for the average strategy gamer, this will probably be a bit too basic.

I've played this several times with my kids and their friends, and have only had one game that seemed fun & exciting. The rest of the time, especially with kids who have played it previously, it seems formulaic. The kids all gravitate to a predictable style of play, which makes the game feel exclusively about luck and out of anyone's control. 

It's more fun with more players, since more chips get left behind on the board, which can shake up the formula a bit.

RATING: 4
This is kind of Can't Stop light with a bit of a theme.  My kids were a bit too young to understand the risk/reward of rolling more or less dice and were really upset when they couldn't count all the pips on all their dice... so that 8+ is probably a pretty good guideline.  I would try this again with my older daughter if she was interested but there wasn't enough here to interest me with other adult gamers who have a full understanding of dice probabilities.

I knew this was like Age of Steam and I had to get my arm twisted to play it.
And I disliked it just like AoS.
Incredibly dry.  Zero fun. A brain-burner.
The best thing about the game was moving the train-shaped turn marker. Luckily I was sat at that corner of the board so I got to do that 6 times.
It took nearly 4 hours to play (5 players) but no-one seemed to be taking too long to take their turns.  A large amount of downtime, but arguably you need it to think about your next turn.
Life is too short to play games like this.
And this is when I won.

RATING: 8
Despite all the controversy and rubbish written here on the Geek, I still see this as another variation on AoS and thus I love it. Crikey, there are lots of AoS maps out there that change the base rules far more than Steam does so why get so upset by it. As such, I refer you to Age of Steam for my comments

RATING: 3
An econ train game where the movement of goods functions in the polar opposite from how I see it logically playing out (where as you want to move them to the nearest port of business) in that you move goods the most inefficient chain possible to score the most points (compared to Indonesia where you pay per hop which makes sense). In that regard, my plays always felt sort of backwards in the analysis; I want track to go lots of places, but I don't want to move the goods there easily (but I do want to move the goods). An interesting puzzle, but not one that really holds my attention compared to other econ games. The digital version doesn't hold my attention after 9 or 10 plays, and plays in a fraction of the time as the cardboard copy...

A caveat: rating is for the "basic" game, which I think is marginally better than the original age of steam. However, "standard" steam is a significant step down, despite the near elimination of luck from the game - urbanisation is just too powerful.

This is an interesting take on the Age of Steam idea. Personally, I don't mind it, though I can easily see how very hard-core AoS players will despise the "resources from heaven" abundance which is lacking in its economically brutal counterpart.

1 play / 5 players

LIKE: Good decisions on every turn. Role selection tied to turn order is interesting.
DISLIKE: Cutthroat and sometimes brutal, but not an unforgiving game. Poor planning can lead to a quick loss. 

OVERALL: I lost terribly by getting blocked and not having a backup plan. That aside, the game is tense and thoughtful. Plays relatively quick (2-3h?) for an involved train game. Something to play occasionally, but not an everyday game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An incredibly tight, well designed game where every decision seems important. Very thinky and surprisingly only slightly mathy (which is a blessing for me). The strategy is deep and cut throat and there's zero luck involved. I agree with others - the basic game is wonderfully light in rules and plenty engaging even for the most experienced gamer. Another game that deserves the accolades.

Grande Wallace. Sólo una partida. Hay que jugar más para valorarlo. Buenas y variadas estrategias. Es bastante funde-mentes si es de los primeros juegos de este tipo que juegas, pero las reglas son claras y sencillas. Se puede adaptar para jugar al Age of Steam, que es casi el mismo juego. Y también con variedad de objetivos y componentes más bonitos, aunque un puntito menos duro está el Railroad Tycoon. Wallace exprimió bien toda su idea... jeje

Better than Age of Steam (which is not a bad game either...) for the following reasons:
1) Adapts to less experienced players as well
2) Looks nicer

To my big surprise I sold this in an auction. Might be that I'll regret it later, but at this point of my life I just felt like getting rid of games that haven't seen any or very little play in the past 3-4 years. 

With Steam I guess the reason was that, unless you played regularly, you need to reread the rules everytime you play. This in turn, decreases the chances of Steam finding its way onto the table. This is essentially the same problem I was experiencing with Brass, which is another Wallace game btw. If I only had more space to store my games...

Major improvement on the previous version. No complicated goods charts, no bidding for turn order, better balanced roles.
When it is released I'm sure the die hard fans will hate it but don't listen to them, all the fun bits are here without all the cruft.
I'm not a wallace fan but this was genuinely *fun*. The backwards (and *forwards* for 2nd ed fans) compatibility is a great concession and for once I might choose AoS over RRT if offered the choice. Now please please please hire an artist to do some prettier maps & markers!

Lo mejor de Wallace y uno de los mejores juegos de gestión y económicos que puedes jugar. Se trata de un simulador económico de trenes con muchísimas decisiones difíciles que tomar mientras construyes tu red, transportas mercancias, ayudas a desarrollar ciudades y pueblos, emites acciones y pagas a tus acreedores...
Se juega mejor que su predecesor, Age of Steam, y tiene componentes buenos y útiles (y aunque no trae los trenecitos de plástico de otros juegos eso no influye!). Además el juego viene con dos mapas y dos modos de juego, el básico y el estandard.
--------------------------------------------------
Best of Wallace's, and one of the best management or economic games you can play. Economic and train simulation with lots of hard choices to make: building up your railroad, delivering goods, developing cities and towns, issuing shares and paying back your creditors...
It has better gameplay than its predeccessor, Age of Steam, with nice and useful components (though it doesn't have those nice little plastic trains, this doesn't affect the gameplay). Also the game comes with two maps and two game modes, one basic and the other the standard one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Steam in its basic form is the excellent train game that combines all the good elements of Age of Steam and overcomes all the bits that don't work quite so well in Age of Steam. 

For example: the replenishment of resources to a city can now arrive in a package with some choices and not disrupt the game with luck; the turn order is predefined by previous choices rather than a bidding war; and you take loans out when you need then rather than planning for a potential eventuality. And all this works to streamline the game and make an already good game even more playable. Magnificent.

RATING: 8
Age of Steam Redux.  Not having played the original AoS yet, I can't compare the two.  What I can say is that Steam plays quickly and smoothly.  I hear it's less painful and more forgiving than AoS, not to mention faster.

I enjoyed it and would gladly play again.  An excellent train game.  By all means, give Steam a shot.

EDIT:  Years later and with another play under my belt, I can see the correlations in Steam with Railways of the World and, to a much lesser extent, with 18xx games.  Steam is very much a euro-styled implementation of the Railways games (which are introductory towards 18xx).

My biggest issue with Steam is how I tend to run low on deliverables at the end of the game.  It's not super critical, but it's tight enough that I dislike the squeeze.

So far I have only played once, the base game with 3 players. It was in my opinion worse than Railroad Tycoon or Rails of Europe, and significantly worse than Age of Steam. Money was too easy, for example pretty much every player had level 6 engines around turn 6. Probably and hopefully the standard game is better.

Great game, I think I liked it over Railways of the World, the only thing I like more in Railways of the World is the economy mechanics of getting an action ticket, but in all other aspects, Steam seems more well made. I like this Pick and Delivery mechanics, very clever.

I've never played Age of Steam, and I have no train game background.  I've only played this once, and it was engaging; I'd certainly play it again.  I can see how a more savage version (nastier about loans) could make things a bit more enjoyable; also how it might just make things more tedious.  I'd be up for a game of Age of Steam to see where it ends up for me.

What seems a relatively simple train game soon becomes a real brain burner as the options are taken away from you by your rivals.

This is the best incarnation of this series. Better than Age of Steam, better than RRT.

The base game makes for a very nice streamlined version - money isn't so brutally tight, but positioning and timing are still just as important.

And the standard game's good too though I think I prefer base now.

Excellent game!

I've tested it with two different gaming groups. One that expected it to be RRT and was disappointed before it started. And one that like Eurogames, and liked it very much.

This is far more competitive than RailRoad Tycoon, but still less "annoying" than Chicago Express. I recommend RailRoad Tycoon for more casual gaming and this one for a real game. Disclaimer: I haven't played AOS, so I can't compare to that.

Nice game with auctioning, role selection and pick up and deliver mechanisms all blended in a light/medium economic game. I find Age of Steam better and more challenging in the same subject. Also if you're interested in the designer or economic games in general I recommend Brass which I believe is Mr' Wallace's masterpiece.

First Review February 2012:  Steam is probably the best "train game" that I have ever played, though in truth, I am not that big a fan of "train games." As such, my best "train game" merits a maximum rating of...8.

Second Review May 2012:  I find that I prefer Railroad Tycoon to Steam because it leavens the dominant, overbearing concern with delivering cubes to "get those victory points" with some additional, interesting (dare I say fun?) ways to earn victory points in other ways, namely, linking cities and satisfying secret goals (ala Ticket To Ride), delivery bonuses, and hotels.  This ever so slight leavening of the one dimensional "must deliver cubes" approach I think improves the gaming experience.  In particular, RR Tycoon provides evident, additional paths to victory, and that is almost always a good thing in a game. So...Steam drops to a 7, and RR Tycoon earns the 8.

A fun and streamlined railroad game.  Features some really intuitive mechanics which aids new players in focusing more about game decisions and less on rules.  The components all work well, and while the ownership markers may be more boring compared to Age of Steam or Railways of the world, the track tiles seem to be of much better quality and of greater variety.  Other aspects I appreciate in steam is the improved Goods cube allocation, in that City Growth actions and Urbanization can be better planned for.  Overall the well designed components and streamlined nature of Steam make it both a very fun and Strategic experience.

This game, while very good, is no Age of Steam (which I rate a 10).  The reason: the lack of goods production chart.  Without any randomness regarding when goods will come out, you don't need to be as flexible, and without the look-ahead provided by the chart the game is significantly less strategic.  What I mean by this is that the game loses almost all of the pre-game planning found in Age of Steam, where you look at the board and the goods display to try to come up with a plan: where are my 2-deliveries, my 3's, etc.  All the way up to trying to find the cubes you (hope to) be delivering at the end of the game.  Of course, you can't assume the other players won't interfere: it's usually best to have several different plans in mind at this state.  In Steam the altered production mechanic makes it much easier to have the cubes you need when you need them, so this planning is greatly reduced.  Unfortunately, this planning is the strongest part of the game.

I'm not trying to get into the war over which of these is superior and whether John Bohrer or Martin Wallace bakes better cookies.  I feel that the best part of Age of Steam has been developed away in this game.  The remaining game is good, even very good, but it is not excellent.  It is, however, much more accessible for this reason.

It had been years since I last played Age of Steam when I tried the basic game of Steam but I thought that this was improved, particularly in the cube replenishment department.  The advanced version sounds like it would be fine too.  I don't like the breed of "clever" which is defined by staring at a board long enough to know which decision is perfect, so it's hard for me to like this just like it's hard with AoS.  I think I'd like to give it a shot with a 3P-only map to see how much that might reduce AP.

Makes Age of Steam feel very euro, and more like a modern Martin Wallace game, if that makes any sort of sense at all. Features the typical bleeding-eye Wallace graphic design too. :/ It's much more forgiving of bad play than Age of Steam, and doesn't brutally punish mistakes. A nice intro to the genre, but just not as rewarding to me as the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The strategy is very high and rich, and the player interaction medium. I like this game. I would play it if someone put it on the table.  The problem is that I don't like the mechanic very much: pushing cubes around routes isn't my favorite. There is one overarching strategy: (1) Build a continuous route closest to the most goods, so that you can transport your goods, and force your opponents to transport their goods over your routes (while minimizing the amount that you have to transport on their routes). Nonetheless, out of this strategy births a lot of interesting strategy and game play.

A colossus of a train game, but it doesn't overstay its welcome, with a reasonable play time. Lay tracks, ship goods, score points, manage your income and locomotive levels. Great double-sided board with two of my favorite regions (one of which I live in), and loads of wooden components and track tiles. Not terribly complex in terms of how the rules work, but there are lots of little details you'll need to pay attention to. And I've only toiled around with the basic game...Standard looks to get much more competitive and restrictive.

RATING: 6
Age of Steam made family friendly.  Creates less tension by separating the income and scoring tracks.  Our first game (basic) played in 90 minutes with 5 new players.  If you've played 18xx this feels incredibly quick.  

My preference for serious gaming would be Age of Steam, but I'd take this for something faster and more casual.  With Age of Steam, Railroad Tycoon, and several Winsome games, I don't feel that I need this on top of everything else.

The more I play this game the more I enjoy it. I would really love to play Age of Steam now as well. It's a great game with lots of depth. I've played a lot with the 2p maps as well as with the standard 4-6p map. So many options and changes with different games.

I guess I'm just not a big fan of Martin Wallace's games.  Steam is a good game, but all the different phases (auction, tile placement, etc.) felt too segmented, like they were trying to fuse into something grand but missed the mark.  I don't know how else to describe it.  

I'm a big fan of turn angst, however, and if you play with the second rule set you will feel it.  Still, games like Power Grid do the economic "plan how you'll spend your money" thing much better and without all the crazy tiles.

Would love to play this again.  First play was a delight even thought we really had no idea what we were doing.  My only complaint was the practical aspect of the train tiles.  Diggin through all of them and having to examine both sides really seemed to slow the game down.

RATING: 10
Overall a very good game. The only thing that doesn't make much sense is that you can improve your locomotive just by not transporting goods in a turn, you don't have to pay for upgrading, it's not thematic at all, on the other hand not transporting a good on your turn can make a big change in comparison to other players progress.
Also the most eficient way to deliver goods (straight line) is not the one that awards you the most points (instead of delivering from A to B, you can (and should) go A, C, D, E, F, B and that will make you earn more points).

Önmagába nézve nagyon jó! De korábban mindenhol azt olvastam, hogy a Railroad Tycoon ennek az egyszerűsített változata. Pedig szerintem ez az egyszerűbb. Bár túl nagy különbség nincs, kb. 80%-ban egyezik a két játék. Ez annyiban jobb, hogy 1. jóval kisebb helyen elfér, 2. nem random a nyersanyag, ami bekerül a játékba 3. kiszámítható a vége. Mindezek ellenére, mivel nekem a Railroad volt az első, azzal játszom szívesebben.

See my entry for Age of Steam for my general feelings on the whole (Ao)S vs RRT debate.

Steam is a refined version of its brethren: Age of Steam and Railways of the World.
The basic game is akin to RotW, with a tighter map and income, and without the randomness of the cards.
The standard game is a beast similar to Age of Steam, with some of the rough edges smoothed. The duality about the income or points is perhaps cleaner than in AoS, but I'm not a fan. Some other aspects, like the City Growth action, are actually better in Steam.
Overall, it's one of the best pick up and deliver train games out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
so far it seems significantly worse than aos, but is quite enjoyable nevertheless. might drop down to 8 again if it turns out the expansions do not feel as different to base game as they did in aos...

edit:
the simple ruleset is a very nice aos-light, but I personally am more in a market for aos-heavy. the advanced ruleset has nothing going for it over aos I would even call it broken. play simple ruleset to teach the system, then play aos.

basic rules: 8/10
advanced rules 6/10 for enjoyment, or 1/10 'objectively' as they are kinda broken

Initial Impression: This is a pick up and deliver game from Martin Wallace. The components of the game feel almost generic with the tiles and board having only the most basic of art. The mechanisms of the game are brilliant with tough decisions in balancing expanding your company or taking victory points.

RATING: 8
After several plays of Age of Steam, this isn't a must have. You could better see it as another expansion of the original game. Of course it's a good game, but during the whole game our playergroup referred to Age of Steam. Steam is more similar to AoS then Railroad Tycoon and Voldampf.

I'm not a big fan of the random goods distribution in the original Age of Steam rules.  So currently, I prefer Steam's ZERO luck approach for Production & Urbanization.  I also prefer the Income/VP split tracks in Steam to AoS's Income reduction.  However, I still love playing original AoS and even though it has its flaws, I can be at peace with rolling dice for goods growth.

Other than the slightly different rules, Steam is basically Age of Steam.  I only play the standard Steam rules, so I have no comments for the basic, simpler game.  From now on, I will be logging games played with the Steam rules here and vice versa for AoS.

Very much enjoyed my play - At its heart its pretty simple all you do is lay some track in turn order then ship some cubes between connected cities.  An initial auction, choosing special power/ability and the income/loan system add some interesting decisions.  What I dont like so much is that if someone is left with a big enough set of interconnected stacks on their own then they get easier decisions and a big advantage.  This is true for lots of games though.

One playing with 4 on the Northeast map, standard rules.  As a huge fan of Age of Steam its not a big surprise to me that I enjoyed this.  I'm generally positive about the new production mechanism, am on the fence about the separation of income and victory.  I think I'll miss income reduction (or, more probably, victory point reduction) as it was a nice way to keep the game interesting in the face of a potential run-away.  Still, quite good and I'd definitely play it again as it scratches the same itch as AoS, and better than RRT did.

Using the basic rules, Steam is a medium weight "euro" style game.  The rules are reasonably intuitive and the game offers many different strategy options.  The standard rules make Steam a medium to heavy game.  The standard rules are no more complex than the base rules but the decision making is more challenging.  Using either set of rules, Steam is one of my favourite board games. The difficult decisions come fast and furious in Steam!

Steam is one of my highest rated games because of its depth of play coupled with its fairly simple rules.  It is by no means an easy game to learn, but for the power and strategy the game has involves, I would expect there to be many more rules.  

I thoroughly enjoy the game play.  It is a game I will never crack since gameplay greatly depends uopn the other players involved.  Every game I play I must tweek my strategy.  I love this aspect of the game.  With the right people, I want to play this game every time.  I still hope to spring this one on a Ticket To Ride nongamer by claiming it is "just like Ticket to Ride, but better" and see how they do.

Simple enough to be used as a Gateway game, but still profound enough to provide enjoyment for many, many plays. 
Great quality, pretty looking (The track tiles are simply wonderful)and highly replayable.
Every decision you make through the game affects the other players greatly, but there is no real direct conflict.

Great game with any number of players and an appropiate map. USA is a cool 3-4 player map and Rin/Rhur is a nice 5 player map

My Box contains a set of 80 poker chips (40x1$ - 20x5$ - 20x10$)

After many plays of both Steam and many other games, I feel that the Base Game does not deserve to be rated higher than a 7.
I hope I can play the Standard Game soon and raise this game's rating.

Comments are for the base game. Steam has instantly become my favorite train game. That's not saying very much as I generally don't like these games very much. But this must be the exception to the rule. This is the cleanest and most crisp Wallace design I ever played. I like the way income and trains are simplified, I like the fact you have more influence on the goods added to the board, I like the role selection and removal of auctions. This game flows like a charm. It is very deep and challenging without becoming convoluted. This is an amazing design I recommend to anyone looking for a relatively quick but challenging pick-up and delivery game.

Great game whether you use base or standard rules. It offers a lot of replayability. Build your track wisely so you can eventually move goods over 5 or 6 links and be aware of where other player build their network. Play also very well with 2 players on smaller maps (such as Sardinia, Scotland, Sicily and Malta, etc.) or expansion #1. My only complaint would be related to the last few turns when you struggle to ship the scarce resources and to expand your network (not much room left for railroad building).

It is definitely a different game than Railroad Tycoon, but I cannot justify owning both.  I really like the "role selection" mechanic, but I really didn't like seperating Building from Shipping (seems like a waste when I don't want to build but would rather spend more actions shipping.)  I like the shipping for income vs. shipping for points, but I don't like the fact that loans can be essentially paid off.  I definitely like the plastic trains and empty city markers and better looking maps of RRT more.  So, after all the comparisons, RRT gets a higher ranking by me, but they are both great games.

Lovingly crafted variation on Age of Steam by Martin Wallace via Mayfair. Most everything that you liked about AoS can be here for you, along with modifications for play that are more forgiving and streamlined as introductory options.

The basic game is for new players and is very forgiving while introducing people to the general system. The built in turn order associated with the roles works but may frustrate more experienced players who will soon want to opt for the auctions to more properly account for the changing importance of the roles as the game progresses.

The dice-driven city growth scheme, and the blind cube-grab Production role, have been replaced by a supply track that allows players more control over where cubes appear whether by Urbanization or Goods Production (a role that now is one of the more desirable choices for role selection). The income track is now split between income or VPs with the player having the choice which to choose when completing a delivery (income levels at game end are converted to VPs but at a discount). At first blush these changes correct most of what people found problematic with AoS; however, the end-game rush to fill in track links to burn up remaining money and squeeze out a few extra VPs still remains.

Component quality and map design is excellent and the map is hard mounted and reversible (US/Germany). The track tiles are sturdy and slightly thicker than those in AoS and the selection of complex track types more diverse. The need to use grey disks to indicate town-sites under just laid track hexes, which some AoS players found confusing, has been eliminated here as all combinations of track through town-sites have their own track tiles now.

All-in-all, an excellent edition of this enduring game - one of Martin's best has become even better!
++++++
I have stopped thinking of the Base Game as "introductory" and the Standard Game as "advanced." Both versions of the game are quite complete in their own right. I think it is a further strength of the game that it gives you two perfectly legitimate ways to play.

I find Steam to be a cut and dried version of a train game.

It cuts out a lot of confusion and simplifies the genre by having rules for a basic game then moving a player into a more complex game by adding auctioning/risk into the beginning $ competition.

Really enjoy the smaller foot print size wise... AoS is just to friken big for some tables... I think the size alone could swing a player to Steam over Age of Steam. 

This game can scratch the itch for the nitty gritty stock manipulation in the expansion Steam Barons.

I also like the 7 player tiles and the balancing that occurs with changes in initiative.  The tiles throw in some variation of tactics from turn to turn which leave the game unpredictable and unscripted which some other train games become for me.

Juego de construcción de redes ferroviarias. Es un poco largo, pero entretenido. Incluye un novedoso sistema de puja para el orden de turno. Ese orden también permite escoger uno de los siete roles disponibles que te permite hacer acciones bonificadas.

Los puntos se obtienen transportando materiales (cubitos). Según la cantidad de tramos de vía que atraviesen los materiales hasta su destino el jugador recibe puntos de vía que debe traducir en mejorar su track de inversión o puntos de victoria (no se puede divivir).

Está bien, aunque es un poco largo para lo que ofrece.
Admite también una modalildad de juego "familiar", que no he probado aún.

Rating is for base game. I acquired Steam to scratch the train game itch and be able to play with more casual gamers and changing groups. Up to now, the game has completely delivered and I see no immediate need to move on to the standard game, except perhaps after a few plays with the regular group.
In the basic game, money is never an issue, but if you are to loose with your spending and too generous when delivering for money, you can miss scoring the crucial points for the win.

Played once with 3 players. Quite a brain-burning game but fun. The mechanics all tie together nicely and allows for good strategic planning while still having lots of player interaction. Want to try with 4 or 5 players to form a more solid opinion but this game left a great first impression.

Update 09/30: We played wrong the first time, didn't use 2 actions (engine upgrade, delivery) during the Movement phase. Playing correctly this way really opened things up and made the game more enjoyable. Bumped to an 8.

Update 03/21/14: Played for the first time in quite a while. This game is just awesome- in part it's kind of a competitive puzzle game. Bumping to 8.5

RATING: 7.5
One play. Slightly improved version of Age of Steam, playing without the auction and choosing what action you need according to player order from the previous turns' selections. Saves precious money and adds a bit of strategy to this part of the game. Still, going last is difficult, and the extra few bucks just doesn't seem to cut it. However, the player that won did well competing right in the middle of the board, while I took second building on the periphery. There is a picture of the game on Inkygirl's photo album on the BGG.CON forum.

Very similar in many ways to Railroad Tycoon, but rather quicker to play. This is not to say it hurts the brain any less, because it totally doesn't. My only real criticism: I would have liked some hidden end game victory conditions, like the Barons in RT.

Spanish edition. Tentative rating, it might go up as I get the hang of the game. Unfortunately, trains do not capture my imagination as other themes do. Played once with the normal edition and twice with the zorotrack that can be found in the Files section. Apparently this track makes Steam play more similarly to AoS.
------------------------------------------
(February 2011)
After a full year of boardgaming and a few more plays of Steam under my belt, I have apparently completed the transition from casual gamer to heavier gamer. Not only do trains not bother me anymore, I am even looking forward to getting my toes wet in the 18XX genre. However, I never play standard Steam nowadays - I always use the zorotrack, which makes it difficult to win by getting a lot of loans and makes the game a 9 for me. This is a great game, and it is tough to compare it to AoS, although I think I like the latter a bit more simply because of it is brutality.

Reasonable game but my main gripe with all the Age of Steam and new train games is they actually are NOT train games. They are in fact cube pushing Euro's masquerading as a train game. Give me a real stock market, crashes, epic track construction and ability to own and manage your own company anytime. In an effort to accelerate and smooth out play, all the above mechanisms from the original 1830xx series have been removed. So take your pick which u prefer.

Played the Base game.  I like some of the things going on there.  I like turn order tied to the action you take, and I love the removal of the dice rolls for the cube supply that AoS has.  The split between VPs and income is interesting.  I think this does a lot of things right, and the board is certainly prettier.

I'm looking forward to trying the advanced game, and will re-evaluate my rating when I do.

Heresy, I know, for those who know and love AoS; but this is a better game!  I like AoS a lot but that was despite its minor flaws rather than because of them.  

For my money, Steam fixes the two main issues with AoS - that is the loan/interest and replacement goods/cubes sub-systems.  Both are just a bit footery in AoS (particularly the cube system, which is a bit too random, especially in the context of the rest of the game - it just seemed a bit out of place; 'tacked on' even).  Steam smoothes out both these minor annoyances and integrates the sub-systems much better with the rest of the game - which also speeds up gameplay - bonus!  Another side benefit of the fix for interest is a new balance to be struck between VPs and income, which adds a nice little extra.


The rest is the same glorious game as AoS, though with better production values and a double sided map.

This shows the benefit of some extra development by a designer who now has much more experience than when AoS first came out.  I know there will be some who will prefer the way things were but I'm in the 'improved' camp - which surprises me, as I rated AoS so highly I doubted it could be much improved.  Glad to be wrong on that.

P.S. A final heresey - whisper it softly, but the 'no turn auction' basic game works well and speeds things up enough to make me seriously consider whether it might just be better to always play that way!  A few plays confirms that it works well and I really doubt whether the extra time and angst added by the full 'standard' rules are worth it most of the time - so, go ahead, mark me down under the 'wimp' column - but only so long as you tick the 'masochist' box if you disagree!

RATING: 7
Played once, I had good expectations that with Mayfair Martin Wallace might *finally* get an experienced and competent developer and turn out a decent game, and first impressions are that this expectation has been met. A lot of the ridiculously silly, anti-intuitive wonkiness of Age of Steam is gone, the rough edges filed off, some semblance of balance attained, and things generally cleaned up quite a bit. Also, the two included maps seem very solid and interesting, where the Age of Steam maps were hit and miss, and the "rust belt" one in the base game was actually one of the weaker ones. For me, the "refined" "Base" game is definitely where it's at, and I think it will find more fans than the "Standard" game, which is basically just slightly tweaked Age of Steam. While the income/VP dichotomy has helped clean up things in a lot of ways (even if it makes no thematic sense), the turn-order auction that is the core difference between "Base" and "Standard" is still hugely problematic in Standard.

Of the three attempts at this so far (Age of Steam, Railroad Tycoon, and now Steam), this is the only one where you can't hear the gears grinding and tearing in the background. It's still a tough, analytical game that sometimes seems to have been designed to make you feel like an idiot, but it's nowhere near as gratuitously hard as Age of Steam or crazily unplaytested as Railroad Tycoon, and first impressions are that it plays rather well.

Only one basic game under my belt, so it's WAY too early to get a good sense of this game.  I recall really enjoying some aspects of the game, but I found the basic game to lack complexity.  We played with only three players and by the end of the game all three players were making a healthy profit, had upgraded to level 6 locomotives, and had shipped every good on the board.  There were a few interesting decision points, and plenty of opportunities for combative players to undermine the methodical planners in the group.  I suspect the planning added by the budgeting/auctioning in the standard game will enhance the experience. 

At the time, I remember thinking the game was awesome.  With a little distance (this is written roughly a week since that first play), I can't entirely recall why.

My plays of this have felt weird so far (only the basic game). It felt counterintuitive to me, rewarding taking inefficient routers to transport goods, rather than efficient routes.

I loved Age of Steam, and this version is much better and cleaner in my opinion.

I was a little disappointed when I played this game. I thought it would be better than it actually is, and even though it's a good game, I'm not completely sold on it. I will play it a couple of times before making a final judgment, but I don't think it will ever be in my top 50 games. I like the idea behind the game and the "role" selection aspect and the spatial element of building your rail roads - but something is missing, and I'm not sure what it is. Perhaps I'm just not a big train games fan?

My rating it based on how I feel Steam stacks up to Age of Steam.  Also, I have only played the base game of Steam.  

I thought I would hate the income/point tracks but they actually work.  I'm not saying it works 'better', but its not bad.  I do really hate the action selection tied to the player turn order.  I hate having to pick the Pass Action to get Urbanization and I hate how Locomative kind of stinks yet is still placed second to last. And I still have no idea how Engineer is not #2.  Either way, I don't like how it changes the game at all.  Also, I loved the Auction and how it worked and this destroys that.  Also, I love the 'planning' part of Age of Steam where you had to count your money, dedicate your shares to the turn and try and do what you want to do with what you planned at the start of turn.  It may be more hardcore for the noobs - but it's what I love about Age of Steam that this one does not offer.

Steam does offer a beautiful board and a new map, which is worth playing to check out.

Not a bad game, though with some flaws.  The game feels like it is one round longer than it should be, or, at least the one game I played felt that way.

Steam is a game that has been in my collection for quite some time and is one of the first "serious" games I purchased. I tend to sell off or trade games that lose their luster over time to keep my collection at a manageable level, and despite that, Steam has remained a permanent fixture in my collection.

What is the draw? Steam has incredibly tight mechanics that are relatively easy to explain but generate some tough decisions. I tend to like games that add a spatial element, and the pickup and delivery system of Steam does exactly that while evoking a theme. 

The way I play Steam has also evolved as I've evolved as a gamer. My first few plays were of the base ruleset. Then I tried the standard (and tougher) rules with "serious" gamers, and it opened up my enjoyment of the game even further. I've gone on to acquire all the various map expansions, which then opened up the flexibility of the core rules and an appreciation for Steam as a game system. 

The result is a game that:
* Can be taught to people relatively new to the hobby, or seasoned vets.
* Can play 2 to 6 with perfect scalability.
* Can offer a fresh, new map experience to pretty much anyone.

Basically I'm "all in" at this point and I hope I can continue to convince other gamers to explore all these various maps with me, as I don't expect my joy of this game to wane anytime soon.

As reported this is a lighter age of steam and if anything it takes the mechanical dryness that some poeple experience out of the game. It is a hectic board and the later phases of track building are duller than I would like, but on the whole it makes AoS more accessible. Railways of the World in contrast seems much lighter and considerably different and I like Steam more to AoS. If given the choice again I would choose steam of AoS.

:sugar: Having no particular experience with, or emotional attachment to, Age of Steam, I was able to approach this as a tabula rasa. The base game (the only one I've tried thus far) is a terrific little very low luck semi-abstract Euro for four players that seems to work on its own terms. While I'd still like to try AoS for comparison's sake, I don't feel like I'm missing anything huge by not playing it, and I'm inclined to think that the lack of auctions is actually a point in (Base) Steam's favor, as is the quicker play time.

Start with no money. Spend the rest of the game in debt, not earning any points because you keep having to use all your points to pay back the bank. Then take another loan the next turn. Get screwed over by the game itself, then have the "pleasure" of being screwed over by your fellow players. Fight for turn order only to have someone take a tile that allows them to jump to the head of the line anyway. Get a migraine from the overwhelming mess the board becomes. Continue being screwed for the entire 2 hours it takes to be put out of your misery.

I'm a long fan of Age of Steam.

I have to admit, I think on the whole I like Steam at least as much. I think the production action is MUCH stronger, and makes the game more strategic in some ways. Its an interesting new lever to play with. I need more plays to judge better.

The changed scoring is a neutral to me. 

The production values are very nice, however I always did like the stark simplicity of the Warfrog version of Age of Steam. 

One thing I really don't like...the bizarre distribution of the double-sided tiles. Its just about impossible to know exactly what is available at any given time. There was an avenue of strategy where you could limit an opponent's builds by consuming the special tiles they needed. Now...it feels very vague and haphazard. I'd prefer a detailed manifest and single-sided tiles (yes, I know they'd need more).  Perhaps just make all the straight / gentle curves double sided...but the special tiles should not be.

Steam is a redevelopment of the AoS system. For the most part, the game retains the feel and options of the original, though there are marked differences, which I will spend most of my time commenting on. Up front, I want to say that this is a distinct variation of the gaming system, and that it is best bought with the intent of simply playing Steam, the same way AoS is bought best for playing AoS. Both of the games can be cobbled into the other, but neither will play optimally when they're being used in that way. The biggest changes here are the tile mix (sometimes this is important, sometimes not; definitely much moreso if using the designer and publisher's preferred rules where the tile mix is unlimited here), the production system, and the split income tracks. Of these, the split tracks are the thing that I think will most divide the system because they fundamentally change the economy of the game.

The beginner rules are, frankly, a bit boring for anyone who is used to the original system. I could not see using most of the rules implemented in it beyond the initial learning game or two though they are still markedly better than the other easier form of the system that is available in Railroad Tycoon. The auction replacement scheme I do like though. It is interesting, but is not well-suited to base-game system + expansion use as it forces the designer to numerically define the role values for the players, which takes away some of the fun of learning new boards. I do think the idea is a good one for an off-board or two, and I would like to see it used on an expansion or two with a more traditional, cut-throat economy as I like the trade-offs involved in choosing power roles. I'm glad they decided to ditch this from the full game though, as novel as it is, I think the auction is a much better role choosing mechanic in general for a large variety of reasons.

The production scheme replacement in general is too powerful and easy to manipulate in the early game , but I can't fault them on that as fixing growth is difficult and I don't think anyone has gotten the right mix between restricted and laissez faire yet. The Steam system is a cleaner, more controllable way to conduct growth, albeit with a cost, that cost being another really good role in the auction, as it jacks the value of the role in the early going and can make early profitability happen pretty quickly if you are isolated in any given location on the board. The downside of the dice is their random nature, you can be screwed for the long game by them if your luck takes a turn for the worse. The downside of this is that it is easier to set up optimum runs, especially in the early game when you need them most. A key element of the goods growth scheme in the original game is that it ties goods to certain locations on the board, you can't manipulate that. Here you can, and as a result, cubes are much more likely to end up in places you want them rather than in places where you have to figure out how to use them (with the latter making for more interesting decisions/challenges in practice). Production is easily on par with Urbanization in the first couple of rounds, if not better in some situations. If you're isolated, it's a possible #1 pick as it makes it very easy to get dream setups in the early going that allow double 3 ships on round 2 to blast up the income track and get the ball rolling. I think with some restrictions, this idea is a fundamentally more sound concept, though definitely best at either higher scales or with at least one of the traditional good roles neutered. The main thing I would look at doing is   tying the cubes to given locations to keep Production from being too powerful and the cubes from being too controllable. The power of production here is high enough to basically make it a rough equal with Urb and those two roles only a half step down from Locomotive in value. What this means is that there is almost no incentive to bid in the auction unless you intend to win Loco, and being in 2nd-3rd is about equal in value until the production cubes run out.

The other major change is the split income and VP tracks. I can see where people might enjoy the gamey nature of this more than the gamey nature of the original (i.e.: if you have a big engine you constantly have to take out shares to build track because income maxes at 10) but my main concern is simply that it makes reduction harder to implement, and I'm extremely fond of that rule because of the little screw-you situations that it creates. I think it also is effectively trying to do the same thing (slowing down leaders, and the person with the biggest engine should be the leader in this game), but it strikes me as even gamier than the original system. This doesn't bother me in either case because I'm more interested in the decisions being created than any sort of thematic integrity, but there you are. This scheme also seems to make the money much looser throughout the game as the tendency is to zero out income (and have a huge pile of cash laying around) so that any ship for income is just back up to cover Loco expenses or to max out the track at 10. This feels extremely loose compared to the AoS system. This splitting of the tracks was touted as adding a decision point to the game, but I don't feel that it does. You need money to operate, so early ships are going to be for income. When you get up to 10, if you still anticipate needing liquid capital, you cash out at the beginning of the round and then ship yourself back up to 10. There's not a lot of thought that goes into it. It has the side effect of creating the aforementioned piles of cash which means it is harder to really put the thumbscrews to someone with a well-placed piece of track or a carefully thought out bid, leeching tension from the game and weapons away from the players.

As a real aside, a lot of the niggly, extra rules that have been added to this are irksome. i.e.: artificially forcing players to deliver cubes using at least half of their own links, not allowing people with engines of 6 to take Locomotive, and the like. These rules both take away occasionally useful options and crowd the rulebook with extra rules that flat out aren't needed and add extra learning overhead to the game.

As most people have seen now, this game is fairly close to AoS. The changes that are present are significant though. Production is more powerful and controllable, which makes setting up desirable shipments easier. The split tracks tend to soften the economy, making it harder to really hurt someone with a well-placed piece of track or bid in the auction.

As an overall base system, this is similar to Age of Steam, but it seems to be better tuned for higher player count games out of the box because of the role power enhancement. Dedicated expansions should be able to easily fix this though, just like they did for AoS. The overall cube tightness is laudable in terms of left over pieces, the rest of the game feels loose to  me, but then again, I'm not the target audience so what I have to say is largely immaterial. Essentially, if you have quibbles with the aspects of Age of Steam that are addressed here you'll probably be very happy with the game and enjoy it a good deal more than AoS. People who are already converted fans of the original game are less likely to find a lot to like here, because most of the changes seem to be aimed at making the game easier to play out of the box, which is likely to have little resonance with people who are already familiar with the game.

Rating is based on my expansion ranking system with 5 being the base and the rank being moved up or down based on that. Pretty much the only thing I like here is the way the cubes run out and the base, though not the final implementation of the production system. Other than that, I think the changes take away interesting weapons or player choices that were present in the original game. If this was an AoS expansion, it would be one of the weaker ones available because I think it takes the game backwards from where I want it to be.

I am giving this the benefit of the doubt, because this is only after one 3p play and used the basic rules. With 3p it seemed to drag a bit, but that may be fixed with more players. Further, the full rules may make it more interesting. 

My first thought is that this has all of the math/tedious distance calculations of Indonesia but without the excitement or tension of mergers. I'll leave it at a 7 for now because it may be better than what I saw, but I was not very impressed with the one play I had.

Glad I finally got to play this.  It feels more like Age of Steam than not, and I really like that he made the Production action more attractive to take than it is in vanilla AoS.  I am not sure on the actions tied to turn order, but it certainly isn't bad.  

I do like cash being available all the time as not to see people just circle the drain.  I will have to play more  to see how the pans out.  It is interesting that income maxes out at 10 in this game.  Another aspect that needs further play before I can make a call.

July 11, 2009 -- Essentially a lighter, more streamlined and quicker playing version of Age of Steam. Not that this is a bad thing. Quite the opposite, in fact. It seems like everything that slowed down Age of Steam has been changed to work more efficiently. Not having to count up track at the end of every turn makes the game run incredibly smoother, for instance.

Really, I like this a little bit more than Age of Steam, but not enough to have a different rating. 7/10

It seems a nice step up from Ticket to Ride, with the TTR Marklin Edition being a good transition.  The added depth is a plus, but unfortunately the board isn't all that pretty to look at.  Will be on the lookout for re-themed versions.  I like the concept of having to choose between income and VP and also the "tax" you must pay to use other player's routes.  But I dislike the railway tiles - too much of the game seems to be fumbling through them, hoping to find the connection you need.

Will have to try again. Fairly unforgiving game. (Standard only, have not played `basic' Steam. Given the chance, I [i]wouldn't[/i] play basic Steam).

Having reviewed some of the differences, `basic' Steam seems like an awful waste of time. What's the point of the game if I don't have to decide my number of loans at the beginning of the turn? I will flatly refuse to play the basic game. 

This game is a reimplementation of Age of Steam. For comparison see note on AoS.

It's really all about the never-ending discussion: [i]Which is better, Steam or Age of Steam?[/i] The answer: [i]It depends on what you find more important[/i]. And for me, the specifics put Steam ahead of its older sibling Age of Steam.

First, Steam's way of splitting up loans (shares/stock/...) and points leads to gameplay which simply gets does not get in the way of the player as much as does Age of Steam's, which multiplexes points, income and income reduction into a single track and keeps shares as a simple counter. I find this gives people a much better idea of where they are in the game. Second, Steam's method of handling production and resource replenishment is much more acceptable to me. In Age of Steam a shortage of goods can result in brutal games, but really, what is the point of such brutality if the players are at the mercy of unmitigated dice? I'd rather trade in the wide, epic and uncontrollable scope, for a more limited but controllable, and still difficult to manage deterministic system. And alter rules elsewhere if nastiness is desired. These two points seem minor, but they mean a great deal to me, causing me to give the nod to Steam instead of Age of Steam.

I also like how the rules to Steam incorporate two variants: one for more casual play, and one which is very close to Age of Steam. If it no big deal to backport those simpler rules to Age of Steam, but still, the fact that this variant is in the rule book and not on some weird fan website is a pleasant idea. 

The games themselves play nearly identically as far as I could tell, so there is little to mention in terms of extras here. I have given Steam the original rate I gave Age of Steam (a 7), and downgraded the original's by 1 point to highlight that an in my opinion superior system exists. I might even decide to swap my copy of Age of Steam for a copy of Steam.

Through a quirk of circumstance, I first played this exactly three days after first playing Age of Steam.  We played the Base Game, and the difference was ridiculous.  I'd rate Base Steam a 3 or 4; I simply have no interest in playing it again.  I understand the impulse, to draw people put off by the otherwise very difficult and inaccessible Age of Steam, but (1) I enjoy that kind of difficulty, and (2) from what I can tell, people that play and like Base Steam have no interest in progressing to Standard Steam or Age of Steam.  So what's the point?  Play what is good and what you enjoy, not some intro/lite version of it.

I somewhat regret getting this instead of the Age of Steam reprint.  At least there is this: most of my gaming opponents have copies of Age of Steam so if I want that experience I can have it.  Standard Steam seems, most generously, to be a streamlining of Age of Steam, and I'm hopeful that to a new initiate the differences will be minor.  But there is little to recommend it above and beyond the earlier game.  At best it is an equal variant.

Steam is drier and requires more thought than Railways of the World. Steam feels like it is lacking the fun factor that Railways of the World has.

A possible solution would be for the last player to bid first and maybe have a cap on the bidding.

More choices to make than Ticket to Ride, but not so complex that even new players can grasp the decisions quickly.  I think the weight of the game is just right, allowing depth of strategy without being too complicated.  Very fun.

As an owner of RRT who plays it with non-gamers and children, my crowd loved our first 2 games of Steam much more than RRT. Ease of setup, better components and an overall better gameplay for them was huge. I had a blast and while some call it simplified, there were still plenty of strategic choices to be made. 

For those who want the challenge of economics incoprated, it is there in the Standard Game. Tons of variety, and a mix of rules can please everyone.

A very good balance in gameplay.

Steam gives you a rich set of decisions without having cumbersome rules.  It also encourages a good level of competition.  It definitely pays to plan ahead.  I missed a great opportunity at the end because I didn't take a chance on something that I thought was too late to start.  I think replay on this would be good.  There is a lot of variability without it seeming too random.  There is luck in drawing cubes from the bag, but that should equal itself out.  The choice of income vs victory points was a nice feature also.  I do not think it is as heavy as the 3.5 it is listed at.  But it does play a little long.  Solid game & our play was fun.

That delicious moment when you can stop focusing on income and start churning out victory points: that's what this game is all about.  Building inefficient routes to cities so that later on you can move goods as far as possible in order to collect the most points possible.  While you're at it, cut your competitors off by building routes through a path that they intended to use.  Better yet, just steal a good that they were setting up a route to earn 6 points with.  Sure, you might only get 2 points, but their disapproving stare is more than worth it!

There's a lot going on here, and it is important to not allow one player to have tons of space to operate uninterrupted.  If someone has a section of the board where they are the lone rail builders, they will have a HUGE advantage over the other players.

Don't shy away from conflict in this game.  Enjoy the moments of dickery and understand and accept the fact that what goes around comes around.

Score your deliveries and add to your income or victory points, balancing your need to invest against your quest to win the game.

Se trata del AoS con dos mejoras fundamentales, una es la relativa a los cambios en las acciones urbanización/producción, la otra es dividir los tracks de puntos de victoria y pasta, el resultado es que el juego ahora es más jugable con 5 o 6 jugadores (hay más opciones al comienzo de cada partida para todos) sin perder un ápice de intensidad, desaparece el kingmaking que tan poco me gustaba del AoS y las partidas son algo más rápidas al no haber fase de producción. La sensación al jugarlo es la misma, quizá la subasta pierde un poco de interés al haber más opciones buenas, aunque depende más de con quien juegues y como se presente la partida que del cambio de reglas ... creo que mantiene toda la intensidad del AoS, y todos los cambios encajan a la perfección ... un juego redondo en todos los aspectos.

Lo he bajado a 8.8 tras dos partidas en los mapas que vienen con el juego, son mapas demasiado sencillos que mezclados con los cambios (principalmente el de poner grupos de cubos en juego) hacen que todo sea mucho más sencillo, la sensación de "ansiedad" del AoS ni se dislumbra en el Steam :(

Streamlined Age of Steam with more tough decisions because of the split Income/VP track.  Being able to use an entire delivery to increase the income makes it less brutal, but it works well.  Map looks nice, great bits, and I like the new City Growth rules that replace the randomness of the former Production action in AoS.  I still like AoS, but I definitely I prefer Steam.  The Standard version is best, but I like that the Base game is an option if I want to teach newbies or want to get in a quicker game.  

To me, it's more strategic than AoS, because I don't have to worry so much about bankruptcy in the beginning, and I can focus on long-term shipping possibilities, rather than "where am I going to find something to ship *this turn* in order to keep from losing VPs?" I can employ a much more aggressive strategy in Steam than was possible in AoS. Steam eliminates the randomness and some of the brutality (not all!) to make for an overall more enjoyable gaming experience.

Rating after 1 play of the basic game with 4 players. This is effectively a smaller, streamlined version of [i]Railways of the World[/I]. It's still a good game, though I think the map is too small for 4 players. To be fair, we probably expanded faster than we would have had we played the advanced game.

Update: After playing again via Steam (heh) I think my rating is pretty much solidified where it's at. I definitely prefer the production and initiative system here to the dice-based system from the unforgiving [I]Age of Steam[/I]. But, I still rate [i]Railways of the World[/I] as the best of the three.

[September 2017 - 7]
Steam gets a bump up thanks to the mobile app version of the game, which gets rid of all the tile-laying fiddliness and helps move the money/loans/interest calculations along faster.

I still find the "inefficient" deliveries annoying with respect to the theme, but it makes for a unique game/puzzle with good interaction.

[May 2015 - 6]
I'm surprised how much I didn't like this game, as I'm a Martin Wallace fan and it receives generally good praise as one of the better pickup-and-deliver games.

First, what I like ...

I like the board, the income mechanism and choice for victory points. Although the $5 for $1 (on debt), then $1 for $1 on interst/income can feel disjointed. And I feel as if income/money should count for a few more victory points at the end.

I like all the decisions and I see the strategies, especially when it comes to placing and playing cubes in vicinity to your opponents (Do I deliver this color good to get the most points, or this color good for fewer points, but my opponent will get fewer as well?) As many Euros, it's a good balancing act, and surprisingly, there's some nice interaction, provided your tracks are intersecting. The randomness of the cubes that come out and where they are placed lend to some nice replayability.


What I don't like ...

The tile-laying is fiddly with the double-sided tiles and having to hunt for the right one. It slows the game down.

Half of the roles seem kinda weak

My biggest issue is the theme within the goods delivery, which I can best describe as 'disconnected.' Some might say 'abstract' is a better word, but it's not that ... I see cities, tracks and terrain, so the visual cues of nice train game are there, but something doesn't quite flow.

With goods delivery, you're rewarded for the amount of links you have on your track (cities and towns along the way). At the same time, you're not rewarded for being efficient with your deliveries in Steam. You take the longer route with more links between two cities to score more points (even if you own a shorter connection).

This would make sense if you were carrying several different goods and dropping them off along the way for points, but you aren't. You can only deliver one cube. There's no penalty for taking that longer route with more cities, other than perhaps the initial locomotive investment.

Meanwhile, a long uninterrupted route (without cities in-between) forms just one "link" -- say four tiles between two cities -- and gets paid out $1, the same as one uninterrupted tile between two cities.

That disjointedness rattles the brain a bit. Again, it's not abstract -- I can do abstract. Steam, rather, sets you up with the theme and then throws you for a loop -- literally, loops and zig-zag track lines can benefit you in this game.

I see why some of it is the way it is, I just wish they would have been able to tie it all together a little better with the theme. Maybe I just don't like pick-up-and-deliver games, because I've tried a few and don't really enjoy them. (Any better suggestions?)

I found myself wanting to play Puerto Rico, Power Grid, Airlines Europe or Suburbia instead of Steam (for similar mechanics).

I will say, that once you know what you're doing and you can get past the tile hunting, the game moves a bit quicker than those above, but I can totally see people getting bogged down in the decisions.

After playing the Steam app countless times and giving it another run face to face, I feel like I have to update my rating. This one is right in my wheelhouse. Rather simple rules coupled with spatial and economic elements seem to be a recipe for games that I do enjoy immensely. Wish I could play it more often on game nights.

[2009-12-07 Rating: n.a. -> 8]
Just a few comments after my first game (with basic rules):

* The basic game of Steam plays like Railroad Tycoon (RRT) and Rails of Europe (RoE) with just a few minor twists (like role-selection). As I like these two quite a lot, I naturally liked Steam. On the other hand, there weren't enough differences to really justify the purchase of Steam. So, until I play this one with the full set of rules and see whether it improves the game and sets it apart from RRT and RoE, I won't add it to my collection.

* The Steam map is better than the map in Railroad Tycoon and on par with the one of Rails of Europe.

* There isn't so much chrome component-wise as you would get with Railroad Tycoon or Rails of Europe. Everything is "just" functional.

Outstanding train game that tames some of the brutality of its predecessor. Surprisingly elegant, which allows you to plan and strategize without being ground down by too much chrome. Manages to blend some of the financial management of 1830 with the pick up and deliver chrome that's a large part of the fun of train games. This one may even edge up into the 10 category.

Well I like train based games, but I don't care for the stock side of most of them - I'm basically clueless when it comes to stocks and financial markets.  Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised at how this game simplified the financial side of the equation, while keeping the basic "feel" of it.  This is definitely a game I will play again.

Elegant and unforgiving economic/railroad game. This is in essence Age of Steam with some added finesse. The differences are minor, but almost all for the better.  Like taking away the cumbersome dice rolling for goods growth, and all the separate boards for keeping track of the locomotive levels, incomes, shares, etc.  Not to mention the painful calculation of the final score by counting the tiles.  I really cannot see myself playing Age of Steam rather than Steam anymore.

Very good train game - like it better than 'Railways of the World' (which isn't bad either) - it feels a little less random (mainly due to being able to choose the cube/goods population sets and the absence of the cards.

Much prefer the components in Steam over RotW - in this case wood beats plastic - the plastic location mini's are just so unnecessary and overproduced. Also the boards are a bit too big to fit on an average table and allow people to lay out their cards and money etc.

This game is so close to Age of Steam, it should have just been released as an expansion map to Age of Steam (incorporating different rules).  If it did, it would be considered "friendly/family" rules.  The economic system is much more forgiving. It takes less future planning.  The tiles for railbuilding are friendlier.  The angst of the auction has been removed.

All of these make Age of Steam better in my opinion.  But although I like the original more, this isn't bad by any stretch.  There is actually one rule in Steam that I like better...the production action.  It's almost irrelevant in Age of Steam, but works better in Steam.

One thing that I really did not care for in Steam was the fact that "Income Reduction" is not present in any form.  This is a good "catch-up" mechanism in AoS and represents the theme well.  Steam feels very linear in terms of VP point growth.  Once you get the lead, it felt like it was easier to play "tit for tat" and keep others from gaining on you.

Age of Steam = 10   (many plays on various maps)
Steam = 7  (1 4er game, 2 5er game new rules)

Update: Recently played this with the Age of Steam auction rules.  The only noticeable differences are: no dice for production, production gets 3 cubes to choice of city, loans available during mid-turn at a reduced rate, no income reduction.   That said, this ruleset (I can't remember the name) is much better than what I had played before.  I'd rate this a 9...almost as good as AoS (a 10).  I think this game thus settles into an average of 8.

Players manage their income to develop and run a railway.  Players take turns to jockey for turn order, tighten their finances for the turn, then build track over either a map of the Ruhr or Canada/NE.USA.  Goods are then run over the built track to generate income or victory points.  Most points after a set number of turns wins.  Tough game, latest in a long series that began 12 years ago, but honed to perfection here.  Two ways to play means you can tune your session to either fast or full game, and both work very well.  In fact, I think the "Base" game is better than the more complex "Standard" game, but at least you get the choice.  All the previous games had their issues - crappy Winsome joke DTP components of the early railways game; Volldampf... actually, Volldampf is pretty good; Age of Steam with it's warts and baggage; the strange Railway Tycoon with the huge map and weird track set.  Probably as good as it's going to get.

I've got so much to learn about Steam - it's almost like a lesser version of how I feel about Go. We've played twice, and both times it's become evident the ways that we were playing wrong, and we resolved to do better the next time. 

Our last play, we realized we were too actively staying separated from each other, creating inefficient and disconnected train systems. We've realized that a player who learns to connect in with other trains efficiently has the best chance of maximizing profits - we'll see how this goes on our third play.

(In case it's not evident, fascinated by this game. Looking forward to more plays - rating will go up or down depending on how I feel once I get any kind of impression that I 'get' the game.)

I prefer it over AoS (I can hear the crowd yelling at me for saying this) for three reasons:
· Production action is almost useless in AoS, while it is very important in Steam.
· There's no recovery for a bad beginning in AoS, while Steam gives more options to the players, specially in the financial side.
· I like the "board" planning part over the financial game. Steam focuses on the "board" part of the game while in AoS bidding for turn orther and saving money prevails over the "cube moving" part (hope I explained myself).
Anyway it is a superb game, both of them are among my favourites.

I enjoyed my first play with 4, but a year later, I found it lacking in tension for the last 4-5 turns in a 3-player game. Tension only existed when choosing turn tiles and waiting for your turn to build track if you weren't first to build. Delivering cubes almost never provided tension or interesting decisions based on risk or intuition: they were just straightforward calculations. Need to try it with bidding instead of the fixed price tiles. Sold.

Played the standard game - interesting, though I was at a disadvantage playing against experienced 18xx players (so they knew what tracks to use, and I kept missing opportunities).

Great introduction of a income track separated of the Victory Points track.

1 játék után, a 8-9 közt, de elsőre lefele kerekítettem. A játék jó, tetszett...csak az merült fel bennem, h mi a különbség a Railroad Tycoonhoz képest...jó-jó olvastam. De próbálva más, és mivel azzal kb 2 éve játszottam...és ugye igazából pici részletekben különbözik, amik alapján nyilván a Steam az "erősebb", gondolkodósabb-tervezősebb játék, de pont h pici részletek, ezért lenne érdekes újra játszani az RT-vel. A Steam mindenesetre bejött, jól tervezettnek, szervezettnek tűnik, bárcsak hozzáférnék valahol egy angol szabályhoz. Na és persze a nagy előnye: elfér az asztalon :-)
Update: Megkapta a 9-est. És talán picit jobb is. Lehet, h az is segített ebben, h játszottam egyet a Baron kieggel is, de így az újabb Steam játékban már nem kísértett a RT, egyszerűen csak a játék volt. Kicsit el tud húzódni, és vannak részek amikor gyorsabb gondolkodásúaknak is le kell állni molyolni, de a fázisok nagy része pörgősen megy. Ugyanakkor mély analízis van benne, komoly stratégia, és az ellenfelek játékát is igen lehet -sőt kell- befolyásolni.

Steam, while mechanically sound, fails to maintain thematic continuity and becomes disjointed. What begins as a gratifying race for key routes and city access devolves into a competition for creating the most convoluted delivery routes. The game rewards players for delivering through as many towns as possible, which is antithetical to how a delivery corps should function. In reality short and quick deliveries are preferred, but in Steam players must create an increasingly serpentine web of rail lines. This inconsistency makes the game frustratingly counterintuitive and produces a strong enough disconnect between the theme and mechanics, that makes even the most mechanics-first gamers cringe.

Don't see any reason to play the advanced game instead of Age of Steam, given that the auction is diluted by having too many good actions and the minor rules tweaks don't help matters. The base game is reasonable in its own right, though.

RATING: 6
I loved this game at first as an intro to the pickup-and-deliver train genre but it petered out after about a dozen plays. The simple logistical nature of it, even playing with the auction for turn order, made it too straightforward. Our games fell into a pattern of fighting for distribution network space (fun) and then a boring playing out of the inevitable with cube grabbing. The game is so forgiving and non-variable that the player who jumped out to a lead invariably would grind it out to victory. I now appreciate Age of Steam’s punishing income and loan system as well as the risk management required due to the random nature of cube placement.

RATING: 8
Despite playing it wrong the first time (we played standard rules and missed the locomotive upkeep rule), I had a great time laying train track and shipping goods. There seems to be a lot to learn in the game, with loans, distances, and various costs possibly playing an important role.

al principio del juego tendremos que pedir dinero para poder participar en la subasta de orden de turno y hacer distintas acciones que nos costará dinero, también tendremos que mover mercancías de una ciudad a otra para ganar dinero, al final del turno tendremos que pagar las deudas.
Es un juego que no perdona los errores y puedes verte fuera de la partida.

Me gusta: Es muy tenso y exigente, tienes que gestionar muy bien el dinero y en que los gastas y cuando conseguir los puntos de victoria.

Not my sort of game. If you already like Martin Wallace games, heavier games, train games, and similar build-track-deliver-cubes games, you will love this. The balance between earning money or Victory Points is nicely handled, the basic decisions are easy enough, but with the timing, and only really being able to plan 1 turn ahead (because of the changing track layouts) makes this a slow game. 

I have a major grudge too. The basic track piece where a straight track splits off to a separate line is NOT IN THIS GAME. So in a very stupid way, you have to build parallel track to track you've already built. This may suit the game mechanics itself (you get a VP for each new line you build), but seems very unnatural. It makes joining up different parts of your network near impossible.

Anyway, if you like this sort of thing, you'll love Steam. If you don't, you won't.

This is damn near overtaking my favorite spot for train games.  A few tweaks here and there to transform the unforgiving Age of Steam into a game that can be taught and enjoyed by way more players.  I'll likely play this far more since it does have a game feel to it rather than a pure computation exercise.  The game grows beautifully and I'm really happy that the expansions I purchased for AoS work seamlessly with this new version.

RATING: 8.5
This game has a great deal in common with Railroad Tycoon. It's a very demanding game, and very tight. It adds some elements, around the way you upgrade engines, cities, and select turn order. It takes away the "reward cards" or whatever they're called in RRT. I'd say that I like each game almost the same. I like the game play in this one better, I like the epic scope of Railroad Tycoon. Since I love epic games, RRT gets the slight nod. Still, after only one play, it's a much loved train game.

EDIT: OK, after my second play, I see the very significant differences with RRT. I'll say I still like RRT more, but this one is lots of fun. Harder in lots of ways. Theres a very interesting mechanic where you take your increase for delivering goods either in income or VP. That's a very notable difference and makes the game, in my mind, more of a mental challenge.

Bleh.  I learned Steam first and expected it to be better, but once I played Age of Steam, I found it the much better game.  There's just too much power in immediate placement of three cubes.  It makes it impossible to gauge the intent of other players because they can make moves purely for screwage and still be able to maintain a good position because they don't have to be as forward-looking.  It drives the dollar auction to even further insanity.

Played the pre-release prototype at the UK Games Expo 2007.  In comparison to the original game, it's cleaner, it's crisper and it flows more.  There are fewer random elements, more elegant use of the income track and improved special actions.  In addition it will be fairly easy to adapt the second edition maps to this system, so owners of second edition AoS will have plenty to look forward to.  I am very keen on this new version of the game; however I am reserving my rating for now until I see the published version - it's unlikely to fall below a ten as it stands because I really want to play it again and again.

Even the basic game is fun. We didn't play with all the features but the game got reasonably competitive and we managed to get out of debt fairly quickly into the game. You got punished a little for a long path in the first game since one player never shipped goods on the first play.

Comment for the orginal Age of Steam, playable with this game:
The best "big game" I have played. Money is very tight, but if you don't overspend and are able to take advantage of the rare opportunities, you will succeed in building a very rewarding network. Spent 3 hours playing it, but it didn't look longer than a game of Tikal. Highly recommended.

Given that you can play the original Age of Steam with this game, it deserves the same rating. I would buy this version anytime over the new release of Age of Steam -- both by principles and to get a more flexible game.

RATING: 7
Good, cut throat and brain burning. Don't play when tired and never with AP prone players. Could have been better if the flow was somewhat more even, and if the theme was more in line with the mechanics. As it is now it's feeling a bit too abstract, although the components (while high quality) are partly to blame.

This is one of my all-time favorite games. Normally I play the called  "standard game" 'cause feel it more tight, tense and competitive; even though, I also enjoy the "basic game" 'cause it's more "friendly" but still has lots of strategy involved. 

I know there are many fans of Age of Steam, the "older brother" of Steam and I'm pretty sure that game must be incredibly good, but to me, Steam has all I have always wanted from a train themed game: lots of player interaction, extremely low luck factor, a system that allows different play-styles and rewards strategical thought, great components, etc. 

I own the map expansion #2. Which includes: 1st. China (a 2-3 players map and I love it for allowing an excellent Steam experience for 2 players); 2nd. California (a 3 players map that can be played like 2 different scenarios, one in present time and the other in a futuristic timeline); and 3rd. Great Britain (a brilliant expansion for 3-4 players that emulates the use of canals in the GB of the industrial revolution. My favorite Steam expansion to date.).  

What else can I say?... Spectacular! A must-have one!

A reworking and streamlining of an earlier Martin Wallace game. That does conjure up some bad memories. Unfortunately, they turn out to apply here as well. Fortunately, they do so to a much lower degree.

Much of the basic system remains unchanged. The major differences to AoS are the loan and income system which is much less brutal and therefore supposedly more suitable for new players, and a split between income for the companies and victory points for the players. Both of these don't seem much like improvements to me.

The game did improve on a somewhat smaller scale, though. Production now allows the player to choose from a limited selection of cubes instead of randomly drawing from the bag, and the costs for laying track make a little more sense, too.

Overall, Steam is no AoS. It is, however, still a very good game.

Steam is a "reimplementation" of the wonderfully cut-throat, tension-filled and truly strategic game [gameid=4098] 

Steam takes nearly everything that was good about [gameid=4098] and deletes it (through just a few, seemingly minor rules changes) completely ruining the game.  Then it adds a couple of rules that are nothing more than meaningless rules overhead in order to make itself “different”.  

What a disaster.

Steam takes a game that was truly unique among the pantheon of Eurogames and turns it into just another neutered, tactical waste of tablespace.  Burn it.

Steam (advanced game rules) makes some notable improvements on AoS, namely the city resources action is much improved. The game didn't feel quite as tight as AoS which I liked less. The build city option also seemed excessively powerful. I also did not like that you had to take either income or VPs. I like the one track tighter model of AoS. That said they are both games I enjoy but the map selection seems to be of the utmost importance.

After playing various AoS maps I think AoS is a much tighter game and much less forgiving so it is the better of the two.

Great economic game with a load of interaction - building tracks, sending cubes, bidding for position and choosing special tiles. I prefer it much more than RRT - it's heavier, tighter, deeper, with shorter railway links and without overproduced componets. Steam is much better produced than AoS - colors match (grey cubes go to grey cities), components are sturdy and good-looking, there are cardboard coins - much better than paper money (because money is not secret). I also like the changed production - production table in AoS is a worse solution IMO, because if you're unlucky some cubes will never be put on cities or will be put too late. I prefer to fight for putting cubes I want on cities I want. Spliting VP and income tracks in Steam also works good. To recap - I want to play more. One more thing - I can also play AoS. Both games are really good. I just find Steam better.

After 3 games I'm reverting to say that this is better than the original game and will probably only play this in the future.

For me it's enough different to own both, when you love the original one, but for most players it will be enogh with one of the games.

I like the goods production system more and I even liked the lack of auctions as it gives a different feel to the game. The changes makes it easier to get into (you are less prone to make fatal mistakes) and have a quicker play time. It is deep enough to have lots of interesting decisions each round. It’s more than just hard fun.

I played the prototype way back in 2007 and played the finished game 5 years later. Train games have a niche within boardgaming that can be hard to enter. Steam and Chicago Express are the entry level games and I like both but I am not tempted to go for any of the heavier games of this style.  The calculations in Steam get involved later in the game. I found myself making best guess goes because to play optimally I’d have had the other players climbing up the wall with boredom . May 2012

Interesting game about building lines to connect cities and then transporting goods between them. The longer the distance transported, the bigger the reward. This also means the game rewards you for being inefficient, taking the longest route possible.

Played Age of Steam way back in the past. I like the beginner version of Steam, but downscaled it from 9 to 8.5, because you hardly can play defensive by blocking (takes too long and it hardly delivers trading points). Maybe it will go up again when played by the advance rules, which seems a little bit more cutthroat.

RATING: 10
The basic game is a simpler version of Age of Steam, which speeds the game up for inexperienced players. But it still have many tough decisions.

I don't like the confusing double-printed tracks, murkier graphics, and insanely large Action tokens.
However, the new production action is a great improvement, and the split between income/victory points is inspired! Also, the ability to take out money whenever you need it (at a cost) is helpful to inexperienced players.

RATING: 7
With a Martin Wallace twist on train games, Steam isn't really a pickup and deliver game, even though it appears so. More of an economic engine builder, Steam is an excellent route building game where players constantly have to manage money in and out. There is a nice arc of play. In the beginning, income is a tremendous burden, but as play reaches the second half, income becomes a second thought, and the game focuses on route dominance.

After two plays of this, I dumped my copies of Age of Steam and Railroad Tycoon, This is definitely the best of the "Age of Steam" versions since it eliminates the (few) annoying mechanisms from it predecessors.  I highly recommend to play the basic version because it gets rid of the tiresome starting player auction, replacing it by a much simpler, faster and elegant mechanism, allowing players to concentrate on track building and cube delivery.  In addition to this, "Steam" has better board and pieces than "Age of Steam", but is not as grossly overproduced as "Railroad Tycoon".

I give him the maximum punctuation because it is my favorite game. Sincerely, I am sure that is not the most complete, but yes the one that more satisfies me. I enjoy very much in every item; on the other hand it has a design of precious board and a few components of quality; I believe that it is one of the best games in relation quality - price. I like to play it with any players' quantity, it yes, I prefer playing to the advanced way. It can be a bit agonizing if you do not control the different mechanics of the game.

The best thing about this game is that the company manager is on the £1 coin, and the worker is on the £10 coin. Score one for the workers.

Tight economic game that refines AoS and presents it with a range of rules varying between heartless economic crushing (original rules) and more friendly euro experience. Visually pleasing, coherent, clear layout. The gameplay is tight, highly competitive in indirect ways. Scores seem to group tightly together with basic rules, but I have only played with three and with more I can see a much more distinct separation of the pack as less space if available for everyone to build fully functioning networks. Enjoy playing, want to play more.

Wow, this kicks the tail off of railroad tycoon as a game, though the components aren't in the same ballpark.  Well balanced and improved in several ways.  Doesn't seem like a big step up in complexity either.  The system is clean and forgiving.  I'm guessing the advanced game gives you a more age-of-steam like feel, I played the basic version.  The version we played is a really tight and well balanced train game that I think is going to be really popular on BGG.  The tension, complexity, and tight design on an economic game reminds me of power grid.

My first play of this was with the Easy Game (not the Standard Game), and based on that, this game seems similar to Age of Steam, but not quite the same.  The game play is very similar, but the fact that the order of the next turn depends on which roles were chosen this time is quite a difference.  And of course the Easy Game has instant loans, which reduces one huge source of analysis paralysis.

RATING: 7.5
Wallace revision of classic AoS - played 1st solo game, basic version, and took half the game getting into the black.  This is difficult, even on the 'easy' setting, with as many choices as a game like Brass, but with significantly tougher access to profitability.

I waited a long time getting a VP engine going while I generated income potential 1st play, and in hindsight that might have been overly cautious (and more appropriate in the full 'Standard' game with AoS-like rules).

Rated this a 7 on 1st solo play, with a lot of potential upside based on additional play.  It may be real difficult selling this to the family though- this is a real gamers' game, with a lot of reward coming in the play, and not much mercy granted.

After playing with the 'Standard' game and also now having playing AoS (1x) and Railroad Tycoon (1x), I think I like Steam best of the three.

The greater control of Goods Growth appeals, as does the nicer artwork, with the simplicity of AoS, but a nicer look (like RT, but without the plastic bits).  Raised to a 7.5.

the epitome of what I don't like in a Martin Wallace design. shoot yourself in the foot to advance and if you somehow stall and need to walk again here's a new bullet; shoot the other foot. 
there are a lot of things going on that make it a game that a lot of people can enjoy, I just don't like making these kind of decisions. this is why 18xx and other heavy economic games don't interest me much.

Very nice RR-building game born from Age of Steam.  Two levels - basic, where turn order is determined from previous turn action and standard, where one bids for turn order as in AoS.  Payment mechanisms differ in each version, standard is like AoS.

Simple rules. No luck except for the initial layout of the cubes on the cities. I dislike betting for turn-order. The game is a race to reach and transport cubes.  If you invest in reaching a city for its cubes and an opponent is able to transport them first you've made a mistake. The game is very unforgiving of mistakes. AP inducing.

RATING: 7
After a disastrous introduction to Age of Steam, and being spoiled by Railroad Tycoon, I was hesitant to try Steam. It turns out that I like the "basic" version of Steam, without the maintenance costs and the flexibility to take loans at any time during your turn. The "standard" rules from what I hear are pretty much AOS--locomotive maintenance and loans only at the beginning of your turn. The basic rules do away with bidding for player order, and replace it with a cleaner, more streamlined mechanism.

I cannot reconcile the fact that I vehemently hate AOS, and the feeling it invoked when I played it. the standard rules for Steam seem to be the same. I don't think I'll care to play that version, but will insist on the "basic" rules.

As for the components, Steam is a massive improvement over the 2nd AOS (from what I could see in the photos), and still much better than the 3rd edition. The plastic trains in the 3rd edition just remind me that they were ripped off from Railroad Tycoon, where they are more at home. The graphics are gorgeous, and the wooden disks pay homage to the 2nd edition of AOS, although the board gets cluttered quickly with many colored wooden disks--not quite the impact of a developed RRT board.

The play is tighter than RRT, and the map is smaller, making for very cramped, if not cut-throat play. The rules for track-laying is cleaner than AOS, but not as simple as RRT. The Urbanization and City Growth options are straight-forward, instead of the convoluted, unpredictable setup in AOS. Otherwise, the options are the same between Steam and AOS. Also, there is no bidding for player order in the basic rules--order is determined by what action you picked the previous turn. This seems cleaner and faster than the clunky bidding in AOS.

All in all, I think playing AOS prepared me for Steam. I like the basic rules much better than AOS, and if I ever want to return to that hell that is AOS, I can switch over to "standard" rules and proceed to slash my wrists. It definitely scratches the AOS itch, if I ever had one, as Steam is more intense than RRT. The play is more fluid than AOS, but not as much as RRT. So, I'd say this is a happy medium between the two extremes. At least I don't need a large table to play this!

Update (01/22/12): Initial rating was an '8'. However, compared to RRT/RotW, I'd rather play those (and I own RRT). Do I want to own this? No. Do I have a desire to play this again? No. Downing to a '7'.

I know it is a highly abstracted game and complaining about this kind of this is ridiculous (since I'm not exactly consistent and let other games off the hook) but.....

The way track gets laid makes no sense given the scale of the game. You get more points for building less efficient rail systems. I didn't like having to grope in the box finding the track segment I wanted (or find that there was no longer one I could use).

If I liked other aspects of the game I probably wouldn't mind that kind of stuff nearly as much.

Comment from 2011: "I'm really glad I got to play this because I wanted to try & see why people love train games so much.  I've never been interested in these railway games & although I had quite a good time, the theme of building rail still bored me.

Martin Wallace is my favourite designer but I think I'll stick to his more war-themed games."  (I rated it a 5 at the time.)

Update: It looks like I'm finally growing up.  I acquired a copy of Steam & have been enjoying playing it.  I get a little bit of the feeling of Brass but can play with a wider range of players.

RATING: 8
Age of Steam with John Bohrer's contribution taken out, and very much the better for it. There's no random die rolling for goods growth, no dreary Rustbelt map. Strangely, the Basic Game is the better of the two rulesets with its rotating action selection mechanism a vast improvement on the ghastly auction for turn order in the Standard Game (at least if you want to go Standard there are now three strong action choices: locomotive, production and urbanize). 
In spite of its obvious cleverness, this is possibly the game that I most love to hate. It's all about minimaxing which isn't something I enjoy, nor something I'm  particularly good at. You can be quite arbitrarily screwed over by another player during building and shipping. Playing at low scale (2-3 player) avoids some of this, but 18xx is a vastly better train game.

I had fun, this game is just SO slow. I'm a very very quick player generally, but this game requires every shipment to be  super well thought out. And it's not interesting thinking, it's just looking at every dang cube on the board and thinking "hmm, where could this go?" Then you take whichever one gets you the most points.

First played September 30th, 2009. Taught in 20 min, played in 2.5 hours for 3 players. This game has pretty straitforward strategy and good strategy/luck balance. The object is to gain the most points by building you train empire in 10 rounds. The start player gets $0 and each following player gets $1 to begin. Each player has one of 7 options each round. The start player picks first, followed by the order on the "turn order track". 1) Be the start player, 2) Move goods first, 3) First build. 4) Lay 4 track instead of one, 5) City Growth (cost $2), 6) Add one locomotive (cost $4+$1*locomative total moving to), 7) Add new city (cost $6). Next players build 3 track (unless you get 4) starting with the player that took the build first action followed by "turn order" (tracks must connect to city or another track piece. If the track is not finished on the next round, it is removed). Next each player may take two move actions(move train down; or move a good between two cities gaining $1/city on the income track or 1unit/city moved on VP track; cubes are moved from one city to another until they reach the matching color of themselves; can only move one city per train track level you are currently at; if you move across an opponents track, they recieve the point). After movement, each player collects $ designated on the $ track. If it's negative, they pay that amount. Next turn order is reset based on lowest value first.

I'll never play with six players ever again. It drags out way too much. Three players just doesn't have enough grit. Four or Five players in my opinion is the sweet spot for this game. Most everyone likes playing. Beginners who play for the first time with six players say that they will never play this game again. And honestly I probably would have said the same thing however having played it with three and four players previously and enjoyed it, I like it soo much I bought it.

That's a darn good game boys and girls.  I really appreciate the compact presentation.  It's just a board and some tiles and a few extra bits.  Nothing like the fiasco that is Railroad Tycoon.

I've only played the Basic game, but I'd imagine that's all I'd play.  The decisions come fast and furious.  And it is fun to have your own little railroad barony by the end of the game.

As for specifics:

I do like action selection -> turn order.

Split Income/VP is just silly.  I'm thinking about bringing the AoS system back just for this part.

Double sided track tiles are SWEET.

Production is smooth a silk.  I thought it might ruin long term planning, but that's just silly.  With 12 options, the worst that can happen is you don't get your first pick.  The marginal value of the second choice is still pretty damn solid.

If you're a train fan, this is the one to grab.

Now I just have to offload my RRT for a chunk of change.

Aug17: Still solid.  Usually play a hodge-podge of Steam/AoS rules.

It's basically Age of Steam which I love, but it only gets a 9 from me because it hasn't cracked my top 10. The things I really enjoy about AoS are there in Steam. I dig the Basic game more than the standard. Might as well play the original AoS rules if you want the auction because I'm not sure the Income/VP split works with a turn Auction. It works much better with set costs for things like Urbanize and Loco. Lots of fun. Nice brain hurty.

Surprsingly good as I expected that messing up with AoS original mechanics can only end in sub-product.  Steam is basically on par with Age of Steam, but I go with the latter, because:

1. Steam is much much more forgiving.  I don't like that.
2. You have to adjust Steam to AoS maps.  I don't want adjusting, I just want playing them
3. Loco models in the newest edition of AoS show in much more clear way the network system (which links belong to who).  It's more difficult to read the map with wooden Steam discs.

Bokkensprong 19/09/14. Eerder strategisch spoorwegspel. Per beurt kies je eerst een actietegel, dan bouw je sporen (3), dan vervoer je goederen (blokjes in bepaalde kleur, die naar stad in die kleur moeten), en dan betaal je of krijg je geld ifv je positie op het "schuldenspoor".
Punten worden verdiend door goederen over je sporen te vervoeren of door anderen die iets over jouw sporen vervoeren. Goed spel, maar geen absolute topper.

This game was pretty good, but also it felt a bit too streamlined. I liked how the key to the game seemed to be to build track that everyone else wanted to use so other people gave you free points, but that's really all there was to the game. For me there's no reason to play this when something like Brass exists where you still have that aspect of putting yourself in position to take advantage of other people's needs, but then there's also more game to be had beyond that.

RATING: 8
Rating based on the "basic" rule set.  With those rules it's a streamlined version of Wallace's original classic AoS.  Some luck is reduced as the random cube draws for the entire game are done ahead of time so you know what you'll get if you take the city growth or urbanization actions. Board did get crowded with 4, not sure I can see playing 6 on this board.

Ok, I've just played for the 2nd time, 3 players with the "standard" rules (we also played on the more mountain USA side).  Rating stays the same (8).

And now played for 3rd time... with 4 players again... and regarding my comment above about not seeing it played with more than 4 on that board... didn't realize board is double sided with larger play area for 5 and 6 players.

By the way, side note... Steam does have sharp turn track pieces... Railroad Tycoon (aka Railways of the World) does not.

Great graphics. Solid take on the AoS/RRT type of game, with the Base game occupying a somewhat successful middle ground between the extremes represented by those two other games. The Standard game is *very* close to AoS.

I am not really a fan of the new concept of differentiating between income and points, and feel that both the AoS and RRT family of games have better, more intuitive economic models. That being said, Base game Steam is more accessible and approachable than AoS. Personally, I suspect that at the end of the day I prefer the added complexity and playing time of AoS, 'cause the auctions at the beginning of each turn really add to the game.

After half a dozen plays, I still think this is a great game. The auctions in the standard game create a nice self-balancing mechanism for the value of the various actions, and there are lots of significant decisions to be made. The game starts to shine when you know it well enough to plan your moves several turns in advance, and it's great when you can do the same thing for your opponents moves and see key opportunities to block them.

My only complaint is that the default map is a bit too open for three players. In my experience, this means that the map ends up roughly divided into thirds, and the player in the middle is the only person interacting with the other two players. That player can balance the game by making sure neither of the other players runs away with the game, but a couple of turns with less than maximum efficiency can make it hard for them to win. (This might be recency bias, though, since that's what happened in my most recent game. It was still close, though: there were only three points between first and third place.)

Was ready to be slightly disappointed with a bit of hope that the reworking of Age of Steam would be good in its own way (as I found Age of Industry was)... But I was really bored, the decisions were a lot more tactical than strategic, also, the nice pre-turnaround stress I would get in Age of Steam was completely absent.

Two years later and I played again with the auction and I've raised the score two points. It's quite a bit better (with the auction) but the tactical over strategic emphasis and the fact that cash is so easy to get still keep it way below the original.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (November 2010)

What a great game! I have played it long ago and I remember I did like the game, but I feel I was too new to the hobby to really appreciate this gem. I played it again yesterday and it was really great!

It is a very good meaty game, with low (zero?) luck after the setup. You have to carefully manage your debt (VPs vs. income, really interesting decisions) and really plan ahead. 

I don’t particularly like the trains theme, but it fits perfectly with the game mechanics, perhaps the game can take a long time to play with 4 or 5 players. The game components are gorgeous, way ahead of my copy of AoS.

I really want to play AoS again soon, I played it long ago and don’t remember the rules and differences. I know Steam is more forgiving, so I want to play the hardest game :D. I’m upgrading Steam rating to a 8.0. A very good game I will always play. When I play again AoS I will review this rating.

Current Rating: 8.0

I have played a lot of AoS recently. I don’t particularly subscribe to the philosophy that a game replaces another, but in this case AoS replaces Steam for me. I know Steam was released later, what I mean is that I don’t have any desire to play Steam because I prefer to play AoS, a superior game in my book. The only category in which Steam beats AoS, is the production values category. Steams is gorgeous while AoS is ugly.
 
Steam is a great game if you play with the advanced rules (that is a very similar game to AoS). If you play with the basic rules, Steam is merely an ok game as most of the tension goes away. Due to this, I’m downgrading its rating. I’m interested in trying the Barons expansion.

One of 2009´s favorites.

I am just not a Wallace guy.  Long setup, long game, convuluded ruleset, over done theme, and most importantly not fun for me.  This game is at least pretty which is more than I can say for several of Wallace's titles (admittedly they're becoming better).  

You would need the right group for this I would think.  If I'm going to invest the time I'd much rather play Le Havre or Shogun or Imperial 2030 or Indonesia or Risk 2210 or Axis and Allies etc.  I understand most if not all of these are fiddely but they also hold a higher fun factor for me.

Strategery at it's finest... a game where debt management and forward thinking is most critical.  

A GeekBuddy informed me that I didn't have a 'real' train game in my collection and suggested Age of Steam (thanks CB), so after much searching through this site I settled on Steam... to start with. 

I adore Steam and so does my family.  =D  Lucky me!  US/German area maps.  A well balanced and competitive game with a tight enough board map to keep all  players comfortably integrated.  The only randomness in this game is in the initial setup and placement of Goods cubes to cities.  After that I feel that any progress or lack of is of my own choosing.  The 'base rule' Turn Order established by prior selected Action tile is simply brilliant!

I now own and have played AoS and find both the auction for Play Order and Goods Growth/Production mechanism time consuming (though I do, however, understand and appreciate the inherent value of dollar auctions in a network building type game such as this).  I simply prefer the streamlined design and approach to Steam.

RATING: 8
There's definitely two schools of criticism on this game, those who rate the game as simply an inferior expansion map (with special rules) of the original Age of Steam and those who think it makes necessary improvements to a good, but flawed design. Although I have great love for Age of Steam, thinking of Steam as an expansion doesn't do the game justice.

While I like everything that Steam does, I still think Age of Steam does similar things more interestingly. At the core of why I prefer Age of Steam is the tightness of money. I found the relatively easy flow of money in Steam takes an edge off of everything else that happens in the game. In Age of Steam I'm sweating bullets over every share I issue. In Steam, I took $10, $15 on almost every turn with hardly a concern because of the delivery options available to me to make up the loss. Speaking of delivery options, while I like the idea of having all cubes that will be placed on the board through production known at the outset, I almost wish the cube lots were 2 cubes and not 3. Three seems like a lot and I never once felt like I was searching for deliveries to make. The boards that come with the base game are dense with towns and cities and few longer tracks (4+ tiles) ever need to be built. The choice between taking income or VP's was not at all a difficult decision, as some say it is. It's pretty obvious when to make the switch. The harder decisions were for players who were behind and didn't want to get left in the dust point-wise, but still needed to jack their income. For players in the lead, though, it was hardly a decision at all. I didn't dislike it, but I didn't think was an improvement. Both Age of Steam and Steam are very "gamey" in the calculation of points. But I like gamey!

All of that said, I do think Steam is really good. I'd be happy to play it any time. I just think I'd be happier playing Age of Steam. Steam doesn't improve the game, it just makes it more appealing for those who don't enjoy the harsh economic world of the earlier version. And playing Steam made me finally raise my AoS rating to a 10. I've decided to rate it as a system rather than a single boxed game. As a system it has proven its strength, versatility, and lasting appeal.

In some ways I liked this better than Railways of the World. Gaining a special benefit card each round added an interesting element. I really liked being able to select the color of the goods to add to towns. I also liked not having the cards that give bonuses. If you haven't played Railways of the World a lot, the cards are an added burden to figure out. Railways of the World had a less crowded map and I liked its artwork better. That game also had nicer pieces. They are both good games.

I only played Age of Steam twice before I played this in the expert version. So I'm not biased towards AoS. After first play I can't say which one I prefer and wouldn't mind playing either. The overall feel of the game is very similar with Steam feeling more polished (in a good way). The usual rough edges of Wallace's self-developed games have been flattened, e.g. the costs for building tracks are far more intuitive now and there is no single underpowered action anymore as has been the case in AoS with production. Steam also is more forgiving which is a plus for new gamers but which is probably the biggest drawback for longtime AoS'ers. We never had the feeling of fighting an uphill battle in our game and I can't imagine anybody ever going bankrupt in Steam. Both are great games and for the time being I rate them the same. Much more play needed - and wanted!

This is a thematic train game. 18xx games are just heavy economics games with a pasted on train theme. This is the game to play if you are actually in to trains.

Really like this one. Fun building your tracks and trying to come up with lucrative routes for transporting goods. Unfortunately, upgrading your steam train is a no-brainer; if you don't do it you'll fall behind, so no tension in whether to or not to. Also, the end of the game becomes a real brain-burner as you try to figure out how to get maximum points from transporting goods when the board is now very busy. Overall, good fun though.

An excellent game, if I gave 1/2 point ratings, I'd give it a 7.5.  Although I will always love the 18XX games the most, I really like this evolution of Age of Steam.  Its challenging, unlikely to play the same way twice in a row, quick and fun.

Steam, I can't explain my attraction to you. I mean, everyone tells me that you're, like, totally wrong for me, and I get that. You're not my type, really. Maybe I'm kidding myself. Maybe I should look at your backstabbing ways, your sometimes homely presentation, and your trail of lawsuits and run away screaming. I have a feeling there wouldn't be any being just friends with you; it's all-in or all-out. It could be a nasty breakup, and I've been hurt before. But I'm willing to risk my heart one more time.

Fuck. Now everyone I know has decided AoS is better. Might as well trade this.

Great components, with a couple of minor exceptions (the included
money is pretty bad). Get the first printing while it's still
available for sensible player colors in addition to the ones they
originally intended to have.

I mostly like the rules cleanups from AoS, but there's one change
included that just completely destroys the game: the handling of
income doesn't work at all. The VP vs. Income split doesn't seem to
add much. The insanely low maximum income limit means that everyone
has to take lots of loans to do anything. And the combination of no
income reduction and no ceiling on number of loans means that there's
pretty much no downside to taking the loans. Free money for everyone!
This seems to remove most of the tension from the game.

The lack of income reduction and the loose loan system also means that
there's a much bigger "rich get richer" effect than in AoS. It's just
easier to get a feedback cycle of good board position -> more
money -> better special powers from auction -> even better board
position going. The basic no-auction game kind of fixes this by removing
the auction, and thus breaking the feedback cycle. But I don't think
that just the track building and shipping is interesting enough for
such a long game.

The new production / urbanization actions work fine IMO, and I don't
mind the simplified track building costs.

I can't imagine this getting any more play than a generic mediocre AoS
expansion map though.

Very quick and smooth feeling M. Wallace game.  While I like some of his war-based games better and desperately await a reprinting of Princes of the Renaissance, I can still see what the fuss is all about.  I suspect even with the base game and the two maps that come with the game there's a lot of re-playability.

RATING: 7.5
First impression of a 3-player game was poor. Fortunately I've played AoS enough to know that the best games are 5 or 6, so I'm still reserving judgement.

Its in-between AoS and RRT (leaning more towards AoS-mechanics), and to be honest I find all 3 games too similar to warrant owning more than one. If I had to pick though, I would probably go for RRT/Rails of Europe. Its a bit lighter with more chrome and I like the bigger map.

After just one play I can see why so many could consider this or its predecessor as the best game there is. The game in itself is pretty much flawless and flows on quite fast. There is some serious thinking involved that may lead to some AP. The real problem of the concept, however, is the clear need for extra maps that will surely arise after a couple of plays with each of the maps included.

Similar to Steel Driver in the sense that it doesn't feel like you're doing anything to do with trains, or much to do with rails for that matter. Basic game took around four hours with six players (of which five were new to the game, but none had trouble grasping the rules or anything), which was a bit long. Apparently it says 90 minutes on the box.

Update: Raised the rating from 5 to 6 after a much more satisfying 3-player game on the U.S. map where I felt I had much more room to manoeuvre. It still took way too long (four and a half hours!), but the game wasn't entirely to blame.

Update again: Raised another point after a brutal 3-player game with standard rules where my position got kind of squashed but I still managed to finish second.

My first play wasn't all that much fun.  We jumped to the advanced game, and all the diehard AoS players grumbled about every change.  I went into a bit of a death spiral and merely held out from going bankrupt for the last half of the game.

My second play was with a smaller group of non-diehards.  We played the introductory game, and I had much more fun.  The introductory game is good, and I liked how the auction was retired.  

The easing on the credit is better - less waiting on players who plot their entire turn before issuing bonds.  The goods growth is more deterministic, and the urbanization is also nice where you pick your set of cubes.

All in all, I like the changes, and may flip my preference over to Steam, which appears to be a very good streamlining to the original.  I like that the new game will easily fit into an evening.

This rating also stands for age of steam. Honestly, it's a toss up between the two in terms of quality. Play the standard game. The unforgiving nature of age of steam remains intact, here. Bankruptcy is less common, but player elimination is a bit of a drag anyway. Age of Steam puts an emphasis on luck. A good roll of the production dice can save you. In Steam, it comes down to how much you're willing to sacrifice. Bidding is important in Age of Steam. In Steam, if you don't bid smartly, you will lose. There are no lucky rolls to save you.

Good remake of AOS that allows the game to see a wider audience with many of the more unforgiving elements of AOS modified to provide a less brutal game.

I have been excited to see Steam come out, ever since I finally tried Age of Steam and found that there would be two versions of the next edition.  I'm not taking sides -- I think Steam meets one need, and AoS would meet another.  I have gamer friends who have AoS.  I have Steam Basic to play with my folks, and Steam Standard to trot out the next weekend gaming session.
UPDATE: Actually -- I am sticking with Steam Basic.  I think the role selection mechanism determining your turn order actually works better than does the auction of Steam Standard.

Played several times, family and full versions.  Much more fun than Age of Steam.  Note that I said "fun" not "better."  I would play Steam with players of roughly the same skill level almost anytime it is requested; Age of Steam I would not.  The feeling of hopeless floundering occurred much less during Steam, and I felt that I had real options most of the time.  Steam also felt faster, but that might've been an illusion.  Family version is just as fun as full version, but more forgiving (obviously).  You'll need to know your audience to pick the proper version.

A decent game.  A bit long and involved for the actual gameplay content but the rich theme and high player interaction make up for it.  It's an euro with the potential to appeal to a non-euro crowd and the railroad/train theme is also pretty accessible.  Still fairly heavy with a potential for screwing yourself.  It's Wallace, so it's surprising that I'm not more enthusiastic but meh.  It's you've played Age of Steam or Railway to the World, it's roughly the same game.

I really enjoy Age of Steam (and own multiple boards of it).  I do like some aspects or key changes made with this version.  

(1) I like the new Goods Display and how delivery cubes come on to the board along with the new action of Goods Growth.

(2) I like all the new Actions and the money costs associated to take some of those actions.  

However, there is NO taxation in Steam, like there was in Age of Steam.  That's one less small layer that was great, serving as a balancing mechanic to prevent runaway leader issues.  There is also no limit on issuing shares for capitalization as long as you keep growing.  And, finally, scoring has changed from 3 VPs per Income (with -3 per Share Issued) to just 2 VPs.  This makes it more of a track building game.  Bottom line:  Steam is more streamlined but AoS is the real deal.  The best, in my opinion, is the incorporate my above (1) and (2) points into Age of Steam.

I abhor any train game, the theme is just a snorer for me. I thought I would really be bored when my group broke this one out. Honestly it wasn't too bad. Giving a 6 to a train game amounts to giving a 9 to any other themed game. The mechanics in this one remind me of Puerto Rico, but the play is a little less wordy. I only played the basic game, but I can't imagine playing any of the additonal rules. Like Power Grid this just gets a little too analysis prone near the end of the game, and that just slows games down, and makes it not fun ultimately. If I am in the right mood I wouldn't mind playing this again, but keep the rest of the train games away please.

I played the standard and basic versions of the game.  They both some interesting differences from Age of Steam.  I like the streamlined track costs in Steam compared to AOS.  I find the handling of shares/income to be a bit gamey (sometimes encouraging one to jockey for position relative to the 10 income cap with oddly sized deliveries).  I enjoy how the track doesn't bump down those in the higher income categories -- something I've always hated in AOS. The goods reseeding method is more under the control of the players and an improvement in my opinion.  This feels more like AOS than Railroad Tycoon.

2p ok certaines cartes sont mieux adaptées

variante 2p:

Phase 1 - This remains unchanged

Phase 2 - First player pays FULL cost of their bid, the second player pays HALF thie bid rounded up.
So if you bid anything above zero you will always pay something.

Phase 3 - This is the biggest portion of the variant. Action Tiles are set into groupings along the lines of the board.

Group 1 - Turn Order and First Move
Group 2 - Engineer and First Build
Group 3 - City Growth, Locomotive and Urbanization.
If a player chooses a special action from a group, the other player cannot choose ANY OF THE OTHER ACTIONS in that group.

Phase 4 and Phase 5 proceed as normal as well as Phase 6.

A short game is 10 turns, a LONG game is 12 turns.

I just want to explore it, I want to explore all the maps and really dive into the fundamental depth of such a system.

For the longest time I never had a 'genre' that was MY genre, or mechanism which I liked above all else... But 'Train games' (or route planning / pick up and delivery games) are THAT genre for me.

The only reason this isn't a 10 for me, is because I'm still exploring the tracks (eh?!). Steam may be the '10' game; or I may discover another game which I see as superior. Time will tell.

But bottom line... Steam = YES, ALWAYS YES for me currently.

I'm now pretty convinced that the genre "train games" is no more meaningful semantically than "network building games," and that's a good thing. Otherwise the world would not have such an array of interesting network building/train games like Chicago Express and Steam (and even Ticket to Ride, which I only enjoy mildly, but respect immensely as a design).

This thought came to mind because playing Steam brought into focus the fact that Chicago Express really is a stock game with a train element as a valuation engine, while Steam is a true train game, where the network building is at the heart of the action. One could reasonably argue that shipping goods is at the heart of Steam, but to me it felt more like a method of providing direction for the track-laying. Regardless, the game offers up some meaty decisions and the most interesting ones revolve around laying track. Even choosing your action tends to revolve around what you want to do with your track over the next couple of rounds. While it is hard to get truly blocked out (and yet it seems to happen at the very worst time), it can be mighty pricey to get to key locations if you don't arrive early enough. You generally need a steady supply of new cubes to ship to keep your head above water, too, so delaying more than a turn before tapping into new cubes can be painful.

This focus on track building makes sense of the cottage industry that has grown up around alternate maps. If you played a single map too many times in a row, you would probably exhaust the questions it asks of the players in a hurry; 4-6 plays, tops. New maps, if well-designed, pose new questions without the heavy overhead of learning an entirely new rules system each time. I suspect playing new maps can help you look through old maps with fresh insight, too.

The one weak spot in Steam is that the economic element doesn't sing, and that stands out in the midst of the interesting decisions elsewhere. While it is possible to get in over your head, it's unlikely, so debt doesn't have much sting in its tail. It's pretty much an automatic decision to let yourself slide 4 or even 5 notches into debt early in the game, since you will defang the debt with a cube delivery or two before you have to pay for it. I'm not sure what I'd like better – the simplicity of this system is almost a necessity to avoid distracting from the heart of the game too much – just that it needs more teeth.

By the way, Steam's set up is much more straightforward than all of the tiles make it look. It's not feasible to sort the track tiles, so you can pour them out in a big pile. If you keep the player tokens separated by colour when you store them, setup shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes.

I'm definitely looking forward to playing more Steam. I'm especially curious to see what effect loosening or tightening the board by playing with three or five does, since my one play is with four (on the Germany map).

Great economic and planning game. I really like the basic version which is deep enough but really streamlined. 

Pros:
- 2 maps
- very nice action selection system
- nice way to put cubes back on board (select them from an open display)
- 2 variants of play (basic + advance)
- lots of possible expansion maps

Cons:
- component are of weaker quality than Railroad tycoon
- very mathy
- newbie have a good chance to get crushed.

RATING: 10
An economic, route-building, pick-up-and-deliver game system.  It requires a lot of planning ahead.  The separated income and VP tracks pose some critical decisions.  What is the optimal time to transition from an economic engine to a VP-collecting engine?  The answer to this question can be highly dependent on the map being played, player position, the goods available, and play-styles of your opponents.  With all the fan-made expansion maps available, this system never gets old.  I like the flexibility in player count, with excellent maps available from 2 to 6 players.

The turn-order [b]auction[/b] (Steam "Standard" rules) makes money very tight, but still more forgiving than Age of Steam because bankruptcy (e.g. [i]player elimination[/i]) is a more difficult condition to trigger.  I count this an improvement, a feature, over AoS.  Paying locomotive costs each turn also means that every game won't be a race to Locomotive level 6.  Played by experienced players, it should theoretically result in the correct [i]pricing[/i] of actions, which should be very dynamic as the game progresses, as it is a function of board position, available cubes, and relative income/VP levels.  This is pretty brutal to new players because it requires careful planning.

Determining turn-order based on previous action-tile selection, the "Base" rules, is a totally different but still wonderful way to play.  This is a better method to learn the game, and is more convenient for online or PBF.  Also one does not need to pay maintenance on one's Locomotive level, so it usually behooves the players to race to level 6 as quickly as possible.

Tense competition for network-building and shipping goods, coupled with excruciating action-selection decisions [i]or[/i] auctions, make Steam one of my favorite euro games for 3-5 players.  Not to mention top-quality game components and a rich theme.  Has all the ingredients to make Steam a seriously wonderful...and wonderfully serious...strategy game.

Update:  I'm open to playing this house-ruling the AoS bankruptcy rules to Steam when playing with experienced players, to [i]raise the stakes[/i].  In other words, if at the end of a round a player is unable to meet one's Locomotive and/or Income expenses, then this opponent is immediately declared bankrupt and out of the game.  But I think this cut-throat rule is best for 2-player matches so that the game ends at this point.

The best train game ever made.  I love the simple role selection mechanic rather than the auction for turn order.  The game is simple and in many ways better than AoS or Railways of the World because of its simplicity.  But it also has rules to allow you to bid for turn order and requires you to allocate enough money early just like AoS if you prefer those rules.  The components work with AoS maps, but you need to remember that Grey and Black are interchangeable.  Also, Steam has a wonderful Steam Barons expansion which plays like an 18XX game in 2-3 hours.  It has three excellent map set explansions which allow you to play 2, 3 and all the way up to 7 player.  I cannot say enough good things about this game.

Though a relative simple game to learn, the depth and sophistication of [i]Steam[/i] makes this one of my favorite games. Moreover, it's competitive without being absolutely ruthless in it's execution. No meeples are killed in the playing of the game, but tracks can be cut off and cubes "stolen" and through it all things remain civil - I suppose it's because the railroad building theme is, well, "civilized".

Excellent game! Two games in one - the base game is quicker, slightly easier, and significantly more forgiving. The standard game is very much like Age of Steam, with a few tweaks on how income and goods supply are handled.

I like the game, but I have the same issue with this pick up and deliver game that many other gamers have pointed out on the message boards.

A simpler option to Age of Steam, this game hits the table more often than AoS. That's the selling point in my book. If you can't convince people to play it, then it's just something else to dust.

Okay, reality check.  I had this rated as a 6 as of Jan 2012 and it is now Jan 2015.  I have played Steam a couple of times since then and it has not endeared itself to me.  I realize that many people find the differences between Steam and Age of Steam to be minor, trivial, or mostly inconsequential, and that is fine for them.  If they get the same experience out of both then more power to them.

I, however, have become increasingly disappointed by the major changes that Steam implemented.  

Choosing income vs points seems to be a false choice for most of the game.  There is no incentive to get points early and not a lot of incentive to get income late.  I do not feel like the distinction provides much value.

Goods growth/new cities greatly damage the forward planning in the game.  In Age of Steam, you know what will likely come out and exactly where it will come out.  In Steam you are at the mercy of the other players and while you know what could come out, you, for the most part, have no control over where it will come out, nor when it will come out.  This, for me, generates more chaos than the random goods growth of Age of Steam.  You should keep in mind that I dislike randomness and luck in games.

As of Jan 2015 I am dropping this down to a 4.

Basic Game
Interesting.  The basic game is much better than RRT, but not as good as AoS.  Not having to plan expenses/shares takes a lot of punch out of the game.

While not having an auction tended to speed things up, the additional urbanization and production options and decisions tended to slow it back down in my group.  I look forward to the Standard Game.

1 play, 4 players, US map
2 plays, 5 players, Europe map

Standard Game
I finally got around to playing the standard game.  I probably won't play it that way again, as long as Age of Steam is available.  AoS is rougher around the edges, but I *like* it that way.

First Impression 7.5

Nice and satisfactory strategy game. We only have played the basic game so far, but is quite enjoyable for my family gaming group. I think the player count should be 4 or more for a better experience. Maybe the only thing to mention is that as the game requires a fair amount of concentration and mental gimnastic during game play, and as it may get a little long (2.5h - 3h+), is a good idea to let it rest for a while before the next game.

---------------------------------------------------------

Updated: 8

Still only played with the basic rules (and having played AoE I doubt I'll risk to play it with advanced rules... maybe too heavy for me), and I think this game is a real masterpiece. I keep thinking that two games, one after the other, maybe is too heavy for my brain, but nonetheless I like the game a lot.

RATING: 7
The mechanics are simple, but a very deep game with lots of options, not good for the overly-analytical. Upgrade your locomotives, and build track between towns and cities to deliver goods cubes to the cities they want to go to. High level of screwage between players. Must try this with Chicago Express trains and maybe Stone Age meeples to replace the boring disks. Includes the #1 Map Expansion for small player counts.

RATING: 8
As an avid railroad tycoon fan that had not played Steam, to me this game was fairly straightforward and in some ways much easier.  I do think the game must be played with enough players so that players are not left alone with large areas of space to "solitaire."  In my group, containing a good number of pick-up and deliver "masters" solitaire situations are automatic wins.

This game is an excellent improvement of Railroad Tycoon.
- it reduces randomness.
- it repaces the bidding process for start player each turn by relating it to the action you took the previous turn
The downside:
- you cannot complete routes anymore
- it makes a split between income and victory points. I am not sure about this feature. I think it makes the game simpler to play by adding another rule. I think I like RRT a bit better, there.

Rapidly becoming one of my favourite "long" games.  Theme is brilliantly implemented.  The lack of luck is a plus as players strive to build the best railways while being mindful of opponents strategies to do the same.  It's one of those games that will get fiendishly competitive once people pick up the basic strategies making for a compelling and satisfying gaming session.

Having now played the full game I think I prefer the base game.  Having to decide how much money you want before each round just adds to analysis paralysis and the auctions mean that you often don't have enough cash to compete with other players who can pull away while others are contending with bankruptcy issues.  With the base version money is always available meaning all players can always compete which is more satisfying.

Probably the most 'hardcore' game I own. I don't want to know what it's like vs. experienced players but I've enjoyed exploring it with other casual gamers. Looks much better than AoS. Evokes the theme pretty well, you have to build railroads effectively, so that they make sense and ship stuff where it needs to be. There are also auctions. Expansion maps are good, increase replayability and have more thematic touches. Steam Barons adds stock system and explodes your brains, no, actually it's great streamlined version of 18xx gaes.

2-Player Comment:
* I like Steam even with two, but most people probably won't. Unofficial 2p variant: 1 less cube in every city. Official Steam map expansions have maps that work well with two even among serious gamers. Steam Barons works well with two too, without any modifications.

3 players basic game, this is a very smart design with some brilliant mechanics, but it actually feels a little bit cold and dry for me. The rulebook is very well written though and the basic game at least, is really accesible. Standard game looks harder and the way to go now.

After a long time the game doesn't see table and apparently everything results a better/funnier choice than Steam...It's kind of sad since the game is good and I like it, but for now I'm not willing to keep in my collection games that I don't play. However if I can't sell or make a good trade with the game, I'll try to play the standard mode soon, perhaps it helps to change my mind.

Really enjoyed my first game of [i]Steam[/i] with three players.  The rules are very straightforward and game play is smooth, yet the game is fairly deep.  You need to consider what your opponents are planning to do and plan ahead to block and/or steal from them and at the same time make sure they don't do the same thing to you.

My only complaint is that the game board/map (we used the northeast US side) should have perhaps been a bit smaller with only three players.  I am looking forward to trying a game with 4-5 players.

Edit - We played the other side (Germany) with three players and it was better.  Will have to try some of the expansions soon as well as the standard game with auctions.

Excellent re-implementation of Age of Steam. The City Growth action and the urbanisation action are better in Steam, more control over which cubes go where and when. I play both AoS and Steam. Steam is more elegant, tighter in cubes and it's without that silly income reduction rule. AoS howeveer, has more financial tightness with the shares that are a burden for the rest of the game.

BTW, I log expansion-plays, not Steam every time I play it or I would be way into triple figures. My Steam plays are either the standard maps or prototype maps that are not in the BGG database (yet).

A very nice production from Mayfair and a very good game. So far I've only played the base game and haven't yet incorporated Steam Barons, which looks a little scary.

I like this quite a bit.  Feels a lot like AoS, but a bit of a change of pace.  Think I prefer AoS, but I'd be happy to play either of these great games.

Played this again using the "advanced" (aos-like) rules.  I rate it an 8 with those rules.  With the standard rules I would give it a 7.

RATING: 6
Build-an-engine economical game with a railroad theme, where however the railroad aspect isn't very well reflected in the game play except in that one lays down rail tracks. Medium complexity with rules that becomes natural after the first play-through. 

In Steam early choices matters, which unfortunately entails that hapless or inexperienced players will lag hopelessly behind after a few turns. Long session times and medium+low direct player interaction. Relatively boring bits pulls down the experience of the game, which relies heavily on its theme for player enjoyment.

As a boardgamejunkie I couldn't resist adding this to Age of Steam and Railroad Tycoon. 

Great game. I like it better than Railroad Tycoon.

The split between money and points makes it more tactical. I'm not sure if I prefer the "grab some cubes" instead of rolling for it (like in Age of Steam) though.

RATING: 9
So far this and age of steam are both very, very good with this being a little less fiddly but more chaotic than age of steam. The production of age of steam (random timing) I found more predictable than urbanization in steam (player controlled location - hence chaotic) but I'm not sure if that is better or worse.

RATING: 7
Tenuous - likely to be removed due to me getting AoS

It feels weird having this instead of Age of Steam which I'm quite sure I'd enjoy even more - but this is the one I'll get to play hereabouts so its both or this (and this for now then).

Based on a single digital play, I like it! It's far more abstracted and gamey than I thought it would be, but I can see why its necessary. At its core it really is combative network building, where you need to position yourself right both spatially and in the crucial auctions - With some tougher opposition I can easily see how this game would become quite the analytical grinder, as doing sums in your head and planning ahead is crucial. Your network and that of other players immediately are tightly interwoven and you need to see where they can get "at you". It was surprisingly confrontational, and the whole using other player's links to deliver adds to that (and while I can see the kingmaker scenario it doesn't bother me much, but it requires players to not "throw the game" by paying attention but they ought to do that anyway so)!

I also see (in part) how Steam differs from Age of Steam. And it affects the game in what I can only see to be a negative direction where the income / vp split just feels silly and how the goods growth is done ruins a lot of the spatial lookahead. Still I found I like this quite a bit (to the extent where I think I'd be happy to play both), but I would like to test the waters with those I tend to play with and see if they feel the same, otherwise I'm just ending up with an unplayed game.

Also, markedly less opaque than I had assumed it would be but sometimes that's what you want.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A good game, probably as good as Age of Steam and better than RRT. It's a little nicer, more forgiving version of AOS. If you want to be punished, play AOS. If you want something a tad lighter, go with Steam.
FYI: I played the basic version of the game: no auctions, no payment for upgraded engines. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Game in a Nutshell:  Borrow money, lay track, and deliver goods to earn income or gain victory points.

Played as: 3,4 player

Pros:  A game where pretty much everything is contested.  Whether it’s a special action, claiming the prime routes, or who’ll deliver those ever diminishing cubes first, you’re going to need to carefully plan for it in an ever fluid player-dictated environment.   Central to everything is how you start the game with nothing and need to go in the hole to fund your start up.  Climbing out of that hole is the best part as prices can escalate, especially in the auction, which can sometimes make or break your plans for the rest of the round. To sum it up the game is chock full of interesting decisions and situations.

Cons:  It’s no wonder there are so many expansions for the "Steam" games since it doesn’t take long for play to feel scripted on any given map. The included U.S. map really seems to channel play with three players.  Lacks a good turn-structure player aid as there is already enough to think about than remembering which of seven phases is next in the round.  It also doesn’t help the rule book is written like a magazine article rather than something outlined for easy digestion and quick reference.

Other:  The "Basic" rules didn’t do much for me. The economic crunchy-ness was lacking and it simply became an exercise in who got to do what first. My advice is skip the basic game and go straight for the standard rules which are actually easier for new players to learn anyway.  Let the newbies buy capital as needed (instead of at the start of the round) for maybe the first game, and that’s it. Still not gentle enough? Then perhaps Steam wasn’t the right fit. 

Best Use:  A heavier Euro for a lighter crowd.

All of the Steam train games are good.  The track-laying/good delivery/city development cycle is satisfying.  I go back and forth whether I like this better than Railroad Tycoon.  Steam clearly is the better game from an "design" point of view, with tight balance, streamlined mechanics, and pretty, functional components.  But somehow I am drawn to the messier design of the other game.

Note to self: Test the following advice found in the comments section on TV's video comparison review of AOS:RotW:S.  Steam is better with 3-4p and Railways is better with 5-6p ("StexeGod" = commenter).

AOS is a different entity, AOS board hates you (the player) and fights you the entire game.  If you loose to the board, you are knocked out.  Different game than these two, need much more brain energy/time/focus to play AOS.  If someone else winds up reading this, AOS is not a "significant other game" (meaning causal gamer) where Railways or Steam could be if they are willing, AOS will just frustrate them away.  Save it for your gamer friends.

[u]08-Feb-2013[/u]:  This is a fairly straightforward train game (at least using the standard rules).  Everyone chooses a role/action at the beginning of the turn which they can use for additional actions during their standard turn of placing track and delivering goods.  The roles (again, under the standard ruleset) determine the next round's player order.  Based on how many goods and how far you deliver them on your turn will add to your income or your final VP.

The base game comes with two maps depending on player count, and there are many, many additional maps available for purchase.  The way income works can be a little wonky at first, but after a play or two, you should be creating a solid rail system and fighting over who will deliver those goods the furthest.

The components are excellent - nice, thick board; lots of pretty wooden cubes, sturdy tiles.  I can't wait to delve further into this one...hopefully soon.

[u]26-Jan-2014[/u]:  So I've played this several more times, all solo except for one PBF game (which was a lot of fun!).  I've played multiplayer solo, using a solo variant, and with a solo specific map.  I really do enjoy this game and am hoping that the new SoloPlay rules will allow me to get more out of this game than I probably will otherwise.

I still think it's an excellent game.  I love the map and watching the network of rails build and expand throughout the game.  I like how all of the markers look at the end of the game across the board.  I'm only familar with the Basic rules, and I think they work quite well with their ranking for next turn order.

This style of game does appeal to me and I may even look to add another train game or two over time.

I've only played once and basically it's a more streamlined version of AoS.  Although the auction has been removed the rest of the game play is still just as engaging.  Loans are easier to manage and there's a more interesting luck-free mechanic to bring new resources onto the board.

More forgiving reprint of classic Age of Steam delivers both same style of gameplay (advanced version) as well as a more approachable 'easy' version to get folks into the game.

Traded this away after two games, I'll do just fine with Age of Steam.

This game has a brutal learning curve, and it is utterly unforgiving of mistakes. Add to that the fact that it is an exercise in brainblistering analysis paralysis and you have a game that takes too long, and is thus absent the significant tension caused by a tight flow of action and choice. I am irritated by this, perhaps more than I should be, but I felt like, in comparison to other economic games (Container, Imperial, CE) where the possibilities inherent in the mechanics are explicit and apparent, Steam has too much need for repeat play to grok it. That said, I was definitely intrigued by it, and I will play it again, but the experience, both intellectually and emotionally was more of a grind than I like. Perhaps future plays will soften the harsh edges?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very tight route building economics game.  I really like the early tension of not starting with any money and having to go in debt to begin constructing your rail lines.  As you start to climb into positive territory, you really feel like you've made an impact, which is when you can finally start honing in on victory points.

I finally got a real play of the Standard Rules in, and what a difference it makes! The endgame seemed similar to the Base Game's, with players making ridiculously long deliveries along increasingly contorted routes, but the opening felt entirely different--much tighter and challenging. The Standard Rules create more of an arc to the game, forcing your focus to shift through out the game. All in all a very pleasurable experience.

I still prefer Brass in this category of games, but Steam could go toe-to-toe with vanilla Age of Industry. The Base Game isn't as interesting but is definitely useful for its accessibility. I'd rate it a notch lower.

I couldn't care less about trains, but Steam is a game that I very much enjoy. It combines route-building and pick-up-and-deliver in a very streamlined and elegant way. It sort of feels like Ticket to Ride meets Puerto Rico, which are both games I enjoy. The game goes on a tad long for my tastes, but the experience is solid. There is potential for king-making here, but otherwise this is joining Brass as a favored game from Martin Wallace in my collection.

UPDATE: Considered increasing this to a 10, but there is a definite kingmaking problem that occasionally rears its ugly head.

This is a brilliant design, easy to understand but there's a lot going on, from managing your short term tactical play to screw up your opponent and kickstarting your income, to planning for the long-term big deliveries.  A streamlined game that is interactive, and demands lots of different skills from players. It's a highly satisfying experience to make a good route capable of shipping goods in the most profitable way.

Back in 2007, I played Age of Steam for the first time. I was amazed. It quickly became my favorite game beyond discussion...

Last night (14/10/09) I played Steam. A newly refreshed version of Age of Steam. In one word: WOW.

Steam not only runs smoother than Age of Steam, but also keeps the tension at its maximun during game time. We played the normal version, but we also noticed that the game came also with a "Retro" version included. Versatility at its maximum level, Steam is about to take the throne Age of Steam took two years ago as my favorite game.

The only issue I would see is the map compatibility. I will wait for the map adaptations to the new rules Mr. Ted is doing to decide my final veredict.

The last thing I must say is... STEAM is the best game I've played this year, and the best money in games I've spent in 2009. Great game.

I played this game like six months ago... and I really don't enjoy it anymore. The tension the original Age of Steam brings to the table, is not present with this one. Down to seven, and probably I'm going to sell my copy and stick with the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Yet another version of Age of Steam, with a "base" version and a "standard" version. The base game, is easier to play, and is summarized here: 

1. There is a VP track and an income track (ranging from -10 to +10). When one ships goods, they can choose to increase either VPs or income; one or the other but not both. At the end of the turn, if one has positive income, they get that amount, if they are in the negative, they have to pay that amount. Instead of issuing shares, if one needs money, they simply lower their income by one, and get $5. At the end of the game, VPs for income are counted as follows: if you are positive, that amount is halved and added to your score. If you have negative income, that amount is multiplied by two and subtracted from your score. 

2. You only bid for starting position at the beginning of the game. Players bid to see who goes first, then players bid next to see who goes second and so on. The player winning the bid then selects a tile from the following: #1 Go first in the next round; #2 Ship cubes first, #3 Engineer: build 4 track; #4 build first, #5 City growth, adding three cubes to a city, #6 Locomotive, adding a locomotive to your train at a cost of $4 plus the level you are upgrading to, #7 Urbanization, costs $6, lets you add a new city with three colored cubes. On the next turn, turn order is determined by the number of your tile. Whoever has the lowest tile number, gets to go first. 

3. The gameboard also has 12 spots for three randomly drawn colored cubes. Whoever chooses urbanization or city growth gets to choose a batch of cubes to put on a city. When all the batches of cubes run out, there is no replenishment. A city may only get at most one added batch of cubes. A token is used to mark cities that have received a batch of cubes.
 
There are two maps, a USA/Canada and Germany map.

With 4 players, the game seems balanced and tense as the original AoS. With 5 players, near the end, we were running out of straight and curved tracks, so we could not complete some links at the end, which skewed the game a bit. I would rate this game a 7, but in the five player game, with tracks running out, it doesn't really help the game, so I would give it a rating of 6.5. I think they could have solved this problem by supplying a few more straight and curved tracks. I enjoyed this game with 3 players, and the turns go fast. So I think the sweet spot is 3-4 players.

Very much the lovechild of Age of Steam and Railways of the World, both of which I own.  Its nominal parents each successfully fill their respective niches, while Steam attempts to be both at once.
Steam has the flexibility of AoS, but without the hard edge and without the need to plan and budget every turn.  Although visually similar to AoS, it plays closer to RotW, being just fun - if somewhat ineffectual.

Though I respect this game, the way it plays, and what it offers, it doesn't really do it for me, and I'm not sure why.

I think part of it is the relatively high availability of track tiles-- there's no scarcity. In a game with tile-placement, not making strong meaningful decision-making as to which pieces to use just makes me sad.

The game is very tight and cutthroat, though. Someone who aggressively tries to hinder you can really blow you out.

I played a 3p basic game and now my head hurts... in a good way

can't wait to try the standard game, with more players

edit: even better with more plays, and more players. I'm really happy to own this.

It is a bit... I'm not sure, mechanical? emotionless? Building, planning, calculating. A cube here, bits of track there. The game pushes you towards doing the best you can, and hoping it will be enough. Tense, cerebral.

I do miss moments where you can relax, sit back, feel confident that you're doing well, seeking opportunities for clever tactical moves, swingy plays, bluff, bribe, negotiate... Steam has none of that. It's a struggle against the game itself, turn after turn after turn. Multiplayer chess.

RATING: 6.5
If I were a train game fan specifically this is probably near the pinnacle for anyone seeking a grind stone to press the brain on that's train oriented. It gets a lower rating for me personally as I like all games but am not specifically a train game fan. So some other game types/mechanics offering a similar level of brain drain will get played more at our table. A long game for sure, in the 2-3+ hour range depending on your table's chop chop level. Extremely low luck factor means you'll only have yourself to blame when it's going south, but that's kind of the hall mark of serious games for serious gamers anyway. If you like this zone of game play difficulty and like train games this is likely a must have for your collection. However I do warn that it's a long game and it's rules can be a bit arduous. At 5 or more players this can be a grindy game to trudge through.

Not bad at all, but I prefer Railroad Tycoon. My only real beef is that other than building track, the actions can only be done by one player each round. Need to urbanize a town? Too bad if someone else beat you to it.  It's a cool mechanic for a game like Puerto Rico, but in Steam, it's frustrating to have all of your planning ruined because you were 3rd in the turn order.  

I'd still play again, though.

Steam is a pick-up-and-deliver game with elements from economics, resource management, and network building. The game mechanics integrate wonderfully with the theme. It is somewhat involved in that each turn has multiple phases and it has a good bit of a learning curve. The downside is that the (English) rule book isn't the most well written and the searching for tiles in the tile pool can sometimes take a while. Also, while the game can play 5, it shines at 3 and 4. Games with 5 can get a tad long drawn. I expect this rating will improve as I play more games and appreciate the possible strategies more.

Only played the basic game with three players but enjoyed it more than Age of Steam, but only slightly. I think the game is neat but there is not enough luck involved for my taste and it is more or less a brain burning puzzle game and the eggheads will usually just solve the board and beat you to it. Also, towards the end (the last few rounds), the games becomes less about expansion than about repeatedly running the already efficient machine which I found a bit stalling. Still, neat game and I would play again.

Fun to make tracks and deliver goods. It's a bit counterintuitive, because you really want to make loops between places, as when you deliver you want to maximize the number of cities you go through. Once you understand that, this is a lot of fun. We play the Base game.

The upside:
-Works on several criticisms made about Age of Steam.
-Two maps, and two ways to play. Basically you get two pairs of map/rules for beginners and experienced gamers.
-Apparently interesting decisions on how to destribute your income.

The downside:
-A tentative improvement of Age of Steam without fully achievement of a better game. It's trying to give the villain a more human side, without making it a better character. In fact, it probably made it a little less special.

A really great game with some neat stuff going on. It seems at first to be a combination of Catan and Eurorails as hexes are used to build rails.  But there's more here than that.  The role selection is pretty cool, and the pick-up deliver system is a little to restrictive for my liking, but at the same time that makes this place challenging.  I love the components and the enhanced difficulty from most gateway games.

I've always felt Wallace games nearly always descend into near chaos by the conclusion. Elegant, they are not. Brass changed my opinion, but Steam doesn't. Everything works, but by the end of every game there's so many tracks and control markers, I tend to feel a migraine coming on. The basic game is enough for me - there's something overly spatial about the game that makes me want to give up by the end. But, puzzle like, I do feel like coming back to trying to crack the code.

Wow. Steam is neat.  You really have to think about what you're doing when you build each section of track.  Also, it's important to not let one player get ahead of the other players.  Going into debt a lot only works if you've got a better plan than anyone else.  It's enjoyable after to have a game where each player's decisions wholly determine the winner.  However, Steam is not a game that I'd ever say lets play again immediately after one play.  One game is enjoyable, but more than enough.

***Update***

I raised my rating to a nine because Steam is my go-to game to bring to game day.  It's deep, interesting, there is conflict without being mean and backstabby, and I just want to play it.  Also, I'm not very good at it, so I learn more about how to approach the game each time I play.  It's a game that builds upon itself.  

I have yet to play the standard version.  So far, I have only played the basic version.

I played it twice now and both times i had no desire to play well, which is quite odd for a strategy game. 

There is of course a strategy involved, but it seems like there is no such a thing like different strategy. Perfecting best opening railroads, optimal auctions and optimal transition point from money making to points making is not interesting at all for me.

If there was nothing better on a shelf i would play it without complaining but that's it.

Surprisingly good. Love the delicate balance of scoring as many points for yourself while giving your opponent as few as possible. I didn't particularly like the drab appearance of the board, but the tight mechanics more than make up for it. Perhaps my biggest complaint about the game is the high likelihood of analysis paralysis, especially in the later rounds of the game as resources become tight, but it just wouldn't be the same great game if you were to change that.

Okay, I really enjoy playing this one. I like the busy-looking of the board after we played it. lots of movement, chits, colorful cube, complicated track. 

Designing a Demand/Supply line is a plus for me, with train track that can go over and under? .You need to do it quick unless your friend will do it before you, Player interaction is very good in this game.

The Loan part is also good, you start from loss and keep building until gain profit. The magic is come from your skill. 

Not a big fan of Auctioning for the Turn Order, not bad could be better I think. 

*Actually I think I prefer the AoS rule a bit more, but this one is better for my group because we don't play very often. AoS require more time until familiar with game.

A bit more player chaos and less predictability than Age of Steam. With the "basic" rules it is a bit less cut-throat. But like Age of Steam, it is probably not a game for casual players. Either you get into it and get good at it, or it's probably not worth bothering with.

I expected big things from this game. It looked like a mix of Ticket to Ride and Power Grid, which is kind of is. The thing about Steam is that it feel a little TOO long towards the end of the game. I like long games, like Eclipse, but you are constantly evolving and your decisions change. Steam is long for the sake of being long. I think if you played less rounds, and gave players more chances to build track and make deliveries, it could be a better game.

Very good pick-up-and-deliver train game. There is much interaction on the map, but also about who gets to deliver cubes first. Blocking of connections can become very mean. 

I do not like that there is quite some AP potential, when you try to determine which delivery gives you the most points, but which other delivery could give your opponent many points, and so on. 

I like Steam more than Railways of the World (or Railroad Tycoon), since I prefer the role selection to the cards. I also think that constructing railways is superior in steam, since the tracktiles with crossings and this little towns offer much more variety. The maps are also better balanced.

Update: After my third game I have to come to the conclusion that Steam is a bit too exhausting for me. This looking at the board and searching for optimal ways to transport cubes and looking for the best cube to move is more work than fun. It is also a bit repetitive. The game is still good and very interactive, but not an outstanding game to me.

Just played Morgan's (sisteray) demo copy yesterday at PrezCon '09 with my buddy Jeff.  Morgan was a laid-back, thorough, and patient teacher and I really liked the game at lot.  It was the only reason we drove the 85 minutes to Charlottesville.

Now, April can't get here soon enough so I can get my own copy.

For what it's worth, I've never played Age of Steam or Railroad Tycoon so I can't compare them to Steam.  All I can say is that Steam's an easy "8" and will almost surely grow once I've played it more.

Edit (March 26th, '09): I've played a bunch of games lately with AoS components.  Two or three times as Steam and two or three times as straight AoS.  Really enjoying the games.  Both of them.  I've pre-ordered Steam.  Still very pumped... but sick of negativity in the Steam threads.

Edit (June 22nd, '09): Steam's coming tomorrow by FedEx.  I'm pumped.  Pretty sure that my 8.5 rating will go up once I've played it more than just at PrezCon.

Edit (Aug '09): Sad for me... I love the game, but my buddies aren't so crazy about it so it doesn't get played.

Edit (Oct '09): Superbad news here.  Now I don't really like Steam.  Maybe need to try 2-person games with Jeff.  I like solo, but with a group it's become a drag.  There are probably 30 games I'd rather play.  Could be a long, long time before I pull it out again......

Edit (Feb. 11): Up again. Bumped rating up from 6.5 t0 7.5 after an enjoyable game at PrezCon with Jeff, Nate, Tom, and a stranger (Edward).

 Never got a chance to play the original Age of Steam, thought about buying it, enjoy Railroad Tycoon and not neccessarily a huge Train game fan but Steam is awesome and only after one play so far. Boycotting the new Age of Steam due to the rights issues. I will be playing this game much more in the future and am a big fan of Wallace's games, great designer.

Really enjoy the game. There is an initial assumption that if you start last in round one that you can never recover from it. We played the base game with this try. I'll have to dig deeper into the standard variant and see if this changes things a bit for next time.

I had Age of Steam and got rid of it due to the harshness of the market for new players (i.e. every time I played the first few times I was bankrupt by turn 3). Steam fixed that with two sets of rules to allow you to ease into the more cutthroat bidding mechanisms. It also incorporated a bunch of the separate game mats into the design of the board, which I like. This is a fantastic game, and I've been playing the Android version quite a bit.

Rating for the "standard variant", not the base game, which I have yet to play.

Has a similar feel to Brass. Players can place their tracks in such a way to encourage their opponents to use them to ship goods, enabling players to score points even when it isn't their turn.

On it's own merits, Steam is an extremely good game. Streamlined, efficient, pleasantly heavy, and plenty of fun. 

As for the new elements, I like most of them as much or better than their previous implementations. I like the split victory/income tracks without the income reduction. I like having the option of playing a quicker game without an auction, the flexibility of the loan system, and the less random (though more chaotic) way that cubes are introduced onto the board. I generally like when choices like this are given to the players instead of to dice. 

All the elements work very well; it is balanced, quick playing with plenty of tough decisions both tactical and strategic. This is what I would have rated it if Age of Steam never existed.

This is one of my favorites. It is an instant classic. It just feels right.

So, some of my friends didn't like it and it never got to the table. So, I traded it for a game that is out of print and it was a great up trade. Probably got twice the price for it. Afterwards I was kind of upset. I really enjoyed the game. So, I went on vacation and the had a flgs so I stopped in. They were selling their old used demo copies. There there Steam was. For $10. The guy said it was probably very used and that I should count the pieces. I went to the table to count the pieces and the game had never been played. It had never been punched. I still counted and everything was there. This was awesome.

 Overall a good game. Plays smooth, the dichotomy between scoring and economy gives the game a nice transition between two different phases. At first looking to buildup the infrastructure while keeping you economy working, that progress towards a scoring race. There are plenty of opportunities for player interaction.

 Unfortunately there are some rough edges. First, the Germany map doesn't provide any kind of interesting choices. It's mostly a big plain with some rivers, without choke points that would allow deep strategical choices. That stresses another problem: the rail network can became so intrincate that turn some phases into an analysis paralysis slowdown. The US map geography conversely reduces that problem to some extent. Another big problem is the scoring system, current player score is completely open, so in the lasts turns kingmaking became an real issue as players that cannot win are conditioned in their decisions.

 It also features one of the worst ever rulebooks I have ever seen. Sixteen pages that shouldn't have been more than 4-5 at most, incredibly redundant and incomplete.

This Game is not the Real Thing, It's a lighter game and inferior game compared with the Master Piece, Age of Steam.

It has some mechanics that speed up the game, like not having Goods Growth phase, those mechanics work fine, but, the game doesn't get better because of them, I would rather play Age of Steam for sure, even knowing that this game plays a little bit faster.

RATING: 8
Wow, we liked it more than we thought we would, after hearing how it was some devolved version of Age of Steam. We played with the full AoS style auction system. The chance-free production system seems better! The tile-laying costs do seem more elegant, once Petr pointed out the unifying logic behind them.

However we found the hieroglyphic role tiles to be annoying and hard to get used to, and the map's naturalistic art is prettier but provably less functional (as Macike got confused over whether a certain hex was mountain or not). Nice that it comes with 2 standard maps instead of 1. Need to play some more.

I have read various of the criticisms, and some seem valid:

1. Steam is more tactical and has less long-term planning because of the new production rules.
2. Steam's urbanization may be too powerful.
3. Issuing shares seems less costly, and possibly creates a runaway leader problem as a result of the ability to keep raising cash by issue shares once you're out of the hole and always win the auction while other players struggle to have cash.
4. The split VP/income tracks means whoever starts earning VPs first will probably win the game, and that ultimately only the final runs matter for victory. In AoS all of your runs have some direct effect on your score in the end.
5. Points for links instead of track removes minor tactics of building more track for points, using engineer, and urbanizing to cost someone track points. It seems done only to save time in scoring.

Maybe the best option is simply to play AoS with insta-production like from the London map?

RATING: 9
This game seems to hit all of the right spots for me.  You need to employ long-term strategic planning as well as tactical maneuvering.  Luck plays a factor but in the good way where it impacts all players equally.  A building game where you get to sit back and admire the empire you have built.  A great game that the whole family enjoys.

RATING: 10
This is a beautiful yet very tense game. You start off building simple connections just to ensure you recuperate your expenses. You ramp up throughout the game by building longer networks which in turn allow you to ship goods further for an even greater reward. The game is tense as you have to decide upfront how much money you need to bid and build tracks. Depending on the outcome of the bidding, you may not even be able to do what you had planned for. Always be prepared for plan B or C or .... I love this game.

A placeholder rating after first play. Perfectly fine, and maybe it has some potential. At the same time, I'm not sure the decision that this kind of game affords are very compelling for me personally. I played with the beginner rules of role selection, which is certainly more my speed. I can obviously see how the standard rules, using auctions, make the game much more compelling for those that like the economic sim angle on the game. I'm pretty certain that would make the game LESS fun for my personal taste though. But I liked Steam enough to give it another try, so we will see.

Interesting economic mechanics, but the game doesn't offer many possibilities to catch-up if you make a mistake. You can be blocked by other players and you can't do nothing about it but sitting there and wait bored and frustrated until the game is over. I prefer Railways of the World.

I don't like economic games (of the type where you run a a company for profit) very much, and the pick-up and deliver mechanic of Steam rubs me the wrong way as being unrealistic. Together with the requirement to predict your budget by taking debts, while your plans may be easily thwarted by opponents moves, it more then balances the childish fun of laying tracks.

To date, only played 2 player with the Mrs, essentially as learning games. Managed to confuse track points and track tiles on our first game, yet still found it very engaging. 2nd game using base game and half the US board went well, 3rd we use the whole board , which was more to the wife's liking; 4th we tried base rules but with paying for upkeep of locomotives, on a full board. This didn't work so well, we seemed to run out of options after making our choices in the initial rounds. 

Anyhoo, very nicely produced game, the Standard rules seem to have plenty if the cut-throat play that earlier incarnations are beloved for, the base game is, shockingly, a fun and accessible track building game. 

Looking forward to playing with 3 or more players.

I'm not a big fan of train games, but this is the one I like the best. Actually, I think I like it quite a bit. The board is very neat with all the levels and income for all to see. All the usual aspects of the Age of Steam genre are simplified here.

Income and loans reminds me of the simplicity of Brass, rather than the fiddling around you have with Age of Industry.

The best improvement is the goods supply track replacing the blind drawing from the bag during the game. Out the window is the annoying uncertainty and luck of pulling cubes from the bag that might benefit your opponents more than yourself. Now you can plan ahead looking at the available groups of cubes. It adds an extra consideration to plan ahead for - in a good way.

Action tiles remind me of Automobile - a significant little bonus/benefit here and there that impacts upon your turn order in the next round.

I quite like playing this.

RATING: 6
Good game about building rail networks and pick and deliver goods around, with the new feature that players must decide to score points or raise income for the cube movements.  Nevertheless, I prefer [i]Railroad Tycoon[/i] and sons better, probably because of the secret objectives, the bonus for building lines between certain cities and the graphical appearence.  I wouldn't say that this last game is easier or a downgraded version of [i]Steam[/i].

  We have now played with both sets of rules and love them both.  We like the base rules for a fun game with friends or just for the two of us.  We break out the standard rules for some real brain burning action with competitive gamers.  We also love that the game has the OPTION to go mellow or crank up the pain and competition, and I love having options!
  AoS was fantastic and I wasn't sure about the new production system in this new game, but after playing it, I'm sold.  This is a cleaner, less fiddly, easy on the eyes, easier to calculate the final score, AoS.  Sure this game may not be perfect but I like it and now it has become my favorite euro.

Have the Mighty Limited Edition: "Martin Wallace's Totally Renamed Train Game", which not only comes with the neat cover it also game with extra pieces like the first edition of the game did. Only 1 of 350, so that's pretty cool.

Steam is an amazing game. It requires a lot of strategy, route planning, money management, and you have to adjust your strategy a little bit each time. Plus, it has good player interaction, and while a meaty game, it doesn't at all feel like one of those multiplayer solitaire types.  I strongly recommend everyone who is into the heavier-type games to give this a try.

That's it?  That's all there is?  I had expected so much more and was quite disappointed after the end of my first play - standard version.  The auction mechanism felt clumsy and after two hours the experience was a let down. No tension, no excitement.  Nothing. 

Played a four player game, first time for all of us but three of us had read through the rules which were fairly easy to understand.  

We kept checking to make sure we weren't missing anything and it doesn't seem we were.  The game is nicely produced, the great bits, but that certainly isn't enough to bring this up to must play status.

I really like the core system that goes into these games, so it was a given that I would be purchasing this.  (Oh, yeah, it's a train game, too!)  Overall, the game is interesting enough, but nothing to really write home about.  The double sided simple tiles are fine, but the double sided town tiles are somewhat annoying to sort out at the beginning.  I defintely do not like the scoring by completed links as it encourages building a lot of little links instead of building a useful network.  It just feels gamey to me.  So far, I'm not a big fan of the stock system and the concurrent stock or VP choice.  I really do not like the limited range of the amount of income that you can develop.  As a minor quibble, I'm not terribly happy with some of the graphic design choices that were made, though there are some that I think were good.  Overall, the biggest problem I have with the game is that I can't shake the feeling that I could just be playing Railroad Tycoon or Age of Steam instead.  Maybe there is a place for the base game (which I haven't tried yet) but the standard game just doesn't stand out.  That's too bad.  [06/28/2009]

The complexity and cutthroat reputations of the 18XXs and Age of Steams of the world are mostly why I shied away from economic train games.

Then, I took a chance on this little brother in the train game family, Steam.

Wow- is this ever fun! I'm playing the 'base game' (no auctions) and am thoroughly impressed with how enjoyable building up a snaking rail network can be; the role selection that grants a special bonus and also determines player order streamlines play and provides a great tactical decision to the set-up of each round.

I am hoping that brain-burn and/or downtime doesn't prevent this from getting some 6-person plays.

Just awesome. Keep the expansions coming, please!

[2 plays] Loved it. Want to play again asap. This is the best of the Age of Steam / RR Tycoon type games. The auction stuff has been cleaned up in a very simple manner, leaving the interesting decision of how, where, and when to build your empire in reaction to the moves of the other players. Delicious.

Update after 2nd play 1/11:  Still convinced that this is the cleanest and most fun version of a rail game yet made. I need to make sure I push for more plays of it, and although I'm having fun, I'd also like to play it better than I have the first two times.

Nagyon sok jót hallottam erről a játékról, de az első játék vele elég nagy csalódást okozott. Nekem még az új megjelenésű változat sem nyújt vizuális téren kiemelkedőt.
Maga a játék pedig túl bonyolultnak tűnik. Pontosabban sok mindenre kell benne figyelni, szerintem túl sok mindenre, így elhúzódhat egy-egy játékos gondolkodása miatt. A túl sok dolog még önmagában nem lenne gond, de az ember szeretne a vasútépítésre jobban koncentrálni, de szinte nem is ez a fontos így valahogy épp ez az élmény veszik el a játékban. Maga a játékélmény sem volt emiatt túl pozitív. Mindenképpen kell majd neki még egy esélyt adni.

Ok, I think it is safe to rate this now.  I have to mention that I worked on this game.  Take that for what it is worth.  I should also mention that of the over 1,500 games I've rated here on the geek, Age of Steam is my favorite game.  

I've played quite a number of expansion maps from the original game so I'm used to how the system is manipulated to greater or lesser effect, but certainly creating different game play.

Well this is more of the same.  I feel that this is just another expansion, with some really fun rules that work toward a greater effect.

Martin took out the only thing that I thought was a flaw in the original game (production) and added a couple great twists (cleaning up bonds and income reduction and adding a money/vp decision). 

The "Basic Game", well, is basic.  I like how the auctions were removed for quick play and ease of learning.  I think it is good for people to have an easier option.  As an expansion, I give it an 8, which is still really a 10 (I rate expansion maps against each other rather than against all other games).  The "Standard Game" is fabu though.  

The Ruhr Valley is a very nice map, it has much of the feel of the original Rust Belt, but works a little better (It doesn't have section that is only viable for late builds the way the Rust Belt does in the midwest).  This can map get tough, I've already see two people almost go bankrupt (myself being one of them).

The NE US map is filled with terrain. It gets really expensive to build. Auctions get high here just to clinch the important efficient/cheaper builds.

All in all fantastic stuff.

I was expecting this to be really dry or really heavy. It has turned out to just be really fun. The process of slowly covering the board with your tracks, cutting people off and moving goods around for points is all so slick, intuitive and satisfying. I can't wait to play more of this.

Nice game. Plays nice, feels tight, tense, it's thoughtful,  competitive. No reason not to enjoy it unless you are scared of 'proper' games.

UPDATE: Sold it, there may be games where you see you can't win on turn 1/2 and there's 2 hours of game ahead, a deal breaker.

I've only played the Basic game, liked it a lot.  There was a good amount of tension trying to be the first to be able to ship a good from a city before an opponent did.  I liked the concept of having to go into debt initially.  My one gripe would be having to fish for a particular tile, but perhaps there's a better way to organize those tiles.

RATING: 9
Steam is a cut-throat network building game, where players vie to make the best deliveries to make the most profit. The graphical representation is top-notch as cities come in four colours and deliveries are made by taking coloured cubes to a city of the same colour. The length of the route used for a delivery determines how much that delivery is worth in either income or victory points. Take too little income and you might end up bankrupt; take too much income and you can no longer win the game. A turn order mechanism lets players take additional actions, like creating new cities, replenishing the board with extra deliveries, upgrading the range within they can make deliveries etc.

I've played both the basic and the standard game, the latter is my favorite. I don't care much for the turn order auction, but the added upkeep cost for locomotives and the restiction for loans are both great. Both planning and flexibilty become even more crucial.

Owned expansions: Map Expansion #1

RATING: 9
I like this so much more than Age of Steam, it's not even funny. I think that the game is more forgiving and less tight, and I think it's a little shorter and has less of a runaway leader mechanism to it.  There's still a fair amount of calculation to it, but I actually have enjoyed the braininess of it.

RATING: 7
Steam is deep, thematic, strategic, and tense. This is the best pick up and deliver game I've played and one of my favourite longer euros. Having said that, I'm interested to play the original Age of Steam, which appears to be more brutal and cutthroat.

RATING: 8
This rating is for the Base game. I enjoy it quite a bit, although I suspect the "2" role may be a bit overpowered. However, I don't really see the need to switch to the punishing AoS-style game. The Base game has plenty of meat and tension for me as is.

Almost a 10, except that I still prefer the original Age of Steam. Playing Steam, though, is a great way to get newbies into the system -- using the Base rules. But rather than play Standard, I'd prefer to just play the original!

Who came up with the "Base" vs. "Standard" nomenclature? I HATE it! They are very different games ... base should be standard, and standard should be auction version (sort of like Tikal)! Gamers don't generally want to play the basic version of anything, and the name "Base" is misleading -- that is the way to play this game, I think!

Base game: Wow! I was not expecting to enjoy this at all, but I am very pleasantly surprised by how well it works! All the roles now have some value throughout the game. The income vs VP decision is interesting -- like other economic euro games, when do you switch from one to the other? The new turn setting mechanism is smooth and makes the game play faster (and should be a LOT easier on AoS newbies). Track building rules are easy to remember, and the double-sided and town tokens work great. Urbanization and goods growth are well-balanced and smoothly integrated, too. And the board and bits are gorgeous! This ought to put Railroad Tycoon away -- this is a much better introduction to the game system!

Standard game: Good, but I prefer the original Age of version -- I LIKE the dice rolls for production!

RATING: 9
I like the changes to the basic game from Age of Steam.  The game is no longer a struggle to survive, but it is still a strategic and tactical challenge against the other players.  I like the way the actions are balanced against your future turn order.  Two of the most annoying aspects of AOS --the possibility of getting into a "dollar auction", and the income reduction, are gone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I don't think these brutally unforgiving economic games are for me.  I like my math fast and loose -- I COULD take the time to figure out the perfect move, but I don't enjoy doing that in a game as it leads to dreadful AP.  There are exceptions to this, but I don't think Steam is one of them.  Still, I'd probably give it another go if the chance arises and I'm feeling up for something heavy.

Having said that, I've also played Railroad Tycoon and I preferred it in just about every way I can think of.

RATING: 5
I had such a different picture in my mind when I imagined this game.  I've always heard that this is the definitive pickup and deliver game.  One that has garnered at least 3 redesigns and a bajillion expansions.  After playing it, I was a little let down.

The game is much simpler than I imagined as well.  Each round players will bid on turn order, then select a special ability, then build tracks, and finally move goods.  The special abilities are things like increasing your track level, placing new cities, building extra lengths of track, etc.  Once each player has built lengths of track they label those lengths with a marker, then they can move goods from one connected city to another matching that good's color.  For each length owned by a player traveled that player earns 1 victory point or 1 point in their income level.

That's it.  There's nothing more to it.  Perhaps the game has been expanded to be more in some of those bajillion expansions but strategies for games this one dimensional are usually pretty simple.  Make as much money as possible early and switch to making points at the right moment.  I found that the game started to get kind of boring 2/3 through my first game.

There is almost no variability or randomness in this game and to that end it felt very solvable.  If playing with a more experienced player you will probably lose just based on the fact that precise strategies and knowledge of the map give a player all the advantages in this game.  One such example is that certain of the special powers are MUCH better than others and not knowing which ones are the best in your first play finds you instantly falling behind.  Also knowing where to build on the map early and how much money in loans to take.  I saw all the experienced players making the same decisions every turn and that's not the kind of game I want to play.  I want to play a game differently every time and explore it.  If I solve a puzzle I don't feel like taking it apart and putting it back together the same way again.

The game doesn't even draw the eye or make you want to pay attention to it.  It's sleepy-looking with muted colors and nondescript wooden cubes and discs.  I'm glad I played it just because of the pedigree but wouldn't seek it out again and it's kind of soured me to vanilla pickup and deliver as well.

Great game. I really like it better than Age of Steam. It's more forgiven but it's still a hardcore gamers game. All the choices are there, the production is very good and the time of play is excellent. A good choice for train games.

If Raylroad Tycoon is too much simple and easy to play, Age of Steam too much cruel and hard to manage, Steam is the perfect meeting between both and my favorite train game at this point. I think Martin Wallace really got it right with Steam! Superb game.

Some rules changes made Steam better than Age of Steam IMO. I like the fact that city growing is not a random move that could makes things easier to lucky players. I prefer the kind of game that allows players to chose what they want.

The other rule change I like is the fact that players can't now transport a goods cube that it's not favorable to him, meaning that negative game play is no longer possible by principle. 

The third major change has to do with income and expenses. They both are easier to manage and make the game more friendly.

After a few more plays with only 3 players I'm starting to get a bit tired of the original map and I'm starting to think about new expansions, especially to play with 2/3 players, which is the range I get more often. I understand that this game should be played with more players - minimum four - but I can't gather enough people for that very often so I guess I'll have to go for the small maps expansions.
One of the things that are starting to bug me in Steam is the lack of surprise in the final scoring. I usually lose my games for a couple of points but it's really something I can see a few turns from ending and, in the last couple of games, I couldn't revert the situation. I'm not sure if this means that a good early start makes a too strong position or if it's just a coincidence...

if Steam didn't exist I would probably give AoS a 10 ^^

a few games under the belt so far - mostly 2 players; one on each side of the USA/Canada map (using Montreal - New York line as a divider), and then one on the printable Scotland map - which I think must be what it feels like with more players on the bigger maps - really claustrophobic and tense... and great!! The games tend to start friendly enough, shall we say?! and have been tight games with a few points in them.

Liz not such a huge fan, and it's a shame this has become a standing joke for a game she doesn't want to play... I'm sure she'd like it more if she really tried... wouldn't she? Wishful thinking?

Updated 2010 score of 8.5; reduced to 8.

The basic game is way more forgiving than Age of Steam but very enjoyable.  The basic game is good for teaching/learning but is not very challenging.  Have yet to get anyone to play the standard rules.  I like Age of Steam better but it doesn't ever come to the table whereas this will at least get played.  I am hoping that enough plays of this may generate interest in AoS.  Update:  After quite a few plays, the basic game is quite boring, only useful for teaching.  Standard rules are OK, but Age of Steam is far superior.

Don’t love how its separate from VP’s; but I understand why it’s that way.  Love the bidding for actions.  Don’t love the auto-locomotive upgrade for not shipping.

After a second basic game with three, the game is growing on me. I can see myself enjoying this a lot with different expansions. The problem is that you need players of comparible skill and experience. The latter is going to be a problem in my gaming group, as we play most games only a couple of times.

-----
Well, my first play of any game in the AoS family. While it's supposedly a lot easier on beginners who make early mistakes than AoS, this noob made an early mistake from whcih there was no catching up.

I enjoyed it nevertheless, althoug I guess I'm never going to like these Martic Wallace arithmetics games. Also, the end game was a bit anticlimatic. The game really was over before it was done (or the other way around). There wasn't much to do in the last two round by means of moving cubes around, so everybody started looking for easy connections.

Would like to play again, a tentative 6 for now.

Plays better with maximum people, for maximum interaction.  I may rate this higher if I get more plays in with maximum players.

Update:  We played with the more complex rules, and the max number of players, and the game tension was amazing.

My only complaint is that some folks are able to avoid interactions with the other players still, and they get a benefit for hiding in the corner, which is lame.

Update:  This game hasnt been as enjoyable as we've been getting into it.  It seems that 1 or 2 people usually run away with it, while 1 or 2 people get stuck in a tough spot.

I'm no AoS expert, having only played it 8 times, but Standard Steam doesn’t really feel less taxing. The Basic game is also great, perfect for those gentler occasions. The new goods production mechanisms and the income/VP decision introduce new elements to factor in. The production quality is good, but not astounding: the rules could do with being two complete standalone documents, the $1 coins are too small, and its slightly irritating the box doesn't accommodate AoS expansion maps.

Played once (standard version).  I definitely prefer Age of Steam and I will probably consider Steam a variant map.  As a variant map it provided a neat opportunity to explore the separate income and vp tracks.  It definitely changes the emphasis of the game.  I found it required longer term planning because it takes so much to break even and you haven't made any points yet...  Perhaps I just need to play it a couple more times to get a better feel for the differences.  2009/07/05

Like most Mayfair games, Steam needs to be played once or twice to get the rules down. But once you do, game play is pretty smooth. Having never played it's cousins, Age of Steam and Railways of the World, I can't compare them together. But I like the game and look forward to it's expansions, (kinda wish Steam Barons was cheaper, though)

I can see the elegance in the design and the interesting things the game does (I do love a bit of role selection), but the game just bores me to tears. The final few turns are just spent trying to nick the odd few cheap connections and while this game doesn't last too long, it is often won (or lost) in the first few turns, leaving you with an expected, unavoidable slog to the end.

A number of changes from Age of Steam make this a different game. It is AoS lite as Conquest of the Empire II is to Struggle of Empires.

**Update 2-22-2011
The changes from AoS simplify and speed a number of things up in the game. The more I play it, the more I think I actually prefer this version of the game. I'd be willing to play with the auction rules for turn order/power selection, but the changes to re-stocking goods and urbanization alone make this so much better.

Autant ma première partie d'Age of Steam m'avait laissé froid, autant j'ai appris à apprécier Steam/Age if Steam par la suite. Le jeu de base offre peu d'intérêt selon moi, mais je ne déteste pas les changements apportés aux règles avancées. Et comme on peut jouer à AoS avec Steam et que celui-ci est plus beau, pourquoi acheter AoS?

This is based on the excellent Age of Steam.  For a tight gamers game, this is hard to beat, but it also makes it hard (impossible) for new players to compete with those that study the game.  Great game overall.

I've just played basic so far, but I like it a lot. Bunches of interesting decisions come at you pretty relentlessly. Early to mid game is the most fun, late game can stretch out with long bouts of staring at those circuitous routes.

My answer to Ticket to Ride (yes, I know it's quite different, but still). I like the action selection, and instead of blocking, forcing your opponents to pay you to use their track. It's less grokky and more insidious. Also, the 'pickup and deliver'. I guess it just works for me as a train game.

Steam is a streamlined surprise for a train game.  Cash-starved, claustrophic, and now pretty, Steam could easily become the definitive gamers' train game (unless you insist on a stock market too).  The potential for AP with careful players is the only thing keeping it from being a 10.

Great theme, mechanics, strategy, tactics, balance, depth, player interaction. No randomness during the game but different setup. Fun factor is high. Many expansions. This game is different from a lot of other board games where you just chose from predefined options. In steam can you find beautiful,creative non obvious solutions. Awesome Game! Steam is my favorite game to bring to the table right now.

1st pl: Fun game. Everybody seemed to like it. 7.5

2nd pl: We had almost all the rules mixed up the first time. But it was still fun session. Looking forward to play it again. 7.5

3rd pl: This game is much better when you play the standard version. Everybody really enjoyed this session. 8.25

4th pl: This game is fantastic! It is one of the best boardgames I have played. It plays so tight and you have a lot of interesting options.Thank you Martin Wallace! 8.5

RATING: 7.5
I don't know what it is about train games, but I suck at them. I guess my head doesn't wrap around the idea of pick-up-and-deliver well yet. In my first play of this lat night, I got buried very early by miscalculating the amount of money I would need to cover my loan payouts + my locomotive upkeep. Huge mistake. There was no hope of me catching up and needless to say, there was no fun to be had as all my efforts were simply to try and keep afloat (in vain).

I know there's a good game here and I want to get it down so I can enjoy it more. I suspect my rating will go up after I grasp the strategies. For now, my only experience was an un-fun one. Keep in mind that I LOVE Brass. It just seems to me like this game system is way more unforgiving than Brass. The loads will break you if you're not careful.

I rate it a 7 after my initial experience. I really hope I enjoy it more with further plays.

Like Age of Steam with the tension and wealth of maps removed and Fisher-Price components. No concerns about profitability and debt limit here and no chance to play more maps at this point.

There might be some interesting maps coming out for this which improve it a lot, but for now it adds about as much to the family as Railroad Tycoon did and gets the same rating. I will play it, it's even kinda fun, but it's no Age of Steam.

First Impression:

Steam is better than railways of the world in my opinion, but not to the point to reverse my opinion on it. I dislike pick up and deliver games and I dislike train games and this one is both.

To make myself clear I think this is a good game - just not for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'd need a few more plays to crystallize my thoughts on this but that is unlikely as I consider Age of Steam to be so clearly superior that I can't see playing this again. Why take the brutal rough edges out of AoS?  It removes much of the tension while not appreciably shortening or simplifying the game. If I want a simpler game I'll go another step down and play RRT. So in the end this is neither fish nor fowl and suffers in comparison to both it's more difficult and simpler relatives.

Much to my surprise, everyone seems to have a strong preference between Age of Steam, Railroad Tycoon, and now Steam. I don't understand it. I've played all three and they're all great games. Actually, to be more accurate, they're all a great game (singular, not plural), with slight variations. These three games are so much more similar than anyone else ever seems to admit. They have a few small differences, but the essence of each game is the same. Some map expansions for Age of Steam change the game far more than either Railroad Tycoon or Steam change the game. To anyone outside the hobby or new to the hobby, the differences between these games (besides the obvious component differences) would be so minuscule as to seem ridiculous that anyone could have a strong preference; it's only from within the hobby that the differences can seem magnified and enormous. I really liked some of the rules tweaks in Steam, and prefer some things in Age of Steam, but they're just variants on the same game in my mind. For instance, I liked the way role selection worked in Steam, but the allocation of deliveries to victory points or income was not an interesting decision as I'd hoped. In the end, I think most people will just prefer whichever game of these three that they tried first, so those who started with Age of Steam will prefer it, but those who started with Steam will likely prefer that one. I started with Age of Steam years ago and have played it 35 times now, so I find myself preferring Age of Steam. If someone only has Railroad Tycoon or only has Steam, I'll gladly play those instead. I thoroughly enjoy expansion maps for Age of Steam, and these two sequels just feel like additional expansion maps with a few rules tweaks like most expansion maps have.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
If you think of this as AOS junior (or maybe AOS for dummies), you won't be far off.  Many of the rules are similar and people undertake similar actions.  There is just very little tension and too few interesting decisions to hold my attention.

Classic game of trains.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
[thing=27833][/thing] is an economic game abour route building and pick and deliver, coming from the same vein of [thing=4098][/thing] and [thing=17133][/thing], but lighter than the former and heavier than the latter.

[thing=27833][/thing] is drier than [thing=17133][/thing] and has more control. It is certainly better for those looking for a more strategic game, as [thing=27833][/thing] has no random elements once the set up is done, while [thing=17133][/thing] has the events and blind draw of cubes to put in cities. Still, more control doesn't translate to me as more fun, just more mental effort to maximize all actions done, leading to a lot of analisis before each decision, from the choice of the action tile, passing by the placing of rails, and finishing in the delivery of goods.

[thing=27833][/thing] is, therefore, a brain burner of a game, with players thinking about the possible connections, the potential advantages and timming of the action tiles, in the preparation for future deliveries and the development of trains, in the management of money and loans, and in the dispute for paths, cities and resources. Is a game of putting the finger in the eye of others, specially with higher players counts.

However, all this seriousness and complexity also leads the play to resemble too much like a movie session of a bad movie: long periods of silence broken by cursing.

In the end, [thing=27833][/thing] offers a good mental exercize, great to streach the strategy muscles, but I didn't found it particularly interesting for my tastes, nor truly a fun experience of play. I much rather play [thing=17133][/thing] or [thing=31730][/thing].

Having played both Age Of Steam (2nd ed) and Steam, I find that even the standard version of Steam is more accessible and less unforgiving than AoS is. It is also better looking. But make no mistake – it is still a gamer’s game with many options to consider each turn and a reasonably long playing time. And even though the rules quickly fall into place once you start playing, explaining them to newbies will take some time. All in all, I find that Steam, like AoS, offers a solid track building system with a good amount of turn angst. During my one play with five gamers, however, I did find it a bit abstract – feeling that the streamlining of AoS was done at the expense of the little bit of atmosphere it had. Also, the game peaked around the fifth (out of seven) turns, making the endgame feel a little anti-climactic.

On peut se lancer dans les 18xx. Mais on peut aussi se limiter à Steam et à ses extensions (cartes alternatives, Steam Barons). Car les 18xx reste un monde très vaste. Steam reste un bon standard. La mécanique du jeu est réaliste et le thème est bien présent. Le jeu peut plaire à un max de joueurs, contrairement aux 18xx en général, très nichés, parfois trop long ou avec un système complexe (pour rien). Steam a été repiqué avec le très simple Railways of the World ou a inspiré d'autres jeux similaires (que le adeptes de 18xx refusent de classer comme 18xx).

STANDARD GAME: Unfortunately, there's no way I can comment on this game without comparing it to Age of Steam.  This is obvious, certainly, but not very fair, since I am an Age of Steam junkie.  Steam will never compare well with Age of Steam.  There are some interesting things added to the system (the income track and VP track separation are interesting), other aspects of the system simplified (the cost of building track), and also some much-needed improvements to its pappy (the production rule is nice).  Unfortunately, none of it is anything I really enjoy in comparison.  The income/VP track separation is nice, but it means that you're never truly solvent in the game, since you will need to issue shares at some point in the future, because you can never earn enough money on one turn to pay for all the stuff you likely want to do on a turn; the track cost rules are ... well, actually, there's nothing wrong with that, because simple is always better; the production rule means that goods are even scarcer in Steam than on most Age of Steam maps, and it's not something I'm really wild about, given the way that Steam plays out.  I can't quite put my finger on why I don't like it that well, but it's certainly not that I have some emotional attachment to its pappy (seriously!).  I just find Age of Steam to be the better game between the two.

BASIC GAME: I figured that, Age of Steam snob that I am, that I wouldn't even want to play this version of the game, but I figured I ought to give it a try, just to be fair.  I liked it more than I expected to, and almost prefer it over the standard game, just because it moved faster, and was over sooner.  It's still Age of Steam, to some extent, but it's much looser, less constrained, and, aside from the track building, a little less competitive.  On the one hand, I figure this could be a good way to introduce folks to the system to move them up toward Age of Steam; on the other hand, you're really not exposing them to the pain that is Age of Steam.  You really have to start with the advanced stuff to get people used to how tight the game is.  I would play this again, but I'm not likely to pick it over Age of Steam.  Ever.

I liked controlling so many different aspects of the railways rather than just building tracks, but we messed up [i]so many rules[/i] during the initial play. I screwed myself over before we got halfway through the game, so it was a little difficult to enjoy the game after we realized our mistakes.

I could tell that this would be pretty fun if I fully understood what was going on, but the introductory game was exhausting.

Still kind of ugly.  Not AoS ugly, but after all this fuss and time....  I never have any sense, with either game, of it actually being set anywhere.  It's just a big abstract hex map with city names.  Boundaries would help a lot (coastline, state/country lines, etc.).

I like the split VP and income tracks, and I like the open, non-random goods growth.  I will never be an aficionado of this system, so "more approachable" is a virtue.  Still too many confusing, niggly rules.  Not sure towns add enough value for all the rule clutter.

RATING: 8
Probably the most solid though unforgiving rail game out there.  Very good gamer's game heavy on planning and calculating the best possible point routes.  Slight rules variations from the original Age of Steam but essentially the same game with upgraded components.

Takes a great game and makes it better, and much more attractive.

Finally played the "basic" game.  Not surprisingly, it is good too.  Not quite as tense, but a good starter game.

After a couple of plays with 6, I've come to the conclusion that I just don't like it as much with that many.

My favorite pick up and deliver route builder. Take loans to bid for turn order and invest in laying track to connect cities and to upgrade locomotives to deliver goods on long routes. Clever role choices allow for lots of decent moves and player screwage. I love the simple mechanic of color cubes going to matching city colors. The IOS version is great and so much easier to find and use the right track hex.

After 1st game. I think rating will increase, when I will learn game more (I hope so).

Really pretty issued game, maybe except coins (I would change them). I saw AoS, that is no comparison between them (except plastic train, but it's not TtR :D ).

2nd game in 5 players, much interesting than...

3rd game in 3 players.

RATING: 7
Feels to me like good old fashioned Age of Steam, with a few adjustments to the hem to allow for a bit more game forgiveness and to speed the game along a little. But the tension is still there for me. But begs the question, do I need this and Age of Steam. To me, not really.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game pretty much has it all.  It's a good-looking game, superbly designed and balanced, challenging even for genius board gamers, perfect length, and extremely expandable.  The mechanics are easy enough for veteran gamers to latch onto quickly, yet the number of possible moves in each turn is staggering, making this a brain-burner of the highest order.  But even though this game wears you out, it is fun to play.  You'll re-live your tough losses later as you recall the critical mistakes you made, and you'll also re-live your victories as you recall the good moves that carried you to the win.  You may beat the other players but you don't beat Steam.

Juego económico donde dirigimos una compañía de trenes. A lo largo del mapa deberemos construir nuestra red de ferrocarriles para transportar mercancías de un lugar a otro. Podremos usar las redes de otro jugador, pero ello le otorgará puntos de victoria también a él. Es de los pocos juegos que conlleva la eliminación de jugadores si estos llegan a entrar en bancarrota. Juego matemático y "quemacerebros". De lo mejor en su género.

Only have played a few games so far, but looks interesting and promising. Intense balancing between income and vp track. Also one must change strategy fast as there are not many turns, especially in 5-6 players game. Not very long game. There is a possibility to "hurt" others by stealing their goods or using their tracks (or even stealing tracks), so it's not a solitaire tracks building in mp game.

The first "real" train/economics game I've played. Definitely delivers. Very little luck, all player strategies. Only played the basic game but would probably stick with that...don't really think the stress of an advanced game is my thing. It took a while for me to digest the gameplay and I got beat pretty bad for it. 

Would definitely benefit from more plays and the rating would most likely go up. 

RotW is a much better fit for the group. Steam is a little too cut-throat and hardcore for people who only play 4-5 times a year.

I love the way the nature of the game changes from the beginning to the end and you're constantly forced to adjust your strategy based on how the board develops.

My only major complaint is the extent to which kingmaking can happen in the last few turns, but that's mostly unavoidable in a multiplayer game with this degree of interaction. Also, I'm only complaining about it because I lost by two points last night because of it. ;)

whew... i think Wallace can stop making train games now.  He's finally perfected Age of Steam.  maybe not the greatest game ever, but surely a classic.  this revision is brilliant and fun, and streamlined in just the right ways..  while i don't have enough plays of it to decide if it will outstrip the original, i can say that it is definitely worth playing.  Note: this is for the "base" game, not the advanced game.

I love the train theme, the track building and the network optimization. The simple economics system is admirable. The dual functions of the action tiles (basic game) are a lovely idea. The art quality varies, but is functional and clear. The color choices of the different playing pieces could be better, especially in less than optimal lightning conditions. I'm not sure I like the random distribution of the deliverable goods, but it wouldn't work as a static version, either. A lack of player interaction usually bothers me, but for some reason, not in Steam. You can sabotage your opponents in subtle ways... Very satisfying to win, and every little mistake will haunt you for a long time.

After 2+ Plays: The gameplay changes from Age of Steam are pretty minor, which for me is a very good thing.  Finally the game is available, and the graphics are nicer to boot.

After 10+ Plays: I simply don't get to play this game enough - it is definitely the most out of whack when comparing how much I like games to how much I play them.  I will just have to start creating new chances to play.

Rating based on first play with 3 players.  Grabbed me quick but started to drag a bit towards the end.  I think it might have been the fact that all three of us were learning and one guy screwed himself up so bad that he was out of the race by turn six.  The next for turns were me and the other guy leapfrogging our way to a near tie of 50 points (tie broken by the income level).  Think the rating will improve in the future.

06/29/09 - After one go, and a previous go at Age of Steam, I feel pretty confident I'm never going to be a fan of this type of game.  By this type, I mean the pickup and delivery of goods type of game.  My train games need a market I can influence, it would seem, in order for them to stick.  This shortcoming, coupled with the fact that I find the need for creative track-building (a boon for some) to be arbitrary and uninteresting, means I won't be lobbying for Steam when the question of what game to play arises.  I do recognize its appeal though, and I'm glad those who weren't ever quite satisfied with either Age of Steam or Railroad Tycoon finally have what appears to be a happy medium.

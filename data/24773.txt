An interesting play, if you can get over all of the different colors and how they might get confusing. Play is fast-paced with several interesting decisions each turn. The added benefit of this title is that once the flow of play is clearly understood, kids easily pick it up -- a good thing if you have young gamers in the bud at home. All in all, enjoyable -- and a great way to introduce yourself to the London Underground the next time you're in that fine city.

Very interesting passenger movement mechanic. It's totally different from Ticket to Ride. The track-building can cause some AP with certain players but it doesn't affect us so far. Really wonderful game.

There's a lot to think about here - whether to connect to the passenger or to complete a line.  I think it would take a few games to get a strategy down.  Really nice pieces and a cool theme.  Sort of like Ticket to Ride but more complex and I think more interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Much like TtR, requires more planning ahead. A good game, and the train-theme is always a bonus! 

A nice variant is to play it for 2-4 rounds first without moving the passanger and not drawing destination cards, but just building an underground network. It makes it more important to have good connections, when only the passenger moves in the last rounds.

Only 1 play with 3 player but a fun little game. It's a bit mathsy and there's not much forward planning you can do but doesn't bog down the game. Memory elements do play a part but is not defining part.

Cannot play this game enough, and being an Anglophile doesn't help that.  Build your networks to your advantage and (hopefully) to the advantage of the lazy passenger.  He'd rather ride three trains for hours than to walk one block, but hey, if that's what makes him happy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A Trans America-ish network building game with a novel in-game scoring mechanism; the passenger who travels around the board and scores you points if he uses your line.  There are some interesting trade-offs between building lines to suit the passenger and going for a line that will score points in the longer-term.  A good game, but a bit over-long and expect down time with four players thinking through multiple options.

RATING: 7
Very good 'connecting destinations' game. A busy commuter negotiates routes to London's tube stations and chooses the most convenient path possible. Points are awarded to the players whose track is used for the trip, and are also available for connecting to various locations.
Luck is definitely a factor, but accusations that you can't plan between turns only take into account one strategy, plus I found that discussions about the best available route kept me interested during downtime. I have been looking for a family friendly rail game to buy recently (which isn't TtR) and at the moment it looks like On the Underground might be the one.

Great game and a nice step up from gateway connection games such as Ticket to Ride and Thurn & Taxis (although it's really nothing like the two).  Is slightly more involved ruleswise (various little ways to score points), but the mechanics are intuitive.  Gameplay is essentially to lay down track, check for points, move the passenger and check for points a final time before the next player's turn.  The components and gameplay suit the theme well.  Overall, an excellent connection game which demands good forward planning and creates a lot of interesting tactical decisions each turn.  Plays best with 2 or 3 players.

The game is chaotic.
The component use too much color and its red and green can be identify as the similar color.

The theme that the passenger is riding the track is the fantastic theme.

RATING: 7
A great network building game.
I can be a little luck-driven with the draw of the destination station cards, but by no means excessively. Most of the time, it will win the player that has built the most efficient subway lines from the passenger point of view. Which is clever and very thematic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An okay route-building game.  I'm not sure we really fully explored the strategy.  Having the passenger is an interesting mechanic that reminds me of TTR: Marklin...but I liked this implementation better.  We house-ruled the end condition.  We ended when one player was either out of trains or could no longer make a legal play...the rules have you continuing to move the passenger until you exhaust the station deck...which would take FOREVER and end up being quite boring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

What appears to be a relatively light gateway game actually has some decisions to make and tempo to play for.  It's decidely not perfect, but I'd rather play this than ticket to ride.

A more advanced ticket to ride with a sort of pick up and deliver mechanism in the way of the tourist. The look of the board at the end is quiet pleasing as it resembles a underground map of your own creation :)

RATING: 5
not quite sure where to place this one, but i wouldn't like to try it again with 5 players.  lots of downtime, and no cause for interaction between turns aside from assisted calculations.  this game seems like it would be ideal for a play-by-web format with its solitaire turns and optimization-style play.  i'd give it another shot with 4 or hopefully less, but i think the klunk will keep me from digging it face to face.

I liked this one more my second time around. I am supernaturally bad at assigning a value to my possible moves... I need to care less about points for riding the rails and more about connecting things up, apparently. I've now gotten my heinie kicked twice!

RATING: 7.5
This is an excellent connection game that is light enough to play and teach easily, but has interesting decisions along the way.  Unlike other connection games, the best approach is not to 'chase the tickets', but to set up routes (subway lines) to locations that have NOT been played.  This requires a good memory of the board and the cards played.  There is a luck factor with the card draws but not enough to create a chaotic game.  Overall game play is rewarding and enjoyable.

Fun and creative connection game.  Multiple ways to get points means that even if you can't go for the passenger points you can still go for other points and don't have to worry about getting too far behind.

RATING: 6
A lot depends on the cards - it is possible to be one step away from destinations and receive nothing for a long track build,  and equally it is possible to be able to build just-in-time track and score good points each turn.  There is some ability to control things,  but I suspect less than you would imagine.

RATING: 7
Fun with 2 or 3 players. Some down time as each player tries to work out the route with the greatest potential reward.

RATING: 7
Would not play with more than three.  Engaging game, however there is little planning that can be done.  Passenger movement is well done, based on minimising walking distance and number (not length) of routes.  Seemed arbitrary that some turns were only one movement - i.e. no yellow stations.  Why not a yellow and a white pile?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad game.  I bought it before moving to London, and I'm glad I did.  It's definitely thinky, but not quite a brain-burner.  A fun theme and a light sorta route-builder and pick-up deliver style game.  worth a look.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game which seems to have a number of strategies to victory. Scales well to number of players - strategies change depending on the number of players. Can lead to 'analysis paralysis' in my group it we're not careful. Loops seem very swingy - particularly with lower numbers of players.

One play.  And boy was this different than how I thought this was going to play out.  One of the few times that my wife took on the responsibility of learning the rules so I wasn't prepared for how it all worked.   After figuring out the passenger mechanism, which is quite good, the game really demonstrated how good it could be.   I am certain the rating on this will grow with more plays.

RATING: 5
First play: Owing to me falling foul of some extreme journey cards immediately after my turn, my route was short circuited and the early players laid tracks in the prime spots only leaving sub optimum track routes.

Generally this left a bad taste in my mouth. Not knowing where destinations would be just seemed too chaotic. Not for me.

RATING: N/A
Another new game with an English theme, but how does it compare to TtR and Canal Mania? Update: well it seems like the rules are quite different, oriented around the passenger trying to visit all the stations in london. It's a bit like the old bus joke: first there are no English themed games then two (Canal Mania and onU) come along at once!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun first play. Want to play again. Rating may go up with repeated plays. 

Update: Still an interesting game, but play length still seems to high, even for the two player game. It always seems like the deck is about a quarter too large. I suppose you don't have to use the entire deck.....

2006: You can't get a bus for ages, and then you get 3 at once. Well, two. And they are subway games. [gameid=23908] and On the Underground are covering very similar terrain, but it's the JKLM one that we liked best, although both have their own merits.

JKLM has opted for the more traditional route, by simplifying the arguably most famous subway network of them all, the London Underground, and let players fight for the most tourist-friendly network amongst themselves by laying tracks in their network colours. Metro uses a blanker canvas, but both gave each player 2 operational lines to work with, solving the age-old problem of an early freeze-out on one end of the map through no fault of your own, and introducing a new layer of placement considerations.

The only thing that you need to get your head around is the way the Tourist moves around the board, and although it is tempting to chase the points when they become available, it is equally important to build a viable network that will bring rewards long after the tourist has moved on. Once you realize how the scoring works, you're literally off to a great game.

There is an obvious self-levelling effect of the way scoring has been implemented; player's are more likely to share points with players who are trailing than those who appear to be behind. It does mean that finishing loops early on, or claiming the any bonus points, is likely to be counter-productive. As a five player exercise downtime became an issue, but I can think of very few games that don't get significantly slower with a fifth player. As the game progresses, there are usually several legal movement options available to the active player, and the tendency by most players is to snowball the active player with advise about "clearly the best move". Not all players will welcome this.

That said, games with a fixed station and network outlay are usually rubbish to play, proudly displayed in the tourist office, with next to no appeal to anyone who doesn't want a token souvenir. This is at the other end of the spectrum. It is highly enjoyable, challenging, and likely to be replayed quickly, resulting in a very different game, largely due to the unpredictable way the tourist meanders across town. 

In its (largely successful) drive to simplify the game for as wide a variety of gamers as possible, I do feel it has made one concession to many. To address the first player advantage, a simple scoring-fix-trick has been used: the further down the play order you are, the more victory points you start off with. Great, except people aren't very likely to give points to the leader. So within a few turns the starting player will have clawed back this disadvantage without lifting a paw. And still have the more beneficial backbone network opening. We feel it is better to restrict the first player to placing only 2 tracks in the opening turn, the second player 3, after which everyone continues placing the regulation 4 tracks. There are some very appealing stretches-of-4 along single lines that not only are likely to give you points early on, but are also often part of the more profitable lines. To make sure that the first 2 players cannot simply claim the best ones, and leave the scraps for others to toy with seems a better leveller. Otherwise players might find they finish in positions that are, too often, too similar to the turn order.   

We might introduce a few home-made touches to improve clarity. The white cylinders that mark the active Tourist destination stations hide the colour of these stations, which is important for a clear overview of the order in which stations will be visited. Getting 4 more of these, and spraying them silver, and the other 4 ones gold, will make sure that a quick glance highlights the options available for that turn. Alternatively, just spraying the tips of the 4 that are provided gold and silver on either end, and placing them in such a way that the station colour always shows on top, will do the same.

Right now it seems likely that the players who forces other players to claim their bonus points early, but still secure their own later on, are more likely to come out on top. With frequent plays, when players who have points to hand out to a choice of competitors are concentrating more on the shape of rival networks, than purely the scoring track situation, that should become less of an issue.

On the whole, it is so appealing that I'm sure it won't be long before other subway maps will start to float about. I can see this quickly attracting its own geek following, and it will only be a matter of time before boards for the other subways will surface.

UPPED it by half a point as it more than keeps its appeal with many replays, and I still haven't tried all strategies yet. Our alternate starting player fix is now a given. Excellent game.

Didn't grab me, a little too complex perhaps. For what it's worth it is a possibly a half hour too long. It does suffer fairly badly from AP players that can cause a 'too long' game to drag out even longer. It seemed as though they tried to fit too much into the game.

This game looks neat.  But in my experience, it plays itself.  There is usually very little choice of where to put path based on the cards that are out on your turn.  And, depending on the type of people you're playing with, you're going to be told exactly what that path should be.

RATING: 7.7
Nice little game. The rules took a bit of interpretation but once we got over that we were soon racking up points.

Rather subtler than Ticket to Ride and the use of multiple lines means it scales much better from 2-5 as well. Overall, a similar to but better game than TTR.

Interesting.  Played with two and you had a lot of control on getting good routes...I think it would be great with 3, as well.  A unique connection game...you are really tempted to play to the passenger, but I think after my one play is to work on the board and get the points that way, and the passenger will come to you.

I could see this being a really fun game, but another great example of why games should not include options for 5 players. Don't include the option if it plays badly!!!

I'd try it again 3 player, but if it were only a 5 player game, I'd never play this again.

I'd been wanting this for quite some time, it being a train-themed route builder that was touted well for two.  I managed to snag a pristine copy in a math trade for my copy of Power Grid.  A trade well worth it in my book!  This is a very nice game.  The rules are SUPER simple, but the depth is quite there.  There are multiple ways of scoring, and just enough randomness to keep the tactical side of the game fresh.  The length is perfect, and the game is VERY well balanced - the scores have been extremely close.  Opportunities for screwage abound, but the great thing about the random elements is that you never can quite predict if a screw will come back to bite you in the ass.  I love that you are earning points on opponents turns.  Plus, the production values on this are nice - the board is huge, and much fun for any Anglophiles in the crowd.  Great job, JKLM.  Now, get me that reprint of 1860...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Surprisingly challenging for such a simple game. Having four colors each (in a two-player game) makes each early move very important as you plan your four routes. The passenger movement rules are very confusing, and I don't think we followed them correctly.

Enjoy the theme and the game play... but I would not recommend playing this with 5.  4 seems right, and 3 is probably better.  I'm not sure there's much chance for "clever" game play, and the winner may be more driven by randomness than anything else.

Interesting connections game, but too slow and analysis-prone for my taste.  I like the trade-off between building track to score points on the board (terminations, connecting connectors, etc.) and building on the main trunk lines in the hope of scoring for the passenger, but in the end it just takes way too much time for people to work through all the permutations on their turn.  Not a keeper for me.

This is a nice game of network building which I do enjoy.  It has a few problems - you can get stuck scoring half points when only silver cards turn up and the ending isn't quite right - but neither are enough to spoli it.  With those issues solved though it could be a very good game.  

DON'T play with 5; the game does NOT play well with that number.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Maybe this would work better with 2. With 5 I feel like trying to pay attention to the passenger is just a waste of time. You may as well just pay attention to your track building and let the passenger go where he will, which is kind of a shame because the passenger is the neat and innovative part of the game.

A really enjoyable tactical game of building subway networks to facilitate movement of some dude that apparently only rides the subway to certain destinations that he has to walk the least to.  The more he rides on your lines, the more points you score.  A really simple idea that can actually be a little brain burny at times as you try to figure out how to make him ride your lines.

Played this game, expecting it to bore me - another Eurotrash train game that is like Ticket to Ride or Transamerica - but I was surprised by the novelty of this game. However, the cards can be predictable, but I have only played it once.

RATING: 10
A deep gaming experience where there are quite a few options you have on your turn in diverting the passenger to where you would like him to go (along your lines). Very satisfying. Some decisions are limiting as you can only play from the ends of your track. Could have some people in analysis paralysis though. Increasing rating as it does different numbers of players very well. 19 Plays.

Played only as a two player game. 
- I love the theme, I'm love London and it's subway system, so it's great to play a game around it
- easy to explain, clear set of rules
- different ways to score points, every strategy is rewarded but the way the lazy passenger moves makes it unsure if you hold the victorious strategy
- lovely two-player game

- could suffer from a lot of downtime with 'Grübler'
- you need to make sure you don't block yourself out of the game from very early on
- not very suitable with 4-5 players

Solid game.  Awful lot of randomness, IMO, but not a destructive amount.  Usually the most diverse builder with the most clear forethought wins, but not always.  Either way, there are definitely some interesting choices to be made, and high level of planning, which I respect.  I like the 2 and 3 player games.  4 adds a increased level of randomness I am not fond of, which is mostly due to the time between turns.  I can't imagine what 5 players would be like.

This is a really cool game, with nice bits and fairly easy rules.  Some people are saying it's good for newbies, better than TTR, but I can't see that.  I think it's more complicated, and also, depending on the personalities involved, could be much slower.  There's plenty of room for AP in this game.  I doubt I would play with more than 3, but I think it's excellent for 2 or 3 players.

RATING: 6
12+ plays

A decent game that generates tension between tactically responding to the passenger and strategically building a good network.  

I don't see it as similar to TtR at all.  TtR is a game that could be about anything and happens to have a railroading theme. OtU has rail network building as core, including use of your opponents' networks to enhance yours.  Whereas TtR is often a solitaire race against others, OtU presents a myriad of choices often involving interaction with other players.I like both games.

Have only played 2 and 3 player games with non-AP opponents, so it remains to be seen if AP / downtime are an issue.

UPDATE: After a dozen plays, I traded this title.  It has enough randomness that you never quite feel in control.  All-in-all it's long for what it is.

Up-Update: This game has joined the elite company of game's I've owned twice.  It's a pleasant diversion and a decent value for the price.

RATING: 3.5
A member of a school of games I'm becoming increasingly unfond of. While there's route building and a very slight level of player prediction, at heart the game is one of exhaustively evaluating the potential board implications against the probabilities of cards being flipped in various orders.  As a result with good players the player who maintains a marginally better rate of return will win and I just don't like that sort of game.  It isn't a bad game certainly, just one I don't like enough to play and don't dislike enough to avoid.

Update: The more I play it the more my tolerance for the game grows but the less I also like the game

Barely acceptable with 3 players.  Avoid otherwise.  Needs bits to mark stations that have already been visited.

Note the game can be heavily analysed and the game rewards thought.  With reasonably thoughtful players I'd expect plays to average between 120 and 150 minutes rather than the claimed 75 minutes.  

For my tastes the game would be improved by adding markers which were placed on each location as their cards were flipped.  As-is there is a strong memory element of remembering what locations have come up already and so are not candidates for further deliveries.  I'd prefer the game with that memory element removed and markers used to clearly show which locations had already been delivered to.

RATING: 4
Oh my god I'd rather eat rusty nails than play this again. The concept of the game is great, but in practice it just shits all over itself. Here's the problem: 

1. Your turn will take 30 seconds. You will then spend 5 minutes moving the passenger and arguing over the shortest route. 

2. Since every station has one card, the passengers movements are almost irrelevant to your decision making. You just want to get the most lines in the high volume areas first and make connections to score points. The passenger will come through sooner or later as you don't have any control over this.

RATING: 6
Fun route building game, but it seemed to be a little longer than I wanted it to be.  Each turn had the same sort of structure, which consisted of lots of analyzing routes and trying to tactically score points.  The strategic part of the game either wasn't too pronounced or I had trouble seeing it, but it needed to be stronger for a game this long.  While far from a bad game, it didn't really strike me as stellar, either.

I really enjoy this.  The combination of options is just right to make the game fun and keep things light.

OK.. bit biased here but this is one of my favourite games and has been for the many, many years it has been in production. I've not yet seen the production version, but I found that on playtesting it I quickly got used to calculating the passenger route. What you tend to find is that groups of players will sit & between them work it out, so I don't find the problems/nags that other people on BGG did.

I like this game a bit more than Canalmania, but they have some elements strongly in common. Here, the destination tickets are better balanced....you know almost everything will show up eventually. There are lots of ways to get point.

There is a turn order issue, which the rules attempt to address by giving an extra point to each successive player at start. I'm not sure how great that works out, but the end game can be frustrating for the last couple players. You have to MAKE a place to have a worthwhile final build, otherwise you have no shot. 

This game takes a big hit down in the rating with 5p. Not enough actions before the game ends.

Love this track-laying game.  Each turn you must decide whether to build your lines in the hopes of catching future points from the passenger's travels, or go for some more immediate points connecting landmarks or passing through/to special stations.  Don't ignore the center or you'll find yourself behind the 8 ball.  Great choices each turn - always interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game sort of looks like Ticket To Ride, but plays nothing like it. You simply get to lay 4 pieces of track (among your 2 or 3 lines, depending on the number of players, with each line required to be connected and only extensible from the two ends or play spending branching tokens), and score points for doing various things like connecting to national stations, track endpoints, connecting to stations of like goods, and surrounding stations. All of that is straight-forward, but then there%u2019s the passenger. There are 4 stations on the board at any one time, and the passenger wants to visit 1 express station (if any), and 1 normal station (if any) per turn. There are rules for how the passenger moves, but basically he minimizes walking to get on a line, and then minimizes number of lines taken. Each line used scores its owner a point. Some people seemed to feel that this was too complicated or fiddly, which seems to be a common refrain heard in my group about recent games that feel decidedly middleweight to me.

This is a wonderful game. It is physically rather attractive. When the game is finished the board does look very much like the underground maps that they distribute to allow you to plan your trip.

Changed my rating from 6 to 7 as started playing it with 2 and 3 players which is far better than 4 or 5.

With 4 or 5 it has far too much downtime. You can't plan ahead as someone will have bound to have built where you wanted to build.

I will happily play with 2 or 3.

RATING: 8
Components: Very functional. I would enjoy the map more if I had a stronger connection to London, but it's pretty cool to look at anyway, and the background and border images are nice as well. The cards serve their purpose well, and the wooden rails stand out well against the subtle-colored board. I would like to have cubes that mark which stations have not yet been visited, so that there are fewer and fewer cubes on the board, making it easier to spot which destination cards I might expect.

Experience: Very enjoyable. All the ways to score make each turn satisfying, and even when I'm not scoring I'm strengthening my infrastructure, which is also satisfying.

The passenger mechanism is brilliant, creating a great puzzle unique to each turn, contrasting with the overall strategy of a strong, far-reaching network. The variability of the passenger's path also entices us to create irregular routes, keeping each game fresh.

The end lines, providing both points and branches, are a great way to keep the end game interesting, when the basic routes have all but been cemented.

What Ticket to Ride should have been. Interesting decisions, plenty of opportunity to screw other players, some (moderate) experience of actually building a train line... The one major flaw is that there is some downtime, although this is mitigated a little if everyone chips in to work out where the passenger is going to go next. Also slightly susceptible to AP as you can't plan your turn too far in advance, hence the planning happens during your own turn. This is usually bearable as the actual opportunities to choose from are generally limited.

RATING: 7
This is a fun route-building game that may *look* like Ticket to Ride...in London...but the game mechanics are a bit different. Players gain points by building through stations, ending at a terminal, connecting matching stations, and by creating loops around nodes. Then the Passenger is moved to two of the visible destination card locations and player's whose tracks are used score points. I think it is safe to say that players who like TtR have a good chance of liking this, although it is a bit less approachable.

I think I was a little soured on this game because I played it right after a game of War of the Ring.  Not many games hold up to that one.  This one just played so slowly for our 5er group.  It is a game with perfect information so the players just tend to analyze the board until the optimal play is found.  This can take time...too much time.  I'd be willing to play again..but with fewer players.  Still I'd rather just play a different train game given the option.

I bought On the Underground because my budding gamer girlfriend was a bit of an Anglophile. 

Unfortunately, the game itself was a bit of a flop. Whether playing against just her or her and a few of our friends I always won by huge margins and had difficulty coming up with a reason why. (Since then, I have begun to win the majority of ALL the games we play, with a few notable exceptions, so I am less confused about the situation...) Eventually we reached the point where we decided the game just wasn't interesting enough to keep. Becky didn't find anything interesting enough to keep her interest despite losing and I didn't like the lack of challenge in the game. Eventually I ended up giving it to my friend Sam, who was a much bigger fan of the game in general.

RATING: 7
Players develop train lines on the London Underground, trying to score points for connections and loops, as well as delivering the passenger along their tracks.  Players on their turn place up to four pieces of their track on the familiar London Underground style map board, or take a branch token in lieu of track placement.  Placing track can score points for reaching a terminus, or a national railways link, or by forming a loop of track.  The passenger then heads off for the "closest" two destinations from four currently available, using the most efficient route of train lines (scoring points for their owners).  Easy game to pick up, but quite meaty and thinky - reminded me a lot of Durch die Wueste mixed with TransAmerica, of all things.  Excellent game that leaves me thinking how will I play it next time, which is always a good sign.  Does slow down with more players - five may be a no-no with this one, and four is pushing it.

RATING: 8
Somewhat like a stripped-down Volldampf (delivery over multiple players' routes), with a bit of Santa Fe Rails (connection bonuses, limited/expensive route branching).  Easy to learn, easy to play, several paths to victory, a fair amount of depth if you want to think ahead.  Good component design too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I found this to be quite a fun game (but I do like train games). It combines a number of good elements from Transamerica (sharing routes), passenger movement driving route selection (TTR-Marklin), and some good strategic elements (aiming to get a good loop in the center and allocation of your multiple colors). Plus, of course, it's the London Underground!

Well la-de-dah. This isn't TtR and it isn't TransAmerica, but it sure is fun. As simple as they are, for some reason the rulebook was hard to digest.

2015-01-13 : Surprisingly fun puzzle game. Normally not something I like, but there is some overarching strategy possible with this game. A point gets deducted for the following problems :
- that "shared victory in case of a tie" nonsense again. Guess what happened in our very first game ...
- the last player in the turn-order is at a serious disadvantage, both for initial placement and he won't score points for the passenger in the last turn.
- bad color choices - the purple and brown colors are nearly identical and the white is barely visible
- the rulebook could have been more clear.

Don't play with 5; 2-3 is the sweet spot.  With 5, it takes a long time for the game to get back around to your turn, and while you can do some analysis of the board, quite often what you plan for isn't possible by the time it's your turn again.  Catering to the passenger and the many ways to score points are fun.

Simple mechanics, similar to TransAmerica but with more meat (a souped-up version, so to speak). I like the passenger idea as it adds a tongue-in-cheek theme to the game.

Played now with 2 and 5, and did not love either number.  With five, you don't have enough turns to develop long-term strategy.  With two, game play is surely going to get repetitive, as dependable strategies ought to emerge.

It seems very likely that 3 is the magic number to maximize the quality of this game - three players has the second most different plan-clogging track colors in the game (5p - 10, 3p - 9, 2p/4p - 8) while also having the second fewest players to avoid any similarity to the five-player bloat.  I'm nervous that if I don't enjoy the hell out of it with 3, I'll have to downgrade it.

I played with my girlfriend, who gave it her highest possible rating "I'd play it again, I guess".  However, she hated the sudden and anticlimactic ending, and she was very happy when I told her Mr. Bleasdale had endorsed playing out the destination cards.

UPDATE - Having now played with three, I'm settling in with a seven.  It's a solid, attractive beard-scratcher, but you're not really left with too much to stick with you after it's done.  I like it better as a dependable puzzle game than Through the Desert - although it is quite a bit longer.  Oh, and three was the best number.

After one play, I was impressed and at the same time, put off by it. Turns are too long in counting out routes. We ended up advising each other as to what options were just to speed up play. Seems like somebody tried to make the "thinking man's" TTR, but I'm not sure we need to spend this much time thinking about the shortest route.

I was yammering on once about how Ticket to Ride should do a city underground version, but then I found out about this game and got it as a gift. The similarities are startling between the two games, but there are just enough differences to make it worth having both. On the Underground is not as pretty, but it provides solid strategy and game play. And now I won't forget the locations of the stops when I'm in London!

I like train games.  I like puzzle games.  I like games oozing with theme.

RATING: 3
Ingenious but fiddly game to play; too much route calculation.

Duration: This took quite a long time despite turns being fairly quick (I was playing with experienced players). You can't calculate ahead what you want to do either, since your play depends heavily on preceeding players.
Design: You play on a map of the London Tube and lay down lines in order to score points and help a passenger get to his destinations. Each turn you had to calculate what a passenger would do according to your plays, which I didn't handle well.
Strategy: There are many choices early on but these close off; the optimum strategy seems to be getting early monopolies on regions that haven't been visited yet. The instant point scores don't matter anywhere near as much. Each turn's moves were pretty straightforward when played tactically, but I didn't get a good feel for longer term strategy.
Components: Fine.
Theme: I liked it, though the gameplay suffered.

It's so unfortunate that the board and bits make this one looks like a "big game" when it's really an excellent midway game, somewhere between Ticket to Ride and Age of Steam. I cite these two games, but there are very few common points, beside the fact that you are laying tracks. The passenger movement mechanism may sound complicated at first, but it gets really easy to figure out after a couple of turns since it's really intuitive. A quick note: this rating is based on 2-player games. On the Underground shines in that configuration, but I would suspect there is too much downtime with 4 or 5 people.

RATING: 5
The first Eurogame I played. It's not actually that great, but I certainly had a good time learning it that day. My criticisms are that it's a bit long and it seems like the winner always takes the encirclement strategy. Also, it's usually a pretty close game around something like 70 points, and I guess I just don't think a game should have such a low standard deviation of player scores. Not sure why, but it just seems unnatural.

RATING: 6
On the Underground is a game of short-term gain vs. long-term success or the attempt to make both work together. You build an underground line in order to carry passengers which score points. Each turn is highly tactical as a new passenger comes out who wants to go to a random destination according to clearly defined movement rules which basically come down to "whatever is most convenient". Now you can try to adjust your line(s) in such a way that he chooses one of your lines for the trip, or you can extend your network for better long-term coverage. Since each station comes out once per game keeping in mind which of them have already been used and therefore offer no more potential becomes important, and a well-constructed network will also score points on opponents' turns.

A nice introductory game that provides opportunities for both tactical and strategic play.

RATING: 5
A strong medium-weight track laying/ connection game, with minimal luck.  Plenty of choices are available each turn, which could possibly lead to AP.  The connections are interesting because the passenger relocates after every player.  The constant shifting in "routes" is a pleasant alternative to fixed ones found in TtR, and other games of this ilk.  Two-player is strong, and provides more control as the game can get a bit choatic with more. All in all an excellent offering. A nice bridge between games like TtR and Age of Steam.

It's not as heavy as Steam and company but definitely heavier than Ticket to Ride series. You build routes and send passengers trying to make the life of your opponents harder.

The one confusing thing is that one player plays with two or three colors at a time which can be really distracting and makes the overall impression of the game a bit worse.

But there is some depth, some strategy and some interaction, beautifully illustrated and with pretty clear rules. Worth giving a try,

Enjoying this network-building and passenger delivery game. Apart from the slightly fiddly passenger moving I think JKLM are on to a winner here - Further underground systems beckon I'm sure, TTR-style system tweaks making each a subtly different game ...

RATING: 4
The game seems very interesting, but does not end up very enjoyable.  Figuring out where Andy Capp (the passenger) is going to go drags the game down for a few reasons.  I don't mean the actual moving of Andy Capp, I mean having to figure it out before you make any plays, and then also figuring out if you can affect his movement or not.  Because Andy Capp moves around so much, there is not much planning you can do, so downtime is an issue as well.  But in the end, what drags the rating down for me is that I just do not enjoy the puzzle of figuring out where Andy Capp is going to go.

It's not perfect, but I like it. A bit more chaotic than Ticket to Ride and slightly less approachable. Having to keep an eye on both short-term and long-term scoring at the same time is a nice twist. It does seem that if you can pull off a loop you'll be tough to catch. Game seems like it can lock up a bit at the end if everyone is built out and you're just moving the passenger around. I'm sure the map does violence to the actual London Underground, but I don't know it well enough to notice, and I'm nostalgic enough about riding the tube in my one and only visit to London to find the theme attractive. Bonus points if you can arrange the sinful union of Cockfosters and Shepherd's Bush. Because the passenger is a fat English b*stard who refuses to walk more than necessary, we call him, "Mr. Creosote."  If there's a connection here to Ticket to Ride I sure don't see it.

Does the world really need another train game that involves laying track and transporting passengers?  After all, we are awash in 18xx games, crayon rails and even the Ticket to Ride series.  Would On the Underground from designer Sebastian Bleasdale offer anything unique or different?  Fortunately, it does, proving that there is still wiggle room within a crowded genre.

On the Underground is yet another strong entry into the track-building genre.  It is easy enough learn to be accessible for casual gamers and family, but contains enough strategy and tactical options to make it attractive to gamers.  Like Ticket to Ride, it is equally adept at satisfying numerous audiences and venues, which alone makes it a valuable addition to my collection.  The fact that it is fun and challenging only enhances its value.

RATING: 7
Easy-to-grasp rules and tactics with some strategy.  Everything is public knowledge (except the future destinations).

Played it a few times, with very different results.  3 players seems to be a good number because you have control of 3 lines.  However, 3 lines may be too much choice, and hence a distraction.  4 players (2 lines) was easier on the brain, and actually less crowded:  3x3=9 lines, whereas 4x2=8 lines.  5 players was chaotic -- the 4 other players could play 16 rail links between the end of your turn and the beginning of your next turn! -- and going last out of 5 really sucked -- too many good routes are blocked already.

I don't yet know if it's better to concentrate on getting good long routes and ignore the passenger.  It does seem that going for the passenger every time is a not a good strategy, because each trip is worth at most 3 points to you (in a 3-player game), whereas you can get a lot more points by connecting to tourist, national railway, or terminus stations.  But getting both of your lines in play, and getting the passenger to travel on both your lines on each trip can get you 4 points per turn.  I suppose one key to the game is to get the passenger to travel on your lines when it's *not* your turn, but that's not easy.

This is my favorite network-building game (I would say of medium weight, but I also haven't played enough network-building games to be able to say that I have a favorite light or heavy game, I would also add "pure" network building, as I also enjoy Power Grid, but I'm not sure how "pure" this is with the passenger mechanic).

Ok, Ok. Semantics aside, this is a great network-building game with some hard-and-fast limits on where and how much you can build, as well as an interesting mix of short-term and long-term decisions (some at the expense of the other). I think that it's really interesting how, with a static map, the game changes every time in response to the needs of the patron/passenger (and what important routes stay somewhat similar).

Not bad, if a bit dry. There's some interesting balance of choices between long term strategy and short term point-grab moves. The ending seemed a little awkward to me, with not all the passengers getting picked up.

My opinion hasn't improved with time. It seems to me that luck of the draw is far too prominent for a game that takes this much effort to play. Downtime can be a real drag too.

On the Underground is an interesting exercise in route-building games, where players must create high point routes that are also enticing for the Pedestrian to use visiting a pile of London stations.
The stations go by very quickly, and somewhat randomly- nevertheless I don't see people winning without paying some attention to the Pedestrian.
I find it a little light, but it's a decent family game, with a bit of luck as well as planning, and an attractive look.

This is a solid, quick, accessible, family-friendly light "train" game that plays in 60 minutes. The initial play may be a brain-burner, as one wonders where to start? While it is desirable to maximize the number of points scored each turn, it sometimes must be balanced against long-term goals, such as creating a loop, or connecting tourist locations. There is an element of "take that", as players can cut each other off relatively easily and quickly, but otherwise, it is quite benign. The visual appeal is striking, as multi-colored links begin to form on the map of London, much like the train route maps of rapid transit systems. Simple rules, easy buy fascinating passenger movement mechanics, and lots of re-playability that is somewhat more than a filler, but not an entree.

Route building game. Each player is able to build 2-3 different station lines on the map. You are trying to attract the lazy neutral passenger to ride your station line(s) so you can score points. The passenger has a few destinations in mind and at the end of each turn, will try to move to 1-2 of them (a "gold" one first if available, then a "white" location). The passenger will ALWAYS take the path that involves the least amount of walking and then the FEWEST amount of train line switches.

Network building both for the short term and long term gains.  Point come from the passenger movement (which is automatically determined but can be influenced by your network building) and reaching specific stations with your line(s).  Typically 1 or 2 points from each source per turn.

Initially this seems like a tactical game, after 3 games I think that long term strategies will pay dividends, if you are brave enough to ignore the lure of the immediate point.

A surprisingly deep connection game, closer to Through the Desert than Ticket to Ride, and built from very simple rules. You're constantly torn between scoring now and building for the future. Some luck, if there's no gold destination on your turn you probably won't score as well as if there is. Great bits.

First played July 10th, 2007.  Being taught takes about 10  minutes and the game takes a little longer than an hour for a first time game of 5.  The board is big.  There are lots of single train tracks and I had the impression that we would be cutting each other off, however it really didn't go that way as we were scrambling for points.  It also took about 1/2 the game to figure out what to do excactly and feel comfortable with the game.  It played a little long for how it played out for my taste as well.  It has a decent luck/strategy balance, however it does seem to shift a bit towards the luck based on cards dealt (1 markers played where your track is not and 2 you may get all gold or silver placements which means only one trip for you) I'd recommend playing if you know someone who has the game, however I don't as strongly about purchasing it for play as it lacked something that I can't quite put my finger on.

It's a really neat idea, but I just didn't like the execution that much.  I think it turned me off with a fake feeling of player control.

It was sort of neat doing the group logic on where the passenger would go next, but it didn't remain neat past the 60 minute mark.

I also didn't really like the "let it ride" feeling of the game.  You made important decisions early and then just rode them out during the rest of the game.

This almost abstract game for more than 2 players go in a design space I don't have in my current collection, route planning/execution.  The random order the stations come out give each game a unique feel, and the game plays well with 2 to 5 players, which is not always a given.

I was really looking forward to this at Essen after having heard some good buzz from the other American pilgrims.  However, while the game has some charm, and is generally accessible, the downtime is deadly.  Worse, you have absolutely NO ability to plan between turns, and counting the passanger's preferences was a bit fiddly and time consuming, in a game with too much downtime already.

RATING: 5
initial rating one play 5 players Essen 2006

Comparisons to TTR are inevitable due to theme and the connection mechanic however game play is entirely different.

PROS:
  
- An optimization game at heart where you try to build routes that score you short term points but will also net you long term gains by being used over and over again the key to scoring in this game. 
 - Easy to learn and multiple ways to score. 
 - Theme was quite good, a very lazy traveller always looking for the most efficient form of travel in London, you want to be the one helping him the most.  

CONS:
 
- First player or 2 to play in the game had an advantage IMHO as they get first choice to build and there only a few 'really good' spots. They should be limited to a 2 piece track placement on their first turn similiar in fashion to TTD with camels. 
 - AP prone but not in a 'deep' way per se, just pure analysis really so any more than 3 playing makes downtime almost unbearible.
 - Almost no planning or strategic thinking possible making the downtime completely useless and boring.
 - The passenger mechanic while a great idea comes at the price of fiddliness as you have to count out his best route after every move.
 - Punishing but in a bad way, especially if you go last in a 5 player game and don't get built up in the center. Even in other scenerios if you are not in the key center areas then you will be 'trying' to catch up throughout the game more than likely without success. These center tracks keep scoring and once built are not removable locking other players out. 

Bottom line I think was the concept was good but after 2 rounds I wished I was playing something better. I 'think' 2 will work okay and probably 3 will be the sweet spot and maybe acceptable for this but I'm speculating. Luck is present but I'm not sure at this point how big a role it plays, I think turn order is the big issue which doesn't change sadly.

NOV09. I fully agree that this game is best with 3 or maybe 4 players. 5 Player is just to much for it to handle with grace.

Not a bad game, but it competes with other games of the same ilk head on and is not the worst, but not the best, although a familiar map helps to promote the game higher up the "OK, we'll play that again" list.

It seems like every third eurogame released has a "connect cities - score points" motif, and this might be the best of the bunch.  (TTR, Thurn and Taxis, RRTycoon, etc.)  Scales well, even down to 2.  

It's not impossible for a trailer to catch up.  In our first two player game, one player fell behind by 7-8 on three different occasions, and pulled back within 1 every time.

A train game that is primary about connecting different parts of London.  The passenger adds some interest, but it appears that the game is won primarily on making good connections around the board, with the passenger making long connections more valuable.  Overall, it was fun and enjoyable.

- This game feels unique because of the passenger mechanism. I have no idea why it's not more popular.
- The aesthetics are a bit outdated, but the game play is really fun.
- It's kind of like Ticket To Ride, with an extra layer of game on top.
- Games usually finish really close which is nice, as players are often able to choose which player(s) to distribute points to on their turn. This makes the game have a somewhat friendly feeling despite the fact that players are competing with each other.
- The game scales pretty well as the more players there are, the less lines each player has. I prefer it with 3 players as I think this results in 3 lines each.

Enough randomness that you feel like you're in the game until the very end.  Trying to remember which stations have already appeared can be a chore, but building a network into an area that's already been covered is part of the game... and great fun.

If you enjoy route building games like Thurn and Taxis or Ticket to Ride, you can't do much better than to add On the Underground to your game collection.

There are lots of different ways to score, so AP can kick in a bit near the end-game, but all-in-all a great addition to any collection.

A definite '8' for me.

I have always had ambivalent feelings about this game. Playing it now with more than two players since forever, constantly figuring out the stations that the passenger would walk taking various routes got real old real quick.

It seemed a pain having to calculate the best route for the passenger, especially as more routes accumulated. Also it was annoying when you were controlling the passenger, but had to use other player's routes because they were slightly more complete. Then there was the issue that the gold station cards came out at random. More than one gave the player the advantage of selecting a station to travel to, but if none came out this only allowed a single trip instead of a double trip. Finally it seemed too critical to have a major portion of the central route. It seemed different than other train games, but just a little too unbalanced. Still, Some people may like the different flavor it brings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Yes, it's yet another train game.  However, this one not only deals with a local metropolitan system, it "feels" like it with unique mechanisms to reward the most effective network.  This reward system is VERY vaguely similar to the races in Railway Rivals, but doesn't involve races and has less luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great mix of "train" games in between Ticket to Ride and Transamerica with some more thinking added. Exactly the type of game I'm enjoying the most.
After a few games I only found a minor distraction that there is a small but noticeable bash-the-leader element when choosing the routes the passenger will take. This is not appropriate in this type of game. To a certain degree it can be mitigated  by clever setup but it's wiser not obviously being in the lead and leaving the big scoring opportunities for later.

I like the theme, as I am a big fan of subway systems.  I hope to see a Paris Metro expansion!  Anyway, this is a pretty fun little game.  I like how simple the rules are, yet there are still some good choices to be made.  The board seems wide open but soon becomes quite claustrophobic with all of the different lines.  This game unfortunately has a big possibility for A/P problems, mainly because it is very hard to plan for your turn while others are taking their turns, mainly because the stations to which the passenger will go could be completely different by the time it makes it back to you.  For this reason I would try to avoid playing with A/P-prone players, and definitely never with 5.  3 seems like a nice number, and I'd like to try just two as well.

Traded away.

An action point system based game where players try to dominate lines of track. Gameplay is simple enough and the art functional. Like most action point games, the sheer number of possible moves tend to slow the game down. If there were more than 3 players, I can see this game dragging.

If you ever asked yourself, "What if the Northern Line went east-west instead...?", then this is definitely your game.

I was pretty surprised at how much I enjoyed this. Its apparent simplicity is belied by the difficulty of some of the choices, with a lot of blocking and foiling and getting there first. One of the best tracklaying games I've played, without all the rummy of Ticket to Ride and tortuous economics of the Age of Steam family.

It's like Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska album: stripped down, location-appropriate, and fascinating from start to finish.

I have had the pleasure of playing the prototype a few times and I commend it highly to gamers. I've always been suspicious of games that are tied tightly to a commercial organisation as they often lack real gaming mechanisms. But in this case those concerns are unnecessary. This is a really interesting game with a stream of tricky decisions to make. 
Descriptions of the gameplay will make people think of Ticket To Ride Marklin (building a rail network in short straight line segments; carrying passengers over the developing network and so on). But gameplay is very different so the similarities prove to be illusory. 
Pedants will enjoy taking the designer to task for the artistic licence he has taken with the London Underground network!! :-)

Based on one-play; a five player game.  Fun game; kind of different.  Similarities to Ticket to Ride and Scotland Yard (at least in my mind).  The tiny little track sticks are kind of, well, tiny.  Enjoyed the game; would play it again.  I like the London Underground theme.

RATING: 8
Good fun rebuilding a familiar Underground in strange ways, with the poorly-served suburbs and cluttered centre feeling a very natural evolution. The lone, wandering passenger is a nice abstraction of how well the network functions, but it needs some effort to stop the enjoyable communal path calculation seeping too much of a co-op mood into the rest of the game.

Excellent strategic connection game with original mechanisms. The movement of the passenger is a very neat concept, but don't make the beginners error of trying to run after the passenger. Take in account that almost all locations will be visited by the end of the game and prepare your connections to profit as much as possible. There is less luck in this game than you might think after the first plays! A bit too much downtime and less possibility for long-term planning with five players, but this improves a lot with three players and is at its best with four. As I definitely have a weak spot for London, I am excited by the theme of the London Underground.

Ticket to Ride meets Finstere Fleur!  This is a great track-laying game with a clever mechanic to guide the movement of the passenger.  Trying to anticipate the stations that the passenger will visit  and trying build a network that not only gives a tactical advantage but lays a basis for the long term gives the game depth.

The game with very simple rules which are printed on 5 pictures on the board and can be explained in several minutes. It is also quite fast (about 1 hour). Great introductory game (or step after the introductory).

Mechanics in not very original, honestly it is probably too random. But the game is quick and gives me a lot of fun, so I like it. :-)

RATING: 4
The passenger mechanism kills this game for me, since it forces players to spend way too much time calculating where the passenger will move compared to the time spent playing the damn game. Thanks to the passenger it is also impossible to plan between turns, which leads to severe downtime problems. So severe in fact, that the game should come with a pointy stick, which would come handy when waking up players who have decided to take a nap between their turns.

After four plays (with 2, 4, 4 and 5 players), there's no doubting that this is a very unique and challenging game. Turn to turn, you want to maximize your point intake while minimizing the points given to your opponents, but you also have to keep the big picture in mind concerning the potential of receiving points on the turns of your opponents. My only complaint is how the game ends. There is a good chance that in a 4-5 player game that a few people will not have a chance to move the passenger on their last turn. [b]8[/b]

Track laying connection game in which one must balance the three methods of scoring: attempting to control the track segements used by the passenger, surrounding territory and linking to valuable spaces.

I don't think four would work very well, though. Nice board, always brings up memories of our travels to London. One disappointment with the gameplay is that EFFICIENT route-building is not rewarded. The passenger has to take three lines to go six stops? Great, if two or all of the lines are yours, it's more points for you. I would like to find a route-building game that rewards efficiency in route-building.

As an employee of London Underground and a frequent Underground traveller this was an automatic purchase for me.  Indeed a rudimenatry knowledge of London geography helps speed up play (although station locations are clearly marked on the destination cards).

The open destination card and known starting position of the passenger makes this a game succeptible to much more forward planning than (say) Ticket to Ride.  This is at the same time a good thing (plenty of scope for strategic thought) and a bad thing (the planning can slow down game play).

I've only played it with two (my wife absolutely loves it) and we haven't suffered too much from analysis paralysis.  So far, our opening play revolves around attempting to complete the circle line (the 9 points from this plus strategic location of track will usually be a game winner) but we may well discover additional strategies with experience. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Best 2 player game I know, although you can play it with more. But then down town is too high. 
In about an hour, 2 people can build the complete Londen underground network. 
While building, you score points directly, but you cannot forget about the bigger picture. Build your network intelligently and it will pay off in the long run. 
Brilliantly simple but not stupid.

Minus: 3 (downtime with 4 or 5 players)

RATING: 3
This takes the tedious experience of Trans America and extends it to about four times the length of time without much of an increase of strategy.  It is way too prone to AP and doesn't have all that many interesting decisions when the game will generally come down to the few points that another player had to decide got them.

Not worth the time to learn and play.

Just didn't do it for me. I'm not usually too fussed about theme, I can handle abstract games, but the theme didn't work for me despite Colin's explanation that we were candy vending machine operators installing machines along the underground. This explained why there were up to 5 lines along the same route and why the wooden pieces looked like pieces of candy (well at least in Colin's mind they did!)

An absolutley astounding idea that so resembles traveling on the tube it's almost unbelievable.  It also looks fantastic (so much so that I'm considering buying another copy to hang on the wall).

Played with 2 players and 5 players and really enjoyed both.  There is no downtime problem in the 5 player game as everyone was chipping in advice on what the active player ought to do (usually for their own benefit!!)

Received 09/12/07 - New from Thoughthammer

I sat down with a cup of coffee to read the rules and when I was done, my coffee was only half gone and it was still hot.  This game has very few rules. However, in practice we had many questions.  All of them were answered by browsing BGG forums but I think the rules could do with another page outlining and/or clearing up the common mistakes/questions new players make/ask.

I find it surprising that the suggested age range dips down to 7. I find it hard to believe that 7 years olds would be able to correctly determine the shortest route.  Even adults seemed to find it tedious to determine the least number of line changes from the available options.  

I've enjoyed my single playing of the game but I have three complaints:

1) Analysis paralysis - Fight it. Get a timer or something.
2) Resist the temptation and help others to resist playing other people's turn for them - it just slows down the game
3) Turns have a fair amount of downtime where there's not a lot you can do or plan for when it's not your turn.

I'm also not fond of the end game where the Passenger is removed from the game yet players still lay track. Seems a let down to be to the right of the starting player and not be able to take advantage of the Passenger movement.

I like the first 9/10 of the game, but the ending just falls flat.  It needs some sort of end of game bonus (or bonuses) so that on the last turn we don't already know who is going to win.  All the times I played, we had lots of fun until the end and when the end came we thought, "That's it?"

Lively [thing=503][/thing] type route building with a far more interesting theme and a nice randomizer mechanism also known as the Passenger. The game nicely shifts from the first few basic '[i]randomly grab the most valuable stations and connections[/i]' plays to the more intricate long-term engine building and blocking strategies. Perfectly fine for kids over 7, best with 2 or 3 players.

The best of JKLM so far that I have encountered (excluding my own 1860 of course!!). I don't understand the comparison with Ticket To Ride - it has more in common with Santa Fe, and is IMHO vastly better that TTR in any case. An easy-to-play game which is intuitive but non-trivial. Better with fewer players, but is always close and engaging. Moving the passenger takes half a game to get used to, but is easy after that, and JKLM have come up with a simpler variant which doesn't add too much of a random element.Beautiful board, good components, good sized (i.e. small) box. Highly recommended. Perhaps a close second to Imperial as my favourite game of 2006, and will probably get more play.

A weighty train game unlike most others I've played. I liked it, but it's another that I'd have to play a few times before I really get the hang of it. If playing a game with 2-4 other gamers, I'd choose this one. If playing with my wife or non-gaming friends, Ticket to Ride hands down.

I was a little miffed about how the cards worked out. On three or four of my turns, all white cards were available which means the passenger only moves once. A potential 4 points were lost by this. It didn't make sense to me, but I also didn't read the rules so maybe there's an explanation. It just seemed rather arbitrary.

RATING: 4
After 1 play. Visually pleasing, but rather boring, one-inch-at-a-time route-planning game.  earn victory points by connecting stops on the london underground with your own tracks and having a pedestrian travel them.  No room for big, game changing plays, plus feels unoriginal.  I've got route-planning games coming out of my ears.  

Apparently involves lots of strategic/tactical nuance, but as a newb to the game I don't see much of it yet.  One nice thing:  Even from the your first playing, there is a clear tension between balancing short term tactical gains with long term strategy.  Nonetheless I doubt I'll ever find the motivation to master it.   

I just don't like the type of game this is.  But those who like efficient route-planning games may adore it, since it's obvious that great care and attention went into both it's design and production.

Excited with the game's London Underground theme and the great map that accompanies it I jumped at the chance to try this out at the BGG.con.  Each turn new passengers appear upon the board and you can extend your rail lines and then choose which people to move.  Players score points for each line the passenger uses (the passenger always uses the quickest route that requires the least amount of walking).  I felt my opponents were building their lines willy-nilly to accomodate the new passengers.  I took a more strategic long-term approach to the game to make sure my routes had enough flexibility for the new passengers to come.  I ended up in last place and was very disappointed to find that it's an extremely tactical game.  Looking foward to trying it again soon, in hopes that there's some subtle, long-term strategy, in the tactical track building.

The components are very good, the game itself has an interesting mechanic. But in your turn there is not much you can do or to think about how to move the passenger - is kinda obvious.

Fun. As the goal of the game is to provide the most efficient routes, minimizing walking and line switching, which is hopefully the same goal of real urban transportation planners, I feel like I'm in their shoes. This makes the theme incredibly real and appropriate and I just had a good time building that network. I have only played 2-player so I'm eager to see how different it is controlling fewer lines in a higher player count game.

Played a 5p and had a lot of fun with it. You're much more restricted with only two lines but you are that much more motivated to get the passenger to use your trains. I still want to try 3p and 4p, but really enjoyed this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is probably one of the better ways to model the value of a network of all train games I've played. It rewards broad coverage. It doesn't suffer from the problem in Age of Steam of the most inefficient route being the most profitable, although in some cases you can game the system and try to get the passenger to ride two of your routes for extra points.

RATING: 4
Okay game but way too long for what it is: a light, repetitive placement game. Calculating the passenger moves gets very tedious after a while, and playing with an analysis-prone player is deadly dull. Not excited about more plays but will try, but only with 2-3 players. [gave away after 3 plays]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Mixed feelings on this one ---- with three players, I like it quite a bit.  It definitely scratches my spatial route building itch, and I appreciate the different ways of scoring (connecting tourist locations, building terminuses, etc...).  In the early game, I also like calculating and moving the passenger.

With more players, my experiences have been less positive.  Your sense of agency decreases and waiting for your turn increases.  I just had a five player game (10/17/09) that went quite well, but I've had excruciatingly long five-player games as well. 

8/13/11: Again, the play group makes a big difference.  This is an AP prone game, especially in the early and mid-game when you are close to reenacting the traveling salesman problem.

My girlfriend and I received this game as a gift shortly after we returned from a vacation to London. On our first play, I enjoyed the game immensely as it brought up memories from our trip as we looked over station names we had recently become quite familiar with. Now, with a more objective lens that only time can provide, I still find the game very fun and enjoy every minute when I sit down for a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very tactical game. Since the board can change dramatically by the time it gets back to your turn, there isn't all that much planning ahead you can do. It also seems like there are several viable paths to victory (connecting shopping districts, connecting to terminal stations, building a central network to grab passengers). It does slow a bit while people are getting used to seeing how the passenger will move, but once you get a hang of it, it's not so bad.

Confounds expectations at first: quite unintuitive and more comparable to playing Through The Desert than a railway game. But there's a slow-burn here: a clear need to plan ahead and not snatch up easy points. Intriguing, but it doesn't really grab you and shout 'play me again', thanks to the tedious working-out of passenger movement and the lack of achievement which branch lines should present. Plenty of nice wood components and an excellent board, but a mite fiddly with it.

Interesting game - a train game where you actually get rewarded for building an efficient network (rare). It looks and feels like Ticket to Ride in terms of theme and complexity but the mechanics are completely different: 

Hand management is out and long term investment is in. OTU retains simplicity, and provides multiple ways of scoring. There is some luck of the draw, but the game is not too long.

The board is kind of bland and the theme is somewhat boring. There was difficulty in figuring out how the traveler should move. About halfway through the game, I gave up caring about the traveler and started rack up points by connecting the bonus spaces. I won by almost 10 points by not paying attention to the traveler at all! I don't know if that was a fluke, a design flaw, or a good strategy. I'm really not all that keen to try it again.

I've set myself a little mission recently to find games that play with 2 players, that are simple enough for me to be able to explain the rules to my wife without her losing the will to live; but also to be able to be played by a larget number of players as well.

Well this game fits the bill, it is now my wife's favourite game, could be because she nearly always beats me at it.

Havent really tried it that much with more than 2 players but when I have it works well but plays differently, in a good way.

Played it 33 times in less than a year (at time of writing, Oct 09).

RATING: 8
On the Underground is a route-building game in which players control a small number of subway lines in London, each turn extending those lines on pre-printed spaces on the map.  While you are trying to make your line more comprehensive and connect certain places for benefits, your immediate concern is trying to create a more efficient way for the city's one passenger (!) to get from where he is to his destination.  Each turn, the passenger will go to two new destinations from a deck, and the owner of any line he rides on will get points.  There's a lot of balancing the short-term with the long-term in this game, which I really enjoyed.

Enjoyable game, especially for those familiar with the London Underground subway.  You claim track routes along the subway lines hoping the passenger who moves somewhat abstractly traverses your routes more than the other players, so you're predicting where the game's one passenger piece may randomly move each turn to build your track there, or along the main arteries which he may use often.  Clever, and almost a great game.  I enjoy it solitaire, plus there's a real good online version for playing against real opponents, or playing against yourself (but no AI version yet as of 2009).

Fine game, on the cusp of being an 8, I think.  I don't think I can say this forcefully enough:  This is nothing at all like Ticket to Ride.  The turn-by-turn mechanics are similar to Santa Fe Rails, except there's no money, and the calculation of VPs is much simpler.  The passenger mechanic is very clever and provides a lot of opportunities for short and long-term tactical play, though the calculation of it is a bit fiddly at first.  I guess I would call this game Santa Fe Rails but fun.  It borders on my giving it an 8, which is my threshold for games I'll want to play in a heartbeat, but I'll have to give it more plays before I'll confirm that evaluation.

Second playing, this time double the number of players (four) and the concept of which way the passenger dobber moves has become second nature. So a slight rise in rating, but I'm really interested in how it plays with 3. This time I concentrated more on what areas would become profitable, rather than focusing on certain points such as building to terminals, loops etc. I guess my approach is a riskier strategy as you are dependent on how the cards come out as well as remembering what has been visited before. I like the passenger aspect to the game as it instills more of an theme that you are building a rail network. I like that the scoring increments are small. My only gripe at the moment is that the way the exhausted draw pile not only removes the scoring of the passenger, but takes away the drama of "the reveal", as the remaining players in the round just try to maximise their line placement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A visually intensive game of building train lines and taking passengers to their destinations, (hopefully) over your own tracks, such that each trip nets you the most points.  Since the passenger destinations are randomly drawn from a deck of cards, long term strategy is basically not possible. Instead, the game is extremely tactical and each turn one has to examine the various possibilities in bulding tracks for the optimal route.

Three is probably the optimal number of players. With four it will be too chaotic.

RATING: 7
An interesting game that is similar, in some respects, to Trans America and Paris Paris. The track laying is similar to Trans America and the movement of the passenger follows the bus in Paris Paris. It is a fun game and eeking out a few points can be tough. Some that I have played with do not care for the passenger movement method for scoring as (along with Paris Paris) there is a strong random element involved. A player has no control over the movement of the passenger and that bugs some players. I find it rather challenging and believe it enhances the game.  If you enjoy Trans America but want something a bit meatier, On the Underground is the answer.

This is a really neat game where you are making connections and then trying to get the passenger to ride your rails. During the game you play multiples colors, which allows you better mobility and allows for scoring more points.

One 5-player game. Probably better with 3 or 4. Visualizing the routes is non-intuitive so it slows the game quite a bit. And, unless you can keep track of what cards have been played, I feel that there is a lot of luck in scoring for track usage. I will play again but it isn't a favorite at this point.

RATING: 8
Let's deal first with the weaknesses. Judging by appearances, the game seems to borrow rather heavily from Ticket To Ride which I haven't actually played yet so can't judge further. The "Passenger" mechanism, which I guess is not found in TTR, is a bit clunky but we got the hang of it after about half a game. There's so much going on tactically that it's easily susceptible to AP if you take it too seriously, though many good games are. And the rulebook contains typos and layout errors (incomplete sentences in text boxes) that even an amateur self-publisher should have caught.Staggeringly incompetent that last one, but hey never mind because once you get going this is a really good little game. There's a good "arc" (opening, middlegame and endgame), a really nice balance between strategies and tactics, and a variety of ways of scoring points that's as wide as it could be without becoming over-complex. Planning your way round the London Underground is a bit of an abstract and complicated exercise anyway, so the somewhat abstract system of points-scoring matches the theme rather well. On the strength of a couple of plays I'm awarding it 8.5, my highest mark yet to date (May 2007) - I may revise this when I've played it some more, though. Edit (June) revising down to 8 after disappointingly flat session with 4 players

RATING: 6
A nice track laying game. Has several scoring mechanisms, connecting victory point fairly static victory point locations, surrounding territory, delivering passengers to destinations which come up randomly. 
The scoring is incremental and I could see how game could bog down via Analysis Paralysis. 
The game is also slanted to the early players, and doesn't scale well. Much better and competitive as a 3 player game the rating generally reflects playing that way. A horrible 4,5 player game since they have minimal chance in scoring the early rounds and can easily get locked out.

Is this similar to Ticket to Ride ? I don't know, but this one is fun, way simpler than it looks, although it takes a good hour to figure out the distances between the stations and other finer details of the gameboard (/w pieces). A basic track-laying game it is refreshingly unlayered. No player hands or event cards etc. Personally, I would prefer a bit more random elements, some events, the chance to be nasty with your fellow players (track breakdowns, power failures etc.), but I suppose that wuld throw the Euro-Appeal. London is always a nice theme (Hometown, Baby!), so that is a plus for me.

One play, five players.

This game suffers from a problem many train games have: interrupted game play due to cross-referencing. The board does have a co-ordinate system so that you can locate stations easier, and the game comes with large pawns to mark the current destinations in play.

This issue of cross-referencing is acceptable if the flow of the game is equally ponderous. However, turns are quick and light; looking for a station every turn breaks the game flow.

Worse, the rules for determining where a passenger moves slows down the flow of the game even further.

I was able to play this while playing Wings of War at another table. They would call me when it was my turn. The board changes so much (in particular, the locations of the passenger and the active stations) by the time your turn comes around that it is not essential to pay much attention to what your opponents are doing. This would be acceptable if turns were short, but as I have said before, the cross-referencing issue and the passenger movement rules slow down an otherwise light game.

I really enjoy the simple challenge of this game.  Scoring is simple, get the lazy passengers to ride your rail.  The key is to build your rail in such a way the passengers will ride it.  The passengers randomly start in one city and must travel to the closest gold city or the closest regular city.

RATING: 8.5
After a single play, I think that the game has the potential to see a lot of play. Not knowing the intracacies of the game, my track laying got off to a very poor start. I made several bad choices of a single track. A large majority of the placements should be for future benefit. Concentrating on getting points for the current movement will not pay off in the long run.

After a few more plays, including a win and a very close second, this is becoming one of my favorite games. I am likely to increase my ratings.

This game keeps getting better and better. I'm enjoying being able to try different strategies. Tonight I went more for up and coming turns at the beginning, rather than playing for the riding points. I pulled a come from behind victory by 2 points, but it could have been more because the other 3 had to team up to prevent me from getting a 10 point loop.

You know you've played enough games when you look at the back of the box and gulp. Route planning games really don't do it for me - and this is a real route planner! Fairly tactical, which is good, but too much downtime and I didn't feel my decisions were well thought out or well planned, yet I did OK. Perhaps logistics experts would have more fun? I didn't care where the tourist was travelling, and working it out was dull.

Had more fun thinking about how iconic London tube stations are - surely only New York has so many recognisable city names? From football teams to literary devices to music venues, London rules.

This is a fun game, I like it. Plenty of choices to make, different strategies to try, good player interaction. However we've concluded (as others have) that there's a strong advantage to going first. Next game, we're going to try BBG user BigWoo's suggestion, to handicap the first players by giving them fewer tracks on the first round:

2 player game: 1st player gets 3, 2nd player 4
3 player game: 2,3,4
4 player game: 2,3,4,4
5 player game: 2,2,3,3,4

RATING: 4
O no, not yet another route game! Nevertheless this is exactly what we have here. In the wake of the success of 'Ticket To Ride' and its German nephew 'Thurn und Taxis' it is the London Underground that serves as platform for this route building game. Technically everything goes along the same lines: laying track and scoring points.
'On The Underground' has more than one resemblance with 'Ticket To Ride', Clippers' and 'Santa Fé Rails', all by Alan Moon, that this almost makes it plagiarism. It must be said, however, that with the series of route games that Alan Moon published he has copied himself numerous times. 'On The Underground' plays somewhat more grinding in a way, as there is more finding out how the token will travel within the system of the underground. It is not that inventing and publishing games of this type solely is the territory of Alan Moon; it's just that enough of these games already have been published. Despite the fact that this game is quite enjoyable to play, we expect smaller publishers to be more inventive in the kind of games they publish, making a difference from the larger publishers. Instead we are treated with the same middle of the road game we have seen many times before.

Based on one play.  I'm a little lost--it's potentially a very good game, potentially too chaotic for a thinking-person's game.  Don't know yet.

On the definite minus side, it's too abstract for my tastes!  Build railroads, collect points for arbitrary goals.  Graphics are a little confusing (white on white is hard to see).  There appears to be downtime issues with the wrong crowd--very little to think about between your turns, and some lengthy thinking is required when your turn comes around!

On the definite plus side, the spatial puzzle is neat--trying to find a way to elbow your subway line into the passenger's route is something original and interesting, though it causes some downtime.  If I can come to see that strategic play is possible, not just tactical, I may enjoy this game modestly.

I admit the strategies escaped me during the first play.  Short term is to build your rails to be used immediately.  Long term, you want your rail lines to be used easily, and make a circle for some bonus points.  I may rate this one higher if I play it a couple of more times.

For a game of simple mechanisms, there's a lot to consider each turn. [i]Do I go for points for the passenger this turn? But what about setting myself up for some guaranteed points later? And if I can get up to that isolated area, the passenger will have to use my line. And I should put something there so I don't get blocked out. And speaking of, I should block those guys out, if possible. And how about connecting those "goods" tokens? That's 3 VPs.[/i]

Lots of "turn angst."

It's strangely evocative, too. That lazy passenger wants to walk as little as possible, and change trains as little as possible. I get that, and I really feel like I'm a part of helping that lazy, hapless dope along on his journey.

It's a fine game that seems to have flown under the radar here on the Geek.

I just got a copy of On the Underground - straight from the designer :)

I like it pretty well, though to tell you the truth I don't know why there's area enclosure scoring. It doesn't seem to be very effective. There aren't a lot of points to be had from making a loop, and it's not particularly ideal to do anyway. Still a fine game though!

EDIT 12/05/06: After last night's game I am starting to see the area enclosure become a bigger part of the game. Still think the endgame trigger is wonky though.

EDIT 12/09/06: The endgame no longer bothers me at all, and in fact I think it's "just fine."

Edit 12/30/06: I'm beginning to think this game is not so hot with 5 players. Actually, I think I'm becoming of the opinion that MOST games are not so hot 5 player. It's less that there's anything wrong with the game and more that in 5 player games there's too much chaos and too much down time, and in this case the game seems too end too quickly. I don't think I have a problem with 4 player, and of course 2 and 3 player are great.

What, yet another train game?  Excellent!  I have enjoyed this game as it gives something of a different take on the genre.  Interestingly, I picked this up at nearly the same time as Metromania, thus two very interesting, very different takes on subway systems.  At any rate, I have really not played this enough.  In fact, I have been actively trying to get some more games of this in.  At any rate, the many different options available to you each turn almost give this game a Knizia-esque feel.  A very good thing in my opinion.  [08/10/2007]

RATING: 7
On the Underground -- Played once; four-player.

Implementation issue:  White should not have been used as a player color as it blends with the board.  Similarly, the destination tokens should not have been white for the same reason.

My initial impression upon seeing the board was somewhat negative, as the monochromatic routes printed on the board confused my eye.  The board actually became less confusing for me as routes were laid.  (Of course, that's the point:  the board must be monochromatic, so the routes stand out, but I still find the layout overwhelming.)  

The visual confusion and my own confusion as to some rules left me unfairly unimpressed with the game.  (I had not read the rules -- the confusion was not in the text, but in my understanding of the verbal explanation.)  I say "unfairly" because in retrospect, I see a lot to like about this game.  The changing positions of the tourist spots and the random order of the destinations provides greater replayability than, say, Ticket to Ride.  The ability to send the passenger via the trailing players' routes (when possible) provides balance.  Unlike many train games, the theme is exceptionally well integrated.  For example, passengers generally [i]do[/i] want to avoid transfering from line to line, and passengers [i]do[/i] ride to reduce walking.

In my group, seeking the optimum paths tended to turn into a verbal group-think session.  Sometimes useful, sometimes distracting, but always involving.

I would have liked to see the line branch chits rendered as half-discs so it becomes visually apparent that a pair constitutes a branch.

Whew...this one is a strange one. You get a mix of mechanics: a souped-up Transamerica style laying of tracks along with incremental scoring. The theme? A believable but incredibly messy-looking London Underground system. The result? A good game that has several minuses against it: the game can bog down due to analysis paralysis as there are simply a lot of moves one can do, especially at the start. Players who can to maximise points can take time to think out all possible moves! The length of the game is fixed by the deck of cards and can be incredibly long especially for 2 or 3 player. The board is horribly messy (the light background just makes everything washed out and the passenger and destination markers should have been in a darker colour to make it stand out more).

I was surprised that I managed to differentiate all the colours (am partially colourblind and close shades are usually a problem) so kudos for that. I think that 3, maybe 4 is the sweet spot for this game. Worth a look as there heaps going on in the small box...the board is T2R size!

Connection. Great game! Really like it after one 2p game with my wife. Some long-term planning on securing valuable routes across the city, plus tactical opportunities each turn to gain points from the Passenger's movement.

Downtime in 5 player game gets too long. Should try this with 3 and 4 players. I assume there are variations of this to other cities as well. I thinkI would like to have this, because it might be good family game, still I rated it only 7, might be rising.

RATING: 7.125
This game was interesting, but it seemed to be unforgiving to new player mistakes and a bit slanted towards the first player.  It almost felt a bit like a cooperative game to me due to the group consensus needed to find the shortest route.  My rating could either go up or down on this one.  At first I didn't like it, then I liked it, and now I don't know what to think.  However, there seem to be a lot of other train and pipe-building games out there already.

Nice looking game, location cards are pulled just before each player plays their turn so planning ahead is difficult which means each players turn can take a while and downtime can be quite long.

WTF? People that compare this to Ticket to Ride are high.

Anyway, On the Underground operates on a nice system pushing a commuter around.  There are some nice choices in trying to gain some points off of the commuter vs building up your infrastructure.  The only issue I have with the game is that points are so hard to eek out, that if you complete the big circle in the middle you will get so many points that it will put you way too far in the lead for others to catch up.

Still it is a great theme done well.

Its official. I like train games. And this one is fun and light. The design is smart and simple but there is alot going on here with strategic positioning and possesing the ability to see the forest through the trees. The map is quite nice and I love how it packs so much into such a little box (Do you hear me FFG?).

RATING: 9.5
Awesome route-building game; it takes the cool route-building elements of Ticket to Ride with none of the dumb card set collection.  The theme is awesome, since I love trying to navigate public transit systems.  I think this might be better the fewer players you have; I really enjoy the two-player experience, but am concerned that more players would make it more chaotic.  The only downside is that I recommend that you don't play with players prone to A/P, as they will slow the game down too much.

UPDATE: I don't think it's great with 5, but it still ends up being a solid and strategic game with 3 or 4. This is quite simply the best pure route building game out there.

RATING: 6
A more complex TransAmerica. By comparison, it's less of an incentive manipulation game and more of a logistics puzzle, but the comparison only goes so far. On the Underground is less subtle but more calculating, with an even mix of tactics and strategy. After one play, it's easy to understand the best strategy but hard to implement due to constantly changing tactical considerations, which are frequently at odds with long-term plans.

Yet another connection, pick-up-and-deliver, train game. The board shows a map of the London subway system, Union Pacific style. There are express and local stations as well as other features. The deck, each card showing one of the stations, is shuffled: deal 4 out and place the Destination Markers on each station. The Passenger Token starts in the middle of the board. Players control 2-3 rail lines (differently-colored sticks). On your turn yhou get 4 actions. You may use them to get branch tokens, but mostly you'll be extending your line(s) from the ends -- need to spend 2 branch tokens to create a branch. You get points for connecting to various board features. Then, the passenger moves: first to the closest express Destination (if any), then to the closest local Destination (if any). The trick is that CLOSEST is defined as shortest walk (with ties going to fewest transfers). Each line used gives its owner 1 point. The game ends at the end of the round when the last card is drawn (when that happens, no more passenger mvmt; just building). Whoever has the most points wins.

This was a pretty good game. Unfortunately it had several problems: the randomness of whether or not you got 1 or 2 passenger movements; the unpredictability of cards (so you can't really plan much in advance); and having to CONSTANTLY count the lengths of various routes. It would be a much better game on the computer where that fiddly stuff could be automated.

RATING: 5
Analyzing the point values of different possible tile (track) laying combinations just doesn't appeal to me.  Maybe it's because I've played too many euros with similar mechanics.  I'm not wild about games with a connection mechanic in the first place, so my somewhat lower rating is more of a personal bias in that regard.  Warning:  I would avoid playing it with A/P types!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game consists of players building their own colors of tracks across a map of the London Underground railway system to the point of getting the laziest subway commuter to his destination.

The reason he is the laziest subway commuter is because he moves based on programmatic rules that require him first to walk the least amount possible.

The rules for the game are reasonably simple but there is a lot of depth here and that's why I really like this game.  Each turn how you spend your four actions is important for the rest of the game.

My one problem with it is that opening turn order, especially in a four-player game, can give quite an unfair advantage to start the game.  I'm sure someone has noticed this as well and come up with a way to even out the opening turn order (such as extra actions for the later players on the first turn) so this may not be such a big deal.

On the underground is a route building game with a twist.  There are four locations that a passenger would like to visit and each turn you build track and then you move the passenger to a location.  The object is to get the passenger to use your routes, but the passenger follows certain rules, he will use the route which he would walk the least, and then he will use the route with the least transfers.  It offers some interesting decisions and each turn turns into an interesting puzzle, but since the locations change and the passenger is in a new spot every turn, it is difficult to plan ahead.  When it is not your turn, you have little to do because pre-planning is almost pointless.  Even with this fault the game still scores a 7 due to its interesting nature.

RATING: 7.5
Light train game with placement like a cross between TransAmerica and Ticket to Ride -- place four tracks between nodes one space apart, but with a less uniform grid and connections of variable width like Ticket to Ride. The novelty is that, while you do accrue some points from track building, most of them accrue from the movement of "The Passenger", who follows a simple algorithm to determine which 1-2 destination cards he will attempt to visit. Essentially, he's a fat bastard who doesn't care how long he spends on the tube so long as he doesn't have to walk or change trains. If he can travel the whole way on a single line without walking, he'll do that, even if he has to sit on that train for 3 hours.

Because each destination will be used at most once, there's a nice strategic element where you can ignore immediate scoring opportunities to build out to stations which are guaranteed to score later. There are interesting tricks, like building wide loops or blocking off parts of the map.

I would rate the game higher if not for two factors. The first is strong potential for analysis paralysis; the second is that the luck of the destination draw is substantial. It's a light enough game for that to be acceptable, but it's a long enough game to give me pause. I'm never sure whether it's good planning or good luck that has rewarded one track over another.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The process is interesting enough, but with five players I don't feel the scoring system supports the process very well.  Players typically share the points they make on a run with whichever opponent is in last place at the moment, so everybody tends to keep pace with each other until the endgame arrives and you have to try to figure out finally who the leaders are -- at the moment.  ...  After several more plays and heeding the advice not to play this with the full five players, I'm liking On the Underground more and more.  My rating has drifted up from the 6 where I started it.

Fun game that is all about how little you can really do on a turn.  Good stuff.

Okay, first, confession time: this got broken out as the "one last not-too-long game" at the end of a long game night, around 1:30am. Well, I was the one who added the "not too long" caveat and evidently my idea of not too long differs with those of others. I may have enjoyed this more when I wasn't tired and trying to get the house cleared up after game night. However, my complaints on it are pretty valid: lots of downtime, because this game is the capital of the country of Analysis Paralysis. You could spend HOURS min-maxing your rail placements for a turn, especially since the passenger movement is 100% predictable. I personally tried to make my turns 5 minutes or less, but it's one of those games that seems to just prompt you to spend waaay too long thinking about your turn, and no one else has anything to do during that time. Also, it can swing points somewhat unfairly if some players tend to get both gold and white cards out while others only get one color (I was on the lucky side of this phenomenon the time I played, but it still felt wrong). The mechanics are okay, I like the point-leeching you can accomplish by having a wide-spread rail system that the passenger will use a lot, but the game just ends up taking SO much longer than what it's worth.

A light romp through the subways.  I actually find this game fun to play, it isn't the type of game you can spend day after day playing,  but still it does have a certain appeal.  There is significant luck involved, and occasionally you get screwed by another player, unintentionally,  so if you plan on trying a loop, make sure you secure tight spots right away.

A bit of a hard shell to penetrate before you get to the fun stuff. If you play with more than three you're looking at alot of downtime. My first play was with five and my thumbs got twiddled down to the nubs. I'm looking forward to seeing how this works with two.

Connection game that looks like Ticket to Ride but is in fact nothing like it at all.
There's a lot of luck in which stations come out when but it seems to all even out over the course of the game.  It's also a little too difficult to figure out where the passenger will go next for your average family gamer.  Makes for a bit of a fiddly game.  But it's still quite enjoyable.

RATING: 8
Very nice game of creating tube lines to move passengers where they want to go. Plenty to think about as you aim to hoover up VP each turn connecting to target stations and growing your lines to better serve the travelling public. Nice balance between immediate scoring, short-term aims and long term network development. I'm happy with the game length, but some people I've played with feel it's too long.

Suffers a bit from too much downtime, though to be fair, we were playing with the full complement of five and only one of us had played before.  Still, it doesn't seem to do much good planning for one's next turn since the cards can influence it, and four other intervening turns means it might be wise to bring a book.  Still, very good game.  I would definitely play this at least a few more times.

Played this for the first time recently and had a lot of fun with it.  The 2-player game was fairly open but there was still some limited room for blocking of your opponent from the best routes.  I think the game would really shine with at least one more player.

Second play, this time with 4.  Difficult to plan as the board changes pretty dramatically between turns.  We spent a lot actions picking up points on the board rather than point gained from the passenger.  I think 3 player might be the sweet spot for player count.

Quite a fiddly little connection game, it was interesting all the same.  Figuring out the way the passenger goes is half the fiddyness.

Analysis Paralysis?  How about Permutation Vapor Lock?  To win On the Underground, you must simulate a dozen or more moves in your mind each turn.  Then you must pick the best and convert it into [maybe] a paper-thin advantage of a single extra victory point.  Get ready for major down time that will make your mathiest friends very happy.

RATING: 7
Why is it, that I like this game so much, although it doesn't offer tons of options like I usually crave for? That is, because it is one of the most brilliant game designs I have yet set seen, it is very well thought through, which shows especially in the way of the set-up with different numbers of players. It has few more rules than Ttr and might soon replace it in my collection as THE introductory game for newbies. Still, it offers more strategic choices to make it interesting enough for playing it with the die-hard-gamers-crew. What more, it has very clever and elegant game mechanics and it is fast-paced. Easily my most favorite "train" game.
Ok, to get this straight. I am not comparing this with Ttr. Because, like it was said before, these games haven't got much in common apart from the looks maybe. I am merely suggesting for people to try it as a gateway game for the newbies, because so far in my gaming groups that position was held by the Ttr-series. With "on the underground" in my collection, I can see it taking its place or at least being a good alternative, because a) the rules are short and simple and b) the game is too.

1 play, 4 players.  I feel starting play is broken.  Too easy to take sweet spots and get lucky/unlucky based on initial stations.  There is also too much required king-making decisions as you constantly use others' routes and try to avoid giving the leader points.  Too much downtime and inability to plan really ruins the game for me.  There were many times only 2 of us were at the table at a time while it wasn't our turn.

It's the dreaded middle ground of a German-style game that is too complex to be a good family game, but too simplistic to be a good game for those who enjoy heavy games (i.e., gamer's game, if the term wasn't so loaded). I felt Thurn & Taxis suffered the same problem (along with its other problems, including its utter lack of intentional player interaction, as opposed to random side effect player interaction). The convoluted mechanics for moving passengers in On the Underground transform it from a fluffy game like Ticket to Ride into a game that really benefits from players' familiarity and comfort with game mechanics and rules, which means it just won't work for its likely intended audience.

Don't let the board design fool you, this game bears almost ZERO resemblance to Ticket to Ride.

I am extremely sad that I don't love playing this game, because if I loved this game I could look at that beautiful board and enjoy the cool theme and gorgeous bits again and again. But sadly, for me the game play is so problematic that the neat presentation can't make up for it. For example: (1a) There is a lot of downtime between turns (even with only 3! with 5 you could probably play a filler with the players on either side of you while you wait for your turn.) (1b) I really don't mind downtime between turns if that time can be used thinking about your own (next) turn, but there is nothing you can do here but wait, because you have no idea where the passenger or stops will be for you. (2) The memory component: since there is no way to mark what stations have already come out, it is important to remember this data yourself so you don't build track in areas with little remaining passenger value. A significant memory task in a game feels way more like a chore to me than fun. (3) For all the big thinking and point value number crunching expended on playing better, the randomness of the cards-- which are 50% new and hence previously unknown for each individual turn-- throws a whole lot of arbitrary mushiness into the analytic mix. I don't mind randomness, but if a game requires a lot of thinking and two hours+ to play, I'd prefer the outcome to not depend on luck of the draw. (4) While there is a whiff of big picture strategy in your initial moves (are you going for a big enclosure? Will you try to block out an area to have it mostly to yourself?) the bulk of the game is solving the same tactical puzzle problem again and again, this is the dreaded 'rather, rinse, repeat' issue that is fine in a short game (like Carat), but tedious in a long one. (5) In a game already plagued with downtime issues, the game maintenance-- resolving which stations the passenger is required to move to-- adds an extra layer of drag that just adds to the malaise. So, next time I have the urge to send something scooting along track, I think I'll avoid the lazy passenger and stick to goods cubes on an Age of Steam Map.

A refreshing take on the train game genre. The passenger creates a rapidly changing tactical environment, while the persistent point-scoring opportunities encourage strategic thinking as well. It's also easy enough to teach people who have played Carcassonne or Ticket to Ride and are ready for something else.

I've only ever played this as a 2 player game.  I understand that with 5 there is too much dead time and I can easily see that just from the 2 player game.  The goal of the game is to lay track in such a way that commuters choose to use your trains instead of your opponents.  The commuters will always go the way that is the least hassle to them, i.e. least amount of walking and fewest train changes. Destinations are chosen from cards.  There are 3 desinations to choose from and 2 types of destinations.  You will choose 1 desination of each of destination available and that's where the commuters go.  As a 2 player game, this game is excellent.

On the Underground bears a resemblance to Ticket to Ride, in that players build routes.  However, routes must connect (and players have multiple routes, hence multiple possible start spaces.)  It adds a lot of control and strategy to the TtR style of game.  Even Alan R. Moon likes it.

Place links on a map of London to construct subway lines. You get points for linking certain items together, or for connecting to some stations, or surrounding areas if you create a loop. After you build track, a passenger located in the city travels to a new location, following a specific set of rules (smallest amount of walking, fewest changes of trains), handing out points to those players whose subways lines he uses. There's definitely opportunity for AP in this one, as there are lots of spots on the board you can build, and different directions to go. 

There seemed to be a noticeable turn order effect, where first player had a tremendous advantage be being first on the board in the high traffic locations. The author's web page in fact states that he probably would change the rules now to allow first player to place less track on turn 1.

Quick "super filler".  Lots of options, not enough actions each turn - sign of a good game.   Not sure if a 7 year old would understand this game, but will definitely help with London geography for anyone going there for a visit.

Another of the four games we played was one I had not had the pleasure of previously; 'On The Underground', which despite several comments around the RMT and Bob (not Russell) Crow(e), was not about organising industrial action. Some of us wish it had but that's another story......

The basic theme of the game is for each player to begin the operation (or building) of the underground railway lines between various stations and facilitate the journey of the passenger playing piece who wants to travel around the network with the minimum of walking and the minimum of train line changes.

The game mechanic to reflect this is supported by the drawing of four station cards which generate the journey required such that main (gold) stations are preferred destinations and starting points, from which the passenger would like to travel to the station that best conforms to not walking or changing the least number of times. 

Hopefully, this concept is not too confusing, as it might get forgotten on the first few times of play! I think we all remembered last night. So, one of the tactics i discovered is that the lines running the length of the board, and generally north of the Thames, are more advantageous particularly once more track has been laid.

there is nothing like repeat customers for promoting track use as often the next station chosen may well run back along part or all of the same route. there is a randomness in what order the station cards are drawn, which despite my reservations part way through the game, do kinda even out, as though placed lat, the gap was about twelve points from the winner , and less than a third of that two turns before the last turn. 

Victory points are also earned by developing lines running to a line terminus or by connecting certain stations or creating a network which encompasses stations within it. I think we may have forgotten to check this at the end but it certainly wouldn't have changed much. Players get two sets of coloured track so that lines may run concurrently or separately and makes for a final board akin to the coloured line maps on the Underground itself!  

Reaching a terminus, or sacrificing the placement of one of a player's track pieces in a turn, allows the use of a 'junction' piece (may have the wrong terminology here!) such that a line can be developed at a point not running on from the end of the last track piece. This is useful in the race to occupy the main choke points of the main lines as those who travel on this system will appreciate.

A game with a similar theme to 'Ticket To Ride' and yet I enjoyed this one far more. I think it may have been down to the RMT theme that doesn't actually exist and the dodgy knowledge of the Underground routes and where they all are relative to one another. The station card draws do make for a cyclical phasing on scoring but concentrate on the main lines and you won't go far wrong. A good game for an hour or so's play with multiple permutations!

I enjoyed my one and only play of this so far, but after reflecting on that game I have some reservations. I think the optimal # of players has to be 3. Our 2p game felt a bit lacking but with more than 3 the downtime and inability to look ahead must be unbearable. On the Underground surprisingly feels (somewhat) fresh for a route connecting game. The two novel aspects in my view were (a) the single passenger that moves around, creating much of the tactical decision space in the game, and (b) that each player gets several networks to build, which is definitely where much of the strategy comes from. 

While I enjoyed myself, I'm concerned that strategically the game will always be the same: establish your first network in the middle and then branch to a relatively isolated pocket on the edge with your other line(s). It's one of those games where tactical decisions might shape the nuances of your strategy, but not in a way that's really interesting (you either go out of your way to accommodate the passenger- or not, on a given turn). In the end I'm skeptical that there's much replayability here, so while I'd be happy to play again, I wouldn't consider buying it. I am impressed with the board and components though- surprising for JKLM

The goal of the game is to build the most successful Underground lines and in doing so gain the most points. You can gain points by connecting your lines to various destinations on the board, and by having the passenger use your lines to travel from station to station. The player who has best balanced the demands by the time that the deck of destinations is exhausted will be declared the winner.

Interesting.  What looks like a Ticket to Ride clone has some more interesting stuff going on, and is a bit "thinkier" than I first expected.  After my first game, I saw that there was a chance that the card draft could be advantageous to certain people (in the first two rounds, the player who went first was the only one to take advantage of a gold card), but the real key is developing a central network that Mr. Wigglesworth will want to ride.  Despite all that, this game falls into my "Fine to play, but not to own" category, because it's hard to control what you want to happen in the game, especially with more players.

Nice cerebral game with thinking akin to Ricochet Robots.  great with 2 - 3 players.  Has an indirect catch up mechanism where players can usually choose which other players lines to use, giving points to the player behind.  Great game.

A nicely done game - it doesn't really "feel" like a typical railroad game, so it can fit into the collection in addition to other rail games.  A couple of worries:  (1) it looks like it might really have an analysis paralysis element to it, and (2) I'm not sure that at the end of the day there is enough variation in what you can and can't do to score to make it much of a game.  It could drop down a notch on further plays.  After a second play, this time with two players, my concerns remain.  Don't play it with more than 3 - too much downtime.  Also, in two games, the point variation has been something like a total of 5 points (one play with 2 and one play with 3).  Is that because we played equally poorly, or because you just can't help scoring more or less equally?

Such a nice idea, very thematic and nice to behold when the lines recall the real ones. You must play this after visiting London at least once, as i did for pure chance.
The game has some strategy but a terrible flaw, it is soo horrendously difficult to keep track of what the passenger will do, every time i want to call for Dijkstra algorithm for the minimum path on a graph. Too fiddly and inelegant. Maybe with some experience everything becomes easier.

A nice game that feels more like Trough the Desert, because of the tactical point-grabbing mechanisms, than Ticket to Ride. The passenger mechanic is a bit on the fiddly side as you have to figure out the shortest path between stations each turn, which can be a bit of a hassle. Also, some kind of end-of-game scoring would have been nice, to provide a bit more strategic scope and end-game excitement.

RATING: 7
A nice departure from the simpler train connection games like Ticket to Ride as well as the more complex economic engine of pick up and deliver types as seen in Age of Steam.  On the Underground still have players building subway routes between stations, but added a second dimension of shuttling passengers to their desired destination.

I like the flexibility resulting from giving each person control of two (or more) lines.  This allowed a variety of play styles (whether to complement one another by growing both simultaneously or exhaust the first before starting the second) to co-exist as you fill up the board.  Although there are many ways to score, it seems that ultimately constructing an accessible path spanning two different ends of the board will almost always result in more points than any of the other strategy.  Even though carrying a passenger only gives you one point per trip, but it's a repeatable earning which you can keep receiving even during someone else's turn.  Everything else is a one-time thing that may seem like a big deal at first, but quickly pales in comparison to the steady usage of a well placed track.

Absolutely not recommended for anyone remotely indecisive or notorious for AP.  As there are just too many possibilities to consider each turn which will just bog the game down.  I like it enough to warrant occasional play, but have no desire to own it myself.  Probably a good intermediate choice to consider for those looking for a step up from gateway rail titles.

OtU is a tricky tactical game, with a subtle but brutal dose of strategy to it.  I have an extra fascination for it, since the game plays out the creation and extension of underground lines.  Well done, Sebastian!  Just be wary of playing this with a very think-out-loud person - especially one who simply must advise every player, for better or worse.  This game is a breeding ground for such "helpers", and they really, really slow it down.

As a bonus, almost everything you need to remember about your turn is printed in a summary on the board.  (The "big" omission:  The cost to branch is TWO branch tokens.  Don't forget it!)

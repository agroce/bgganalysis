RANK: 2790

RATING: 8
A great game that takes elements from other tcgs and combines them in to a very humorous and fun game.  It has a much cleaner ruleset than Magic, and arguably better artwork.  I am hoping that the game's second life through Arcane Tinmen is successful.

RATING: 4
This game hands down beats Magic the Gathering.  It takes Magic's components and makes it better.  The art is hilarious as well.
That being said, it's still a CCG.  So that's a major problem with the game.  And also it's not as popular as Magic so it's a little more expensive.  Game is fun though.

At first I though it will be another game that wants and fails to compete Magic: The Gathering. Well... it doesn't! It steals quite some mechanics from other games, but the outcome is a well balanced, easy to play card game which makes it interesting enough to make me not unpack several other games which are just waiting to be played. I recommend this Spoils game to thise who are a bit bored with MTG.

The down part is the graphics and the flavor text, who seem to be made by some horny teenager, but this does not spoil the quality of play.

Just played the regular starter pack game of two: 
The game feels very easy to learn and comprehend. Sadly, even that the mechanic is quite simple and elegant, it just does not engage me on a level I would really care for it deeply. It is more of a battling game of characters. The idea is to control the table with characters and thus hold your opponent in control. It is just not too imaginative and quite repetitive.

And yes, it is true, the artwork is amazing... and it reveals quite easily the target group of 14 - 19 heterosexual males. :)

From the flavor text to the responsive game play, Spoils is by far the best CCG I have played. Spoils provides a method of play and rules that avoid the pitfalls of most CCGs with the concept of the player's Faction abilities and a more robust combat system.  While success in many CCGs are based upon who has the best cards (e.g.: Rares), success in the Spoils is more so based upon which opponent can better utilize and optimize their cards abilities and capabilities relative to the more responsive game structure.  I have yet to play another CCG that can equal the Spoils in its quality of game play, card development (art, flavor and tech) and scalable complexity.

anyone looking for a card game that is above and beyond anything out there, needs to check out the spoils. an amazing game that was bred out of the minds of fellow card gamers, has ridiculous depth and some of the most fluid gameplay out there. also, the amazing artwork and hilarious flavor of the game keeps me and many of my fellow players coming back for more and more. anyone who reads this should know that you'll be doing yourself a great service if you don't take a crack at playing the spoils. hope many of you try it out. have fun play spoils #hfps

I played this for a while, but didn't find it all that interesting. The focus was always on competitive play, which wasn't all that exciting for me. I like some of the ideas (pay for extra card draw, use any card for resources), but most of them are better done in Warhammer: Invasion.

RATING: 7
A great game that owes a lot to magic but with a more humorous/strange theme.  I think it fixes a lot of issues that magic has regarding mana screw/flood.  It does this by initially starting with two resources of your choice in play.  In addition, with your opening hand you can discard cards to the bottom of your deck that you don't want and then draw back up to your maximum starting hand.  Regarding a flood of resources they can always be used in any given turn to draw cards or do other effects.  One great thing is that this game is great for making multiple decks from one collection since there are no neutral cards that can be used by the 5 different trades.  Basically you give your friend one or two 'colors' and you take one or two 'colors' and make decks with no one squabbling over who gets how many neutral cards.  To add to that, I find that it's not just the rares that are interesting/powerful in The Spoils.  The only bad thing to say about this is the cost associated with trying to acquire 4 copies of  every card.

This rating is for the "mature" content (a euphemism for the coarse and obscene?) of The Spoils.  According to the BGG rating scale this rating means "won't ever play this again," which is true for me and my friends.  I personally find cards like Dragon Juice and Eye Gouge rather immature/adolescent and tasteless/repulsive, but do judge for yourself: http://www.thetournamentfaction.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=11&pos=10 http://www.thetournamentfaction.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=11&pos=16

RATING: 3
A game that borrows so much from existing games that it is difficult to find anything that is truely original.  The game works because it is a grafted mix of proven and thoroughly tested designs but without the balance of existing games.  I suspect it will be seen by the time the ambitious tournament scene is kicked off that truely effective decks will be few and broken to a tee.  Since most gamers already know about the power of tempo and ressource managament, this game will be taken apart and stood on its head in no time.  Given a choice between a card which adds 4 life to a character and another which destroys that character outright, let me count the ways in which the first card will be torn and burned.  Most of the recent CCGs at least tried to do something differently; Spoils not only avoids that effort but it also manages to go back in time by obfuscating the crux of action-based timing.  We had to go by MtG acquired experience to figure out how to time effects and stacking.  Laughable at best.

Really good CCG. It's simultaneously more accessible and tactical than many other card games due to some nifty (stolen) mechanics. The art is superb, and the flavour text is hilarious. Really very well done overall.
That said, it's still a CCG--deck-building is the main draw, as the cardplay itself (while good for its genre) is a little too obvious.

UP-UPDATE:  At this point [i]The Spoils[/i] is a game that's good enough.  The theme is an easy 10.  The art is another effortless 10.  But the play... [shrug]  As I said, good enough, a solid 7, nothing wrong here, no tumors under the petticoats, but nothing that hauls me back for more, either.  I'll play if asked, no problem—and if I never offer to play it's only because it's just slipped my mind.

Best trading card game, far ahead of the competition. Basically Magic 2.0, they essentially fixed most of the problems I had with that game without introducing new ones. Less luck based than other TCGs as well, better players were constantly winning, that's something good. Probably because you have more valid choices each turn so better players capitalize on that.

Bought some stuff at Essen to play with my girlfriend. Not planning on playing this full time, but who knows.

Initial thoughts: a nice little game, but nothing exceptionally innovative. Too much creatures, to little tactics. Doesn't seem to offer much strategic choices (at least without buying a lot of booster packs, which I won't do). Will try out other decks I have and see what I think afterwards. Art is terrific.

What I have:

Starter (including the Arcanist/Warlord and Rogue/Banker decks)
One of each preconstructed deck from Seed: Children of the Lingamorph
Competition Pack

First, I'd like to say that I love the theme. I think of the movie Gangs of New York when I play this. Different gangs meeting up in some square with their cooking knives and bludgeons. 

Regarding the game itself, I like how lands are handled. You're never locked out of a land because any card can count as one! The cards themselves offer a lot of options in how they work together. Depending on how you play them, you can get them to work in a certain way. Overall, nice solid system for a collectible card game.

I rate CCGs and their expandable cousins (LCGs, etc.) on this basis: "I will never invest in one again, but assuming that someone else hands me a deck here's what I think of the game."

This a fantastic little CCG. Based on the two-player starter set, it seems to be a bit of a slow burner, but the resource mechanic is excellent.

Ditto with the feel of the world and the card art. I like good card art in any CCG, but the art really plays a huge role in this one -- particularly in covering the mad fantasy aspect of the world. I also dig that it's over-the-top and adult; neither is run-of-the-mill for a successful CCG.

On quality it's a 7, but being a CCG I never intend to play again it's a 5.

Based on 2 games starter vs starter. Game rules are solid (but very derivative), but I didn't find that the speed stat was compelling enough to make up for the additional complexity.

RATING: 7
There's an odd sense of humour running through the game.  The artwork is a little variable, but generally good.

Ruleswise, it's not quite a MtG clone, but very close.  The main differences are thus:
- starting; players start with an avatar.  So far everyone starts with the same one (25 life, start with 2 lands in play, 3: draw a card, 4: put a land in play)
- playing stuff; each spell has a colourless numeric cost, plus symbols denoting resources that you must control (but are not necessarily used to pay for the spell).
- combat; each character has a speed in addition to its' power and toughness.  Highest speed inflicts damage, etc.  You can launch as many attacks as you like (defenders tap)
- locations; kind of like artifacts, but your opponent may choose to attack them instead of you - presumably the only way to be rid of them.

In summary, I liked the game, liked the humour, but the only thing that felt original was the combat.  I suppose it's inevitable with over 8,000 cards in existence but a lot of the cards seem to have 1:1 correspondence with Magic cards.  Will play again, probably won't spend any more money on it.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

I alone will play the game just to enjoy the artwork, and how it supports the game mechanic of each card as well as how it fleshes out the lore of The Spoils Universe.

The Spoils step away from your typical fantasy based card games, and gives you something unique to look forward to.

I started playing Magic back in Revised. I've played all sorts of other CCGs (Star Trek, Monty Python, Guardians, Doom Troopers, Pokemon, Yugioh, Cardfight, Rage, Middle Earth etc), but none of these games quite compare to The Spoils in terms of the art direction, outrageous lore, and the smooth system of mechanics. The Spoils doesn't recreate the wheel when it comes to card game components, but its lack of turn Phases gets rid of a system that constrains players to a smaller window of meaningful choices that affect the outcome of play.[b]It takes what works, gets rid of most of what doesn't (after all, you are still shuffling) and gives you an awesomely deep and strategic gameplay experience that is actually a ton of fun.[/b]

I highly recommend giving this game a shot, heck, you can play it for free online! (search for OCTGN to learn more about that)

The constructed format is awesome and the draft format is hands down the most fun I've ever had drafting.

[b]Other Highlights[/b]
-Resource management style game that lets you start the game with 2 resources already in play.
-Can play any card in your hand as a resource.
-The BEST mulligan found in CCGs on the market (Put any number of cards from your opening hand on the bottom of your deck and draw the same number. You can do this once before the game starts)
-No max hand size.
-NO PHASES - after following the two start of turn rules, you can take your turn however you want.
-Dynamic Combat and Gameplay - hands down, in my opinion, the most strategic gameplay in any CCG on the market.
-Everyone can use their resources to draw more cards or play more resources (there is ALWAYS something for you to do with your resources)

The Spoils is my favorite card, and I have played many. Very fun, great art, and flavor. It is unique in regards to R&D with open community discussions for new cards, effects, and concepts. 

The gameplay is amazing. You choose how to take your turn. The best combat system I have seen, character speed and multiple attacks sometimes in groups. The game is more about strategy and a lot of small decisions instead of being dominated by luck. You do not need a to spend $400 or have a deck full of rares to be competitive, really. 

Also there is a FREE online platform to play on, very cool and helpful. Includes a card catalog and deck builder. 

Give it a try, it does not disappoint. Have fun play Spoils #hfsp

Very similar to Magic, but with some significant improvements: for instance, the mana screw problem is avoided by starting each player with an automatic two resources, and allowing any card to be played face down as a generic resource. You can also spend resource points to draw more cards. This eliminates a lot of the "luck of the draw" aspect of Magic that I found frustrating.

Combat is done with 3 stats: Strength, Life, and Speed. Characters with higher speeds deal damage first, killing their slower opponents before they can counter-attack.

Fantastic artwork is a 10!
Humor is also a 10 (No other game has made me laugh this much!)

My foray into 'the Spoils' has been interesting, and this game will continue to interest me into the future.

Of CCG's - I've only ever played Netrunner and Bloodwars - so I knew that I was taking a leap.  But I also knew a couple of other points; the artwork, theme, and dark humor would draw me in even if the fact that the game was designed by tried-and-true CCG players.

The trouble is, as should be expected, this game's a money trap.  If you only bought one tournament deck and two boosters, you'd probably only have fun and see a fair challenge in competing against a player with an equal chance of the draw. Otherwise, if you came across a player with a constructed deck you'd be screwed.

Aside from this, the whole concept is very cool.  5 trades, each with a unique perspective within the game, play against each other in a tournament setting.  Each trade is comprised of locations, characters, items, and tactics.  Using those resources, players attempt to destroy the other player's overall 'life'.

I'm going to have a high rating for a while because I'm continually interested in this and yet am having difficulty in finding people to play with.

4 plays.  Not a lot new here.  Interesting mechanic of 1 free play or draw.  Very reminiscent of Magic.  It's great to play with the pre-constructed decks without getting competitive.

I called this game's death before it even launched.  It was brilliantly conceived, illustrated, and promoted.  It was a clever progression in a tired genre...and it never stood a chance.  It was the Arrested Development of card games. This will turn up as a hidden treasure, much like Burning Sands or Net Runner. 

Update 2014:  Dislike the initial developers intensely, and they have never figured out a way to sell this thing to people.  I call it instant (well, slowish) karma.

I enjoy the resourcing system quite a lot, and the allowances for playing two factions without needing a lot of each type of resource.  I also love the idea that you can only draw a card OR lay a resource, but you can still do either of those more by paying for it.

The humor is good, but overall there's nothing in this game to keep me playing it over and over.

Pretty much a revision of Magic, with the turtling and mana screw problems addressed. Also, many of the cards feature sexy ladies. Awww yeah.

It's a good solid game, but fairly derivative of Magic while competing directly with it. And obviously (as a dead CCG) there's less scope for deckbuilding versus MtG.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Rating after 1 incomplete play. I dig it. I expect the rating to go up with more (complete) plays.

Update: got a full play in. It really does cherry-pick some of the best mechanics from other games, but combined with some very clean rules regarding timing, targeting, etc. Very flexible card draw/resource system puts the player better in charge of his options rather than being subject to the whims of the shuffle. Great theme/setting with lots of flavor and humor, though it is definitely a "mature content" game. Looking forward to some deckbuilding.

Interesting game and might get a better rating if I get my hands on better decks. Only played with a couple of preconstructed decks and the games seemed to always end up on one player getting run out of deck. That was because you never ran out of gas because you could always draw more and more cards and the situation ended up in a standoff.

played at ConQuest SF.  Found it to be overly derivative and the "humor" to be immature at best.  Honestly I do have a bias against CCGs, in general, although I have friends that play them all as they come out.  That said, I'm not sure why, when you have near-perfect examples of the genre like MTG and NetRunner still available, you would want to keep trying to re-invent the wheel by ever so slightly moving 1 spoke and calling it "new."

It's not "broken" as far as I could tell from a few plays, but I would be perfectly content to never play again.

The Spoils is pretty clearly an attempt to clean up some of the more fiddly and frustrating aspects of Magic: The Gathering. It succeeds in some respects, especially in its treatment of resources (mana in M:tG). In The Spoils, players start with two resources in play, and any card my be played as a further generic resource, meaning games are far less likely to be determined by who gets the right mix of resources/mana, as happens so often in Magic. The Spoils also streamlines game play by simplifying phases and introduces a wrinkle into battles with speed (something Magic creator Richard Garfield did earlier with the Battletech CCG, although it's implemented a little differently here). Do all the "improvements" make this better than Magic: The Gathering? Not really. The game is interesting, and works pretty well (and credit where credit is due - the rules are incredibly clear, simple and easy to understand), but the graphics aren't great, the game feels a tad text-heavy compared with Magic and the theme - the five trades - is a definite step down from Magic. There's something captivating about the Magic: The Gathering universe, and it's lacking in The Spoils. So ... decent game that's worth a try, but given all the CCGs and LCGs out there, this doesn't stand out for me.

This game is NOT just another Magic clone. The 'fixes' that have been put in place in this game do more then just 'fix' issues with other ccgs, they have created a very in depth and well thought out competitive card game. The luck factor is minimized but not so much that it has become like chess or is unfun to play. The replay of this game is as much if not more then other more successful games.  I truely feel that this game has not surpassed Magic yet because people are too invested in MTG. I have played MTG since beta and still play it.. but this game is far better.  If you give it a serious attempt I feel that you will find it to be much better then your first thoughts about it.  Enjoy!

Two player adult fantasy based CCG. A top-decking game that borrows a lot from Magic but has its own mechanics. Resource and deck management are improved to get the cards you need. The staple resource cards are skimpy clothed women. Each player selects a faction card with unique characteristics. Turns play without strict phases. Creatures have speed, strength and life. Items are destroyed, creatures are revived. Location cards can be played for special effects. Tactics cards are similar to instant cards in Magic.  Combat is similar to Magic and resolved based on creature initiative using speed value. Quirky and amusing card art.

Hints of other CCGs abound, yet The Spoils is definitely its own game.  I'm curious as to whether or not the whole rarity factor actually *is* a factor, especially in a game which provides so many choices during gameplay.  I'm looking forward to exploring it further...Update: Raised from a 7 to an 8.  The Spoils is really a lot of fun, and considerably more strategic than most other CCGs I've played (and I've played *lots*).  Anyone who wants to play a CCG with minimized luck should give The Spoils a try during their Open Beta season.  Update: Up from an "8" to a "9".  This is my TCG of choice nowadays; the base set is only 220 cards and I still keep coming up with combos upon combos.  Every card is good in its own way...this hearkens back to the days of early Magic.  However, I know a lot more now than I did back then, and honestly...The Spoils is a much better game, hands down.

An engrossing and strategic card game that doesn't take itself too seriously.  The flavor text, subtitles and artwork of the cards are fiendishly brilliant.  The Spoils seems less luck based than other games in this category.

I dunno...The Spoils seems solid, with a decent resource development system, a terrific mulligan rule, and lots of potential card synergies.  

But I just kept finding myself wanting to play Magic instead.  I have no idea if that's because there's a fundamental flaw in The Spoils or if I'm actually missing out on a great game because I can't see past MtG.

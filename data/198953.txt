Initial game thoughts: 
twice the size of Porf and almost twice as hard to accomplish anything... It seems much more sandboxy in that there are 6 prestige categories and sort of divergent ways of winning. The map play is really interesting and he used the card spatial aspects that Pamir had. The rules burden is stiff though and seems to be the toughest of the three Pax games. Lots of different levers to pull and it's going to take a bunch of games to figure it out (not sure if I'll ever get there or not with my game group). It will be interesting to see if this clicks faster than Porf did in terms of what's required for good play.

After 5+ plays:
Porfiriana wants players to play a game that can end at any time, and end with a "gotcha" sort of flash bang. You play something from your hand, change the regime and presto you buy the topple to win. Pamir shifted away from the hand of 5 cards to a focus on board position to determine primacy and generally reduced the realistic handsize (in my experience). Ren goes one step further and drops the handsize, and then requires an action to declare victory, *and* you have to activate the condition first which wont show up until late game. So we have a different focus in each game. I think Ren is sort of overwrought at times, and at 4p, Pamir shines, but Ren drags terribly. Conversely, a 2p game of Ren is delightfully fast due to the reduced deck size (the downside being that you almost have to commit to a strategy too early). if you can get 3 people who know what they are doing, it would shine (where as Pamir is fine with 3, it's solidly better at 4 due to how allegiances work). This is the most complex of the three, and I found the hardest to teach people. There is a ton of game here for those willing to get a group together and explore it fwiw.

Such a clever game! After the initial learning cliff that is the manual..(watch the Heavy Cardboard playthrough of 2 player, it makes learning the game so much easier)..you'll find an incredibly opaque game where every decision matters. 

It's a lot of fun and with the variety of potential cards that may or may not be in play and the order those come out in, you have to be flexible in your strategy and pay attention to what your opponent(s) do.

Fantastic game!

There is a clear line of development from Porfiriana to Pamir to Renaissance.  The vast number of cards with unique abilities in Porfiriana gave it some of its charm, but made for a lot of reading.  Pamir introduced a standard set of card ops, enabling the cards to be cleaned up graphically.  It also introduced a map and pieces, with those pieces representing factions the players were trying to control.  Renaissance makes the map even more of a focal point.  Players earn income from concessions on its trade routes, while battles fought on it using pieces representing Catholic, Muslim and Protestant forces may well determine the outcome of the game. Renaissance also retains the standard set of card ops.  An amusing element from Porfiriana that resurfaces here is the potential to profit from stoking revolt in your own lands. 

Where Renaissance most clearly departs from its predecessors is in dispensing with topples – cards that can end the game if specified conditions are met.  Instead, comet cards allow the purchaser to activate one of four victory conditions (and there is a fifth if the game ends with no one claiming victory).  Any player meeting an activated condition can use an action to declare their win on any turn.   I like that and I like the greater variety of conditions than in either of its predecessors.  Another significant change is that players’ tableaus are divided between East and West.  A single activation can trigger an op on every card in one sphere or the other.  The strength of these combined actions is mitigated somewhat by many being tied to a single state.   Indeed, this may be a novice error, but I have found myself focusing much more than in Pamir on the one-off effects of the cards rather than on ops that can be quite situational.

The card artwork is handsome and the graphic design retains the clarity of Pamir.   Everything fits easily into the larger sized box.  The rules follow Phil Eklund’s usual format of explaining most of the basics and then putting the rest in a glossary.  They are a decent reference tool, but learning the game from them is horrible.  Only after reading them twice do I now understand that a pawn is a cube, which is also a token.

More than Porfiriana this is a game that takes a bit to make sense of what you are doing and what you should be doing.  The constant placement of tokens on map and tableaux that are not your own combined with other strange elements (flipping map and empire cards over), 6 different types of victory point, less obvious ways of getting money ( no regular income).... all make this a game that really needs repeat plays to shine. The acheivements of this game are amazing but I just need to find enough other people keen to explore it often enough to give it a chance to shine. With two I far prefer playing with the same set up as you would with 3 - it feels the end comes too quick otherwise and given the wide card pool and small number of cards used a bit skewed/swingy.  Not sure if with experience this will hold.  Very possibly my favorite game of 2016.

A very unique and interesting game. If you are just learning I recommend the Heavy Cardboard play through a online and then a reading of the living Rules. We actually found the gameplay to be more understandable and natural then we were expecting. Overall I really enjoyed this one. It can feel very tactical as you respond to the market, etc. I think the mechanics for the trade fair, purchasing cards, and activating victory conditions are genius. There is a lot going on and it can be hard to remember what differentiates the various one-shots, but overall I found it fun and fascinating. Highly recommended!

Juego del estilo del pax porfiriana. Es un juego de cartas, y de desarrollo... al que le han añadido una serie de cartas que hacen las veces de tablero. Hay cuatro formas posibles de conseguir la victoria. El sistema de juego está basado en los símbolos de las cartas.

Está ambientado en las guerras religiosas en la europa del siglo xvi. Es bastante denso de reglas y está lleno de abstracciones. Desde luego, está fuera del alcance de cualquier no aficionado a los juegos.

Supongo que se le irá cogiendo más gusto cuando vas jugando más y conociendo las cartas.

Pax Pamir was good, but was some work to like. Pan Renaissance is a total winner though. It's still that the Eklund multi-layered complexity, so it's not a simple game, but it is very tight and comprehensible. I think it hits a nice spot between Pax Porfiriana and Pax Pamir: it mostly uses large and clear iconography for the special powers, but doesn't eschew text (and so individualized card flavor) entirely. It's actually fairly easy to play, although it takes a game to get up to speed.

Thematically rich and fun, with some very interesting / fresh mechanics blended in. Most of the actions are hard to perform and the downtime increases as the game progresses. The components could have been better, and the game trimmed down significantly (too many rules). But ultimately, my experience was nice and this game deserves other plays.

Pax Renaissance works spectacularly well as a game: you are cast in the role of an aspiring merchant-adventurer in Renaissance Europe and are presented with a frankly absurd number and variety of strings to pull in an effort to secure one of four (!) different victory conditions. It has been (maybe facetiously) described as a "Here I Stand killer" which is cray-cray; aside from a little thematic overlap they're obviously very different animals.

As with all the entrants in the Pax series, the learning curve is daunting, and the sheer amount of information to initially imbibe is vast. This is not a game for dabblers; you're stone cold lost for your first five games or so even after you've assimilated all the rules. Just play. Judge (while you're learning) a game a success by whether you've said "I wonder what happens if I do this" at least two times.

The main break from Pax Porfiriana design-wise is that that game's focus was on building a tableau of cards that passively generated benefits for you. In PaxRen, you build a tableau of cards that don't do TOO much at the moment you initially add them to your tableau but do a great deal when you spend an action to activate them. The trick therefore is to find a set of interlocking actions that give you more of a return than an endless sequence of buy a card/play a card.

As always with Eklund designs, the microlevel historical tidbits are so tantalizing that you can forget that the macro-level historical picture being painted is profoundly weird and implausible. But the time period is so rich and your power to move events is so strong that it's just damn fun to play in the sandbox.

I've been following the development of Pax Renaissance for four years and it's hard for me to capture how apprehensive I was about playing the final game. When I finally got a chance the first play left me dumbfounded. I was intrigued, but the game seemed like a mess.

This was entirely my fault. 

Over the next few days I had a chance to teach the game several times and in teaching the game, I got a better sense of both the game's interlocking systems and the strategy. 

This game is a flat out masterpiece. I'll have a lot more to say about the design with the next dozen plays but I expect this one to crack my top ten list. 

NOTE ON TEACHING:
This is a very easy game to teach poorly.  I think I'll be writing a teaching script when I get some time. Having taught the game several times now, the key is to teach the game in stages (like Pamir, and, to a lesser extent, Porfiriana). Start with just purchase and play and basic map dynamics (trade, levies, cities). Don't talk about one shots except coronation.  After 2 or 3 round introduce the Conspiracies and Peasant Revolts. Play several more rounds. Then talk about religious wars. Then play another round or two. THEN do actions.  At this point you'll be a round or two from the first comet and when it shows work through the victory conditions saving the Holy victory for last. 

This methods takes about 90 minutes to fully teach but the game will only last about 10 or 20 minutes beyond the teaching and all players will be engaged the entire time.

Edit:

Very opaque. You definitely need more than one play before the first lightbulbs start coming on. More tactical than strategic, as you have to make the best with what cards are available on the market.

Sorry Gamelyn Games, but this game should be the one really worthy of the title "Tiny Epic". This game manages to be both highly thematic and have an intriguing gameplay topped by a really interesting end-game/victory mechanism. The only real flaw of this game is its manual: the game is much, much simpler than the manual makes it to be. This is one of the games that truly deserve a Deluxe, high-end version.

Notes:

Reading the rules left a lot unanswered, but after playing a couple of turns things started to fall in place. I love how the theme came through, through the play of the cards. Really drops you back in time, making you feel that you are part of the period. There is a couple of small things that I would like change visually to help with the overall experience, but these are just really personal preferences. I would prefer actual military pieces, instead of the chess pieces, its a bit to abstract for me. Overall a great game, looking forward to my next play. I enjoyed it so much I had to order my own copy. This one needs more table time.

RATING: 4
After 5 plays (three 2p, one 3p and one 4p), just not impressed. Definitely inferior to Porfiriana in my opinion. With a pretty large disparity in quality in cards, but no cost to actually play any of the cards from your hand, or to use their abilities once they are in play, the game pretty quickly degenerates into a crapshoot based on the flop. Either the game tilts early because of the Coronation cards (see below) or, even if you are able to achieve some sort of parity, as morbidhermit says the winner just sort of emerges after a while.

The difference between getting an early Coronation card versus not getting one is huge, since not only does it mean you get an empire for free, you get a concession (probably whacking someone else's concession in the process), the ability to wage campaigns against neighbors, and a card that counts towards one or more of the victory conditions. The Roxelana card in particular, with its 3 units and ability to behead anyone that challenges in the Ottoman space (again at no cost) is especially overpowered.

This leaves the other players behind, as they have to acquire multiple cards before they can even think about acquiring an empire because trade fairs happen pretty regularly, ensuring that all of the areas are militarily built up rather quickly. Otherwise they have to adopt a completely different strategy, something that will depend entirely on the flop and other player's purchases. All while catching up economically because their starting pawn was destroyed before they even got a chance to play.

For player counts, I would say 2p is good for nothing other than learning the game, since it's too easy to reach a victory condition that your opponent can't block. The 3p game wasn't great either, with at least one player probably having to dedicate himself to blocking another player, and probably at his own expense (or at least his own fun). That leaves 4p as the only real way to play the game.

See also: Lonestar's comments regarding the change from 3 to 10 locations which exacerbates the issues with regards to the difficulties in formulating anything resembling a coherent long term strategy.

I won't comment on the rulebook too much other than to say that, in typical Eklund style, it appears to leave even experienced gamers baffled as to how to actually play the thing. Thankfully there are some nice videos to help.

Anyway, thumbs down.

The greatest distillation of thematic scope in a game.  Pax Renaissance takes hundreds of historical individuals, factions, ideas, etc. and boils each of them down to a single card.  These cards are then thrown together in a highly thematic struggle for control lasting only about an hour (for seasoned players).

The game is incredibly complex in terms of both rules and depth in play.  For the rules, it falls mostly on how many different abilities (both one-shots and tableau ops) can appear on the cards, and how many pieces are involved with each of those abilities.  It took multiple plays to become comfortably familiar with the rules to the point of not constantly using player references.  For depth of play, the complexity comes from how interconnected everything is.  Each decision has a ripple effect that often isn't fully understood until many turns later.  For this reason, it is typically unclear how to best get from one point to another, let alone to which point one should best be headed towards.

Pax Renaissance is highly rewarding of multiple plays.  Is is satisfying to play in this sandbox, slowly gaining an understanding of how the many cogs interact with one another, and how to distinguish between a bad move, a good move, and a brilliant move.  If that wasn't enough inscentive for replays, only a subset of the cards provided are used in each game, making the landscape of every game significantly different than the last.

The components in this game are of sufficient quality, though not spectacular.  The cards in particular feel a bit cheap.

All the Pax games are opaque, but an initial play of Pax Ren left me utterly alienated. After two plays of Pax Porfiriana, I sort of get it. I'm nowhere near familiar enough to teach it but I have some sense of how it works. Likewise with Pax Pamir after one play. After one play of Pax Ren, I got nothin.

I think a thorough understanding of at least one of the other Pax titles should be thought of as a pre-requisite. However, whether or not it is a great game, and it may very well be, for me it will likely fall into the category of "Too Many Rules".

More complex to learn than the previous games and probably to teach in terms of its raw mechanics but it might be easier to grok in play. The victory conditions once active stay available and are easy to understand. The main complexity is how to exploit the different combats and holding on to your empire cards. I definitely prefer this to the instability of Pamir and the presentation is better than Porfiriana but the jury's out at the moment, need more plays to draw a final conclusion. The narrative comes through strong but I cannot gauge the strategic depth as yet.

First game of Pax Ren was undirected and lengthy (4P); a chaotic sandbox with goals not even considered until card deck(s) [nearly] depleted. Second game went a little more smoothly as rules were understood. Third game completed in less than 90 minutes; each losing player was close to a different victory condition. Hopefully in the next play(s) we'll be able to properly counter opponents' strategies. Card design is atrocious, though, making it very difficult to take in the full game state.

I have thoroughly enjoyed my plays of this game. I haven't won much, and that's a good thing. The game is extremely opaque. The game can be swingy, but as I learn the game more, further avenues of play become available and I have begun to understand how to protect what I have and grow my power only to the point that I need to win. Now to find the expansion...

I have to say that this is my first Eklund game and I'm very impressed by it.

The first time I read the rulebook was thought and hard to understand all the concepts and details (and it has lot of minor but important details in many actions) but when you start playing with the rules in hand all is clear (even not retained in memory) and the game flows really well.

It was a bit hard to have in mind the use or utility of many of the game possibilities but once you read one game play session or you play your first game things explain by themselfs and then you realize how the game works and what a good design you have in your hands.

The theme in the game is fantastic, the cards are full of History, the game possibilities are great, replayability is really good as being a card game you will never have the same card sequence in play. And you also have four victory game conditions that you don't know when will be active and in which order, so create a strategy to win the game is not as easy.

If all the Pax games are like this one, I will have to buy them all!!! :-)

I was told the game was made to be small for shipping purposes from Europe.  But frankly, the rule book is a nightmare with teeny print & few illustrations  and no sidebars, something I have come to love in a game.  It too had to fit in the box.
     Learning the rules  doesn't mean you can jump in and play a decent game.  There is constant reference to the rule book, an activity I am positive will occur with subsequent games.  Every card has so much info on it, and then get a row of them....wow, it is overwhelming.  It takes too long just to figure out what to do.  
     Too much luck with which cards are turned over.  In this game, and evidently others, a person behind in the beginning of the game, stayed behind the entire game, and it's a long game.  I am sure with continued games, the cards are not such a luck factor--you can learn how to compensate, probably.  It would take a lot of gaming time to get comfortable & knowledgeable  enough to play this game well.
      If I need to fly, I have many other small, great games I would pack first--this game needs a big board, cards, and rule book.  Even then, the game is too cumbersome, not for me.

The most complex game of the series, but covers the sweep of history well in a short time frame. Empires rise and spread, then fall to conspiracy and revolt.  The new mechanisms to the Pax series are the Trade Fairs which injects money into the game, but also builds up the armies of the empires and the comet cards which when purchased allow to activate one of the victory conditions.  Claiming victory requires another action.

Oddly feels a lot like Chrononauts with lots of bells and whistles added - you create counterfactual history, pick cards to flip cards and set up game ending conditions that serve your chosen path. The bells and whistles are what does it though and the story that comes through (for example, what if the HRE was united under Lutheranism and an invasion of the Papacy?) is certainly good stuff.
As a piece of commentary on history it's pretty interesting and a bit conspiratorial considering that bankers have been chosen to take the central stage as avatars of the players and thus prime movers of European history.
Compared to Pax Pamir I'd say it's not quite as tight, and a few ounces short of being as pretty but still as much of a gem and an easier theme to entice new players with.

A very educational game, first of all. The rules book is literally packed with background information on the Renaissance period and its main characters: bankers, princes, queens, famous men, events etc. The theme fits well with the game mechanics and, although a bit complex in places (especially the campaign and the trade parts), the rules are mostly clear; the game is played in less than 2 hours by inexperienced players and in less than 1 hour after playing 2-3 times. Very tactical game, it takes a lot of time to master it, hence great replayability - strongly recommended!

RATING: 8.5
Something weird with this game, it was long time since, after the first play, I could not get a picture of the whole game.
A different point is mastering it, but know how it flows or how you can do things is easy to be done after one play.

Not with this one, It seems that I am going to like it. But will no rate it, nor make my typical comment until I play a second time... at least

Second play and everything start to click on my head

Components: good quality
Complex: hard to teach, harder to master (it is better if someone explains it to you)
Weight: heavy
Players: 3 or 4
Length: less than 2 hours
Mechanics: basically set collection, but not as simply as that
Decisions: lot of choices with lot of interaction
Opinion: after the second play the game clicked in my head, not ready to master it, but now I can see what the game offers... and I love it
As a Banker you try to influence everything and everyone on the map. No matter if it is a Catholic King or a Muslim Republic... you only look for your own interests.
Would be long to enter in all what the game offers, because it is a lot... and a lot in a short time, and that is something amazing.
In order to win you have to.. err... well, this is a Pax game, you have 4 conditions for victory, but not all of them are possible since the beginning. You have to go for a Comet Card on the market, buy it, and activate one of the 4 options (Comet cards are not linked to a specific victory condition, you can activate whichever you want with any Comet card). And, once activated, anyone can win with that (in a nutshell, you can win with Empires, with Republics, with Religion or with Economic Concessions).
And what you can do during the game... you can buy card, play card, sell card, do trade fairs (make money enter the map) or activate your cards. It is important that you have many actions (this makes the game harder to enter), some of them can be activated when you play a card, and others are active in your tableau, and can be activated when you do that actions (activate your West or your East side).
Each action has interaction, and you have to have an eye in the Market, in what you are going for, and what your opponents are doing. With this level of interaction, and the Comet Cards out there you cannot play by yourself (moreover, each of the actions you are going to use, affect any other player).
To finalize, offering so much in a small box and with a short play time can only mean that this is an amazing game. Making you think on the last play during several days, and willing to play it again soon, so you can do that other thing you forgot or did not realize on last play

UPDATE: rating increased. It's amazing what you get in such a small box and game length. Personally, I could not think at this moment on a game that works so well. Lot of options, all of them logical once rules click on your head, and lot of interaction. If I wish to raise any issue with this game, is that you need several plays to understand what you are doing and what do others,a nd when I say several, is more than the usual "the more you play, the more you learn about the game". In this game is special.

As much as I have enjoyed some games, they are too dense to explain to new people (who often find their first game a chore). Im not sure Id play it with people who dont already play PAX games...and in my life there are few.

Greenland is my favorite because the solo rule lets me visit it regularly and keeps the concepts fresh in my mind. Without a solo variant, gameplay for group settings would be filled with constant rule book checks which really drags down the fun factor.

Can't wait to play this!

UPDATE
Played once and was super messy and we made fundamental rules mistakes. But it was a necessary step to learn the basics of the game, and now - as I see how it all works - I am super excited to play this again!

It is a very distinct game from Pax Pamir, and somehow looks more similar to Pax Porfiriana, while it has a totally different feel. At the base of it all is a very fluid core. The situation is changing constantly and implications are not easily grasped at first glance.

UPDATE
Here I Stand in two hours! :)

UPDATE 
Was able to bring this to the table once again. This time I could see that through the right cards with strategic significance - namely the 'Ottoman navy' card, I was able to slowly but surely throw out all of my adversaries from the game. I then proceeded to own all of the east and convert all of it to Islam. Problem was that I was locked into a vicious struggle with another player for influence and play went on exchanging religious zealots and beheadings. 

Finally, the underdog of the game, the poor West schemed a Republic for a much surprising Renaissance Victory!

Over simplified put Europa Universalis (IV) the boardgame, but where the players do not represent a nation but are the scheming and wheeling & dealing rich bankers of that time (à la Imperial 2030) whom use Europa and the Western-Orient as their 'playground' to compete against each other.

Top Notch production and after 2 plays i think Eklund & Eklund looks like they done it again!

Este juego es difícil para mi de puntuar, por un lado el juego es una evolución de los Pax y quizás sea hasta ahora el mejor de los publicados, 

Un juego muy táctico y situacional que se desarrolla rápidamente, aquí Eklund ha mejorado mucho el tema de las condiciones de victoria. Es un juego muy temático con un montón de cartas que te ayudan a poner en situación.

A mi no me gusta la mecánica de Draft y es mi mayor gripe con este juego, muchos lo han acusado de que es un ataque al líder continuo y que estás chequeando condiciones de victoria todo el rato, pero la verdad es que no es algo que lleva mucho tiempo y golpear al líder en este caso hace del juego interesante, al final es una decisión que debes tomar durante la partida: Me convierto en Punching Ball o espero un poco.

El problema del draft es que convierte el juego en algo muy oportunista y táctico, no puedes crear una estrategia a largo plazo o yo no la he visto, tienes que adaptarte a las cartas que puedes obtener del display y trabajarlo como puedas lo cual puede hacer que tu partida tome derroteros no queridos debido a las cartas que van saliendo.

La suerte también es importante y por supuesto gestionarla, pero tengo la impresión de que entre jugadores experimentados gana quien más suerte tiene.

It's basically Innovation with better theming and some chromey, unnecessary stuff added on. Some of the chrome is cool, but honestly it's less thematic than it should be--you're not getting a sense of the Renaissance, really. The game is almost exclusively tactical. I'd happily play again, but honestly I don't see what the fuss is all about.

Pax Renaissance is a smooth little card set, offering Medieval banking clans the opportunity to purchase influence, topple, and otherwise profit from their power in Renaissance Europe.

It's not a wargame, but like the other Pax titles it can be very confrontational, both directly and indirectly.

In early plays, I am enjoying it even more than Pax Porfiriana- Matt and Phil have worked together to improve and tighten play and to create another small box classic.

Lots going on, but loads of fun.  PaxR felt satisfying where PaxPor just game me a headache.  Maybe the theme just interested me more than either Pax Por or Pax Pamir.  This will take multiple plays to better grok strategy.  

Pros:  A blast to play.  A rich theme, multi-player, intricate, challenging, madcap, a history lesson in a box, nice narrative building, good player interaction, screwage, multiple paths to victory, excellent card art, a real sweet spot for play time 1-2 hours, extremely tense - often just that one doggone action away from victory.  Challenging in that you have so many things on which you must pay attention.  There is NO "twiddling of thumbs" in this game -- your mind is constantly moving, processing...scheming.  

Cons:  Fiddly rules, lots to keep track of -- not just your tableau, but everyone else too, first few plays can be a little overwhelming, takes multiple plays to really grok all the levers to the game, I would dare say a lot of plays to really master it.  Sadly, unlikely a game I would introduce to new gamers which is unfortunate - simply too dense.  

All that said, a game I really enjoy a lot.  I learn a bit more every time I play.  Definitely not for everyone, but for those who enjoy the era, a wonderful way to spend a couple hours with friends at the gaming table.

- E2. Play Hand Card and Place Agents: A Bishop can be placed in any card with the same location (not necessarily same printed location) as the Tableau card being played. 

- E3. Sell card: A coronated pair (I1) must be sold as a set, for 4 Florins total.

- E4. Perform Ops (East and West are separate actions): You may perform Ops on cards acquired as a result of Ops (e.g. campaigns), as long as it is in the proper (east or west) Tableau.

- E4. Perform Ops (East and West are separate actions): You may use an Op listed on the new Republic (as long as the card hadn’t already been used for an Op).

- F6. Vote (Political Op): A vassal can be the target of the Vote OP.

- F7. Corsair (Military Op): Use this Op to move a Pirate Rook in a Sea Border of the card’s Location to another Sea Border in the card’s Location or an adjacent Location sharing a Sea Border.

- J1. Conspiracy One-Shot: Any Theocracy may be switched to its other side after a successful Conspiracy.

- L2. Game End: If two players are tied for the Patron Victory, the player with most florins wins.

- M3. Torch One-Shot (torch icon): If triggered, this one-shot inactivates (flips) the Victory Type indicated, if it has been activated (L1).

- Battle Table: In a peasant revolt you can place in empty conquered Cities the Knights & Rooks used to attack

RATING: 8
Potentially my favourite Pax game so far, not least due to the period but also because there's so much more going on than in others, and also because the means of player interaction seem much less... arbitrary? Nothing like the orange cards from Porf, nor really like the campaigning in Pamir; everything stems from the imperial politics which provide the framework.
A couple of question marks: Fugger seems very disadvantaged by starting position and going first, and it doesn't really seem worth playing with 2. I would consider just ignoring the "Fugger always goes first" rule.
The whole game seems to really swing on the East, perhaps more so than it ought to. Yeah, the East was important: but equally, it's pretty much impossible to get levies into the HRE, so what should be a pretty stable area is usually a wasteland.

Update: I have managed a win without playing a single Eastern card, so I'm satisfied it's possible. But with more games this is tending to be a bit fragile - if you don't get into a strong position early, you're basically out of it for the rest (much more so than in the other Pax games, I think). Not sure it's going to overtake Pamir as my favourite.

Youre building a mechanic for your character (a banker from renaissance) and trying to control and manipulate whole Europa. Every card and character card has many texts for explain its own historical backgorund. Brilliant mechanic building, brilliant drafting.

It reminds me Europa Universalis. I recommend this for gamers who is interested in history or renaissance Europa.

A multi-player tug-of-war.  Plus ganging up on a player who - somehow - approaches the win.  Definitely not my type of a game.

Extra 2 points deducted for very unintutive rules, a monstrous FAQ, living rules concept, tiny and cluttered cards, generally poor readability and lack of proper player aids (the enclosed ones are a big JOKE).
Ergonomy level: absolute ZERO.  But what else can you expect from Phil Eklund/Sierra Madre Games?

Once I thought executing people with anti-aircraft guns (Kim Dzong Un's weapon of choice) was a bit of exaggeration.  I don't think so any longer.  I think it's far too gentle way of dealing with lunatics like those responsible for Pax Renaissance's ergonomy.

Way more involved than Porfiriana. The map, the chess layer, map cards and pieces mean at least 3 different things at once. Then there are all the rules on how those pieces move and interact depending on which actions you are taking and which cards have come up. The cards you acquire and play also feature an abundance of icons, actions both one-time and persistent, and various agents and prestige. 

Overall it is too convoluted and complex for my taste. Plus I find this impossible to reach for when Porfiriana exists.

Not intuitive for more than a 2 player game. Very very very swingy with just the right card at the wrong time. Feels like a historical game of Munchkin. Also, considering some cards are randomly taken out at the beginning of the game, you could really be gunning for a strategy that you find out an hour and half later is not even possible.

Un juego redondo.

Pax Renaissance invita a reflexionar sobre la importancia que tuvo el nacimiento de la banca moderna para, la transición de la sociedad feudal, hacia una sociedad moderna.

Cada jugador representa a una familia de banqueros que debe financiar a un variopinto grupo de personajes, intrigas palaciegas y movimientos políticos y religiosos.

La idea de tener dos mazos de cartas de este y oeste, captura perfectamente la contraposición de oriente y occidente.

Es interesante leer las notas a pie de página del manual para entender como se justifican algunas de las mecánicas.

Un buen equilibrio entre simulación y jugabilidad. Se da un aire a su predecesor, Lords of the Renaissance, en algunas de las mecánicas.

The King is dead, Long live the King!

This game has dethroned our charismatic and beloved game Pax Porfiriana for our games of 3 or 4 players.
It feels more tactical, but it has has more quirks and options, and backstabbing happens from the very first minute . In some way it's a concentrated version of all the good points of Pax Porfiriana with more deep gameplay. Rulewise it's a very heavy game so you will need some game aids in your plays.

Epic game in less than two hours!

There is so much game in such a small box. Takes several plays to clear the opaque fog of what you should actually be doing as you play. Pax Ren is a tough game to teach, but extremely rewarding if you can hook a new player on the detailed decisions and subtleties of good play. This is deep, thematic, brain-burning fun for me. Every game I play tells a different story with varied victory conditions and almost-wins that disappear in a moment. I'm probably in the minority that prefers Pax Ren as a 2p game, but it removes the kingmaking and really makes every decision crucial to victory.

RATING: N/A
At the moment I'm just doing some solo play testing. Pax Pamir is one of my favorite games, which helps. I haven't played Porfiriana, so comparisons will be with Pamir. I love the Phil-Eklund-concept. Hence I'm inclined to like this game as well. 

Notes in no special order:
- as far as I understand there's no limit to the tableau, which makes card management far more difficult than in a Pamir game
- special ops in either west or east did at first glance seem like a too powerful ability, but when tested it became obvious that you're too limited by region and power balancing to in normal circumstances be able to totally "reset" the whole game
- some winning conditions though seems very unlikely to be achieved, which makes me wonder whether it in a 2-player game even is rational to try: "... at least two mor Law than any of your opponent" can be totally impossible depending on the mix of cards available, and "more Tokens of its color in play in its Theocracies than both other religions combined" seems extremely difficult to achieve unless someone else unwillingly help you (Edit 161129: "its Theocracies" is key here, and therefore it's a lot more plausible than my first impression, maybe even one of the better strategies for an aggressive Islam victory) 
- in Pamir military can become a deciding factor if no winning condition is met, but it's manageable to improve in due time. In Renaissance I got the feeling that Patron prestige becomes extremely important. In my test for a 2-player game the total amount available, including the empire cards, were only 4. That makes me wonder whether the minimum should be 3 players.

I'm too uncertain to be able to rate it. For the effort and research alone I would give it a high score, but in the end of the day it's about the gaming experience.

(Edit 161129: no tiebreaker for patron prestige win?)

Box consists of two things--a great game accompanied by a horrible rulebook. Would of rated it a 10 but learning the game is not kind to new players. Yes there are people that like reading footnotes in a rulebook about medieval Europe, however it causes many readers to get lost with the game terminology. The game has medium mechanics with heavy strategy. Watch a few teaching videos, and hopefully down the line certain designers will stop making elitist textbooks and instead write easy to grasp "layman term" rulebooks.

This is a fun game and somewhat novel for my experience. I'm not sure it has much to 'say' about the Renaissance, but it serves as a good setting to house what would otherwise be a bewildering array of mechanisms.

The density of the game is off-putting at first, not helped by some crowded graphic design on the east and west cards (because of the flavour text - the map cards and card backs are very nice), but settles down fairly simply in play.

At first glance it looks like something of a sandbox, but I feel that play is mostly tactical and reactive - to the subset of cards that come out each game, and to the play of others. More of a sandpit, with strong tides.

Ultimately a bit too gamey for me, especially in the end game. I enjoy a lot, but when a game often ends with a bunch of 'who can win on their turn' calculations and bashing the leader I'm not that interested to invest the time over and over again.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Sierra Madre Games are always difficult to rate as the first couple plays are mostly about learning the system, cards, and exploring the game states. This one is no different but does feel different from other Pax games. I might prefer the other Pax games at the present but want to give this one more plays to solidify my thoughts. Seemed quite challenging to make what I want to happen, happen due to the cards that come out - and not all cards are used in the game as usual for Pax.

* Notes before playing

The rules are numerous, but each represents one of many possible thematic actions. I expect them to be relatively manageable, in practice. 

After reading the whole rulebook, I am exploring each rules by laying down cards on the table and trying each rule. Very useful: I had missed many simple points, because they made sense when I was reading the rules, but I had not fully visualized them. 

The cards contain significant historical details (for a typical game). Also, icons with standard actions (Corsair, Tax,…) are labeled with the relevant historical fact, which stimulates the imagination and gives them more soul than a simple mechanical action. I am impressed by how the fact that each card is a piece of history makes the theme and story shine through much more than in games with thematic but generic things like a fireball, or even historical events that are only refered to by name like in Twilight Struggle or 13 days: the Cuban missile crisis. This helps describe and remember the story of the events.

* After a first game 

We took a whole game to learn most of the rules (vassals were not used, but that's about it). We had chosen to read the rules for each effect as we went. This was nice and made learning nice enough, but we could not really play/strategize.

One thing that should be made explicit in the rulebook is that taking enough Commerce ops is necessary. This is what I did out of general principles, because this is what gives you choices for cards and thus actions. My opponent did not and this was tough and made the game less interesting.

Wow! This is a really interesting game. I can not give it a rating, as I need more plays. The actions in the game seem very simple at first, but knowing which actions to choose from and how everything connects is complicated. One of the most interesting games I have played recently. Not everyone will like this or give it enough plays to appreciate it. It will be a challenge for me to get others to be interested in playing this. I love the small form factor. Too many  games these days are overproducing content and lack substance. If you are interested in the game, I recommend watching a video playthrough or have someone who has already played the game teach it.

RATING: 4
Disclaimer: I really appreciate Phil Eklund and what he does in his games. I like how he chooses obscure subject matters and attempts to model them in unique ways. Having said that, I believe this attempt falls way short.

Pax Renaissance is not a game in my opinion. It's an attempt at simulating a time period with fairly abstract and incredibly fiddly mechanisms. It seems to me, the game was designed by making cards of historical people/events from the renaissance, and then creating mechanisms for those people/events without looking at how all of the mechanisms work as a whole or in conjunction with each other. 

The backbone of the game is based on the Pax Porfiriana and Pax Pamir (I haven't played this) market tableau system which I believe contributes to the game's problems. I'll try not to go into too much detail but the system creates a lot of randomness as to which cards come out and when. As a result, your ability to plan for the future is minimized and you wind up doing the things you can do versus what you'd like to do on your turn.

Another major obstacle is the locations and how the cards affect those locations. There are 10 locations in the game. If you want to affect a location, you'll need a card for that location (or region) but you can only do what's listed on that card in that region (ignoring campaigns for now). Since there are 10 locations, the number of cards that will come out which allows you to do something in any one is pretty limited. To compare, Pax Porfiriana only had 3 locations which gives players many more opportunities to buy cards affecting any given location.

The interaction of the map cards, chess pieces, and tableau cards is another major problem. The chess pieces on the map cards have large effects on "Oneshots" which can be triggered by playing cards into your tableau. However, your control over influencing what chess pieces are on any given map card is pretty limited (again by needing a specific tableau card with a specific location and a specific "agent" which dictates what chess pieces may be placed). Since the liklihood of getting a card from the market with those combinations is so low, it's pretty hard to plan anything out and, if you do, luck had a lot to do with it.

I won't go too much into the mechanisms but each one has a lot of specific requirements and are so abstracted that they don't make a lot of sense. An example is the repress action. Sometimes you pay a florin to repress but other times you gain a florin. Another is the regime change outcome of oneshots which often doesn't change the regime, but just changes the ownership of an empire card.

As a whole, you will never feel like you are a renaissance banker controlling the outcome of history but rather, a player trying to figure out the best move you can make on your turn based on the luck of the draw.

First impression after three games.  Interesting game, that certainly deserves repeated plays to get a better feeling for it.  It did not initially wow me like Pax Pamir and Pax Porfiriana did when I first played them.  I found the board state to be more opaque than Pax Pamir.  Unless this opaqueness starts clearing up, the game feels less engaging -- it does not have the clear feeling of the struggle of empires found in Pax Pamir, at least visually.  The theme is great, the game length is good, the downtime is minimal, the decisions are engaging, the excitement is there -- all the great qualities of all of Eklund's games are clearly there.  I look forward to playing it again and seeing how my perception changes with repeated plays.  Meanwhile, playing this game made me hunger for more plays of Pax Pamir, maybe because I got to a point in Pax Pamir where the board state starts to make sense and the negotiation and strategies start to be juicy, maybe because a Cole Wehrle and Phil Eklund design, in spite of the common Pax name and publisher, are really very different creatures with a very different flavor.

Very agressive game! Each turn seems like a lot happened. I just wish the rulebook had less footnotes and more details on the rules (trully interesting notes but it takes space from the rules that deserve more examples, footnotes could be available exclusively in pdf format).

(10/17) 9. My first Eklund, I think.  And I love it.  Such a deep game for such a small box of cards and set of components.  I also ABSOLUTELY love the amount of history crammed on every card.  I'd just as happily spent the time just reading them.  Loved the theme, loved the game play and the how dense with options the multi-use cards are as well as the economy to buy them.  Fantastic.  My #9 favorite game of all time.

Tentative rating of 6 after a learning game. Lots of details to learn in this one. I am a little concerned that this may be one of those games where you have lots of history and lots of interesting details, but you won´t see much of it before the game is over. As far as I recall, that feeling was less present in Porfiriana. Time will tell if this gets a second outing.

RATING: 5
For how little you can do on any given turn, the randomness of the card flop makes it difficult to plan more than a turn ahead.

The rules almost seem like they are convoluted on purpose, like how things are named different names at different times, even if referring to the same game part.

The complexity of the rules does not add any richness to the decisions, in my opinion. It does give you more options, but not more interesting options.

I feel like the essence of this game could have been maintained while cleaning up a lot of the rough edges, like how there are several different types of wars that are only 1 minor difference from a different type of war. I think there's just too much in it for its own good.

The main skill tested is if you can remember all the options you have at any given time, and then see which one will move you forward at all this turn (because most won't).

RATING: 10
My most anticipated game of the year, and I finally have it. Just going through the rules now. I am almost literally salivating to play. Hope it is as good as it looks.

Edit: Seems brilliant, although intimidating on first plays since it's hard to tell what you should be doing (the victory cards are a big help here, at least in a big picture sense of 'what should I be doing?'). A clear offspring of both Porfiriana and Pamir, but it does not feel derivitive to me. Wonderfully evokes the era in cards, and a relatively quick play time. (It's been 2+ hours for me, but people who have played more report about an hour, which seems reasonable to me) 

Somewhat complex, but not too bad - best way I have found to learn Eklund's games is to just play out the various mechanisms. For example, to learn how Siege works, just do it, even if it doesn't make sense in the game, strategy-wise. Do a Coronation. Do a Religious War. Etc. that makes learning it approachable. 

Still getting my sea legs on this one, but I really love it. If you like the game, get the expansion, which adds 50 cards (the card art and history is wonderful, as expected), and very little rules/ complexity.

RATING: 2
It's too dense but makes up for it by being too long. This was sheer agony to sit through, being both highly abstracted and highly detailed at the same time, which makes it difficult to teach and difficult to learn. The player aids are nigh useless, with the typical result being that you have to go the rulebook to figure out what the player aid means.

Mostly, this game simply isn't any fun. It packs an absurdly large amount of suck into a tiny box, though, so congratulations on that, I guess. I would not play this again for any reason.

After the first solo play using two characters, I am very impressed.  So much game in a little box, perhaps the best of the Pax series so far, and so much information crammed on the cards, can spend a whole evening reading through them.  Will take some getting used to determining a strategy, but the sheer variety of what cards could fall to you is staggering.  Next go I will also include the expansion, most likely, but for replayability they are certainly not necessary!

Big thanks to Heavy Cardboard for their teaching video. I guess I could have made it through the rule book myself, but seeing the whole thing played and explained finally got me to try it.

After two solo plays (2 players) I do not find it all that heavy but highly tactical. Of course, there needs to be a strategy but much seems to hinge on availability of cards and where the money is currently. Lack of a good strategy likely limits the ways on which one can still "get lucky" when an opponent threatens a win.

All in all, not a bad game, really not. Still, I would have liked there to be more of a story and evolving game play, but it seems a little too tactical and somewhat too short for that.

I've played it a number of times and it's always felt like muddling through. It's pretty hard to get any synergy going in one's tableau. The winner just sort of emerges after a while, where they just happened to have useful cards available to them to buy on their turn. So many cards are terribly situational. In comparison, I feel like cards in Pamir always had some use, since they serve so many functions. I'll keep playing it because it feels like something is there, just very hard to grasp.

Pax games can easily be a 10 or a 3: if you judge a book by its cover, expecting a light filler in a small box, you'll be blown away (litteraly) by this [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17392/here-i-stand]Here I Stand[/url] distant cousin.

The game begins and you think: ok now what. What do I [i]need[/i] to win. And that's the game really: a research of a path; an experience of a journey.

You take your - simple - actions to (try to) shape the world to your desires, and interest, conflicting with the other players in a web of interleaved plans.

I like this one a bit more than Pax Porfiriana, mainly because of the theme & the cards aren't as carbled. Don't get me wrong, they're still pretty carbled! With a little bit of cleaning up (both the rules and the looks) and better production this one might actually be quite good, there's almost some Europa Universalis action here. But I guess nice looks or intuitive gameplay are not Eklund's style. Too bad. It's simply too ugly and fiddly for me to truly like.

Having played the finished game 19 times now (with 60-card expansion 17 of those plays) with an even mix of 2P, 3P and 4P, I can say that you all are in for a particularly enjoyable treat!! It is an elegant, flexible and polished design that is right up my gaming alley. (See my All-Time Top 10) I have seen such variety in the games due to the small sampling of cards used each game. All four victory conditions have been achieved, with Holy and Imperial being the two most common and quickest ahead of Globalizatiion and Renaissance victories for longer games, but not always with strong special abilities in red text making even those two more possible. The changing direction of trade routes CAN (but not always) change the money flow in the game and help build up the ruling class (levies), strengthening regimes. The timing of comets can change the nature and pace of the game and having plenty of florins in reserve, although challenging, can prove the key to winning. The abundant flavor text on historical context of each card (and in the rulebook) is extremely educational and interesting. Art is fabulous. Use of chess pieces is a brilliant and appropriate idea. Thank you for yet another major contribution to the gaming world, Phil & Matt, and the whole play test team!! Will bring my copy to Essen and BGG.Con and run events each evening to introduce players to the game. Just message me.  It is all I want to play now, over and over.

Completely blown away by Pax Renaissance. I boosted my Islamic empire by raising Catholic taxes on my own peasants, driving them out of Ottoman territories, just to bring in more heretics to slaughter by jihad, for religious dominance by turning Ottoman empire Islamic. Other ways to win include generating democratic votes to create republics, spreading peasants around the world as a globalist, having more monarchies than others, capturing young kingdoms by marrying a Queen into them, silencing or beheading others, manipulating trade routes or wars with pirates etc. Subtle scheming and grey/ambiguous options in a tiny box. EDIT: Getting even better on second play, this is now my favorite board game.... Stunning with a custom play mat.

[i]Pax Renaissance is a cardgame for 2 to 4 players who play as bankers in Europe, 1460-1530. As a Renaissance banker, you will finance kings or republics, sponsor voyages of discovery, join secret cabals, or unleash jihads and inquisitions. Your choices determine if Europe is elevated into the bright modern era or remains festering in dark feudalism. Four victories determine the future course of Western Society: will it be towards imperialism, trade globalization, religious totalitarianism, or enlightened art and science?

What is a "paxgame"? Everyone knows what a wargame is: players assume Napoleon-like roles representing nations and maneuvering pawns across a mapfield. In a "paxgame", the players ARE the pawns.[/i]

Maybe the game I've had the most difficult time picking up. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Did the mechanics make sense? Yes. Did I know how my actions impacted the overarching game? Heck no. But that's the thing: since playing it, I've tried to wrap my mind around how to manipulate the board, empires and religions to figure out how to win. It's making sense, but the game needs more plays to determine how I can unlock the puzzle.

Wow. Turned out to be exactly what I hoped for. Extremely happy with this game, and would gladly play any time.

What I liked:
* replay value: only a small set of cards will be included in each session
* varied goals: five possible ways to win; in most cases, players need to spend one action to activate the victory condition and another to claim victory so it usually won't sneak up on you
* story-telling: the historical flavor on cards is wonderful, and the characters/events build a strong narrative
* complex: you are never lacking options to pursue, but it's difficult to know which choices are best at any given moment
* very playable: the game flows nicely once you get started, and is quick enough you could (usually) play a couple of games in one evening

Learning to teach the game effectively will be a process.

Gioco molto, molto, molto, molto tosto. La prima spiegazione stordisce, la prima partita comincia a dissipare le nubi, dalla seconda, terza, si comincia a capire cosa si può e deve fare. Gioco interessante con regolamento e cavilli non semplici da assimilare ma che restituisce comunque grande soddisfazione nel riuscire a capirlo e a 'padroneggiarlo'. Il gioco non nasconde uno studio storico e di ricostruzione incredibile e tipo dell'autore. Gioco per giocatori assidui e non per tutti ma che sa catturare i più stoici.

My first Pax game, my first Eklund game, too. I came into this play almost unprepared and didn't know what to expect, but was first and foremost surprised by how fast it all went after this long explanation of rules. 

The game is highly interactive and aggressive, also it seems quite flexible. Many different paths to chose. I also like the historic flavour texts.

RATING: 8
If you take this game's conspiracy theory-inspired premise literally - that a handful of bankers controlled all the great nations of Reniassance Europe and the Near East - then it seems pretty silly. But if you read it as a metaphor for the role capital played in the artistic and cultural flowering of the period (as the rulebook seems to suggest you read it), then it's actually quite persuasive.
Mechanically Pax Ren is extremely clever and well-thought out. A point of debate is whether the game is more tactical or more strategic, especially compared to the other Pax games. Is it really possible to make long term plans, or is the winner typically going to be the one who most skillfully adapts their play to contingencies, the chance appearance of this or that card? Haven't played enough yet to decide.

I think this is the best PAX game so far. I would be happy to try it again, but I think it suffers from some of the same problems as the other entries in the series. For instance, the way the victory conditions are unlocked is nice, but the end game does still turn into a bit of a grind. And there are a number of, perhaps unnecessary, distinctions and subtitles which undermine the playability of the game. In a lot of ways, the PAX games remind me of the ol' wargames from the 80s: good and fun in you can find a group who enjoy the detail of a simulation and who can get over the learning curve.... there are further similarities: an inaccessible rulebook and un-ergonomic component design (e.g. card design).

It's incredible to me that Pax Ren, with little more than a stack of cards, makes you feel as though you hold sway over the fate of Renaissance Europe. Though there aren't many components, the actions you can take vary widely, from coronations and trade fairs to beheadings and inquisitions. I feel like I've just barely scratched the surface of what Pax Ren has to offer, but I already love it. This game is only going to get better and better, and I can't wait to dig deeper.

Played first two games in a row in under three hours combined- yep, it's that quick, and it'd only get quicker (an hour a game?). Also excellent on Vassal/Dropbox (especially with the new module). Despite the head-spinning rule book (mine is going to wear out from constant referencing) and sand box, puzzle-like play, this is outstanding. Perhaps the best of the Pax titles so far, in fact. Lots to explore, ridiculous amount of replayability due to the amount of cards available, and the winning conditions are really variable.

Like Pax Pamir, it is rather tactical in nature - difficult to carry out a strategy when waiting for the right card - but there's far less negotiation and discussion. Theme is brilliant (flavour text takes up half the card!). The only downside is that it is over just as you are getting your banking empire going (our three player games have finished on the first and second comet) - I'd almost like to see winning conditions for Renaissance and Empire modified to make them more difficult. 

Had one bad teaching experience, but generally if you take your time it's not too bad. Winning conditions more straightforward than other Pax titles, and actions fairly intuitive. Only the one-offs require multiple reminders. What's difficult is to understand WHY you'd want to play a certain card, or why you want to repress or tax or play a conspiracy. It helps to understand you don't actually own anything (except money), instead you're investing in intrigue, influence and taking advantage of European events rather than conquest, revolution and religious fervour.

RATING: 9
Despite the initially-confusing map play, I think Pax Ren might be simpler to understand than Porfiriana, at least in terms of victory. Much less abstract in terms of what is happening where and where/how a particular player is strong. Victory conditions are also more intuitive in that they're generally based on having more in X than other players rather than more than the lowest 2 opponents + 1 or 2. The movement of Bishops is somewhat more intuitive than the card-to-card movement of Pamir.  Player positions seem more stable than in Porfiriana. It's still possible for another player to remove cards from your tableau with little/no work. But the ramifications aren't as drastic since your revenue is less dependent on tableau cards. 

All-in-all it may be the best Pax game yet.

Amazing game - a lot of terminology overhead, but the rules are not actually all that complex, and a new player can muddle through (I did) and still compete for the win.  The hardest part is realizing that most of the pieces on the board are not "owned" by any player, with colors of the pieces only particularly meaningful for the one religious win condition.  Really interested in exploring this one more and becoming familiar enough with the mechanisms so that I can better enjoy all the rich flavor.

Will this be the one game from Phil Eklund that I keep? I absolutely adore all his stuff, but I hate having to sit through all of the horrible rulebooks that make these amazing creations less accessible than they need to be. Anyways, I love the theme here. I am a big fan of that time period in history. Let's see how this one goes. Getting prepared for days of rules reading, video analysis, and forum investigations.

Plus expansion, BGG Promo Pack, Pax Pamir, and Khyber Knives. 

I appreciate Phil's games being compact. I grow tired of giant boxes for all sorts of games and am starting to prefer ziplocks and paper maps even more than before. 

I like that rooks are both nobles and pirates. Intriguing, and we've so far only played knowing about half the rules well, so the fighting between pieces on the map is still largely a mystery to us.

Some notes recently sent to a friend:

Pax Renaissance. I've not played his other Pax games, but I like the history, the fact not all cards are used in the game (altho this could cause problems for trying to win in certain ways), like if few exploration cards come up, you'll be hard-pressed to win with that victory condition. Other victory conditions are law/republics, control of most empires, or religious control between the three religions involved. Get one of those and you win. The tiebreaker is "prestige" which some cards carry, subject to who the designer thought brought especial prestige.

We only played knowing about half the rules, and the combat and revolt type stuff we didn't learn yet, so we spent most of our time running trade and performing only limited actions, like marrying queens. It's abstract, it's weird, you may like the religious element, but we didn't figure that one out too well either since it also heavily involves the map and little chess pieces. 

I am starting to want smaller footprint games and Pax is weird but intriguing.

While Pax Renaissance has a steep initial learning curve, the effort is well worth it and soon pays off in the form of an engrossing, mostly tactical, push-and-pull game driven by the opportunities presented by the market cards. Most of the learning curve has to do with correctly remembering the card icons and their associated rules, but with repeated plays these eventually become second nature and then the game starts to purr like a well-oiled engine. 

As of now we have logged 20 plays and have seen every different victory condition in the book, though some victory conditions are definitely more likely than others. As a two player game play time is relatively quick, typically around 45 minutes, which means that for us Pax Renaissance has almost become a filler that we play in between bigger and longer games.

I own and have now played all three of the Pax card games and Renaissance is my favorite. After a few plays do yourself a favor and read Phil's rulebook commentary at the bottom of the pages. While often provocative, it makes for fascinating reading. Phil is a Big Picture guy and someone I can imagine who will be an excellent dinner companion over a glass of scotch or red wine while discussing big ideas. 

Pax games are not mainstream, but the historical scope and the ideas simulated in all of them are impressive. It is absolutely amazing how much game the Eklunds (and also Cole Wehrle with Pamir) manage to put in these small boxes.

Feels smoother than Porfiriana, but not quite as aggressive.  These are both good things for me.  The rulebook is horrible and some of the mechanisms are still opaque after four goes.  The thematic chrome is fabulous as ever, and the actual game flow is quite smooth.  But in the end, I suspect this will go down in my ratings over time faster than Porfiriana will.

Played for the first time yesterday (02Jan) and ended up as 3 games on the same day, we loved it so much. Excellent game. The tension towards the end is wonderfully agonising; and the end can be a surprise if you don't keep an eye on your opponents.

Yup, another masterpiece from Eklund.  So much going on.  It's like Pax Porfiriana and Pax Pamir had a beautiful Renaissance baby.  Money felt tight and actions felt like you needed just one more on your turn.  Love how all of the mechanics interact.  My brain is cooked after playing, and I don't know if it passes Porfiriana for me, but it's right there with it.

Rulebook is a complete and utter mess... but happy to report the quality of the rulebook and gameplay have nothing in common. There's a lot of depth in a tiny package here. The cards are very attractive and well-researched, and give a sense of the political, religious, and economic complexity at the end of the 15th century. Covers the same period as Here I Stand, but plays more quickly, is less historically constrained, and more replayable.

I've taught some complex games, but the degree of exceptions and rules density makes this game unapproachable for some people.

I've played it twice and it's played out differently both times and even though we were all figuring out what we were supposed to be doing, it clicked about halfway through the first game. Additionally, I think it helps if you have played the other two Pax games as there are some similar elements...and a whole lot of other elements as well!

In the end, it's an amazingly deep game and one that I look forward to playing more in the future, because it's truly excellent.

I love all three games in the Pax series; Pax Ren is my favorite. In my opinion, it is the best 2-player game of the trilogy, although it is still great at higher player counts. Games are highly variable, due to only using part of the cards in each game and there are many different strategies to pursue. Paying attention to your opponents' plays is as important as advancing your own agenda, as victory can come quickly from a seemingly poor board state. It has taken me ~10 plays to get comfortable with the flow of the game but it is well worth the effort. Highly recommended if you enjoy complex games and don't mind putting in the time to learn the flow.

This is the best Paxgame yet, which is a huge statement. Captures the essence of its subject matter beautifully, and allows you to be caught up in the sweeping changes of the era. Religious wars, empires, trade houses, the birth of republics and theocracies alike... an incredible sandbox experience.

Staggeringly difficult to learn with an attempt to include so much flavour that you end up having to ignore that and focus on the rather abstract mechanics instead.  First game ended with a bit of a damp squib; I won but there was no real crescendo or satisfaction in it.

Oof.  The first play of any Pax game is hard, but always worth it.  Understanding all of the different one-shot wars, and how the Ops tie into victory seems very opaque at this point.  But I cannot deny Phil's mastery on display here, he manages to model yet another fascinating era of history, with way less components than any other designer could get away with.

Second play...things started to gel much earlier in the game.  Someone in our group made an excellent point about how the amount of information a player needs to process at any given point is actually much higher than other Pax games.  For example, if you don't know what symbols are on each side of every empire card, an opponent could quietly accumulate enough symbols of a certain type, initiate a vote, buy a comet card, and win the game - all without any other playing having a clue that victory was nigh.

The eccentricity of Phil Edlund is counterpuntual to our whole hobby. Not a subversion, tho he breaks so many rules; complexity, a rather mad love of chaos edging into the game from 'out there.' But mostly it's the scrambling of motives that gets us dirty & personal with the world when most our cardboard simulations seek a more comfortable distance. 

And he does so without a hint of irony. Destruction in his games doesn't come with a wink. He's science's version of the old testament God.

I have only played two games, but I know this is not something I would ever want to teach new players. Coming from Porfiriana and Pamir helped overcome the learning curve, but there are more situational rules than a player will ever retain after a preliminary intro to the game. The rulebook looks like a travesty, the map featured a couple locations in odd places (nitpicky- sorry) and the reference cards for actions are borderline useless. I’d recommend player aids with more detail of actions (the only print size constraint is that of the game box) that can refer to a rulebook by section. The game has some great mechanics and features, but there are too many barriers to bringing Pax Renaissance to the table for new players, and without a significant investment of time, I’d be destroyed playing with anyone who fully grasped the game. This one is a pass for me.

RATING: 7.5
An interesting game that has a very difficult to read rulebook. Once the game was explained it was quite easy in the end to play. However, the real crux of the game is understanding what to do to win. It was in no way an easy task to manipulate the board in such a way that you would win and after one game I could still not decipher the game-state. However, I think this game will greatly reward multiple plays and hopefully I can play it enough to actually understand it.

The rules are incredibly slanted toward the author's viewpoint and read more like a polemic than a description of a game system.  The political and economic theory behind the game is incredibly fringe and is not grounded in reality.  Bankers are not what drove the Renaissance; that would belong to the political, religious, and artistic thinkers of the time.  No credible scholarship is going to make Eklund's objectivist theory fit here.  That's also not to mention the stereotypical "the Islamic world was strange and backward compared to the West" myth that the game perpetuates.  It's irresponsible and ugly to maintain such a racist, long-ago disproved viewpoint.  Eklund does research for these games, but clearly at least in this case, he either researches too narrowly, or he simply ignores anything that doesn't fit his preconceptions.

I've played the game only once, and it's a testament to how much I like Eklund's games that I'm willing to give it another try.  It was inscrutable, swingy, and not grounded in any kind of political reality that I recognized.  Far from being closely married to the theme, it felt abstract and bizarre.  It felt like [gameid=7239], but more complicated and even less understandable.  I'll see if it plays better next time, but as it is right now, this is looking like a massive failure.

I recognize that it will take some time for me to be able to understand all of the strategic options in this game, but I am so excited to invest more time to do so. The gameplay is so rich that I can see playing this game countless times and being able to pursue different strategies each time. Also, the chess-like components are very thematic and add to an already rich tableau of political, economic, and religious intrigue. I concede that this game may not be the best fit for everyone, but I love it already, and I can't wait to play again.

With familiarity and sticking to just 3p the game has started to really shine. The theme comes through in spades; I love the tension in the second half when the comets come out. Usually the whack-a-mole/keep so-and-so from winning dynamic turns me off in games, but here it's done so so well; I'm truly in awe of this design. UPDATE: Once in a while you'll get a confluence of events that makes the game either end too early or force someone to fall on the sword to prevent it from ending early. I guess those occasionally wonky and unsatisfying sessions are the price to pay for the immense variability created by the card flop.

RATING: 8
Noble weddings, church schisms, Crusades into the Holy Land, inquisitions, royal conspiracies, peasant revolts, merchant concessions and trade routes...How on earth do you fit all of this and more into a box the size of a pack of Kraft Mac-n-cheese?

Somehow, Phil and Matt Eklund do it. More impressively, they do it in under an hour.

As usual with Sierra Madre publications, the rulebook is nearly impenetrable, making the game seem much more complicated than it actually is. If you manage to work your way through it, you'll still probably wander around the game a bit aimlessly, as this game casts a wide net and it's never entirely clear which levers are turning which gears...and there are a whole lot of gears.

Once you stumble through a few games though, it really comes together. Like Pax Porfiriana, there are lots of cards but only a few see play in any particular game, making each session a unique experience. There's so much here to learn, so much history to see...this really deserves to be in every heavy gamer's collection.

Pax Renaissance is an outstanding game, and it fits perfectly into the Pax series of titles from Sierra Madre Games. In order to master this third installment in the Pax series, I play a series of Pax Porfiriana, and then Pax Pamir solitaire games to refresh my mind of their rules, and intricacies. This likely paid off, as I didn't find Pax Renaissance nearly as opaque, or tough to learn as its reputation had led me to believe.

Pax Renaissance is a deep, extremely heavy, game with a lot of player interaction. It is also educational, and historical while still being an incredibly interesting, and fun game to play.

There are a lot of moving parts in this game which is pretty much a very complicated tableau builder.  But those complications are fascinating as you try to keep track of four pretty different ways to win the game, how each type of card interacts with other cards, the map and pieces on the map. There is lots of looking in the book to see which type of pieces do what in each type of conflict... it makes me miss the simple days of confusion over internal and external conflicts in T&E!  Still... despite the rules getting in the way of the fun here and there, each game I've played has told a great story of the rise and fall of empires and the wealthy people who drive them.  Certainly worth the effort to learn if you are into this kind of crunchy game.

Played once. I'm not a pax gamer; the game seems designed for people who've played pax before. As such I never really understood what is going on, or what the actual mechanics were or what benefit clearing knights, castles were to me and could not consider long term goals as game/card state changed a lot.  The game left a sour taste. its not something I will ever play again

Oh how am I thankful that this man exists in our hobby. Although I disagree with pretty much every aspect of his Weltanschauung, be it "supercapitalism" or certain contempt for humanities, I cannot help but adore his games, researched like no other board game products (except for some wargames that are significantly narrower in scope), that always come with the strong thesis respected throughout the design. Phil Eklund is an explorer, brave experimenter and visionary, although he would much rather present himself as a businessman. Unlike let's say Friedemann Friese, his experiments do not rise from mechanics, but from the theme - which is by itself anomalous in contemporary design. He stubbornly ignores established principles of good rules writing, yet since they always educate you on lesser known subjects and facts you cannot take that against him. Pax Renaissance may be his most personal game to date regarding the strength of the thesis presented. It profits from previous Pax designs and involvement of several Phil's good associates, it plays out beautifully with both mechanical (activating half of the tableau), spatial (activating trade fair) and historical (beheadings, campaigns, religious wars and regime changes) senses of fulPhilment.

Wow. Blown away. You can do everything. The game is balanced on a knife edge. This was playtested really well.

General strategy: Get queens and try to get some empires and concessions on the board. Early on, the east will be dominant because of trade routes, but the west will be stronger later on because of trade shift and generally stronger, better cards. 

Also, beware of Vlad. He'll behead all your stuff and you'll hate it.

A lot of nuance in this. Wish I could play every day and figure it out.

Edit: Some more plays, still same verdict. Every game looks different and offers different challenges.

Pro: 
* It really feels like plotting and puppeteering behind the stage, juggling with empires, uprisings, revolution and wars

* Hundred years of history condensed in a small package. This has everything a renaissance game needs.

* Lot's of depth and interaction

* Everything intertwines beautifully

* Sandboxy : you can be very creative in the ways you play

* An epic story to tell afterwards

* Very informative about historical events, every card has a background

Difficulties: 
* You must be 100 % vigilant that no player is going to fulfill an objective so a lot of checking your opponents on top of all the possibilities

* Huge amount of rules initially, but easier to explain once it clicks. There are some smaller rules about vassals, repression and emancipation of tokens that make it more complicated.

* Much depends on what is available in the row, though there's many decision and considerations which card to pick.  


Verdict: Masterpiece , game of the year 2016

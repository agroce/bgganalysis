RATING: 4.5
A fun bluffing style game. Very light and easy to teach/grasp. It's just a pain to have to write everything down and pass it around each turn. This is a game that would benefit from the use of technology: load an app on the kindle store or play station, etc... and let the computer do the randomization for you like the Jackbox games, removing the need for pencil/paper and difficulty in reading the other players sentences as intended. How disappointing it is when someone misreads your handwriting resulting in a dud.

Breath of fresh air to play a party game that isn't apples to apples. This one was pretty fun, and is really satisfying when someone chooses your fake saying. 

I could actually see playing this a few more times!

It reminds me a lot of how we played apples to apples back in high school when we wanted to play at school but didn't have the game.

Great party game!  Unfortuantely the rules limit the number players, but we always seem to ignore those.  The more the better.  Think Balderdash with international phrases.  Simple to learn, easy to follow, fun to create the other half.  Very little downside unless you have people who can't read well.

RATING: 7
Box shows a bit of shelf wear on the edges and the card box inside shows some wear on the top of the lid, probably from being put on the bottom and being slid across a table.  Pads are still nearly full, pencils look nearly new (used once or twice?) although only five of the six are present, and all pawns are die are present and accounted for.  Great out of print game.

RATING: 7
Black box shows some shelf wear (white wear through on a couple of corners and edges).  Inside sports the cardboard insert which holds the card box and pads that are nearly full.  There is also a black cardboard pencil box included (part of this version?) with 6 pencils.  Board, rule set, six pawns and die are original.  Nice set.

Six patches on the box show bare cardboard thanks to the tape monkeys.  The box is firm with no split corners, but exhibits obvious wear on the corners and edges.  Inside, this copy has the plastic insert (shows some cracking) which holds the card box , board and rule set (rules not original to the game...printed out from BGG), six pads, three pencils, six pawns, and the d6.  The appearance of the box is not museum quality, but the contents are complete and in fine shape, making it a perfect party game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Box is solid, with a bit of shelf wear on corners and edges, as it apt to happen with a black paper covered box, as well as a small sticky patch on the side (1"x2").  Contents are complete:  Rule set, six black pencils, six pawns, one d6, nearly full writing pads, and full card box. Great for a party!

RATING: 7
Box is solid and shows a bit of white on the corners and edges, as is apt to happen when a publisher put a game in a black box.  All contents (cards, pawns, and board) are in good shape.  The six yellow pencils are new and uniform, and showed up with the game...different from the black ones that typically come with this title.  Rule set is not original.  Pads are nearly full and will provide many, many plays of this fun party game.

RATING: 6
A well-designed Balderdash-style game (That is a game where everyone writes a fake answer, one person reads the fakes and the real, and players vote on which they think is real.)  This one focuses on ancient sayings where you have to complete the saying.  Where creativity can sometimes fail you in the other games of this genre, Wise & Otherwise gives you a good platform to build from.  Often the made up quotes make more sense than the real thing, and this is what makes the game funny and extremely enjoyable.  The flaw is that the game is entirely group dependent.  If the humor isn't flowing in the made-up answers then the game can become entirely too serious which doesn't really suit this kind of party game.  I've had superb games and then I've had just ho-hum games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fantastic party game.  Same mechanics as Balderdash, but the theme (proverbs instead of words) is an improvement in every way.  Whereas in Baldurdash you can tack any definition onto any word, the different adages in Wise & Otherwise force the players to come up with something completely new every round.  The made-up phrases are often very clever and entertaining.

An excellent break from heavy gaming, and superb for friends who aren't gamers.

RATING: N/A
Its the same game as Balderdash, but with 5 proverbs insted of the 5 categories (abbrebiations, weird words, movies, laws, people)

A good family game.  (family games tend to be rated lower on BGG, so maybe this should be a 7)

I would would rate it an 8 if the proverbs were better, but I think that many of them are poorly chosen.  Some of the answers are so obscure that it would be obvious they are the correct answer.   My family agrees, so we allow the reader to select any they want from one card.   

Also - the reader has to exercise some judgment as to which submitted answers are similar (and one is excluded from the reading), and which is close enough to the solution to be credited with 3 points.

I recommend Balderdash instead of this game, but its not bad.  

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Same rules as Balderdash.

Could be a 7 or even a 7.5.  Maybe 6.5 is too low.

The main problem is some of the proverbs don't make any sense, or are kind of stupid.   We found that the reader may need to reject a few proverbs to find an interesting one.  This cuts down on the actual number of usable provers, but there are still many, even if you cant use all 2,500  :-)

Also, because the proverbs are set in the past, it's somewhat harder for kids.  I also felt it wa sharder than Balderdash to come up with answers.

You need the right crowd.  And with the right crowd its a fun (and short) group (party)  game.

Very similar to Balderdash, but coming up with fake proverbs is more enjoyable than thinking up word definitions.  Although Beyond Balderdash has more variety, some of its categories don't work well.

RATING: 6
Cerebral party game. Similar to Scattergories or Balderdash in that it has intense periods of thinking, quiet and writing down followed by exposition. Some minor strategy involved with larger groups in trying to get others to vote for your fake saying.

Good in the right crowd. Over the head of others.

RATING: 7
I'm not overly keen on this sort of game (players supply answers to a question/fill in the missing quote/etc., and then pick the best answer), but this one is not at all bad.  It's not overlong, and the answers are SO obscure and unexpected as to be entertaining.  I wouldn't want to play it every week, but I've ceased to cringe when it's mentioned, and actually enjoy it once it gets to the table.

Like most party games, it's only as fun as the group you play it with. We had lots of laughs the first time we played, not so much on following plays. Maybe the game's replay value is limited.

RATING: 6
To party games in general, I say: blech!  To Wise and Otherwise, I say, bring it on!  Especially fun after much drinking.  It's not really necessary to play the game since you can have just as much (if not more) fun just making up silly endings to the proverbs.

Either way, I guarantee that you'll laugh your butt off!

Revised thoughts after many years with the game:

Wow, somehow this has been the "write an answer" party game that has lasted with our group. These days, it even gets more play than my once-totally-beloved Why Did the Chicken...? which I did NOT see coming. 

In the right group, I still prefer WDtC? But the problem is that game actually puts a LOT of onus on the players to be funny and creative - under a time limit no less. All it takes is one player who either isn't comfortable with that expectation or simply isn't in the mood for that kind of mental challenge (these types of games are often our closers so "I'm too tired" is a pretty common refrain) to kill that game dead.

I think this game works so well as a party game, then, because it has a little more structure and a lot less pressure - you're coming up with these obscure old sayings that don't really have to mean anything, just [i]sound[/i] like they could, which is a lot easier than writing a punchline to a joke. And you only have to do one. 

And man, this game is worth grabbing just for the proverbs alone. There's a ton of bizarre ones that are just laugh-out-loud hilarious. I've never played a game where the real answer to at least one of them didn't send everyone into hysterics. Kudos to whoever found all these gems. It does limit how frequently you can play the game if you don't want everyone to start remembering the answers, but we've been playing this for something like 10 years and we still play it nearly monthly.

And that's what makes this game leagues ahead of Balderdash/Dictionary. Proverbs just work so much better (and are so much funnier) than obscure words. Though it does share my chief problem with those games, which is that players often have to choose between being funny or playing to win. Outlandish answers can sometimes trick people because, again, the real proverbs can be so bizarre in themselves, but quite often I feel the need to reign it in a bit. And ultimately, I want my party games to be about laughter. This game provides plenty of it, but sometimes the design feels at odds.

On that note, the score track just feels outdated. Played 'til the end it's overlong, and there's almost always a runaway win. Also there's a dumb hallmark of "classic" games: an "anyone on this space moves up 3!" spot that we always ignore. It'd probably be better just to play until a certain number of points or something. Usually I'd just suggest ditching the point system altogether (as I do with Concept), but since this game is actually about tricking people the points feel appropriate.

This is too quiet to be a party game, but too goofy to be anything else. You have to have a very creative group of players to make this any fun. 

The quotations that you are completing are strangely humerous in their own right, though!

Neat party game. There is a definite trick to choosing an end to the idiom that sounds real, so that others will pick it. Played with four. I could not see playing this with less than four people because the variety of answers will not be the same. Five (or more) would be better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Finally, the dictionary-style bluffing game carried off to perfection.  People have tried for years to design a game that really is an apt showcase for wit and ingenuity.  For whatever reason, proverbs were the perfect way to do it. This game deserves more recognition -- it is a "can't miss" with sufficient number, as people are surprised by their own and their friends' ability to generate creative, plausible bluffs.  Someone did one heck of a job finding obscure, delightful proverbs to stock this game, and I wish the designer were identified so that they could take a very well-deserved bow.  Well done!

I know I'm going to skew the ratings with this 10. This is given for the group that I play this game with and not so much for the game itself. Especially totally awesome with the "modified" Mesquitian rules of game play. Best played after enjoying a meal of Congalisian Rice.

If I'm in the mood for a party game, this is a strong contender - it's a balderdash variant which I find about ten times as entertaining.

As with any game that hinges on the players' wit and creativity, it requires the right group.  That said, this is a beautifully produced, clever implementation of the classic dictionary game, with an amazing stock of proverbs from around the globe.  The cleverness of using proverbs lies in their cultural frame of reference; the most implausible answer occasionally turns out to be the correct one!  It was the hit of our last family gathering, and I'm on the lookout for more of these gems.

Like a mix of Balderdash and Apples To Apples (with some scoring similar to Dixit).   You are given half of a saying, and need to write down the rest.  People vote and points are awarded, etc.   Nothing you haven't really seen before, but it's not too long and not too intolerable for a party game.

Edition: First edition, English.

Game condition: Excellent to Like New. Opened, but looks unplayed. Even the pencils are untouched. Complete.

Box condition: Mostly very good. Minor shelf wear. Has two flaws: a dime-sized portion of the back/bottom cover surface has been removed, plus the cover box is lightly creased vertically in the top, left edge(not the front), which extends slightly into the corresponding edge of the inner box. No game components are affected by these flaws.

Very enjoyable "make up a believable answer" game.  First half of a proverb is given, everyone writes a second half -- answers are read, votes are taken.  Similar to 
Balderdash but a bit more original.  Can be hilarious is you play with the right people.  Can be frustrating for those who don't feel they're good with words.  I have played this with high school students many times -- always a good time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The proverbs are very hard to predict because some of the endings make sense and some are totally bizarre and even nonsensical. "One needn't devour a whole chicken....to know the flavor of the bird." Okay, that makes sense. But how about this one: "He who has not had breakfast will not be able to . . . tell a citizen from a stranger." Or this: "Cheese and money should always . . . sleep together one night." You really can write down almost anything, which makes the game great for laughter and creativity.

Wise and Otherwise plays at a quicker pace than Balderdash, with less brain strain.  I enjoy both, and would usually choose Balderdash if we're sober, Wise and Otherwise if we're a bit drunk.

As a party game, this one is quite fun. Mechanically, it is identical to Balderdash. What makes it different (and better) is that players are completing old sayings from cultures around the world. This allows players to be much more creative, and makes it harder to distinguish the real answer. For some reason, that just brings out far more laughter than Balderdash or Beyond Balderdash does.

Sold Basically a knock-off of Malarky/Balderdash ... except rather than making up definitions for words you are making up the ending to ancient sayings and then trying to guess which are the correct answers. Like the original game, the more creative a crowd you play with the more laughs you will have. Good enough ... if you want some variety in this genre of game.

Brilliant game.  Takes the basic idea of the dictionary game -- fool people into thinking your fake definition of an obscure word is the real one -- and makes it far more meaningful by requiring the players to finish obscure proverbs, instead of mere words.  One minor problem is that there's no way to try to take down the leader, since you never know whose proverb is whose.  So in my limited experience (played about 3 times) the more literarily gifted player ran away with it each time.

About five different times from playing this game I've laughed so hard I had tears flowing down my face.

This game is GREAT, and also very group-dependent.  If you aren't playing with creative, funny people, it'd be about as much fun as painting a fence.

My favorite to play with is any group with some adults and my two teenaged sisters.  The kids always come up with some left-field stuff that makes my belly hurt with laughter.

This feels like an "intellectual" party game that is not as fun as it should be.  Feels clever, but we never end up having as much fun or laughing as much as when we play Apples to Apples, for example.  Since you have to come up with a phrase and be judged, it's not as easy for introverted and shy people.  However, the many included sayings make for interesting reading.

Eh. It's alright but I'm not a huge fan of games like this. Its one trick isn't that entertaining after a while, and unless everyone is playing 100% seriously, the mechanics fall apart. It can be painfully obvious when an answer is a joke, which makes the real answer that much more clear, which in turn screws over the person reading the question since they can only gain points that round if nobody guesses the correct answer. And that's frustrating. You need the right kind of people to play this with, unless you're just screwing around and don't care about actually having a decent game.

This is a group game for literary people. One player reads the first half of an obscure saying from some foreign culture and players write down what they think the ending should be. All players vote on which one they think is correct, the more obscure, generally, the better! Players are awarded points for having people guess that theirs is the correct answer.
Not a game for non-creative types. But a blast for creative folks and those who are into word games. As they say in Ireland,"Never sell a hen... on a wet day".

They took what might have been a rejected category in the new Balderdash and made a whole game out of it. And yet it works! 

There's an old Greek saying: Cabbage cooked twice... tastes like shit

There's an old Nigerian saying: Oh! My banjo has... a rat in it

In an odd twist, last time we played, cloaca was not mentioned.

A fun and creative party game, though you have to play it with people who like being creative for it to work.

What a hidden gem. This has never disappointed and is always hilarious. Tip: chuck the board and response slips. Pull cards and give everyone a looseleaf sheet; having everyone play as normal, writing responses on normal paper. I love this game because it goes through four distinct phases:
1. Discovering that the craziest, battiest saying is ALWAYS the correct saying, because people from ancient times were very very weird.
2. One of the players 'gets' the game and throws down an answer so nonsensical that it couldn't possibly be made up, except it is and you actually got someone to believe that "The stalk that stands straight...blows southerly"
3. One of the players writes something from modern times, like "Clay cooking pots...are at least better than Tupperware." Nobody votes for it, but everyone laughs.
4. Someone writes something too modern to be the real answer and everyone still votes for it because it's so funny.
After this point, there's a great mix of all four phases: too-crazy real answers, crazy player-generated answers, and great funny answers. The game can go as long as you need it to and generate some great memories. "A Spaniard who sings...is mad or has no money." Classic.

This is essentially Balderdash but with old sayings instead of word definitions. You get the first part of a saying and the place where the saying comes from, and everyone writes own their own endings. Then everyone votes for their favorites.

After reading this in the rulebook... "In the extreme circumstance that a player is unable to come up with an ending, they should withdraw from play and stand on their head for the duration of that round in the hope that increased blood flow in the noggin will produce brain waves in accordance with the creative requirements of the game. The ideal playing environment for Wise and Otherwise is a living room or other area where players can take maximum advantage of seating and space for maximum creativity and comfort. Remaining vertical is optional. In the extraordinary event that a horizontal player falls asleep, they may continue to play as long as they are still able to create plausible endings." ...I knew this would be my type of game.  Yes, it is another "Balderdash" clone, and yes, "Why Did The Chicken...?" is a better "Balderdash" clone, but someone went to quite a lot of work to collect a couple thousand proverbs, and the game is a little easier to play than the other 2 previously mentioned games for those who aren't as creatively inclined.  But what I've gone and done is create a variant that combines all 4 of my creative writing games ("Quip It!" is the other) into one.  Good times!

If you're going for laughs among mixed company, Wise and Otherwise is better than Balderdash.

It's a solid game, and with the right group a really good one. But I'm not sure I much prefer this version to the version that can be played for free, hence the low rating.

An enjoyable Balderdash variant.

Played this game once. It's in that absurdist fashion like Balderdash, but I prefer this game to Balderdash because there's more to go off of for the creativity part. Definitely one of those games that lends itself to people with a good sense of humor and bluffing.

This is an old style write it down and guess game but it has a fun (non-scoring) element in trying to figure out the meaning of the idioms from various nations. It's not great for little ones as a good vocabulary is required to some degree. It's a great game to get out once in a while and zip through in an hour or less.

Like Balderdash only you complete proverbs.
Old Jamaican proverb: Every hoe has ... its stick in a bush.

A guessing/trivia game - these types of games just don't do much for me.  Fun for a once in a blue moon game with a bunch of non-gamers who would like to play a game.

A fun alternative to Balderdash, but the scoring is kind of fiddly.

This is essentially the same game as Balderdash. I rate it slightly worse because it's a lot harder to come up with creative answers that match the style of the game, and people who are worse writers fare more poorly in this one than in Balderdash. Still, it's not a bad option if Balderdash (or a dictionary) is not available.

Weak for 2 players. "Borrowing" from Geoff and Claire. Finally returned it on 11/2009.

Back in the day we played something similar with a dictionary, notepads and pencils. It takes a lot of creativity and that feels like too much work for a lot of people so it doesn't get out much. I love this game.

Freestyle writing is fun, so party games in this vein are one the few types that I find tolerable.

The first major hurdle is being able to write answers in a format (verb tense, sentence structure, etc.) similar to the "real" answers.  Even then, a chuckling reader can guarantee that no one will vote for your genius response.

Fun game along the lines of Balderdash, but better. The phrases lead the made-up entries to be funnier and easier to think up.

Always a favorite in my crowd.  Who knew that proverbs could be so counter-intuitive?  If your gang is a creative group, you gotta try this game.

My favorite party game other than Dixit. It's more cerebral than Balderdash or similar games, which is a plus. The sheer multitude of sayings in the game is impressive and educational.
I love this game and wish it were still in print so that more people could experience it.

This is the game the 'Balderdash' wanted to be.  With Balderdash, sometimes there's just not enough to go on to sink your teeth into defining a word, but with the beginings of phrases in Wise and Otherwise you always have a solid place to start, and it's much easier to be convincing with your endings than it is to be with made-up definitions that seem to exist in a vacuum.

The actual old phrases used here are often much funnier as well.  "Even if the tree snake is long, he can't... sleep on two anthills at once."  Really?  Who knew?

An intelligent group will make this game even more fun, but it's often a good laugh to just throw out some garbage line.  Our games have included stories of mad geese chasing little brothers and the classic phrase "Blah blah blah, [Swedish stuff] blah."  Which so accurately described burn-out from a late game night, that we all got a kick out of it.

it seems that everyone has to work to make this game funny/interesting.  if someone isn&#039;t into it, it gets bad fast.  balderdash doesn&#039;t have that problem.

After 2+ Plays: Basically Balderdash with sayings instead of definitions.  I like Balderdash a little more, but this could still be fun once in a while.

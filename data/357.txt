Nice little filler game. It's all about rolling the dice and pushing your luck, but it's really luck-dependent. I've seen games where someone was more or less stuck at 0 because of the continuous rolls of X. Still, it's quick enough that it doesn't bother me enough.

[original rating: 3.5] I'm sure this game is better than 3.5, but I only played it once years ago and didn't care for it.  I suspect we had a rule wrong.  Must try this one again.

[finally, another play years later, rating: 7] Wow, what a difference.  Now I'm not so sure this game warrants a rating as high as 7, but, boy, did we have a good time.  I suspect the fact that we had a good group of players helped.

[more plays later] Okay, I've bumped this up to an 8 now, as the more I play it, the more I really appreciate it.

RATING: 2
A luck based dice game that takes far too long to play. It suffers from the problem in that it is quite possible to not move a single square as you watch other players grind the victory. The lack of a theme and poor artwork doesn't help.

RATING: N/A
Two plays (4-player, 6-player).

This was fun both times...the pieces are colourful, the game's easy to explain, and it has (so far) been well-received. Feels like it goes on about 5 minutes too long (well, at least with 6 it did). But this could have been my bad for thinking all doubles moved 2 spaces.

Would like to try again for sure.

RATING: 3
Dreadful, dreadful game. I quite like push-your-luck style games but this is more akin to ludo - in fact to ludo with only 1 counter (to really cut down on the chances of you having to make a decision) - than to, say, Incan Gold.

Sub-Yatzee, sub-Frustration. The good doctor really laid an egg with this one.

A different push-your-luck experience than Can't Stop, but a fun game all the same. There's a chance of a tail-chasing end game as everyone tries to punish everyone else and prevent them from winning instead of going for the brass ring, but that sorts itself out eventually.

Not my favorite dice game, but not terrible either. Your decisions are pretty obvious once you realize that rolling a 6 or 7 will likely result in a win, and anything less will not. It's VERY short so I don't mind playing once in a while. Luckily I got this for a steal (after an extremely unpleasant BGG marketplace experience that almost ruined my faith in third party sellers).

RATING: 6
One of the best roll and risk dice games I've played. I like it because it offers players some meaningful choices in a mostly chance game. I enjoy it more than Cosmic Wimpout, Can't Stop, Pig-Mania or Fill-or-Bust and it finishes in about 30 minutes. Don't buy your kid Trouble or Aggravation -- get Exxtra instead. Five players seems to be the sweet spot for this game, but if playing with four or fewer people, I'd recommend removing some of the top reward lines on the chart one at a time (max of 5 with 5 or 6 players, max of 4 with 4 players, max of 3 with 3 players). Otherwise, the game goes too quickly.

RATING: 5

RATING: 7
Great press-your-luck dice game!  Slightly unintuitive at first, but is super simple and easy once people wrap their head around it.

Players roll a pair of dice on their turn, hoping to roll high in order to score points with the result.  They essentially bet on how strong their roll is by placing it on a rung of a scoring ladder (the higher the rung, the more potential points scored).  They then hope their bet lasts through all of the other players' turns.  They lose their bet if anyone rolls a higher result, and then places that result on a lower rung of the ladder.

If you don't like the result of your roll, you may push your luck by rolling as many times as you wish.  However, each die has an "X" on one face, which means you bust and lose points if you roll this face on anything past your first roll.

Overall, just a great press-your-luck dice filler that produces a lot of cheers and groans!

Light, press-your luck filler. Okay implementation, but I like other games better. The X's seem to come up often enough to make pushing your luck seem not that enticing. Choice of placement on the track is where the game is, if there is one. I'd venture to say that slow and steady wins the race - or at least is well-positioned to do so. I'm always worried about writing something off after one play, but I'm pretty confident when I say I don't need to play this again.

A Reiner Knizia dice game where players are seeking a great roll, then judging how good that roll is by placing it on a five rung ladder. Better rolls below the ladder will remove worst rolls above it, but if your dice is still on the ladder next turn, you get to advance.

Great dice game.  Maybe not quite as exciting as Can't Stop, my other favorite in this genre, but it is easier to explain, supports more players, and has less downtime between turns.  I like to use the first roll XX variant in the Excape rules.  I think simpler is better when it comes to dice games and negotiation games, and this is a great example of the former.  The theme of the new version feels very appropriate as everyone tries to pull back the leader and surge ahead themselves.

A Reiner-ized Can't Stop with weird custom dice.  You bid your dice onto a movement ladder after rolling them.  The more players, the better.  However, with 6 players, the ladder can really lock up.  And, there is ton of going backwards in this game, which can get tedious.   It's a fun dice game that everybody should give a whirl, but it's also the kind of game that is only good for a handful of plays.

I wish this game had a means of helping players control things a bit more, as I had an extremely tense and fun session as well as a complete wipeout by another player with no tension after the third turn. The dice dictate which type of experience you're going to have, and if they cooperate, you can have one helluva fun. If not, things can fall flat and you can practically call the game as someone flies into the teens while others are still languishing in single digits. Best played in a series so if you have a clunker of a game you can finish it up and play again.

For a turn, a player rolls two dice. The die results are used to create a two digit number, like sixty-five or twenty-two. If the result is a double, you can move your marker forward. However, you can continue re-rolling your dice if the result isn't high enough. Assuming you haven't ended your turn by rolling any of the X's on the dice, then you can 'bid' the results of your dice for movement. If no one's beat your bid by the time it is your turn again, then you move your token that many spaces.

Goofy spelling aside, this is a nice push your luck family game with lots of player screwage.  Risk it all to get more movement, or use your better rolls to deny your opponents a chance to keep moving.  Push 'em down, scramble for the exits, man....it's EXCAPE!

This is a strong push-your-luck game with some fairly unique elements.

I like how you can knock your oponents off the movement chart, thus creating some very real player interaction. I also like the catch up mechanism of rolling doubles.

It's a good game that plays fast but also has some meat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Will be fun if you really get into the game. Can be a lot of excitement around a specific turn when a player is looking to roll high. Can bog down at the end as the winner will be knocked off the board at every conceivable moment. This keeps the game from being slightly higher for me. Fun, easy dice game though. Not quite as good as Can't Stop, but it offers its own unique interesting decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
[Exxtra] Five plays—two with four, one with five, and two with six. A clever design, but I think that most seasoned gamers are going to find it a little too slow and luck-heavy. In particular, the ending can drag a little as people stymie the leader (or the leader plays conservatively and puts his dice on the "1" rung every time to creep forward at a snail's pace). Knizia has much better dice games out there.

Also, definitely not recommended with six—as light as it is, the game moves too slowly, both because there's a lot of time between turns and also dice get knocked off the ladder more often. Even five is pretty slow. Contrary to popular opinion, I would put the sweet spot at three or four.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excape is a good racing/press your luck game for the family or casual gamers.

I like the track where you put your dice and wish they stay there until your next turn and advance that number of space if so.  Is it better to move slowly every turn or try to advance faster but risking of getting kicked and not move at all?

Many games are pretty exciting at the end!
A game last about 20 minutes so we often play more than once!

I was prepared not to like this, but for family play, it is a great pre-bedtime game.  ~15 minutes & easily playable & winnable by a 6 year old.  For us, Can't Stop can bog down with indecision.  This goes faster and offers the same feeling without the (albeit simple) math.

Ridiculously random.  I guess as ridiculously random games go, this one's pretty good.  There's no theme; it's just constant press-your-luck dice rolling from start to finish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great combination of Can't Stop and, and, I don't know what else. It has the push your luck element, but also has a good deal of screw your neighbor. But by screwing your neighbor, you may also be hurting yourself, so a difficult choice arises--Do you sacrifice yourself to take down the leader, or go for second? Slows down a bit when played with 6. *UPDATE* I discovered we had been playing a rule wrong, which I think contributed to slowing down the game. Played correctly, I don't have a problem with the length.

Neat dice rolling game, leave it to Knizia to make one that works for me. I think this game really benefits from the right group and that might have hurt folks initial impressions. I know several people who just groaned their first few plays and then grew to absolutely adore the game. It really plays best with 5-6 players. I love the look of the game and finally got a copy.

Exxtra is an excellent, inclusive game. Although it's not highly skilled, it is highly interactive, fun, and quick. There are strategic choices, and you can use your cunning to prolong your suffering. Nevertheless, Exxtra is really just a roll your dice and have fun type of game where you can sometimes screw over your opponents. Have fun with it and talk a lot at the table... you can't go wrong, especially since it's very quick.

As a side note, it is worth blocking out certain bid spots at lower play counts. I think blocking out over the number of players is good at low counts (i.e., for 3 players, have only 4 spots, for 2 only have 3 spots [yes, this works and is fun!]).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First played October 17th, 2007. Taught in ~5min, played in ~30min w/ 5 players. This dice game is more luck drive than strategy(however there is some). The goal is to get 21 VPs. Each player gets two dice, a player "X" marker and a scoring "X" marker in their own color. Game board has a "laddar" number 0 through 5. On a player's turn they roll their dice. Each dice represents a digit in a 2-digit number(ex: 7-6, 6-6). One die has a 7 instead of a 6 & an X instead of 5. The other die has an X instead of a 4. Otherwise the 6 sided dice are "normal". If doubles are rolled move maker forward 1 space. You may re-roll as many times are you like unless you roll an "X". If you do, you move back 1 space and lose your turn. At any time you can place your "#" dice on the laddar track & pass. If your dice remain on the board until your next turn, you get the laddar position pts (0-5) you placed them next to on the board. Players dice can be removed by other players by rolling the same or more than you did and placing it lower on the track. I'd strongly recommend giving this a gameplay if you know someone who has it, otherwise consider purchase.

I'm pretty disappointed with this one. My family really likes push-your-luck games but this one just dragged. Moving forward on the board is like slogging through a waist-deep swamp. Too many times your moves are negated. And at the end, everyone is just trying to slow the leader down and no longer really trying to advance themselves, mostly because it's the only chance to catch up. I liken it to the end of a basketball game, where the clear loser keeps fouling in the hopes that the other team's missed free throws will pave the road to victory. Ho hum. I do like the idea of the game, even if it doesn't quite work.

Push your luck with a nice element of screw your neighbor, in the quick-playing filler category. The customized 6-sided dice are a brilliant game component design.

I like the push your luck element to the game.  So far I've only played it with 3 players.  The ladder is so empty it really seems like you need 5 or 6 to make it shine.  You're not doing that much on your turn, so downtime doesn't seem like it would be as much of a problem as in other dice games like Pickomino.

This is a fun variation on classic trick-taking, where it's not just about whether you should keep rolling, but wagering where you think you can get away with putting the dice on the ladder.  You want to advance on the score track, but how greedy should you be?  Rolling doubles gives people opportunities to really have a big turn.  And those x's, they are your friends on that first roll, then you never want to see them again.  One of my grail games and I'm glad I finally have it!

This is one of those great small, easy to setup, easy to play, and easy to introduce games. 

I'm glad I picked up this game, even after the newness wore off. 

It is a must with 5+ players.  If you play with 4 people, do not use the "5 point" slot. (or the 1 point slot if you want a faster game).

Added a variant to where the 2 last place players cannot lose points on rolling an X.  And get points for knocking off the 2 lead players.

The game concept is somewhat interesting, but if you are not very lucky, you would end up losing anyway. 

Sure there are many ways to push your luck and screw people over which is nice but in the end bad dice rolls can cost you the game.

The game tends to be long and repetitive after half of the game. The primary reason the game is not shorter is to even the odds between players. 

But I don't know they could add some twist in the middle of the game or make some spaces have special abilities so that players does not always try to get the highest score, but rather bid on the score to fall on these spaces.

The dice rolling system is pretty innovative.

RATING: 8
I have a preference for the EXXTRA version (by Amigo).

Similar to Can't Stop or or other push-your-luck games, this is very good with 5 or 6 players.  Not too difficult and its a nice dicefest of fun.  Can go on for longer if players are the gambling types (by going one step forward and two step backwards).  The "spite" choice to screw players (leaders) when you cannot win is fun when done with the right group.

I was introduced to this by a friend who regularly used it as an opener at his game night, and it's perfect in that space.  It's a great little dice game for casual gamers -- easy to teach, quick to play, and dice rolls always make for some exciting moments.  The decision making is limited, but does offer enough that there are certainly some strategic moments in the game.  I finally picked up my own copy about the same time I bought Las Vegas and for a filler dice game, I would be hard pressed to choose a favorite between the two.  Excape plays in about half the time of Las Vegas, which gives it an edge, but both are very enjoyable.

I thought this was a fun push-your-luck game.  I like how players are basically betting how well their rolls are going to do when they jockey for position on the movement bid board.  I imagine this plays best with the full 6-player complement.  UPDATE: raised rating 1/2 point -- this is fun and a lot of people don't seem to understand how you can score with lower scores.

Played once.  A "push your luck" type of game wherein players role dice hoping to get a higher roll than anyone else.  While there are a few twists (players must choose where to put their dice on the board; the higher teh put them on the board, the more points they get, but more likely it is that other people will kick them off), basically all you're doing is rolling dice to out-roll the other players.  Maybe if the game took only a few minutes to play I'd like it more, but our game took more than half an hour, by which time it had gotten rather old.

Game dynamics change a bit depending on number of players as with less you can more easily bid higher and still get that. There isn't that much to do if you don't roll high/doubles. The winner is decided by about 80% by luck alone. Still a pretty fun filler with 6 players if you don't mind total luckfest. Seeing other players get unlucky is a joy that never gets tiresome.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]After the initial excitement I had after one play I was searching for a copy and couldn't find one. I then got to play again and the game ran long and was a lot less interesting than I had remembered. As far as I'm concerned Liar's Dice is still the go to dice push your luck game and the only one I need in my collection.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Excape is a great push your luck, family game that would easily replace Can't Stop if I could find a copy. I only played once, but that's all it took to figure out that this is an awesome dice filler. I can't help but compare Excape to Can't Stop because they are both pure push your luck games that deal with probability.

I actually really enjoy both games a lot, with one exception for Can't Stop that Excape solves... play time. Can't Stop with 3 and especially 4 tends to overstay its welcome. There are always edge of your seat moments, but the game drags on too long for what it offers. Excape fixes that, that game plays out at a very quick pace and you aren't constantly moving pieces on a board.[/i]

A quick and fun filler game! The components are excellent. The board is an X shape fit together in a puzzle type layout. The game pieces are nice tall wooden X's that are nice to handle. Each player has their own set of colored dice to roll. You roll your dice and based on what you roll you pick a row to place your dice; if you survive until your next turn without being bumped, you will score the number of points by your row.

50+ plays. A nice can't-stop type game that's provided us a lot of fun and trash talk over the years. I prefer it over Can't Stop as the downtime between turns is far reduced. We use a home-grown variant of starting on the space equal to the number of players in the game. That shortens the game a little to a preferred length and also means you've got something to lose right from the start.

Nothing original here. Just another dice rolling game with way too much luck and often, you have no choice but to keep rolling since you need to roll a higher number then the people who have their dice already on the board. Also, rolling doubles lets you move forward, which has nothing to do with the rest of the game.

Good dice-rolling filler game for up to six players.  Easy to learn and doesn't take much brain, so it's great for the later part of the night when everyone is getting tired and not sure they want to stay for another game.  Can go longer than necessary if all the players decide to beat up on the leader and no one can get ahead, but luck has a lot to do with it, too.

RATING: 6
Firstly the rating is for 3 players, as the problem I'm finding in dice games is that when it's not your turn, unless your interest is that of a referee or as a competitive spectator who's receptive to the drama or humour payoffs of the rolls (the intrinsic quality I love about dice games), the game will be a dull, non-engaging affair. So in Exxtra, for me more does not mean merrier. Another aspect which can diminish the enjoyment is when a player's tactical play involves rolling numerous times (although Reiner's touch is incorporating a threat of the "x's" moving you back and ending your rolling, a simplification and so an improvement over Can't Stop). Of course the other out of turn players can enhance the session by trash talk etc. Still, Exxtra is one of the best abstract dice games I've played, though the perceived nastiness of knocking players off the scoring ladder (at least it causes score stasis rather than going back as imposed by your dice roll of 'x') may cause a negative vibe if not played in that kind of spirit.

Quite a nifty race game with dice wherein players may reroll their dice in order to secure better movement on future turns and/or try to knock other players off this 'future movement track'.

Excape -- Played thrice; three-player.  

Yes, the game [i]is[/i] playable with only three players, but it really doesn't shine at that number.  However, its potential is obvious.  With four, five, or six players, I expect it to be not only more fun, but also significantly different at each number.  This is because of the limited number of spaces on the movement ladder.  I look forward to trying it out with each numbers of players.

WTF?  

When I first heard about the game is seemed so simple and elegant, it couldn't not work.  Sadly, while it technically works, it tends to work without your help; the game is chock full of false choices.  By the second or third turn, it is abundantly clear how the game practically plays itself.  

First, it doesn't take a genius to know that certain die rolls aren't going to make it around to you. So if you don't bust and you get a small number you have to roll again.  Now it should seem like you just put your small number on a lower bracket, but the biggest problem with the game is that you are constrained by the positions left to you.  Because you can't share spaces often you are forced to take a chance higher than is realistic, so it is clear that it is better to get zero and bump a few people than to let other people get points, get the same slots and to ultimately bump you anyway.  If you could share spaces with people, then you could make real decisions of who you bump and what position you think your dice will be worth, you push your luck because you might want to go higher and a bad roll loses you points.  I don't consider a push your luck game to be worthwhile if you are doing it because you have nothing worthwhile to do otherwise.

So what does that mean for game-play strategy, roll high and hope that there is a slot available for you or knock out those that were unlucky enough to sit on low slots when you can't place high.  Often the pay-out, if you get it is in ones or twos, most efforts are futile.  Now what really stinks is that if you roll doubles you get those points and continue.  More often than not this will be a much higher payout than anything else that is going on.  So ultimately, the secret to winning this game is to roll doubles.  GREAT!

RATING: 6
[Amigo Spiele 'Exxtra' 1998 edition] {Dice; roll-and-move, luck-pressing; optimal 4-5p} Exxtra is a good tactical dice game. Players have certain control even though dice are used. Players have to wisely decide when to stop rolling and where to place the dice (even though decisions become trivial sometimes). It's interactive (and may be nasty) - players can intentionally remove other players' dice by placing his 'large' combination at lower rank or intentionally occupy lower end of the ladder to force other players continue rolling. Turns tend to be fast, though may sometimes drag. The game time is short, which makes the game tense.

Exxtra is a very clever design of dice game, which, I would say, is a masterpiece of Knizia.

The components are stunning. The special dice is a good collection item. The markers are large and pretty. However, the box is a little larger than necessary.

Excape is so easy to teach and generates so much tension on every roll that it is my go-to press your luck dice game.  It's so much fun for players of all ages.

Even from a skeptic's viewpoint, it feels more enjoyable than Can't Stop.  Can't Stop is a favorite in our house, a game that my wife absolutely loves.  After playing Excape several times, I believe it to be more enjoyable.  It can play up to 6, goes along fairly quickly, and has a small footprint.  The most recent time I played it, we had a side game of Excape going while playing a couple of longer, slower games.

RATING: 8.5
While I enjoy "Can't Stop", this is a notch above that game. The ability to decide between knocking someone off the score track or playing for a higher column is about as exciting of a decision you can make in a dice game.

Take note of the expression the guy on the box cover is donning.  Pay heed to the crowd that attempts to flee in vain. These are your former friends if you inadvisedly parade this swill out on game night. Rolling doubles was implemented better in Monopoly.
 
Now you know.

Feel the fear.

Painful luckfest with just barely enough of a trick to it to save it from a 1 rating. Makes Yahtzee look like pure genius.

RATING: 5
This is only somewhat a push your luck kind of game, in that too often you have a useless initial die roll where there's no point but to roll again.  That takes the tough decision out of the equation, and the fun too, for me at least.

Simple game of push your luck. Works very well!

I liked this.  I wanted to like it more but I just found that I'd rather be playing Can't Stop.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
only one play, but so far, not as much fun as i had hoped.  at least i bought it used for $12...

needs more plays though.

downgraded to a 6 after more plays.  i wanted to love this game.  the vids i watched about it made me want it.  i definitely like the "claiming a space" mechanism, and the ability to risk manage your moves and bump others off.  its the actual dice rolling that i find somewhat dull.  at least in comparison to things like zombie dice and pickomino.  in both those games you roll a bunch of dice, then you have to sit and think a bit about how you are going to use them - which ones to set aside (lock) and which ones to re-roll.  in excape the post-roll decision is VERY simple - keep it or reroll it all.  no tension, and it feels like decisions are fairly obvious.  

or most rolls are obvious:  keep rolling rolling rolling (hope for no Xes) until you get a decent number, then place it - there is some thinking here - do you put your pretty good roll up high, hoping to keep sitting there until your next turn, or down low and "ensure" yourself of some moves?  do you bump your competitors off and take a lower move/score.  

meh.  i want there to be more dice-rolling in my dice-rolling games.  on the trade block.  i will goto pickomino and zombie dice first any day.

A very good press-you-luck game, by legendary Reiner Knizia, as a tribute to Sid Sackson's Cant's Stop.

Player interactions happen for every simple decision you would make. Superb.

Many decisions are totally irrelevant.  Not nearly as much fun as Can&#039;t Stop, to which it is usually compared.

Very good push your luck game. The scoring ladder is a realy twisted and powerfull system !
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
What a miserable game. I'm surprised at the references to Knizia's version of Can't Stop, because Can't Stop is genius and Exxtra is completely moronic. There's basically no reason not to stop rolling until you get 75, or sometimes 74 or 73. Whoever rolls the most doubles wins. Whoo.

RATING: 7.5
A fun push-your-luck dice game, which I prefer to Can't Stop. The end game can break down a little bit, particularly with less players.

Eh.  Not much to it.  Would rather do something else.

Another filler game by Reiner Knizia, simple and fun dice game, much better than the rating it gets.

If you can get this cheap, grab it, as it's fun to play a round of between more intense games. Mostly a press your luck dice game but the decisions are really interesting and that makes it fun.

(Jan 2011 - After 1 5p game)  Another Knizia game that I enjoy.  Pretty light, but good for a family gathering or a winddown game at game night.  I like the custom dice that go to "7"

In the same way that Shark adds something to Acquire, Exxtra adds something to Can't Stop.  This is a push-your-luck dice game with some typical Knizia mechanics to give you more decisions to make.  Aside from pushing your luck with the dice, you're also pushing your luck with your position on the ladder.  Is someone else going to take what they can get, or try to be mean and knock you off the ladder?  Fun, rousing, and always a good diversion.

1 play: 4 players

A dice rolling, push-your-luck game. Quick to learn and much more fun than it sounds.

RATING: N/A
This is Reiner Knizia's answer to venerable gamer designer Sid Sackson's Can't Stop. For a turn, a player rolls two dice. The die results are used to create a two digit number, like sixty-five or twenty-two. If the result is a double, you can move your marker forward. However, you can continue re-rolling your dice if the result isn't high enough. Assuming you haven't ended your turn by rolling any of the X's on the dice, then you can 'bid' the results of your dice for movement. If no one's beat your bid by the time it is your turn again, then you move your token that many spaces.

It's fun playing simple push-your-luck games with expert gamers, because sometimes they just don't get it.

This is one of those games. A simple game to pass the time at a picnic or family event.

RATING: 6
very simple and superfast but smart game... not many decisions, just a push your luck but with a subtle and a bit mean mechanism where you can be as vengeful as you like. not bad at all!! I'd like to try it in (not too) many people.
-----------------
[EDIT] in 5 ppl it is quite too long, not many of us liked it and you start hoping that the leader hurries toward a victory.

simple dice rolling game without many decisions. Played once. I except the rating will go down with more plays.

Played again, and upgraded the rating. Very random, but short and fun.

This one took up too much space in my trash can, so I finally burned it.

Go play Can't Stop instead.

OK, but rolling double 1, 2, or 3 can move you much faster than rolling high numbers. I don't like that part.

Played a few times (with 4 to 6 players). A pleasant push-your-luck game. Of course luck plays an important role, but it is rather quick, and enjoyable enough so that it does not really matter.

Not a bad game, but it is extremely light.  I was expecting a little more neck-to-neck gameplay, but like anything luck driven, this wasn't the case.

The components are nice and durable.  I feel like I received my money's worth.

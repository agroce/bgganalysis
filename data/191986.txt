Very nice euro-game discovered at Essen. I liked a lot and thanks to the amazing author, the experience was definitely great with my friends at the table (all of us bought our copy, signed by Pieter himself!!).

A linear WP with a few of original and nice twists (e.g. the shared production, the harbour mechanism), playable fast and always tense (both with hardcore gamers or not).

Worth (at least) a try!!

After reading the rules I was already hyped about it. After the first turn I hated it and for the rest of the game I had mixed feelings. The game mechanics are good, but the implementation and the balance are mediocre. I would not play it again, but I can see why the other players mostly liked it.

RATING: 5
It could have been a great game : fast gameplay, clear actions, enough interaction BUT it isn't for the following reason : the costs and income for certain actions are not balanced : why should you buy an expensive speciality tile in the town hall while it is so easy to buy things very cheap from the harbour and when you buy during the harbour action  victory points you even get money again. So almost nobody bought a lot in the townhall and doing the farm action helps the other players. Making the tiles cheaper in the townhall and making the cost of stealing goods in the harbour would have changed the game a lot.

There are some interesting things going on in Rhodes, but the game seems to have needed more development and playtesting. The ending comes too abrupt before your engine starts to get into gear. This was played with two of the expert variants by the designer. Supposedly, these add more time for your engine to evolve with the development tiles. The "expert variant" files are on the BGG website.

The variants were "Demeter" and "Hermes". Demeter uses all of the 15 assignment tiles and Hermes does not give the revenues from the assignment tiles.  I guess I will try to include the third variant "Poseidon" which uses less ships for the players. Hopefully, it betters the game. It's a shame that these variant/rules were not included with the game for seasoned players. 

Still, even with these variants, the game seems to be missing something. Our last turn was anticlimactic where you're left with no particular interesting decision to do. I owe it to the game to give it another shot, but I'm not optimistic. 

Also, download the FAQ from the publisher's website which you will need to clarify what is a very simple ruleset.

2016-11-20 : Cubes & money - gather and convert into points. Oh, and there's tech tiles to help you do this more efficiently. This should be yawn-inducing and at first glance it sure looks every bit like a bog-standard euro, but there are some very neat little mechanics in there which lift it above the mean. First there's turn-order : pay to go early, get a bonus to go later - I wish more games had a mechanic like that. Then there's the mechanic that you get money for putting your cubes on a boat, for your opponents to buy and give money to you, but you can buy them back real cheap if nobody wanted them - so you never feel like you're wasting resources. Finally there's the very clear graphics and layout which always make a game more enjoyable. Need to play this again to confirm, but as middle-weight euro-games go, this is a neat one.

This designer has obviously focused more on the gameplay experience than making fresh mechanics, and the result is very good. Fast and easy Worker placement with a lot of tension and tough choices. Well done.

In a game where money is so tight, I think the tiles should be cheaper in order to easier getting a richer play experience.

Buying goods is the superior action and it gets you money so you can buy more goods all the other players growing stuff and shipping it to market are chumps :P Not a good design and it has a physical problem with the board as you are supposed to constantly slide tiles up the center board but every time you try and slide it hits the crease from where you fold the board so it won't slide, to bad they didn't just print a cardboard river slide you lay on the board. Could have been ok but feel it needed better play testing and proofing.

While Rhodes doesn't do anything new, it's actually a pretty decent game, even though you already know all it has to offer. It's advertised as a light strategy game and that fits well, but it's far from being pointless, as there's quite some depth to it.

The rules may be short, but are one of the worst I've ever read. I needed both, english and german rules to get it going and some things were still not 100% clear.

I gave this game a chance and it didn’t win me over. I have complained about my gameplay gripes at length, but to be honest it’s more a case of the gameplay being weird and not especially good than that it is actually bad. For sure, I didn’t think it was fun, but I don’t see it as the main problem of the game. I could forgive wonky or run of the mill mechanics, if it was supported by a game with an interesting theme, and/or beautiful artwork. Unfortunately, everything about this game is generic, and when it isn’t generic it is interesting in a way that’s not a positive. In case of some of the art work, it’s actually bad.

Acquired this game second hand, and despite all the negative comments in this section. Me and my husband enjoyed the game thoroughly. I really like the board and the information it contains. Sometimes coded information is ugly or difficult to interpret, but the information on the board really adds to the game experience.

In Rhodes you are attempting to get the most points by fulfilling public contracts that ask for specific combinations of resources. You can produce resources by buying particular farm tiles and then doing a produce action.

The produce action is one of the more interesting things about the game. There is room for two people to produce each round (it's a worker placement game). When you produce you choose two of the four types of goods and then assign a production token to each one which range from something like 1 to 5. That many resources will be distributed among all the players, one at a time, starting with the person taking the action. You must produce for 2 different resources when you take the action leading to an interesting positive player interaction. You want to have room to store different goods in case you happen to get some free stuff!

The other interesting bit is shipping your goods down the river. You cannot simply use goods you produce to fulfill contracts. You can only use warehouse goods for that. You can get goods into your warehouse by shipping them down the river which is a queue of boats that get slowly pushed down the river as people add more boats. If your goods arrive at the other end you add them to your warehouse. However, other players can buy them off your boat, which is what typically happens. As they get closer to the end of the river the prices drop. The upside is that you get the money from the player.

It's a light strategy game suitable for casual gamers, but with enough there for a gamer to be happy. I was a bit concerned about a bunch of technology type tiles that are in the game. It seemed that there wasn't really enough time to justify buying them, the game didn't last long enough for them to be worth the investment. It might just be a problem with my first impression, I can't say for sure.

Interesting light-weight game with some good ideas. But badly flawed ... requires more playtesting and game design corrections. As it is, the game is simply bad due to the imbalance between the costs and benefits of some of the tiles/actions (specialist tiles, buying in the harbor, victory points & money when delivering). Pity!

Not so bad, not great either. I suspect after one play that going straight for the points when you can, is the winning strategy. The other tiles are chrome, not worth spending your scarce money on. Very nice production must be said. I like the old-look yet strong moneybills.

Lineare e godibile gioco. Si tratta di un classico piazzamento lavoratori e gestione risorse, nulla di veramente originale ma un gioco che gira bene. Il suo principale difetto sta tutto appunto nella poca originalità ma devo dire che le partite al contrario sono carine e combattute, l'interazione più che discreta per un gioco del genere e la meccanica di spedizione delle merci con le navi è simpatica e riuscita. Da provare sicuramente.

A very light, fast game ... where the most points are to be earned with the assignment tiles.
Gold is to me the key in this game.
Because in category II and III you need gold to do an assignment. Without gold you can not get any assignment tiles in category II and III.
Also buying gold gives you nice points at the end of the game.

This is a nice, lighter euro where players are trying to fulfill recipe cards. The way this happens is pretty interesting. There's a communal "grow" action where a player takes the action spot and then chooses two types of fields that will generate new goods, along with assigning a quantity tile to each of those types. Then the number of goods produced gets distributed evenly among all players who can grow that type of good, starting with the person who took the action. Then, with another action, players put their goods on boats in the center of the board. When someone wants to complete a recipe, they can buy goods from any of the boats they want, paying the people they took the goods from. The recipe tiles have some nice points on them, and they also act as the endgame timer, but points can also come from bonus buildings, or by just spending money on the relevant action spot. There's some really nice tension about wondering if players will buy your goods, or if they'll sit on the line of boats, slowly getting pushed ahead in line, becoming cheaper and cheaper. If they happen to reach the end of the line, you get to keep them for free, which is really cool. Timing the push of the boats is a lot of fun.

All that being said, I felt like the game didn't have enough complication or excitement for me. Even though I was amped enough for this game that I ordered a copy from europe, I decided to sell it, as I have other games that play in about this time that I liked better. I think one of the things that made me shy away in the end was that many of the buildings you can construct didn't seem very interesting. I could see how they would be helpful to you, but the bonuses seemed small and somewhat mundane. If those had been a little wilder, I think this would have been a hit.

Rhodes is a simple resource generation and contract fulfillment game. The standout concept is the way goods travel through the harbour. Players may pay to snap up those goods early, but goods which make their way to the end go straight into their owners' warehouse. I'm also a fan of mechanisms which allow players to choose their own turn order, so that's nice too.

Rhodes moves fairly quick and the gameplay revolves heavily around the harbour. As a result, several areas on the board feel rather neglected and it doesn't make economic sense to buy more than one development tile. Playing with the variant which removes the monetary reward for assignments helps to reduce the focus on the harbour, but the issue still remains. Perhaps making development tiles cheaper might help? Quite possibly a good game if development is put in to flesh the game out a little more.

tl;dr: better than expected

In the past The Game Master has put out some solid games, but their own titles have always fallen short from greatness. [thing=42743][/thing] initially felt really solid, but after a couple of plays a big flaw surfaced and it was a disappointment.
So my expectations for this game where not too high, but I hoped to be surprised. And I was. Of course, I've only played once, but this felt really solid. It plays well, it seems like there is room for different strategies to work.
The only thing that has me a bit worried is the way the end game snuck up on us. It's probably just a first play issue, but none of us where really prepared when it happened, and some scores where really hurt by this. But I expect this to not be an issue with repeated plays.

It's seems too important to get the assignments at the harbour done - much of the game after the first 3-4 rounds of build up seems to be about getting the right spot at the turn action table being most sure to get to the harbour the next round and the round after - making the actual decisions you take late game way to few.

It's very close to be a really really good game, but it's too one sided with the very balanced assignement tiles, that one player won't get their hands on each round, and that's a huge shame when they are / seem to be the most important way to get a lot of points. 

But it has nice and interesting build up mechanichs, and I have enjoyed it - however, the replayability isn't as high as I expected.

Rules are messy, and lacks overview and pictures - but when you figure them out, they make good sense.

Economic euro on the Greek island to produce, ship, store, and fill contracts with a combination of olives, wine, grain, and goat cheese while Egyptian ships of gold enter harbor.  It has a lot of interaction to keep players involved with a San Juan feel of 1) timing group actions to get the most benefit and 2) timing cash with ships movements in the harbor to get the best prices before they get snapped up. I also like that it uses a player turn order draft with ordered cost or benefit.

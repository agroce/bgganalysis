Have SPI and AH versions. A chess like game of manoever in the mid 18th century.

The system is easy to learn with only an eight page rule book, but definitely not a simple game with careful balancing required and battles only when absolutely essential.

Planning to play through a couple of the scenarios to ensure I have the rules down, then will try the campaign variant to cover the whole seven years war.

RATING: 8
Brilliant and elegant system depicting the nuances of the need to maneuveur and seige in the age of enlightenment. The system is not without problems, Frederick is virtually unbeatable and strategy involves keeing away from him and cutting supply. Despite this it stands repeated playings, works well as PBEM and holds up well against more recent renditions of the campaigns. 

Would be a wonderful game to have re-released with minor rules tweaks and a grpahic upgrade.

Probably not for the panzer pushers as battle is often best avoided, something they may find hard to deal with!

This is a good game. I won’t add to what others have said. However, running your leaders around to pick up the widely dispersed garrisons at the start of the scenario is a bit tedious and seems Gamey rather than historical.

RATING: 8
A good simulation of warfare at this time in history.  As a game, it does have certain playaility issues and can drag into a war of attrition based on march and countermarch (battles are just too risky in this game.)  As a simulation I would rank it a 9.

RATING: N/A
("The only rules changes from the first version is that the Allies must subtract two victory points for each eliminated friendly strength point in excess of twenty instead of in excess of fifteen. This simple change dramatically improves the Allies' chances and successfully balances some of the scenarios which otherwise were weighed against them."--Deane Sperdakos) I look forward to trying this. I think I will like it. Reminds me somewhat of SPI's "1812" (Nappy's Russian Campaign), but there are probably a number of games with similarities.

Similar to War & Peace, lots of sieges in this 7-Years War, strength points instead of unit counters.  Low counter count, nice mounted map.  Good hex and counter strategic wargame, wished there was a campaign for the entire 7-years war.  Stacks rule in this game.

I've not played it, but the issue with Frederick always winning with 5 SP sounds absurd. The only thing more absurd are the people who try to defend it. Frankly, it smacks of hero worship.

An odd duck of a wargame. It feels like I'm playing a Columbia block game but it was actually a hex-and-counter chit game! 
 
Frederick the Great has a lot of great features: it is chess-like, low-density, has a fun "fog of war", and the battles are decisive. The turns play very fast once you've mustered your forces and start tangling. The combat and supply system encourage a careful use of manpower for strategic aims, not a bloodthirsty attrition. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Sensational S&T game. Tactics rest in a unique phase order. The best moves seem to sit in the use of forced march. But also a very unique siege action. Very interesting. A game of maneuver not a lot of troops to depend on.

RATING: 9
A game design of pure genius that rewards plan and maneuver.

It is not a slugfest; there are few actual battles, the matter being largely decided by the time troops have successfully concentrated for battle. The military capabilities of the forces on the map are similar. A tactician's game, not a technician's.

Having actually read Frederick's book on the Art of War, it impresses me greatly that this game captures so effectively the operational concerns and decisions of contemporary commanders.

This is a game about keeping marching formations intact, and figuring out the supply capabilities and forced marches so that everything comes together at just the right time to vanquish the less well prepared foe. If that sounds cool, you should definitely get this game.

I started a game of the 1756 scenario before Christmas 2007 (and have yet to finish!).  This was a surprisingly hard game to learn for me, mainly because I stubbornly insisted on playing "Panzergruppe Friedrich"... resulting in the king being duly killed somewhere in Bohemia while on a panzer raid without panzers...  Well, now that I've learned the game properly, its growing on me.  I would imagine that it's at its best as a multi-player game of the whole Seven Years War (I believe AH produced such a scenario, for two players at least).

Useful to know that the original version had only the first four scenarios and the doubling point for victory points Prussian losses was at 15.  The addition of the last three scenarios, heavily balanced against the Prussian, may be responsible for raising the doubling point to 20.  Suggest that experienced players choose sides by auctioning off the Prussian doubling point.

As of this writing, this old game (particularly in the AH 2nd Ed) still holds its own in the pantheon of strategic/operational games covering this period.  Called by others a "minor masterpiece," it combines such elegance in the rules with great historical flavor and a near chess-like playing experience despite great uncertainties.  While the subject (and play experience) is typically not filled with excitement on a turn-by-turn basis, gameplay usually builds up slowly to quite a suspenseful end of the campaigning year for each of the Seven Years War scenarios.

Highly recommended.

Didn't feel like a game depictng 18th Century Europe to me.  Obviously quite a few devoted fans of this.  To me it was like War and Peace (AH) ... it just didn't feel right making "panzer thrusts" in that era.
Perhaps I need to be revisit it and reconsider.  
Personally, I think the use of CDG and connecting boxes (or area games) rather than hexes work better for these eras and scales (lots of hexes but too few counters).

This is a genius game, and 40 years old this year! Very chess-like in terms of planning ahead, but so much more. The sequence of play is very clever and produces the march counter-march activity really well, and adds a lot of uncertainty and friction around your move distance and how the enemy reacts. The use of leaders, supply, depots and sieges is simple but very clever. Overall a great game and I highly recommend it.

This was the game in my first issue of S&T. I was very excited to get it, but remember finding it a challenge to learn. I had never had a game with separate "leader" counters... wasn't used to a game where the counters just represented an abstract "strength" rather than particular units... the forced march rules meant each unit had (in effect) a variable movement allowance if you were willing to take the risk. After a siege, the winning besieger could choose to grant the loser the "honors of war", and I remember it being a challenge to simulate this in solitaire games (Let 'em go? Kill 'em all, and let God sort 'em out? Hmmmm...).

A classic game on a rare subject -- Seven Years' War in Europe, focusing on campaigns conducted by the soldier king Frederick the Great.  I own the Avalon Hill's version and played it several times.  A stack of units moving as a force is something new back in the early 80's for the mass market.  The game mechanics is simple and effective.  Map is too blend for any appeal.  City siege is especially fun with the supply problem leading to attrition effect on the army.  Combat system is adequate to reflect the historical results.  Frederick has an advantage of interior lines and crushing the enemy one at a time each, as long as supply lines were not over-extended.  By today standard perhaps the game lacks a little bit of tactical finesse that we expect from a strategic scale wargame.  Compared to similar scale "War and Peace" by the same publisher, it was a crisp, fun and short game in which you can complete the game in one sitting.  A big plus even today.  This is Avalon Hill's treatment back in 1978.  For a more modern version, check out the 3W's The Campaigns of Frederick the Great as well (it is a different game, not an update to the SPI version).

I have lots of respect for the games of yore, but it can't be denied that most classic wargames have been made obsolete by designs in the past ten years.  FtG is a case in point.  At the time, the use of leaders, die rolls determining movement, and supply rules were fairly unorthodox.  Not so now.  

If I'm going to Seven Years War it on this scale. I'm going to break out Friedrich, no matter the endgame issues.  In FtG, die rolls dominate *everything*.  So, since I am cursed with Unluck, in my first game as Freddy I rolled numerous "1's" for movement and had numerous disastrous battles.  To be fair, some of these were due to the Fog of War ("ooops, I attacked a stack of 16 with one of 10"), but even Fred rolled badly in a battle he should have won, and remained Demoralized (with most of his generals I might add) for most of the game.

Hmmmmm...random movement, random siege results, random battle results, random depot creation, random retreats, random morale recovery, wrapped in a 1970's chocolate coating?  Thanks very much, but this one needs to stay in the retirement home.

A chess like hexgame with armies manoeuvring to form supply lines with deports in order to take fortresses, which are worth VPs. It was a good game, but I played it to death with FTG looking very scruffy at the end. I sold it after I bough clash of Monarchs.

Fred is just too good.  The CRT is also too deterministic, very little tension as he stomps virtually anyone opposing him. The Leader loss rules can make the outcome too luck dependent.

RATING: 8
For an older game this aged well. Did a good job in capturing the importance of supply chain and position warfare. As with much 18 century warfare you spend time threatening the supplies of your opponent to get a siege lifted.

One that I regret I had let go. Traded to get it back.

One of my all time faves. Often difficult to get opponents though due to the fact that Freddy himself is almost impossible to defeat - winning games by avoiding or even loseing battles is a hard sell. AH version.

Quite a fun game, the different scenarios/years change the tactics greatly as the various nations grow or diminish in strength.  There is an issue with the combat that some see as a flaw, though I do not - Frederick himself is 100% unbeatable in most battles if you keep his own army small.  This just forces his opponent to take a historically accurate path of generally avoiding him and smashing his troops wherever he is not.  Anyway, a good game.

RATING: 6
big game, with big flaws which show up after the 20th game, or so. Without these flaws i would rate it a 10. With these flaws, however, i would never think of palying the game again. It is just too absurd, that you cannot defeat frederick while he is moving with 5 strengthpoints (SP), but you have a good chance defeating him if he has 10 SP. Same absurdity is that your chances on victory are lower with 11 SP than they are with 10 SP. But, i have played the game more than 30 times, because of its breath taking elegance and chess-like brilliance.

30 years old (in 2008) and still kickin' it ye olde schoole linear stylee.  Frank Davis takes a simple set of rules that must've turned heads in the 70s (die roll for movement, leaders with initiative ratings, tight supply restrictions, sieges) and formulates a concise package that makes you think in terms of risk, lines of communication, geography, and morale.  Perhaps not "chess-like" as the cliche would have it, but a true thinking man's wargame.

Looks like it would play like 1776 or War & Peace, but it doesn't.  Victory conditions are primarily based on victory points from taking fortresses and causing enemy losses.  Taking fortresses requires laying siege if it's occupied at all, and it will be.  A siege takes time and troops because you require a minimum number of troops to set it up which alone takes two turns (Each turn's half a month) you then bang away on the table every turn hoping for a breach.
There's an odd couple of places that seem to penalizing your leaders for having better initiative.  Movement is a die-roll + initiative as is forced marching.  If your forced march roll + initiative, is 6 or more you take a loss.  Retreating also seems to penalize your leader's with better initiative as you add it to a die-roll to determine the length of retreat, and you must retreat the full amount in movement points.  Would not a better leader maybe subtract his initiative from the retreat die-roll?

Now-a-days there's constant whining about appearance and component quality,   More often than not it hits my ears as an argument between those that read, and those that just look at the pictures.  FtG isn't pretty by today's standards, and the AH chipboard maps were awful when new, and get worst with age.  But, none-the-less, it's a fine game.  It has a low learning curve; easy set-up; challenging play; and feels right for the period it depicts.

The first game I received in my first SPI subscription - it got a lot of play in the two months before my next issue arrived. A strategic study of the Seven Years War, centered on Prussia old Fritz (a distant relative). Map and counters were pretty simple, all that was necessary for this scale. Game play was not difficult, but leave your continuous battle line ideas behind: armies are simply groups of troop strength points which may move only when accompanied by a leader, who has a major affect on their combat effectiveness. Battles are very abstract, and combat can be rare. The game emphasizes maintaining supply lines and troop morale while besieging fortress cities, and using maneuver, as much as the strength of your forces, to defeat your enemies. One of my old favorites.

At least as far as hex and counter games go, I think this is the best on the Seven Years War in Europe. Friedrich may be a good contender for a point to point treatment.

One of the best S&T games ever. Shows the importance of leadership, initiative, and the central position as Fred and his subordinates seek to out-march and outmaneuver their more-numerous enemies.

back in the day it was pretty interesting as you had different commanders with different ratings. And you had winter attrition. But if you look closely it's really just an abstract mechanisms there's no real bluffing or hidden info.

One of the all-time masterpieces of parsimony (simplicity plus depth).  Beautifully captures the essence of Fredrician strategy and operations at a level suitable for high-schoolers and college students.  Fine companion to Duffy or other authors on 18th-century European warfare.  Very few errors in the rules, but one is a whopper -- yet quite easy to fix (see game review and proposed errata in Files section; also have a 1757 replay in the Forum/Sessions section).

This reminds me a bit of War & Peace or 1776.  While the scenarios are generally 18 turns, these turns just fly by.  The rules are wonderfully clear and almost intuitive.  Die rolls for movement, rallying and sieges add a nice dose of randomness.  I find that I want to play this more often than I thought I might.

RATING: 6
Filled with counterintuitive rules that made me wonder if I had them right, such as demoralization never able to be removed by bad leaders, and useless Swedes.  I understand that the game is supposed to be one of maneuver, but this felt very, very strange and gamey when compared to newer wargames.  Despite comments to the contrary, I do not think this has aged well at all.

Played 1756 and then 1757 scenarios. In 1757 Coalition won a substantive victory. French reached Magdeburg and sidelined the Hanovarians. Frederick was too involved with the Austrians in Silesia to help retake Magdeburg although he did take Prague. Must play again soon after these learning games.

One of the best strategic games designed for the 'Age of Reason'. Long out of print but still a winner all the way. At least one fan has created some fabulous new units and a beautifully re-designed board. After having it professionally printed it was like getting a brand new game on Frederick's campaigns. This one should have been re-printed years ago. An excellent simulation of the period. It's all about manoeuvre and sieges. Battles are only a means to an end.

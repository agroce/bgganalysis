Pretty nasty variable worker placement game. 
Kingdom point scoring rules seem unbalanced. Surely the points should be divided for joint kingdoms.

There may be a good game here, but not good enough. The rulebook is poor - several gaps in defining legal play, mixing strategy and theme comments with instructions and generally leaving out key information. The actions are odd in that you can easily mess with other players to no benefit to yourself. This leads to numerous problems with king making and spoiler play. Certainly doesn't stand up well to many other easy fun games available.

Um jogo que peguei na fase do protótipo e na sua primeira versão lançado. Agora chega ao Brasil a aguardada versão completa do jogo. Ele tem um controle de área bem interessante e fácil de jogar. Todos no meu grupo gostaram. Vamos ver o que as expansões agregam ao jogo base.

Not a bad little game. My only complaint is that the kingdom cards are so thin and light that the slightest touch or breeze and they tend to move on a smooth table. Thick card would be nice but then you have the issue of holding a 'hand' of these cards. Possibly I just need a felt-top table.

Neat little filler worker placement / take that game. I like it but it could use some tightening up of some of the ogre cards and the way it explains things is a little ambiguous.

Je bouwt met kaarten aan een koninkrijk.
Je kan de kaarten van de andere ook gebruiken om gems op te delven.
Je kan er monsters plaatsen om hem te ambeteren.
Soit, ik had het spel niet erg goed begrepen, maar wel voldoende om te weten dat het mij niet boeit.
Ik wil het wel nog 1 keer terug proberen als iemand het vraagt.

Party divertido, facil de jugar y con mucha interaccion. Necesita forzosamente de las expansiones, la que permite especializar los enanos y la de royal decrees que cambia las reglas base eliminando algunos de los fallos del juego base. EL modo solitario es muy entretenido tambien.

It's a nice, sweet-looking, pretty cutthroat worker placement filler.
I like its mechanics of building the board, building over existing places, swapping them and moving the workers. Sounds a lot, right?
But it is just filler-level after all. I will play it but I don't need to own it.

This is a neat little game. I liked how quickly the turns flow and I'm a huge fan of how mean you can be in this game. I also feel like the scoring structure is pretty neat in that there are so many ways to score points for such simple concepts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The concept is easy enough, but I feel there should be more rules, the more we played, the more questions we had.  One of the biggest was can you cover another's castle or no?  Aside from confusion due to not enough rules, which led to a lot of arguing,  it was okay.

2016-10-27 : Take-that game where the cute graphics seriously hinder game-play. A game where so much hinges on where the castles, walls, mines and dragons are needs to have very, very clear graphics. Another bug-bear is the advantage given to the last player : it's pretty much impossible for the player ending the game to not get hosed by a dragon card kept to the very end.

Played the game in Essen Spiel 2016. Build your kingdom, dig for jewels, buy your rewards with them, complete your secret objective, place dragons on mines to close them, place ogre's on your opponent's castles to destroy them. When I started the game I was a little cautious, I didn't expect much dept. Then the developer came to us and said: most people this weekend play the game for the first time and play nice. Lay down there tiles, score some points, end the game. But when you play it like three times, you start to see that there is another way to play, to make it difficult to your opponent. Then the game becomes more strategic. So we started playing, started to block our opponents with the dragons and the ogre's. And the game showed us the dept. The dept that a worker placement needs. For me it was THE BEST GAME AT SPIEL 2016.

Tested this on Essen, and even with a full rules explanation, we didn't get this. It felt very unclear and strange. We also read the rules and couldn't find anything that improved the situation, so unless we did a major error, it fell flat.

Later on I have read through the rules again and I think that we misunderstood the resolve rule. So we always returned dwarves empty handed if they didn't complete their mission. As I now understand we should have left dwarves until they finish or they reach the correct number but fail.

Got Dwar7s Fall as part of my Covil (an awesome game btw!) pledge. The artwork is terrific, it's not only cute but also very clear in explaining the rules visually. The rulebook is fine, I don't really see why so many are complaining about it. It's a bit hard to wrap your head around the game at first since it's a worker placement game without a board. The players are creating and constantly changing the board and I guess those points are the reason why so many feel confused with the rulebook.

But in the end Dwar7s Fall is a very light filler that only works on the 3-4 player range. 2p is dull and the solo mode only takes 5 minutes to complete. (The player mat that comes with the solo rules is gorgeous, though. And cheap!) However, with so many games aimed for 4 players, I have a hard time justifying putting this on the table. The expansions I found quite fiddly. I really liked the dwarf upgrades and monument tiles from the Royal Decrees expansion but the rest added lots of little rules that are hard to keep track of.

I bought this at Halifax Geequinox... what a deal they had for the event! $25 Canadian for the game and game matt. Played it three times in a row. Very enjoyable. Cards hold well in hands because they are square. The instructions at the booth were so clear I was almost able to play without instruction manual. Which was easy to read and understand. The art id fantastic with humorous touches throughout.

A little gem of a game.  I bought this on a whim at this years Gen-Con and our play group ended up playing this every night after that and had a blast every time.  This components are pretty good for a $20 game and the game play is solid.  My favorite part of the game is fact that hand size/management forces players to build their kingdoms and interact with each other.  All in all a great 30 minute worker placement game.

Visually appealing game. Good quality components. 
Tile cards are not distinct enough so it is hard to identify what type of building is where at first glance, which distract quite a bit. Strategical part is kind of flat, and it is really hard to keep track what is you score count because it can change each turn significantly. Dig action is kind of tricky, because you have to remember what card is under which one. It also does not make sense thematically, but anyways - it is about dwarfs after all :)
Ogre cards are simply not diverse enough, maybe it gets better with expansion. Definitelly not for family play with younger kids, can be quite nasty sometimes. But if you are in the mood, give it a try.

The game was on my preparation list for Essen, after visiting the booth and getting the rules explained by the more then enthousiastic designer I was convinced. Played it one time already and it is worth every euro I gave. Tile-laying worker placement where you can mess around with your oponents, when you think you're save you should be afraid that you are not ;-) one minor thing > the rulebook is a disaster, had read the rules, had to check bgg to watch a video and to read the faqs.

I like to think about my dwarf king building his kingdom! In this game you can change the boundaries in order to make your kingdom bigger, while narrowing the other players'. I also like that, although the way I play interferes in other players' kingdoms, there's no direct combat. Also, it's difficult to tell who is going to win until we finish the match.

[size=12][b]Why I like Dwar7s Fall:[/b][/size]
+ The game is easy to teach
+ I like the mechanics. The take that mechanic was nowhere near as bad as what I was expecting.
+ The game is short
+ There seems to be decent replayability 
+ The theme is a bit overused but works well in the context of a light-weight game. 
+ The game seems to require meaningful decisions to win

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Dwar7s Fall:[/b][/size]
/ Some of the secret objective cards seem easier to pull off than others but I'd have to play the game a few more times to accurately comment on this observation. I'd also like to play with the expansions.

Played it 3 times with my 11 years old son. This was the first time we played it since we got it, so I decided to go with base game. We really liked it. It's not very complicated, but has hidden tactics beneith, so it is perfect as a gateway game.
I will definately add expansions next time we play because for me as an more expirienced player it was too simple and felt more like filler type game :)

不是很有趣的遊戲
版塊拚放的部分選擇性太少
每個玩家又相同
放工人阻礙別人自己又沒有好處
加了擴充也改變不了什麼
遊戲勝利主軸只是收集資源換分
但又顯得沒什麼組合可以增強效率
感覺是賣畫風的遊戲
規則:
*洗勻交易目標卡蓋著開三張，秘密目標卡洗勻，寶石卡分類放置，巨魔卡洗勻
*每個完加拿一個顏色米寶跟所有對應顏色9張王國卡，抽一張秘密目標卡，年輕玩家起始
*遊戲輪流進行，每個玩家回合有三個階段
1.行動階段 可執行三個行動(城堡蓋了有四個)，以下三種行動任選可重複
>打一張王國卡 跟之前場上打的相鄰(全部玩家)或疊在同類型(左上符號)且沒有米寶的卡上面(城堡跟怪物不能被疊)
>放一個米寶 可放在包括別人王國卡上的任意空格上
*可移動米寶到相鄰卡片上的空位，但不能穿牆
>免費行動 打一張巨魔卡
2.結算階段 結算所有你在卡片上且符合數量的米寶，卡片右下角標示該行動需要幾個，將對應數量的米寶回手後執行行動
3.棄牌階段  手牌包括王國卡寶石卡跟巨魔卡上限9張，要棄到該數量，王國卡不能棄
***卡片介紹***
>城堡 在場上時多一行動，兩個米寶可挖掘，將一張沒米寶的卡片(怪物卡不行)下面的任意張卡不旋轉移動上面，王國內如果有怪物也不執行
*你的王國為跟城堡在同一城牆內的所有卡片版塊，遊戲最後會獲得上面的分數
>礦 放對應數量執行時可拿寶石卡，如果數量有到因為其他原因不能拿也會回手(沒卡片)
>怪物卡 王國內的龍會讓所有的礦拿不到寶石，冰霜巨人會取消城堡的多一行動，上面放滿同色米寶就打敗，將該怪物卡跟目標卡放一起(最後3分)
>酒館 抽巨魔卡
>雜貨鋪 支付對應數量寶石來拿取交易目標卡蓋著，每次只能完成一張
*秘密目標卡只要滿足條件可隨時展示最後記分
*當有玩家回合完成三張以上目標(包括秘密目標)，觸發結束，所有玩家一樣回合數後結束
*加總目標卡分數，怪物卡一張3分，寶石卡分數跟王國內分數

3 players. Unless with got something terribly wrong, this game has absolutely no point. We had no reason to not have only one huge kingdom with all 3 castles. The hidden goals were massively unbalanced. Blocking one player's castle ruined the game for that player. Him then introducing a dragon killed the game completely for everyone else. We're all experienced players, and could not understand how this game could possibly get a decent rating.

Beautiful art, though.

Quick, but pointless. With four players, I felt like we had too little control over our fates, especially (but not only) because of the take that cards. I really do not like games in which you need several turns to achieve something, but someone else can, purposefully or accidentally, mess it up in just one. Still, it did not bother me that much, because the game was over thankfully quick.

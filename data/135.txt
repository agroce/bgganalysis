RATING: 4
An ok game, I need more exposure. I've had a run of not completely comprehending games in my first playing or two... this one was no exception. I'd make a decision on what tile to play, then instantly wish I could take it back after playing. The one thing I'll say about Kontor is that the little areas seem to be key... trying to build a big area to prevent your opponent from scoring just results in less room for you to maneuver in later. Also, the randomness of the deck sometimes is frustrating. In my second game I could have done a lot with the crane tile that never came. Also, we did not try any of the scenarios located at the end of the rules. I think these could prove to be a bit more enjoyable, so I'm definitely planning on playing a few more times before I make a final decision.

1. Play with the ship.
2. Be sure that your cards are face up. If you aren't looking ahead, you aren't playing well.
3. If you feel that it's too wide open at the beginning of the game, play with one of the alternate configurations.
4. Play with the ship.
5. Use the special cards.
6. Be sure to score only the five largest configurations.

I've given it a few tries but have now permanantly been put off by this very dry and unexciting building and area influence game. It tries to do the same things other games already did in a much better way. The only thing remotely interesting is the scoring. Still, this does not make this a good game.

This is an underappreciated gem!  Don&#039;t know why it has garnered a fair amount of negative opinion.  The advanced game (which is the recommended version) is very satisfying.  Because players use separate decks of cards the game is inherently balanced, and luck is minimized.  There are many ways to attack and defend, many decision points each turn.  People who call this game bland or dull just don&#039;t get it.  This is a tense, exciting two-person struggle.  A lot of variants and expansions are available for free on the Web.  My favorite two-player tile laying game.  Maybe Schacht&#039;s best game.

Packhuys is a must for anyone living in Amsterdam—so my girlfriend decided she should have it. At its heart, it is a card game where you try to build closed-off districts with wharehouses ('packhuys' in 17th century Dutch). The fun comes in when you pester your opponent: you can force him to pay money to build whatever he was planning to build, or you can alert the port authorities and instruct them to remove an 'illegal' wharehouse. It is definitely not easy to balance expansion of your trade empire and keeping the other player busy with the law or the bean counters. The game plays smoothly, despite the ever troublesome scoring of completed districts. I have not yet played the game sufficiently to shake off the desire to build large districts: the idea is to build lots of 'em, because large and small districts score one point each—if they make it to the top five of biggest districts, that is. 

[b]Update[/b]  Ehm, no. The game is too tactical to be funny or interesting, and if your opponent through sheer luck draws more cards with coins than you do you're stuck as he can build up a head start. In addition the cards really dictate what you can and cannot do. Downgraded the rating, moved onto the trade / giveaway pile.

[b]Update 2[/b] Sold off quickly thereafter.

We like this alot!  Try the basic game for starters, just to get a feel of the mechanics, then add the three or so extra rules for the full experience.  Wonderfully balanced design giving lesser cards the edge in terms of cardplay timing.  Enough wooden bits to give it a boardgame feel, even though its more of a cardgame in execution.  Highly recommended as a two player game.

Kontor is a partnership tile-laying game. Players try to gain majorities in various commodities in the Amsterdam harbour district.

Gameplay in general seems somewhat family-oriented (it's a Schacht, after all), although there is a considerable potential for screwage present in the advanced game that doesn't quite fit that target group. Even though the individual game parts work well the overall package left me wanting. I cannot really pinpoint what is missing but the game feels a bit bland and unexciting.

The basic rules aren't worth playing at all since they drop everything that makes the game even remotely interesting.

RATING: 7.25
Kontor is a Michael Schacht game from GoldSieber, with typically wonderful GS bits, a largish box for the contents, deceptively simple rules hiding the real game beneath, and not enough general appreciation.

Kontor seems intended as a 2-person area control turf war, and I think it will only improve in ratings as I play more.

The concept is simple, almost abstract: from a cross shaped harbor, build land areas that you control by majority of goods in each area. Larger areas are scored by priority, most areas controlled wins.

Money is only critical if you run out, and as a last tiebreaker- but that hides a good deal of interactive play, just as the rules do.

Players can inflict taxes on other players, possibly preventing them from playing.

In the advanced game players can have the Patrol ship tear down buildings, join or separate areas, increase point values for one or two areas, all confrontational acts making this more like Roma than like a typical 2 player solitaire.

The basic game is very basic, the advanced (real) game sizzles.

Look forward to more plays of this one; I'm already beginning to see why some rate this very highly indeed.

RATING: 4
Rating is for the advanced game with none of the variant cards. In this game, players play tiles to the table in order to build harbor areas. Areas score when they are completely surrounded by water or the map edge. Each harbor tile features one or more commodities and the winner of a harbor scoring is the player with the biggest differential out of the three types of commodities. At the end, the player who has won the most harbor areas wins the game. 

For me, the game just doesn't have the dramatic tension needed for a superior play experience. Each harbor area tends to close and score before the competition really gets heated. The ship adds a bit of "take that" play, but it doesn't really make sense thematically. I will try out some of the variants to see if they substantially change my opinion. I do like that this game continues to be well-supported by the designer and that the game does lend itself well to variants. As published, though, there are better two player majority games than this.

Kontor is more a collection of game variants than a single game. The base game is not much more than an introduction to the system. The most interesting is probably the 2x2 partnership game. The focus of the system is the two-player professional variant wherefore a lot of scenarios are included. Quite complicated and even aggressive for a Schacht game but at the same time the game is as bland as all his designs and not as deep as his best game Web of Power.

Usually I like Michael Schacht's games, but Kontor is a bad game. Well, actually when I play Kontor, I'm wondering where is the game part - that's a bad sign. 

Basic game is boring, when both players just try to keep control on their own harbours. When you play with advanced rules (and the boat comes to play), the game is even worse: sometimes you can hazzle with the boat and get off your opponent harbour, but that's it. The boat just don't make the game better.

Although this game doesn't get much love here on BGG I'm interested in playing this one some more. Good 2-player game.

get past the introductional game, end get to play the advanced rules that come with the game for a tense game. Lots of interesting variants offered in the box as well.

After one play with most of the advanced rules, I see some potential but I wasn't totally enamored right away. Maybe the expansions will help or we'll find a scenario that we both really like. More plays are needed and we both liked it enough to give it a few more chances.

Played with two teams. We played to keep at least tied in every region to maximize our efforts. Seems like focusing on one region too much may be bad. It's usually better to start a new region than fight a losing battle. We only had six total regions on the board (one 1 size didn't get counted) so most scored.

My one and only play of the 2 player version was unconvincing. Simultaneous card play leads to development of a 7x7 plateau, where you're trying to win more and bigger dockyards (through playing dockyard cards and placing them smartly) than your opponent. You're hindered by having to play canal cards (which surround and close off the dockyard cards) to earn the florins to be able to play in future rounds. There wasn't any tension, so I suspect I need to move this into the play-fast category to get enjoyment.

This game has tile laying (which I have a weakness for). However, it kind of came up short - not enough elegant interconnected aspects of the rules and mechanics to hold my interest. Certainly deeper than Carcassone.

RATING: 6
3 plays of the Basic game left me wanting to play it again. It's fast and clever but maybe too dependent on the luck of the draw between experienced players (lowering it to a 6). I sure don't see it as trivial as the better player won smashing victories in 2 of the playings (don't you love having your son make you feel like an idiot). The Advanced game will probably rate a 7. Lots of 'scenarios' should keep this amusing for quite a few replays.

First off, I LOVE the wooden coins in this game, they are so neat.  The card play in this game is interesting and make for some good decisions during the game.  I like the modular and flexible nature of the initial layout that can add variety to the game.  I would like to try this again sometime.

Rating is for the basic game only.  It's easy to see that adding the advanced/optional rules will, as Bob Rossney says, move this from a "blah" game into quite a cool one.  Looking forward to trying again.  It totally expect the rating to go up.

Kontor, you committed the worst offense of all games.  You are boring. You seemed like you could have been fun, streamlined ruleset, some decent options, a level of control, with some nifty ideas for scoring.  But, really at the end of the day, you left me wanting...wanting something else besides you.

I'm sorry, but I just thought you were cooler than your really were.  I mean you have such beautiful coins, and your art is so pretty, but at the end of the day you lack any tension or grit.  I'm not looking for a bad boy, but I just need someone that is going to put out.  

It seemed that we just went through the motions.  I play a card then find out when I can place it.  Sometimes I pay, sometimes I build canals.  I try to get majorities, but don't you see, so many have done this before, and better.  Just because you decide to score it different doesn't mean that in your heart you've changed anything.

I don't think we can be together anymore.

Don't call me.

Decent 2-player area control game that can also be played with 4 players in partnerships (although I've never done so).  The components are really great-looking which definitely adds to the game.  Tracking the scoring of who's ahead in an area can be a little taxing, but there some decent depth here, between trying keep enough money and the battle for various areas around the board.  I particularly like how there's one point for a given area, so it often can be worthwhile to simply cut your losses.

RATING: 6
Basic game only; advanced is probably better. Our one play (2er) took only 14min ... and it just wasn't very interesting. A tile-laying area-control game where you're trying to achieve majorities of commodities (cube types) in areas on the board, which are created by surrounding dock cards with water cards. Some cards force opponent to pay a coin (very cool stamped wood discs), but money wasn't particularly tight in our game (you get money by playing water tiles, or passing). 

The box is about 3 times as big as it needs to be, too! That, plus average game play --> TRADE!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Mediocre tile placing game with area control thrown in. It is easy to feel screwed by the tile draw. Also the economy aspect with having to pay coins sometimes is more annoying than helping to provide interesting decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Only played this in the basic setup with two players. It's a bit bland then, and prone to ending very close. I'm probably missing some potential, so I rate it not too low. But am I ever going to find out the true merits of this game?

RATING: 5
Pretty clever little game that probably turns people off with its weak-as-dishwater basic game.  The advanced version is a game in the vein of Condottiere, Sumo, and Charioteer: trying to predict what your opponent will play, and then attempting to undercut that choice.  Of course with 2P, this dynamic creates a spectacular cycle of guessing and second-guessing.

A huge thanks to eisenphx, who surprised me with this wonderful gift.

RATING: 7
One of the best two-player games around. It has great components (especially for a two-player game) and is quite tactical. More often than not, the endgame is a thriller, especially if you play with the victory condition that only the 5 largest harbour areas bring victory points. Played 10+ times, and it is still never dull. Sessions usually take little more than an hour, which is longer than most German-style two-player games.

Michael Schacht;Kontor is a two-player tile-laying game which can also be played by two teams of two players. The name means 'Trading House' and the players act as merchants vying for supremacy in late 17th century Amsterdam. By building trading houses at the canals you aim to control three major commodities (Spices, Tea and Wine) in each harbor area. During the game you expand by playing Land and Water cards in the large area of the harbor. By the end of the game points are awarded according to ownership of the largest commodity majorities in each harbor area. This game has many optional rules, scenarios, expansions and variations. The game is intended to be played by the advanced rules.

RATING: 5
I would like to play the game with the advanced rules, and some of the variant setups, before rating the game completely, but the basic game leaves a little something to be desired.  The board doesn't feel large enough to maneuver effectively, but the game plays quickly enough as it is.  There are a lot of variant maps and free expansions, though, so they may help draw some more tension out of the game.

Played once, and played the advanced rules with Exportlager expansion.  This rating could go up a little or down a little.  I'd like to try playing with bridge/flood/etc. cards.

Played twice (with two players). The game works quite ok, but there is nothing really exciting. The scoring system is interesting, but some of the other mechanisms (such as the coins) do not bring much to the gameplay. I should read the rules for 4 players, maybe they have something new worth trying, but I doubt I will play it again with 2.

Inside the box we found wooden coins, which were engraved at both sides. Both sides were differently engraved. WOW!, just fantastic. Also the rest of the components were very nice. Read the rules, and after having that done, I raised my eyebrows. Is this it? Was the question I asked myself. But, I can remember some games of which I asked the same question, and they turned out to be very nice. With Kontor this is not the case. It’s just boring, and replayability is almost zero. We bought this second-hand for a real bargain. When we opened the box, we could see that it was only played once. We played it once again, and my guess is that this game will be played twice for as long as it exists.

A strange cards-that-act-as-tiles game for two. Creating sections in which you are leading and then closing them off can be tricky. This is deeper than at first appears, but the simultaneous picking of cards keeps the analysis down a bit and the game moving. The game isn't uproariously fun, though, just interesting, well-designed, and attractive.

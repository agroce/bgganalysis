RATING: 5
Craftsmen just does not quite deliver the fun it promises, at least not as a two player game. It becomes an extremely mechanical exercise of taking the maximum number of actions possible. There are some neat ideas especially with the production chain and how goods are upgraded. However, once you have set up the production chain of your choice, you are just focusing all your efforts in using the "produce" action space on the board. If the game played, say in 45-60minutes, would this be totally fine. But now a two player game takes at least two hours (~50 actions/player/game).

An instant buy after watching the Rahdo run through. I love the tech tree system, invokes the feeling of playing The Settlers, one of my all time favourite video game franchises. Can be a bit fiddly since almost every rule has an exception clause, but a very solid heavy Euro.

So much game for so little money. The game is designed to force players to think multiple steps ahead. The worker placement section of the game is all about finishing last round's plans, continuing others, and starting new endeavours, all while avoiding being blocked from spots you need. Tense and thinky.

However, it has achieved this though complicated rules about your tableau, worker placement, and money but if you can get up the learning curve, you may well be surprised by this one.

A fun production chain building game. It is described as heavy because you need to plan at least 2 turns in advance at all times. A lot of fun, but very unforgiving it one player isn't able to get points off of a ship in the first round.

RATING: 3
Some good ideas here that I think I'd really like if the game had been further developed.  As it is, the game is really slow and plodding, and there are a lot of niggly little rules that seem like they could have been developed out to streamline the whole process.

The main thing I really hated is that you often know what direction you're headed, but it takes an excruciatingly long time to get there, despite there really not being all that much going on to impede your progress.  The play time and the steps needed to achieve your goals just weren't worth the payoff.

Speaking of the payoff, I'm also not convinced that the goal of the game was all that interesting.  You build a chain of buildings in order to form a production chain that culminates with producing some final goods that are worth points.  However, those goods are simply worth some points, plus some more points for an area majority game that you place them into.  No market or market manipulation or timing a market to actually make all the the goods or when you should produce them very interesting.  It was an awful lot of build up and play time to achieve a goal that was ultimately not very satisfying.

I felt like the game is pretending to be heavy under the weight of all of the rules and steps required to produce anything, but the game did not feel at all heavy in terms of the decision making.

Overall, the game has one element that is normally a shoo-in for me loving a game (engine building), but I disliked pretty much everything else about it.  I'd love to see the tech tree production engine developed into a different, awesome, game though!  As is, you'd be hard pressed to get me to play this again though, as the dullness combined with the long play time was just a really bad recipe.

P.S. The rule book is pretty awful, at least the English rules, which is odd considering there's nothing complex going on in the game.  It just fails to explain many things well.

There are a lot of very interesting mechanics in this game. For my preference though and for what you are ultimately doing, the game is too long. If the first half of the first year and the last half of the 3rd year could be streamlined or removed then I would enjoy the game a lot more. I find it starts slow and ends with more of the same.

I do not believe that the current weight (4.1) is a reflection of the game play and strategic choices, but more a reflection on the burden on understanding the rules and sorting out [b]how[/b] to actually play.

First impression: interesting mix of lots of different mechanics in one game, though maybe one or two mechanics less would have made a better game. This is the game HELVETIA (Kosmos, 2011) should have been! I definitively want to play it again, but only with max. 4 players and then only two years (8 rounds). The last year doesn't add much to the game, but drags on and on. A good player aid would also help alot, because almost every player made mistakes here and then.

In Craftsmen, players try to gain appreciation points by building production buildings, creating connections between these buildings, producing raw materials and consumption goods, or buying them outright. They can also gain points by sending produced goods to the farthest parts of the world. In the end, whoever has the most appreciation points wins.

This is a heavy game where you are trying to establish production chains so you can produce goods to ship for points. I really enjoy the money system in the game as well as the place all workers and then resolve all actions nature of the worker placement. My wife and I have played this together two player and have really enjoyed it.

RATING: 7
It takes a little while to figure out the flow of this game, but once you do, it makes sense and works really well. It's all geared toward getting the right resources at the right time and then converting them at the right time to load them onto the ships at the right time. There are also some points for expanding your city evenly and for sending partial products to Storage... but really, it's all about the producing and shipping.)

The biggest issue with the game is that it does take a very long time to play... and I'm not sure there's enough "wow factor" in the game to justify 3+ hours.

If the playtime was shorter (or if the game had more aspects to it than just building resource chains and then shipping them), then I'd be able to give it an '8' or '8.5'. For now, '7'.

An OK worker placement game, with bidding on action mechanics, which keeps the planning exiting. Personly i would have done the board a little different at the "bottom" to remove any confusing. Slow at first, but speeds up really fast when people get to know the mechanics, making it a really nice game to play.

This one is not an easy game. In fact after three plays we still found small rules we didn't play correctly. It is a brutal unforgiven game and you need to plan way ahead.

[b]Rating based on - 2 plays, 2 player[/b]
This is a heavy economic worker placement game where you build production buildings to turn raw materials into finished goods. For example, you would turn lumber that you generated in your lumber mill into a barrel and combine the barrel with some grapes and wax and you have yourself a cask of wine! First off, incredible amount of game in a Carcassonne sized box, great components and brilliant artwork, game plays smoothly once you wrap your head around the rulebook, interesting if not somewhat counter intuitive gameplay in some bits where you build buildings [b]then[/b] buy plans for more buildings etc. (whereas normally you would buy then build), there's a lot to do and think about which makes for a really crunchy puzzle – production efficiency, colour matching buildings, saving money to buy victory points etc., board is icon heavy and the icons are actually really clever so no need for constantly checking what things mean. However, it is way too long for us (2-4 hours depending on the number and speed of players), the market seems like it would have the potential to stagnate in a 2 player game and you need to be somewhat lucky with the cards that are available – I used a privilege to get access to 5 cards looking for wax and it was nowhere to be found and we had lots of slate that nobody wanted to use and while you did have the option to change up the cards in the market neither of us wanted to do it to grant our opponent a potentially better card that would be useful to them, turn order swaps regularly in the 2 player game so you each have the same number of chances at first player however I was always first player in Spring and Autumn and my opponent was always first player in Summer and Winter – haven't played enough to tell if that has any significant game impact or not though, rulebook has several omissions/translation errors/clarity dead spots etc. I did check the forums before we played and most of my questions were answered but I still had a few niggling doubts I need to get clarified. Turns out we definitely made the game harder for ourselves in a few spots.

Despite the convoluted rules, the game is essentially 'get an effective engine going, rinse and repeat until the end of the game'. The end game is pretty predictable as all you are interested in is production and then the person in the lead will stay in the lead from what we've seen. There is just no catch up mechanism so if you've chosen the wrong thing to produce or you couldn't get appropriate buildings, then you just deal with what you get and that's your game. It also tends to feel repetitive. If you have an effective engine that's cranking out bread or wine or meat and its various by-products, there is no point or incentive to further diversify so you just do the same things all the time near the end otherwise your competition will catch up with you. I think the game could be done in 2 years instead of 3. It's fun to build your engine and see it produce, but the 3rd year is kind of pointless as you can't catch up anyways...

More complex than necessary.  Lots of rules.  Lots of steps to get things done.  Buy a building (with the right color money).  Build a building (matching colors to adjacent buildings).  Do that for (at least) 3 different buildings.  Produce a raw good, use raw good to make intermediate good.  Use multiple raw/intermediate goods to make final good (to finally earn the big points in the game).  There's area majority, but you don't have much choice in where you are placing for area majority - each good goes into one of two ships, and what you are producing is partially determined by your initial building draw.  Getting new buildings is the slow process described above.  And the new building selections is limited to what's available on the board.  One coming up randomly could help you immensely and if one is bought out from under you (even inadvertently) it can have a huge impact.  Privileges can make each of these steps easier, but not everyone gets them every round.  Extremely money tight at the beginning, so first actions are money-money-money-money.  Race to produce at the end: produce-produce-produce-produce.  That makes  a lot of the action selection kind of automatic.  Overall, a long game that feels very slow and more chaotic that you'd expect for this type of game.

The game says it's complicated, but I wouldn't go that far, even though it's not easy to grasp everything at start.

In the end we have a solid workerplacement game, where players have to build production chains to get points. Nothing new at all and there are more than enough similar games out there, but however, if you don't have many of this kind, you may have a look at this one.

I'm kind of amused that I seemed to be the only one who liked this. It's a heavy resource-conversion game with a (Caylus-style) worker placement element and a tech tree.  I love this kind of resource conversion, and the lack of any kind of spatial element makes it easier for me than something like Neuland.  There's a lot of planning, and it's exactly the kind of planning I enjoy. 
The game is a little too long; it might be better to have a half-round at the end. But I enjoyed it a lot. (1 play)

I was hesitant to play this game having never heard of it before, but was convinced by another Meetup'er to give it a try. After learning the basics I became uninvested in the outcome due to learning thta the strength of your strategy was dictated by random card draws, but I went through the motions to be polite.

Unintuitive interface design. I was confused the entire game about what costed what and when. multiple times I chose the wrong action space thinking it was something else. Just like Race for the galaxy, your strategy is dictated by random card draws, and your ability to memorize unintuitive symbols. Mechanically, the game was fine, just not for me. The illustrations were good, but the graphic interface was terrible.

I like the idea of a tech tree game, and this one does a lot of things well, but it is slow to the point where I would not play it 4/5 player despite the warehouse needing 4/5 players in order to be worthwhile putting your cubes there. 

While the warehouse needs more players to function, more players means it's more likely that your goods will get bumped from the ships.

The randomness of the colour of the cards can be easily combated by just making sure you always stay near the hand limit of money cards, so that isn't a problem.

The rest of the game is good, and I would have rated it a 6 if it hadn't been for the abilty to bump other player's goods from ships.

Worker placement game that isn't long because of AP problems, but simply because some steps just take so long to go through. Which of course creates quite some downtime. Playing takes some hours and feels quite rewarding. The production chain and market mechanisms are neat and overall the game seems to flow pretty smoothly. I also like the stacking mechanism. The English rulebook could have used stronger editing while the German one is more precise and leaves less room for interpretation. Wonder how the Polish one stands in comparison.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I don't mind long games, but this one felt old after a couple hour of largely doing the same thing. One places five markers on different guilds to largely build and run production chains for point. Production chain games have never been among my favorite types of games, particularly if they last a while since if one falls behind, one stays behind. I feel like this one tries to do too much to create a challenge and the added complexity and chaos doesn't make the game better (production chain must usually match a color, drawing cards may result in a card of little interest for your engine, etc). Probably works best with two players. My three player game  lasted 3.5 hours.

I was afraid of the complexity complaints that I had read before going into this game. Not to worry, this is nothing like Madeira. It's a bit fiddly but I wouldn't say it's too complex.

However, it was very long (3 hours) and didn't do anything particularly different. Maybe the action selection was the most interesting mechanism.

We played it with 3 players and it felt too loose (no reason to diversify), but I dread the play time with 5.

This is a very cleaver HEAVY game with a pretty bad rule book...

The way the order the guilds are activated in the game is very fresh and different because in games, you usually are able to buy a building and then build it in the same turn, or buy some resources to make production, etc... in this one these actions are "reversed", so first you build then you Buy Buildings (of course you already start with some in your hand)...
First you make your production, you can always produce your Raw Materials and after you can buy products you need that you don't produce...

A very interesting twist on the normal worker placement and resolve actions...

The way the money works is also pretty cool, there are 4 different currencies in the game (4 different colors) and in some guilds you have to pay for the buildings with money from the color of the building... if you don't have enough of the color you need for the building you want you can always risk put that building up for Auction, and in that case you can pay with any kind of money...

It's also interesting that the value of the money cards varies from 1 to 3 but if you have 2 money cards of the same color, if you want, they are worth 5 Money of that color, so you can have 2 blue cards of value 1 and they are worth 5 blue money... if you have 3 cards of the same color it's 10... 4 it's 15 and so on...

We've made some mistakes in our game, being the first for everyone... I mistakenly swapped the wrong building at the start of the game... but the main "bad move" we made was building too much... we tried to make many complete Production Chains and that's probably not the most efficient way to play the game...

We had many buildings and not enough Work Points so, many of those remain unused many turns... instead we could have gone earlier for the Final Product and use the Half and Raw Products that we didn't produce from the Storehouse and then try to get the buildings that produce those Products we needed to complete the chain...
We did it the other way around and I think it's more difficult to do it that way, specially if you try to make 2 different Production Chains at the same time 

I really liked the game but the rule book makes the game a disservice and I have 2 more "complains" about the game:

1- I think in a 3 player game the board feels too open... 
I think that every Guild should only have 2 spots for placement and then you can place on top of the other players...
The way it is with 3 spots available in the bottom row, it's too open and you generally see players delaying their choice in placement in a specific guild so they can be the 4th to place there to be able to get the privilege...

If you make it more tight in the bottom row, people would start to place early because there are only 2 free spaces and if they place early they can also earn more money from the late comers...
as is only the 1st player to place in every guild will get money from the other players, and that player already has the privilege action and be the first to do it...

2- The game is too long... I don't mind long games, but the game, despite being good overstays it's welcome... 
The game took 4 hours, granted it was our first game, so I can see it take a little less, maybe 3 to 3h30 hours but it's still a bit to long...
And I think the game would probably be better with 4 players but that would add at least another hour to the game... so no good!

Overwhelmingly complex production chains but the game manages to run smoothly regardless. Does not induce much AP but the total playing time is very long anyway; The game could have used a bit more streamlining and cleanup to shorten the length and to remove some needlessly cumbersome rule details. 

Carelessly written and structured rulebook, and the English and German rulebooks contradict each other.

Were this a big box game, I'd probably not bother with this at all but since this in Carcassonne size and the Essen price was only 22.50 EUR, I'd say this is pretty good value for money and box size after all.

Craftsmen is a long resource-crunching worker placement game.  The game literally features a tech tree of various stages of goods that can be built.  The phase order of the game is a little non-intuitive--you play building cards from your hand before you have a chance to play new ones, so you want to make sure you have the cards when you need them.  I enjoyed the basic premise of the game, and even liked puzzling out the phase order planning, but the part of the game that fell flat was the building cards.  You could never really plan on getting what you wanted, which made building a long-term plan really difficult.  Also, the game was a little long--I don't mind length but this got a somewhat repetitive after a while.

The biggest issue I have with this game is the rules. The rulebook is mostly clear, although it's a bit muddy in a few spots. Moreso the issue that I have is that the designer is constantly contradicting himself in the forums. Yes, I understand English is not his primary language, but his answers often conflict the rules or he provides rules that were not included in the rulebook. I'm trying to get a concise sheet of rules typed up, but it's been difficult since I have to filter through the forums to find what the actual way to play the game is.

The game looks great, although potentially very long and occasionally mean. I just wish they had an updated and revised rulebook instead of an ever so slightly clearer one. The wording of the different phases and "raising buildings" could be changed for clarity. 

Edit: While this game is fiddly, after typing up a condensed rule sheet, playing this game again after a couple weeks was easier than I was expecting. I really only missed a couple rules on my condensed sheet and it played a lot smoother this time. I'd love to play it with 3 or 4 players as I think the fight over building chains might be more interesting. Same goes for the storehouse (granary). I like this game quite a bit, but I can see why it got mediocre ratings.

I was initially worried after the first round of gameplay that it would feel samey, but on rounds 2 and 3 you have multiple buildings out and can actually start your production chain. A smaller focus on money and more about trying to squeeze as many work points out of production as possible. Filling the storehouse and maybe setting up your final goods for last.

Not sure I agree with how turn order works in a 2 player game, but I'm not really sure an easy fix. Maybe whoever is last in points chooses turn order each new round?

It works, it's not annoying, but takes far too long for what it is. 

I think it would be a far better rule that if you can look at the top 3 buildings of a deck, you would have the choice to put the 2 unchosen buildings on top or at the bottom of the deck. Now it's pure luck when looking for a certain type of building to claim a bonus.

And why not provide every player an overview of what you need to claim the bonus tiles, or put extra markers in, just like in Helvetia were this concept was first used ;-)

This is an interesting production chain game, where players purchase cards that make A so they can purchase cards that make B with the eventual goal of making C, which then gets sent to boat areas that do majority scoring each round. In addition to majority scoring, the different goods are also worth different amounts of points inherently depending on how difficult they were to produce. The rulebook for this game was brutally poor, but there is a solid game here. The only issue for me is that I have a number of other goods conversion games that I would prefer to this game, so this isn't going to be a keeper for me, although I see why people like it.

didn't enjoy "putting cart before horse" approach to goods production structure, and a bit too long as well

Very fun and beautiful eurogame. What makes this game interesting is the production chains you have to set up, the way you combine your actions, the money system... and altogether a very tight and balanced eurogame. One of the nice surprises of Essen 2013.

Awesome game. Age 10 is too young, 12 is barely to do, my recommodation; 14. Game is hard to oversee (production lines). Horrible written rulebook. Minor downpoint; It is a very long game.

After 2 plays I don't know how to rate this game. I love it and I hate it -_- But I don't know if I want to play it again. The reversed action order is really pain in the *** ;P - sadistic design!

With the autograph of the designer. After one full 2 - players game. This game is one of the heaviest game i'd play ever. To win, you need to think 3-4 movements ahead. 
For 2-players shipping final resources on a shipboards seems to strong "heading to win" strategy. All the game is pretty solid. I totally recomend this game.

Too long (4 hours for 4 players). And not enough for meaningfull decisionmaking. It's obvious what you have to do. Especially to the end of the game you just want to produce as much as possible because that will earn you points. 

I do not want to play this game ever again.

I like the structure of the crafting, but it all gets muddled by the overly complicated rules.  It needed to be more streamlined. Having the buildings color coded and money required color coded also is a bit too much. Artwork looks great. Play length was too long in my opinion. There is fun to be had, but not without some frustration.

This game is a heavy euro about building an optimization engine.  The game tries to blend as many different mechanics and rules nuances into it as possible.  There is worker placement for action selection, bonus spots, and fees for using spots after opponents.  There are 3 different colors of currency and bonuses for set matching.  Complicated drawing mechanics for money and building cards and color matching returns for building rules.  Finally, the different materials that you produce in these buildings flow from one another and to different spots on the board in kind of a herky-jerky way.

I'm sure you can tell from my terminology that I'm not in love with this game, and I'm not, but it's not bad either.  While the mechanics are convoluted and complex, none of them feel unnecessarily convoluted.  I think the designers just really wanted to do "a lot of stuff".  It works for the most part which points to good design.  The game could use some kind of catch up mechanic as I feel there might be a bit of a runaway leader problem and I don't think the game is meant for two players, I'm not fond of the rules changes for that player count.

In the end the biggest criticism I could make against the game is something hard to describe. it just felt lifeless.  There's a lot to do and think about but it never grabbed me and towards the end I was bored with playing it.  You never want that when playing a game.

RATING: N/A
Very abstract game with players placing workers and get to build and produce stuff in order to score VP's during 3 years, each with 4 rounds. 

It's long and challenging although a bit underdeveloped in my opinion. Graphics don't help much and that's really a problem as the game is too much complex and abstract to not having helping graphics playing for it but it's playable, of course.

Although I played it once only, so far, it seemed balanced and strategic enough to get played more often. The timing to place workers is really more important than in a 'regular' worker placement game as some positions offer more than others within the same action.

It brings some interaction and balanced opportunities to every player. My main complaint has to do with the rules which are far more complex than they should be. But hey! that's the price you get to pay when you want to design a complex game. Sometimes it just isn't 'rounded' enough and the angles hurt a bit too much.

tl;dr: would be great if it took 90 minutes

When I read the rules for this one, it surely sounded like a not very original but solid game. And that's exactly what it is.
It's a worker placement resource generation game with some nice combinations of familiar mechanisms that, when combined, do something fresh and interesting. This results in some interesting decision points each round, which is good. What is not so good is that this game should take 90 minutes and it takes at least 60 more minutes with 3 fast players.
If only this game was developed further so it wouldn't stay out it's welcome, because it has some good stuff in there. Too bad.
At least it wasn't as boring as [thing=159507][/thing] from the same designer.

I can't figure out if some of the mechanisms are complicated for the sake of being complicated.  Want to improve the local economy?  Here's a hint - monetary reform!

First year was spent figuring out what you are doing and third year was just producing.

Still, I would play it again.

Kind of cool but way too long.  Very clunky.  I didn't like this.  It's hard, but ultimately unrewarding.  A lot of the spaces, especially the ships, seem trivial.  The worker point thing for moving goods around is just.... what?  Unnecessary.  Play some other worker placement.  The tension in Craftsmen comes from not being able to see what is going on.  Seems trivial.  Your mileage may vary.  

I'll say it again.  Play Caylus.

A bit too Euroy.  The production chains could be more interesting.  And the other mechanics were in need of streamlining.

pure euro buy/produce/sell, very confusing, convoluted and boring game.

[+] 
[-] bland artwork & theme, the actions seem to be in the wrong order (you must buy cards before building them, but the build action is done before the buy action, so you "lose" a round; same thing with the production/market), need 4 turns (out of 12), almost an hour!, to start producing something... some convoluted rules that just add constraints and no real excitement (color of buildings that must match, color of money...)

played in Essen 14

A brain-burning game about production line. I just love how the card play really works and it's amazing to see what complex the game is realizing this is just a card game disguises as a board game.

Do not be fooled by the size of the box.  This will burn your brain.  The 2-3 hour playtime is accurate even for two players.  First time through with 4 or 5 could run into an epic session.  Worth the effort if you like efficiency euros, which is what this is.

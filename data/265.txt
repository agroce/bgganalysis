Okay, this is a real "love-hate" kind of game for me. It's brutal, in a single word. An uncomfortable, mean-spirited, conniving experience. But saying that, this title really provides pretty much the same kind of experience in under an hour that Diplomacy does in a day (or month if playing online).

A good diplomacy and negotiation game.  I'm not a huge fan of this game type, though.  I generally prefer games where you have a stronger say over whether you win or lose.  In this one, it's entirely up to others and, while you can try to bribe them, there's absolutely no guarantee of success.  Very much screw-your-neighbor.  If you like that sort of thing, chances are you'll enjoy this one quite a bit.  It's just not for me.

First off, don't believe the hype: this game isn't the most vicious and nasty game ever....that game is called Diplomacy. Seeing as how it is immediately clear that Intrigue is all about backstabbing, one would have to be insane not to expect....well, backstabbing! And that it does very well. This, of course, results in a very psychological game which feels like a party game. But a fair bit of strategic thought is required, which hugely reduces it's value as a party game. But the fact that you're playing mind games with your opponents, and that it is utterly impossible to guarantee that any opponent is actually going to keep his word certainly reduces the value of your strategic thought, thus reducing the value of Intrigue as a strategic game. 
In other words, Intrigue doesn't have the foggiest idea what kind of game it wants to be! Plus, apart from the manor house cards, the components are pretty lame, and the theme is quite hidden in a Euroish mist......

Pros
- Creates hate and resentment
- Shorter version of Diplomacy

Cons
- Abstract to teach at first
- It can get math-y
- Dry theme and almost non-existent 
- You need five players

Sold/Traded because:
- Hard for me to teach well
- You need EXACTLY 5 players which is annoying

RATING: 5.5
It's a fun game, but I've noticed that the end scoring follows a pretty hard reverse turn-order ranking by default. Maybe if you play the game multiple times with the same players, and everyone takes note of this fact, it won't happen. But, minus that and the arc and outcome of the game is going to be pretty scripted.

The problem is that the first slots to be filled are, generally, going to be the highest value slots. The first person to contend for those slots will be the first player, and so he'll grab most of them; the second player might snag a couple more; the third player might grab a few send and third tier slots; and so on. The top tier slots that the second player gets will most likely be with the first player, since those are the ones which were uncontested on the first round (in a four player game). So the first player starts his second round with a strong income and holds the second player hostage. The second player starts with a less good economy and holds the third player hostage, etc.

This relationship maintains a steady economy for a couple of rounds, until pieces start to go empty. At this point, the further you were in the lead - which is in turn order - the more you are locked out of the map. Pretty quickly, it goes from a spread of ownership between the players, to all players except the last player, owning nothing. The last player can get ~2 rounds worth of money for almost the entire map.

So...while it feels like, while you are playing, that it's a negotiation game. The choices that people make have more to do with the realities of the situation before them, and that trumps anything you might say. The end result comes down to the math of the game, and that math is slightly off-kilter. It feels a bit disatisfying to play a game like this, where you're really engaging with every other player to the max and doing your best, just to see, regularly, the same tiered end-result every game and realize that you could have played the game silently and had the same score.

A modified turn order strategy could bring the game back to being a negotiation game. But I'm a bit disappointed by that this isn't already in the game.

I was surprised at the depth of this little game. There is quite a bit to think about and some clever deals to be made. I’ve found I prefer to use these rules.

1. All players are eligible to make deals and barter until the person who is assigning the positions calls in the bribes. Then bartering and deals go in turn order,(unless it’s an internal conflict then the defending player goes first) only with the players involved with the assigning and all the other players must remain silent. A $50,000 fine for anyone who speaks out of turn in this phase.

2. Hidden money

Interesting negotiation game. Easy to pick up and play without a ton of explanation. 

I think the one thing this game suffers from though is a lack of a strong theme. While I really enjoyed my first playthrough, not having a theme to chomp on would probably make the game suffer over multiple plays.

But that's just me - I like a strong theme.

As far as gameplay goes, I do like to feel I'm bargaining for something a little more than points, but still a rather fun game.

There is nothing to keep someone from hiring others at the highest paying jobs just because they simply feel like it.

A great little game (literally, a full 1-2 hour game in a very small box) for those who love negotiation and backstabbing. 

Keep away those who have delicate egos or are quick to inflame. After 1 play I can see why this one has its well-deserved reputation, alongside Diplomacy, as a friendship-breaker. The rules allow, positively encourage double-crossing, backstabbing, taking back your word and using a strong negotiating position to extract every ounce of flesh. Not for the faint hearted, the unforgiving or for groups who take ages to negotiate.

The negotiation game of choice in my mind.  It captures the important elements of Diplomacy in a short 30 minute package.  Don't take the game too seriously; the winner is not always the best player.  However, more than you might think is going on here with player psychology and tracking the profitable professions.  An almost Modern Art-esque vibe.

Feb 2011:  Rating dropped to a 6.  I'm starting to see a trend of whoever is in last place at mid-point winning, because everyone gangs up on the leader.

The design is pure genius much like Diplomacy. And I can play this game and do well at it because, well, I'm a nice guy and pretty good at being persuasive when I want to.

Warning! If you don't like backstabbing games like Diplomacy, run away! This game is purposely designed to reward players who can balance trust and betrayal.

Who knew so much fun and tension could come in such a small box? Intrigue delivers a top-notch negotiation game with an almost trivial rule set. The key here I think is that there are no rules that enforce agreements made between players. Currently an 8 based on one 4 player game but I can easily see this becoming a 9.

UPDATE: Moving up to a 9. Now that my understanding of the game has improved this is possibly my favorite game to play with gamers.

Wow, this game is MEAN. But it's also an absolute blast! If you've got a group that isn't going to get all bent out of shape over all the backstabbing, this is a great time. The rules are simple and smooth, and the constant nasty interaction really makes this game stand out. The game really moves at a good pace and there's never a dull moment. After my first game I immediately wanted to play again. This is a definite must-have for me.

The game of rampant nepotism (also known as 'Welcome to Nova Scotia'). Nice artwork. The fun in this game is very dependent on the creativity of the players. Best played with good friends who know what to expect and can enter into the spirit of the game. Five is the ideal number for this game. With four, players tend to split into pairs. Not a game for kids or non-gamers. A modern African or Nova Scotian retheme would work well!

Liked it well enough after the first play. The box says 45 minutes. With five first timers feeling their way around the negotiations, we dragged for 2 hours. If this can really play in 45 minutes, it could climb to an 8 or even a 9. At 2 hours it is a solid 6.

Updated: Indeed, it goes to a seven on the second play. Clocked at 1:15, that was a good length. Started to see more of the negotiation tactics and, lo, even longer term strategy.

RATING: 7
Reputed to be the most evil of all games; the great destroyer of humanity and all that is good in life.  How could I not own a copy? Oh, and yes, the game in fact is quite that evil, nasty and conniving.  Well worth the money and time.  Remember to push relatives to your left in the early game, right in the late game, and manage what relatives in what trades you have available compared to the other player assignments for the late game.  

Frankly, the biggest problem in this game is ensuring that you don't peak too soon.   That's an almost unbeatable burden.

I like pure negotiation games, and Intrigue is Diplomacy without the time commitment, Genoa without the faffing about on a board, or Article 27 without the rudimentary acknowledgement of the idea of fairness.

You don't have to be a sociopath to play this game, but it helps. The fact that the game is so lightly themed only throws the cruelty of the experience into sharper relief -- play it, by all means, but play it with people who aren't going to bear a grudge.

I'll need more plays before I can articulate my thinking on this game.  There's a rather curious positional game beneath all the trigger happy backstabbing that tends to erupt.  I'd imagine that it will take 4 or 5 games with some keen minds (and open money) to unravel it and see if the game is worth further exploration.  

Update:

This game is unstoppable, but you need a group that is willing to really think about the game.

The basic idea is great, the execution is flawed. The main problem is the flow of the game. Just as the game becomes interesting and alliances are about to shift, it ends. The other flaw is the low production values. The theme is totally tacked on and the components are cheap. So much so that assembling your own (and improved version) is trivial and, frankly, preferable. I might play this again, but not if I can play something else...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A neat backstabbing negotiation game, where the backstabbing is mandatory due to the nature of the bribing.  The best of this type of game because of its relatively short play time and required backstabbing, it tends to be more light hearted than longer games or games requiring more targeted mayhem.  

In the end, I like the big bad sandbox of Lifeboats for my negotiation games.  Traded away.

RATING: 7
Admittedly, it's not much of a "game" mechanically but as a instigator of social discord and relationship collapse, Intrige is great fun.  The rules are loose and you are entirely at the mercy of other players' whims, so the only real rule is the law of the jungle.  Forget all these "low player interaction" games and go right for the psyche.  Completely immoral, minimalist, and sure to start arguments.  Due to the amount of foul language that this game generates, don't play with gamers with tender ears- send 'em to the Transamerica table!

RATING: 8
Fun game of traitorous negotiation and underhanded backstabbery that should be played with the maximum of 5 players.  Devilishly enjoyable.  I found it to be missing a little something more, which is why I probably prefer Chinatown.  For the shorter length though, this game really delivers.  Much fun!

Components: Nice artwork and quality tiles, but the paper money, like most paper money, is cumbersome; and the island is superfluous.

Experience: I'm not a fan of deception or back-stabbing, so I'm unable to play this game as it was meant to be played, but I did enjoy the strategic placement of courtesans, and deciding how high or low to set my bribe.

Intrigue is a pure negotiation game. There are a few rules, but mostly you will be arguing, threatening, sweet-talking, wheeling and dealing and most of all, betraying your friends. Sounds like a fun time? If so, Intrigue definitely is the game for you. The rules are easy enough that it can be played with non-gamers, although it is a good idea to make it very clear what the game is like before starting.

Saying this game is about negotiation is a kind of speech, because regardless what the players negotiate between themselves, everybody just do what it pleases with no penalties whatsoever...that is, unless other players later seek revenge for a broken deal (just to nail the other part, with no benefit whatsoever), beneficiating a 3rd or 4rd player...

I admit some people can get a kick out of this but sure is not my case.

RATING: 5
Players send their "workers" out to the palaces of opponents, seeking employment.  There are four different workers, and four different rooms in each palace to house a worker.  Each room pays a different salary per turn between 1000 and 10000 crowns.  In order to get into a room, players negotiate with the palace owner for a spot in their palace - cash (must) changes hands, and then the owner can do whatever they like (i.e. major shafting).  The loser of a battle for a palace spot is banished from the game.  Nasty negotiation game, but I must admit I really enjoyed it.  Very simple to explain and play, feelings will be hurt.

[Dorra] Considering my aversion to 'military diplomacy games' like Diplomacy and Game of Thrones, I didn't expect to like this one. But indeed I really do like it.

Excellent luckless negotiation game where you bicker of money and positioning but not turf or troops. Give it a chance!

First, it's important to note that these kinds of games aren't my cup of tea.   Table talk, random posturing, arbitrary backstabbing, futile negotiation...   just not my thing.   But I knew that going into the game.   The game is 25 rounds, with 8 character placements each.   I think if it were shorter, say 20 rounds with only 6 characters, then it might be better.   I found it just too long and too repetitive, with no real strategic choices to make.   The box says 45 minutes, but that is only possible if people aren't negotiating.   I think there are better negotiation games, such as Chinatown, that have more strategy married with the negotiation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very neat, quick negotiation game. All it takes to play is the ability to make offers and do some very basic mental calculations. But the deals you make and the kinds of offers you can consider make it a fun, cutthroat way to spend 45 minutes - but only with 5 players. It's just not as good with less, and that's really the only thing keeping the rating down. Really, it's at least a 9 with 5, but at most an 8 with 4. Haven't ever played with 3, but I don't imagine it would be very engaging.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) For a game with absolutely no luck apart from the human element, this seemed a bit too random for me, strangely enough.

An interesting exercise in the capriciousness of the human spirit, but not a particularly engaging game.

RATING: 7
Take all of the seething frustration and rage that Diplomacy engenders and put it in a 45-minute box, shake the contents and watch the blood flow. Intrigue is the meanest, nastiest game I own and should never be played with people whose feelings are easily hurt. There isn't much of a game here; make agreements with other players to do specific actions and watch them gleefully backstab you. Every time. You have to lie through your teeth to accomplish anything by the end of the game, and you're likely to have your friends ready to kill you (and each other). 

I think there's a potential problem with teams here, especially with even numbers of players. But as in Diplomacy, any alliances tend to be short-lived by necessity. 

This is not a game I'd ever play with my mother. It's a very specific kind of "fun," and I can understand why people would hate it. I have to be in the right mood to play, but when I do it's always simultaneously fun and frustrating. Beware.

* Played 5+ times. Don't take the game personally. Great fun, but you have to just take backstabbing as a matter of course. The game is great because of the amount of pleading that goes on. I don't care that much whether I win or lose, because I have so much fun trying to manipulate the conversations and perceptions of the other players, and observing the same dealings of others! Think a more "public" Diplomacy that can be played in 30 minutes; or think of Bohnanza with more of an edge. The new card game version from Amigo is even better because it is much cheaper and easier to find, and has 8 workers instead of 10, shortening the game by one round, and making it fit a better niche in a game collection. Recommended.

[Negotiation] [4P:7, 5P:7] [Thanks Wilson and Shih Huei!] Backstab-fest in the tradition of Diplomacy, but purer and much, much faster. Your friendships had better be able to withstand this sort of game. Me, it's not really my thing, but if I had to play that kind of game this would be the first choice (haven't tried the Lifeboat Game yet). *** UPDATE: Better than I initially thought, but requires a the right group. Expect a lot of yelling and simmering and boiling if the game is played right. When teaching the game, remind everyone to have short memories, and that when the game is over to forget the whole thing. Otherwise, I doubt that this game will ever see the table again. With Intrige, there is no need to ever drag Diplomacy's tired old carcass out of the closet ever again. *** UPDATE: Mayfair's doing an English edition of Intrige in early 2006. The components are likely to be crappy (especially if it's going to be the AMIGO card game version they're basing the game off of and not the FX Schmidt boardgame) but I'll take it. The game doesn't use its components heavily anyway, except for the cash, and that's easy to solve.

This is the only game that causes more anger than "Quo Vadis?" in our group.  But the anger is short-lived, because the name of the game is screwing other people over.  You make nice for a while and then get nasty.  It takes some clever manuevering to make it to the end with the most cash.  This game is as much about charisma as it is strategy.  I like it a lot.  I wish the bits were a little nicer.  The character tiles are great, but the money is VERY flimsy, and there is no reason I can think of to make your mansion out of 4 playing card-style pieces.  I might make up some small gameboard-type boards for the game.

I own the Mayfair 8 scholars per player version (the box is quite small and not great to store components).

Played the game 3 times and had fun. It can get nasty but not as much as I had anticipated. My biggest problem was keeping track of how much money the different players around the table had and if you can't do that, you'll have a hard time winning the game.

Still, if you do not take betrayal too much to heart, you will laugh when playing it, I will play it again for sure as I feel I didn't quite master it yet!

It should be played tongue-in-cheek. All the backstabbing is in fun. Otherwise, it can split households! Never play with your wife! However, with a bunch of your best friends it is a blast, when no one takes it seriously.

Seriously, why is every game from Amigo a game about screwing over other people?

This one is a no randomness game where you bribe players to try to get jobs for your people, who then earn you money.  No promise has to be kept.

I think this is the best negotiation game I've played. From negotiation theory standpoint, the key to the game is creating incentives for cooperation in a system that provides no assurances of any continued cooperation. This shifts towards the end game as all players know that the game ends at a certain point, so as the game progresses any cooperative relationships become more tenuous and less profitable to maintain. Simple and Brilliant, and now I'm going to raise it up to an 8.

This game continues to impress me. 8.5!

Most unfairly rated game in the geek. Really, it's a game, not a friend-assasination kit.

This is a game about trust. You want people to trust you so they give you money but to gain their trust you have to give them money. And, of course, you don't want to give them money so you are going to screw them over. But if you screw them over they won't trust you and you will lose.

Very, very evil and a lot of fun. Probably the purest negotiation game I know of.

This game should rate higher but it is too vicious for me.  It's more vicious than Diplomacy by far because you can't even outguess your opponents' moves and counteract them by that method. No it doesn't give a Diplomacy feel, but it is a game of pure negotiation and threats.  Mechanically it works well, but the clockwise turn movement gives advantages when bribing (because of seating position of certain types of players) and number of rounds of income.

In concept, I like this game. Intrigue has such simple rules that it's hard not to understand how to play. 

This could be described as Diplomacy Light. There are no random elements in the game. There are twice as many bodies as there are jobs so somebady has to take a fall. The rules to who falls? nothiong but negotiation.

In play, though, this game can really wear away tempers and nerves, which lowers this game's rating for me.

Do play with the right people, if you play aggressive, you may hurt some feelings. I KNOW that it is just a game, but I also know that the human mind is ill suited to accept to be frustrated without any form of payback. If you're good at this game you will generate some amount of frustration into the other players, so be prepared to have this game, or you, frown upon.

It delivers what it promises, and it is truly a "raw template" of negotiation psychology and "back stabbing". A bit too vicious for my taste, but I'm glad to have it in my collection and I am willing to take it out once in a while if the right crowd and the right mood.

This game lives and breathes based on several things:

(1) Negotiating strength and ability;
(2) Evolving game theory;
(3) The ability to persuade other players to act based on fiat promises (since the only currency in the game are promises and commitments).

It is a meta-game and it is a very very good one.

Alterations/House rules: poker chips in the open. If there is a tie-breaker it wouldn't matter to us and we wouldn't look for it (as it isn't the game's focus).

Touchstones: Filling the slots in the palaces is key, negotiations should avoid set-in-stone agreements; Reserving slots for some; Pushing slots at times; Turn order is important; Removing competition through squeezes in vacancies; Allowing others to waste chits on overly ambitious placements; One needs to make opportunities for others and even protect them for the right individuals.

Incredible range of experience generated by this game. One set of players sensed it was too cutthroat and bailed. Another absolutely relished the intense nature of the game. Another adapated a semi polite set of exchange norms introduced by a single player until it all came crashing down in the final round. Looking forward to seeing how more groups play. It's a game that taps into intuitions about justice which is why i think it's an intense and recommended experience.

This is the lowest I have ever rated a game that was this much fun.  There isn't much game here.  The game itself is unpredictable, the decisions have little meat, and the endgame is really anticlimactic.  However, its an absolute blast if you have a fun crowd.  The game is based on paying each other to get your people jobs in the other player's camp.  Each player vying for a job gets a chance to bribe, then the owner of the job makes a decision.  Comedy ensues.  Bidding wars over good jobs lead to hilarious results as Player A bids 25,000 for a job, and Player B bids nothing.  The job's owner decides to give it to Player B and kicks A to the curb, keeping his 25,000.  The random screwage, diplomacy-esque negotiations, and overall fun of this game is off the charts.  Its also very quick.  But, like I said, the game underlying all the negotiations is nothing but a simple bidding game that suffers from being anticlimactic and random.

[Initial Impression: 6]
This game evokes vehement feelings - some games you just don't enjoy, but this one makes some players so miserable that they will swear it off forever after a single play. It's a pure negotiation game, and everyone is involved in almost every turn, but that's because it forces a high degree of confrontation nearly every turn. I could see it being truly awesome with the right group - being a group willing to rationally examine the consequences of each deal and how that will impact other's choices about their own positions. Too bad you're unlikely to play with a group consisting solely of Vulcans. It is necessary to keep the "heat" level down, as it is easy to get very emotional during gameplay - maybe that's part of the point, but it slows the game down and makes some people impossible to negotiate with, and if negotiation breaks down, the game breaks down since it is the sole mechanic. People trying to be too nice (but you can only be nice to some of the people some of the time, so it backfires) or too vindictive will sour the game completely. Metagaming also seems likely to be rampant ("so and so is generally trustworthy"). The game practically forces you to promise, threaten, lie, and badger for your own benefit - just do so and don't fret when others do the same. The game invites "alliances" between sets of two players (I'll put you in my 10-space if you put me in your 10-space). With an odd number of players, the odd one out finds it very hard to break such alliances.  Even if they pay up to do so, the other players then have an incentive to immediately screw them over.  With an even number of players, it could just become a stalemate of alliances. An early leader will likely get so beat up that they have no chance of winning, so come-from-behind victories are highly probable. Possibly brilliant in theory, but in practice there seems more to hate than to enjoy here.

RATING: 6
This game was introduced to me as THE asshole game, a bit like diplomacy where sooner or later you have to betray in order to win.
It's actually not that bad, because where in diplomacy everyone can clearly see wether you're winning or not, in Intrigue money (VPs) are hidden. So there is this cloud of uncertainty, wether they should support you or the other guy.
And you can only allow yourself to screw people over completely in the last turns, because otherwise they will never let your guys enter their courts.

Good game, but you gotta find a way to limit haggling to a certain time frame, otherwise it can drag.

Best with 5, which prevents symmetric positions from arising.

While the Mayfair box is smaller, the balance of both only 4 turns of sending out academics and the choice of 1k, 3k, 6k, 10k is a tighter, better game. In particular, with the minimum bribe being 1k just to apply to a position, just getting any conflict at all for a 1k position provides you with more income than even the winner will get.

Just long enough. Not too much. Like it.

One of the challenges of the game is inducing others to send scholars to your palace. Being honest and scrupulous means alliances with other players keeping your own scholars in well paying positions. But that also means no one is going to send applicants to your palace, and the other players will win from all the bribe money coming their way.

The paper money does stick together some. I prefer using a poker chip set instead. It really does improve this game and make it even faster. One afforable set is here:

For what it is, it's quite a good game.  It's really just a meta-game popularity contest with tons of backstabbing involved.  But sometimes, that's just what the doctor ordered.  It's neat that the bribes are completely non-binding.  You just give away your money and hope for the best.

Of all the games i loose the most this is the one I like the best.  This is a good game to play with my brothers who love to argue.  There is lots of action during the game...name calling...accusations...all great fun.  Observers usually want to leave the room.  I have never seen a game that immediately elicits such a strong response.  This is most certainly a game that exercises the reptilian brain. A great game, you just have to find the right people to play with.  For some reason this is not a popular choice with the spouses.

RATING: 6
A first try (with 4 players) was fun. However, there is such a lack of structure that it would only seem to work as an exercise in negotiation and/or backstabbing. For example, nothing in the rules ensures that bribes of cash have any effect on play (other than redistributing cash a little between players). This means that whether it really works as a game depends very much on the group of players (and their current mood).

Just one word : Nasty. 
The game is very simple to explain and a blast to play with a big caveat:

Played the original FX Schmid.  I won by being cheap in the bribes I made, and not worry about defending positions I already had, and taking in lots in bribes from other players (it also helped one of the 5 players was a 9 year old who was generous with his bribes overall as otherwise he actually would have won).

After one play, I'm rating an 8. The game was fun, and very much a playing-the-players game (instead of playing-the-system). This rating could easily go up with more plays (could be a 10 for me).

The only difficulty we had was with the english translation of the rules. They weren't entirely clear in the Amigo version, but we got it after a round.

Has a very 'Diplomacy' feeling, but much shorter.

The nastiest game I've ever played. Yeah, I love Diplomacy, but when I get backstabbed in Diplomacy, it's generally justified - plus, a good stab necessitates careful planning and great skill. If I get stabbed, I'm angry, but I still feel like congratulating my opponent. In Intrigue, however, backstabbing is the norm, it's tactical rather than strategic, and while the game isn't bad and you do have to take the consequences of your stab into consideration, it's still extremely mean.

I love negotiation and backstabbing games but it can be a bit much for some people :devil:. It is a quick, nasty betrayal, game, if you want to win you HAVE to betray someone at some point.  If you have the right group this game can be a lots of fun.

Intrigue was one of the first games I ever played. I have changed a lot during these years so, in general, I no longer enjoy this kind of game. I do love negotiation games but games that feature gratuitous backstabbing are losing terrain in my personal ratings. Still I recognize that game can be fun with the right game group so I'm keeping it for now but I'm downgrading its rating.

(No 2P support.)

After one play: Definitely the "pointy end" of negotiation games. Designed specifically to get players to make deals and break them quickly. Elegantly simple rules, seems well balanced, brings out the negotiation and backstabbing concept brilliantly.

Alas, backstabbing is not my style. I may yet play further if gently pressed, but maybe not.

Warn those of a nice disposition that this one should not be taken too seriously and to expect others to lie openly to them.  My 1 playing so far left me crying with laughter as we earnestly attempted to convince each other of our sincerity.  With the right group this is a simple ruled blast.

A nice stab-your-opponent-whenever-you-can game.  If you don't like diplomacy (which can prolong this game indefinitely) then it's not for you.  I'd rate it higher, but the length of time to play (even on BSW) is just too long.

Played twice now, and it's not enough.  I enjoyed this game of pure negotiation a lot.  Negotiation, irrational deals, good deals, bad deals made.  Loud and full of chaos.  Bad part would be playing with those who don't like conflict, or can't handle rules that ecourage backstabbing. (I have updated from 8 to 9, it is that much fun.)

First Impression: This game is really great fun. If you have a group that you think should love negotiation games, but have had other games fall flat because no one could bring themselves to bluff or break a deal, this is the game for you (even if you have a group that loves negotiation, this is a great game).

I bought Intrigue at Essen '10, because of Barnes' review at Gameshark. This game is incredibly simple in its mechanics and visual design, but contains many layers of strategies in player interaction. The ruleset is skinny and short, but provides a framework for bluffing, lying and blackmailing your friends. It's a bit too intense for some of my friends, but I definately enjoy it if the group enjoys it.

RATING: 6
Owned the original FX Schmidt version since middle of the 90's. This is as cutthroat and backstabbing as a game can get in an hour. Think Diplomacy Express. It's more about the metagame than clever play. If you're into that it could be a '10'. I just don't see the group I could play this with and would usually prefer something else.

RATING: 7
A rather fun little game, but I've only played the game with three people, and I don't think it's nasty enough.  Although it leads to a sort of rock-paper-scissors type of stand-off between players, which can be interesting knowing that everything you do will lead to cutting off your nose to spite your face, you rarely get to settle both internal and external conflicts for the same position, which I expect is where the game become truly cut-throat. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
As long as you have the right group, I don't see what the problem with this game is.  You basically have to anticipate that you will be stabbed at multiple points throughout the game.  Usually, it makes sense in the context of the game, but there are always irrational, unpredictable moves I guess.  There is such a web of interconnectivity in this game that is very complex, making for a series of interesting choices.  There is also a serious hand management component that experienced players should have at their advantage in choosing which scholars go where.  If I could play this game in 45 minutes I would do it often, I'm hoping to get the game time down a bit on this one, as I think it dragged on a little too long.  This game reveals a whole other side to Stefan Dorra - a very multifaceted designer.

Update - Having played with students at school, the play time has gone down.  It takes a while for them to figure out the spirit of the game, and while they sometimes make illogical decisions, it is an absolute blast.  One must play with 5 players.  With 4, you can get 2 rival alliances, which makes the game pretty stupid.  But with 5, you must attempt to ally, but you cannot avoid stabbing someone if you want to have any chance of winning.  Up to a 9.

This game is a little bit about strategy and tactics with regards to where to send your professors, who to make offers, and what offers to make and/or accept. However, the meat of the game is in the trying not to look too strong, negotiation, deal making, deal breaking, backstabbing, and social engineering all in the name of trying to end up with the most money.

This game is very hard to rate because, though it can be a real blast, it’s definitely not for everyone. It’s the type of game that requires the right group with everyone in the right mood or it can really fall flat or even become a painful experience. If being lied to and backstabbed repeatedly by your friends for ~60 minutes is likely to harm your friendships or hurt your feelings then you had best look for a different game! To enjoy this game everyone playing really must have a bit of a thick skin or at least be in the right mood for this sort of shenanigans.

All of that being said, my first game of Intrigue was with a perfect group and it was a blast ... easily the most fun I’ve had playing this type of negotiation/backstabbing game. I wonder if there may be a strong advantage in going last in the turn order but other than that (which may be a miss-perception) it seems very solid. Definitely worth a try if you’ve got a group that can emotionally handle it :)

RATING: 6
Intrigue is a little yet extremely nasty game: treachery, bribery and backstabbing are its main points. If that doesn't seem like your cup of tea, stop reading right now and stay far away from this game.

The game is super nasty because it's a pure negotiation game where one player offers a source of income, for which the other players must bid. Once the bid has ended, the position will be assigned by the buyer, independently of who is the highest bidder, and will collect all the money for himself. Yes, even the money from the loosing bids. In one word: nasty.

But it is fun? Yeah! I tend to dislike games that require backstabbing your fellow players for no apparent reason, but in this one it's so obvious it'll happen that it doesn't bug me. The short playing time also helps a lot, as even when you're completely crushed, betrayed and humiliated, you only have to endure the situation for a few minutes.

The components, though a bit cheap and ugly, are very functional and do their job well. The theme is pretty shallow, but can be drastically compensated if people start roleplaying a bit and behave like selfish and greedy ba****rds. If your group is OK with that, do it, as it'll skyrocket the fun factor.

All in all, a nasty little game which relies completely on the group of players. Watch out with who you play, as games this nasty aren't meant for everyone, and can seriously dent relationships (not that it's happened to me, but have heard of quite a few cases).

In short, the most evil, cut-throat and vicious game I know of that packs a wallop of treacherous laughter in 60-70 mins.  It's an abstract tactical exercise in using negotiation and bribery with a lot of screw-your-neighbor decisions.  The rules are designed for the players to be evil to each another in order to maximize money.  Because of it's evil nature, I will only play with the proper crowd of people...

Do you have a game group that refuses to negotiate, or seem to be too friendly with each other? Ever feel like what your group needs is more getting pissed with each other, and feeling icky because you just had to stab someone in the back? If so this is the game for you. Everything is just window dressing for negotiating, and everything has a price in this game. I really like this game and will probably keep it around because I think this may be the first tool I have found to change dynamics in a group. My group has been playing negotiating games pretty regularly for the past few months, so we didn't have a problem jumping into it, but I can see this game coming in handy because I have been in groups that refused to negotiate anything. And no, making equal swaps all the time is not negotiating. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Evil little negotiation that distills the essence of the backstab more clearly than any other game I've played.  I can see real potential for kingmaking problems and the player induced chaos prevents one from taking it too seriously but there are definitely ways to optimize the placement of your pieces to help shape your deals as inexpensively as possible.

More of a social experiment you conduct among friends than a game.

It's an experiment that excites, and one that tends to scrape raw the nerves of its participants.

Its limitation, I feel, is that it only works for each group once.  After you've explored the alliances and backstabs in this game, it seems you've hit the bottom.

I wish there was something else to the game, some economic aspect beyond the bribes and salaries, or perhaps a variation in the way bribes are given (hidden, blind bid, etc.)  Without that, it feels like half a game.

The question here is not who but when you're going to betray - because eventually you'll betray everyone.

Wow! For sure you need the right group for this...but WITH the right group, this game is glorious mayhem. This game is the distilled essence of negotiation games. The only difficulty, and the real issue with this game for people, is that there is very limited foundation for negotiation and no means of enforcement. So if a player really sucks at negotiation/guile/status building, then little fun will be had. And being such a slim package, Intrigue is easily now a staple carry to game nights.

The FX Schmid art is fantastic. The later editions with the playing card palaces and 4 pairs of workers feel like a big let down.

If you have a group that gets feelings hurt easily, I wouldn't recommend this game. Otherwise, back stab to your heart's content. And challenge a fellow player to pistols at 20 paces.

RATING: 6
Tenuous - not a priority to remove due to taking so little space

Vicious and laugh out loud backstabbery all the way, or cold hard game-theory'esque calculation. Either way is fine and either way makes for a fun game, just make sure you know which you are playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After ~20 plays. 

It's perfect information, but entirely psychological.  You have to learn to read your opponents' intentions, and manipulate their perceptions.  The only way to win is by talking other players into letting you win.  You could call this a game of "skilled begging".  If I could only have one game for more than two players in my collection, this might be it.

The way the game unfolds depends entirely on the personalities of the players and the cultural norms they bring with them (or fail to bring with them) to the game.

I'd rate it maybe a point higher than this, except it only plays well with exactly 5, which is really inconvenient.

RATING: 7
Docked a point Dec 2015 after my second play of Intrigue in like +10 years (rating of 8 to 7).  Still a game I'm willing to play again with a good amount of intermediary time between games.

Susceptible to group think, maybe, which can lead to a slightly stagnant and stale game, but not really enough play experience to make that determination.

Formerly owned FX Schmid edition.

I really enjoy this game... though it might be difficult to get a group together to play it (and enjoy it).  Quite nasty and arbitrary in that no one can hold you to your promises despite the amount of their bribe.

Needs the right group for a good game.

Very backstabby.  I'm okay with that; I like Diplomacy after all.  However, the one time I played I was neck and neck with Player B for the lead.  After an hour and a half we were at the last turn when Player C (in last place) turns to Player A (second to last place) and says "Do you want all of my money?"  Player A accepts and now wins.  Really?  Why the hell did I just waste an hour and a half of plotting and maneuvering just to have the whole game nullified in five seconds?  It made the whole game pointless because this can essentially happen every time you play.  Why bother?

Very interesting. Not my type of game, really, but I enjoyed it anyway. Enjoyment depends heavily on the players, but with the right players (ie. people who don't carry grudges and take backstabbing well), the game is a blast. It's like Diplomacy with all the boring bits and hours of play time removed. However, I came to the conclusion that it takes a too specific group to enjoy, thus I sold it.

Indifferent.

RATING: 8
Insanely vicious. 

So much so that during our first game, one of the players at our table physically threatened another player, and it wasn't a joke (quote:"if you ever do that again at a game I am at, I will seriously punch you in the face.")

The only game that manages to capture the same tension is Diplomacy.

And while that is probably off-putting for some, in my own crazy universe, this is exactly the kind of game I am always looking for - one that is so intense and nasty that the players forget that they are playing a game and experience real emotion. I think this is because games like this break the illusion of what really happens in all games - there is an unveiling of sorts, and suddenly we see each other as we really are - beings who are willing to do whatever it takes for personal gain. And that's not pretty, but it sure the heck is entertaining as hell.

Make negotiations to employ knights/workers in your castle, then can bribe or manipulate other people to pay you more, or bribe the original person you made the deal with. In fact, you don't have to honor any deal! Very cutthroat, and left a bad taste in my mouth. However, these type of games are not my type, but made me think about honesty and honoring deals after the game was done. I prefer something a little more structured.

A universal theme when learning Stefan Dorra's games is a sort of community 'that can't POSSIBLY work!' feeling. Turns out the majority of them do work, many very well, and Intrigue is certainly no exception. It's pure negotiation and skulduggery, absolutely one of a kind, and almost invariably uproarious fun, even when playing with cynics.

The game is a popularity contest in most respects - if people perceive you as a leader or a regular winner, then you simply don’t get awarded paying jobs by the other players and there’s nothing much you can do about it except whine harder.

Fun game-alliances, deceit, greed, under the table deals. 

All this in a tiny little box.

Feelings may be hurt. 

In one of my first games, an opponent I played screwed me early on a deal I made with her, so I dogged her the rest of the game. This helped me win. She later told me she had nightmares about that game. 

***If that kind of thing doesn't blow yer skirt up, you probably wouldn't enjoy this game.

Intrige is my favourite game to lose friends with. The ruleas are simple, so simple in fact that you caould wonder if there's a real game there. But it turns out that to win, you have to befriend and betray the other players. The player who bribes the best wins.

A classic game of broken promises.

There aren't many games I rate after one play, but I'm pretty confident that my opinion of Intrigue isn't likely to change much. I didn't like this game, at all! I'm not sure if it was getting the rules wrong twice (we started over at one point and still got them wrong). It may have been playing with someone who created a policy of negotiating and creating a binding deal with the first player in turn order, thereby guaranteeing anyone else was SOL. It may just be that this isn't the type of game I enjoy. In the end, I like games where I control my fate.

RATING: 8
I love this game. I don't know how much control I really have when playing this, but I don't care. Any game where backstabbing, badmouthing, shrewd dealmaking and making offers-that-you-can't-refuse are integral parts of the experience is pure bliss (but then I'm a sucker for negotiation games). With the right crowd this is a hit. When playing in teams you add an extra layer of conflict as the team managing one house sure will have a lot of internal discussions (that perceptive players can profit from).

Nice easy little game that you can learn on your first play. This game is the epitome of promises that lead to back stabbing and then more back-stabbing.

Hard to play fully when couples are involved (they tend to band together and be less treasonous)

Forget brain-busting economic development strategy and tactics: this is a blast of a bribing and backstabbing game! Not to be played by players who don't know well each other, this game is basically an hour full of bantering, haggling, sarcasm, psychological manipulation, pithy and tongue-in-cheek comments, broken promises, innuendos, and laughter. Unlike most boardgames, it's also a great spectator game: bystanders can add to the fun interjecting their own advice, either well-meant or on purpose to turn players against each other!

The ultimate game when it comes to meanness and backstabbing, perhaps even more so than Diplomacy!

This game should have a warning. As with Diplomacy, some people simply cannot remember that this is simply a game. Intrigue and Diplomacy are the two best negotiation games available. Unfortunately, Diplomacy is too long and really needs at least six to work well while Intregue is too short. With the right group, Intregue is a blast - with the wrong group, the game can result in anger, hurt feelings and all that goes along with this behavior. Pick the right people and play away.

This is a short game, where players negotiate these contracts to hire each other's workers, but then are under no obligation to honor those contracts.

RATING: 6
Intrigue is the "nastiest" game I have played. The rules explicitly allow for backstabbing and breaking of promises. 

In Intrigue, you send out your workers to other people's palaces for employment and then negotiate with the palace owner to employ them. Thus, multiple workers may be sent to a palace to be employed.

What makes the game interesting is that each negotiation must be concluded and paid for before the next one begins. However, only one of the negotiations will be honored and everyone knows that. This leads to interesting mind games and creative deal making.

There is some strategy to the game about when and where to send out your workers but the key to winning is striking that delicate balance between diplomacy, tact, and timely betrayal.

You need a group with the right mindset and personality to play this because some of the backstabbing can be truly frustrating and annoying and can thwart even the best laid plans. That's what makes me give it a 6.

An absolutely delightful game of pure negotiation.
The core mechanics of the game are so simple and intuitive that players will already be cutting deals before you finish explaining the rules!

The beginning of the game feels very open; the world is your oyster, and you could happily spend or demand almost anything for a short-term gains... 
...But as each round passes the stakes get higher, the board becomes claustrophobic, and the negotiations become increasingly bloodthirsty and stressful.  
By the end you'll be yelling, bargaining, and swearing your loyalties up and down just to eek out an extra buck.

A perfect game in my eyes.   Tight design, no random chance, exciting interaction, and short enough that despite how heated it gets it'll soon be over and everyone can decompress and laugh together.

I'd heard the game's reputation and knew what to expect going into it.  It's a decent game but, based on my playing with three and with five, not something I'd clamor for again.  Interesting mechanics, but it just didn't grab me.  Be sure to keep track of who has what professionals left in the game, as that really allows you to know when you can back stab someone with impunity.  Ok negotiation game, just not one that I enjoy that much.

Rather abstract negotiation game, which is also quite simple. I have played it only once, but I do not think there is more to see in this game and have no desire to play it again. Artwork is very unappealing and two of the colors are very hard to distinguish (well, it is an old game...).

The game doesn't work as a three player due to the inability to choose where your helpers must go.  In the first two games that played, the person who looked to be losing ended up winning due to miserly use of bribes.  Good fun but think that need to know your opponents well to get the full effect.

It's the Dorra-est of the Dorra. Pretty much the most open game system in the universe, with the possible exception of bare-knuckle back-alley brawling.

When i want to play a game that will make me lose friends, this is the one. It is about equal to Diplomacy in that respect. You screw the other players more in this game but because it is a lighter and shorter game than DIplomacy it does not hurt as much. It is a fun game in a masochistic way.

This is a very interesting experiment into player derived gameplay, but in my group it fell totally flat as people didn't really want to attack each other. The one player who tried fell behind and ended up playing kingmaker. Basically, the game needs more incentives. Or my group needs different players.

Ironically, Lifeboats seems to work as expected with the same group.

For people who feel like they're ready to get rid of their friends, Intrigue accomplishes that with alarming efficiency. There are maybe a page of rules, but every one is designed to compel you to lie, bribe, and screw your neighbors.

Some people are wildly thrown off by the fact that there doesn't seem to be any real rules to the game - you can cheat whenever you wish (within reason). Also, it's incredible hostile - quite possibly the most hostile game I've ever played as it encourages you to constantly betray your friends. I find some love its fiendish nature while others are repulsed by it. I enjoy it from time to time but only with certain friends that don't mind busting on one another.

A straight negotiation/diplomacy game, that plays in 45 minutes. That's an okay length for this type of game. Leave your morals and your friendships at the door and you'll be fine. If you can't do that, stay away.

The nastiest of the nasty games.  A couple of my friends "never want to play it again", while others reveled in the pure Machiavellan negotiating necessary in this game.  This game is like dark chocolate.  Not everybody has a taste for it, but for some, the bitterness is was makes it delicious.

I like Dorra's games for their elegant simplicity, but this one is a little too "simple" (i.e. the game is too loosely defined). More like an exercise in talking and making deals than an actual game. So much screwage is involved, you can't really do anything except just try to stay in 2nd place all game. I don't like negotiation games, especially ones involving promises (promises exist to be BROKEN; why can't others realize this?) and this one definitely doesn't change my mind.

This negotiating game is extremely simple. 1) Hire and/or fire workers who come to your city. 2) Send your workers to other cities with a bribe to ensure they get and keep a good job. 3) Collect what your workers get paid. These simple boundaries provide the framework for backscratching, backstabbing, revenge and a lot of fun.

When played with a group of guys who haven't played together much this is my favorite game. Consensus in my group is to keep this game far away from your spouse.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
Extremely nasty negotiation game. Players own households with 4 job positions with varying levels of payouts.

Then they send out their own 'workers' to opponents households, wrangling for a high paying position. This involves dealmaking, bribes and dealbreaking.

The nastiness comes when there are duplicate characters fighting to keep one single position.

It's meant to be short but can seriously drag with the wrong type of players.

Needs the right group to shine. And yes, it's only a game.

I love a little bit of being "evil" just like the next board gamer and I gave this game a few tries but the last time we played it, the 10 year old son of my friend ended up crying.

That was just too much for me, so I sold the game.

This is one of those games that you either really love or just despise.  Without a doubt it is the meanest game I've ever played.  The beauty of the game is that it forces players to ally and back-stab.  If you can't handle that, this game is not for you ... but it certainly works for me.

Wow.  I just played this as a four-player game over the weekend, and it was an excericse in backstabbery.  My rating reflects playing this with three other somewhat-ruthless players, each with no qualms about negotiating situations out, making threats, and going back on promised promotions just to get ahead.  Quite fun, though I understand that this would not be appropriate for all groups.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  Super high player interaction.  I never really like super high player interaction, and this game takes it to the extreme.  You can't really plan how to win or have a good strategy.  You really just have to talk smack and hope it is enough to trick other people into helping.  Likewise if other players want to they can screw you for no reason at all.  Although I will admit it does add some cool variety to an evening of strategy games.  I can't really ever see wanting to play this game often or requesting it often, but if it came out every once in a while as something different to try I would enjoy it again.

RATING: 6
[Amigo Card 2003 Edition] {Economic; negotiation; optimal 5p} Intrige is a very cut-throat negotiation game (in the line of Lifeboats, Mall of Horror, etc.) Players either love it or hate it very much. It highly encourages threats, blackmailing, backstabbing, betrayal and irrational deals. In this short game, players must develop target ally or rival quickly.

General players and games would play Intrige quite differently. General players can play it peacefully where each player makes binding commitment and tries to get as much money as he can (though it loses the essence). For gamers, there would be many intrigues, threats, etc. in this game. With correct playing altitude, it provides loads of fun. However, if you don't like being cheated, you should avoid this game. 

Players must not take this game too personal. Better avoid playing it with unforgiving and sensitive friends.

Before you go and buy this game be aware of the reasons for me giving it a 10.

This game needs a stronger government health warning than a pack of 20 Woodbines.

I've only played it 3 times and each occassion has resulted in pistols at dawn and family sqaubbles despite my very clear warnings to all, that this is the sole intention of the game. 

It is a Pandoras box of hate and deceit born of such simple rules, yet no serious game collection is complete without it. 

Nearly every one I know has sold their copy and in doing so, has lost the rare opportunity to examine the Primitive Psyche of their so called friends and family.

Just sit back, light the touch paper and enjoy a world you never knew existed. You can only hope that there will be no permanent damage. And if there is, you'll have lasting memories of the occassion and be forever intrigued about what a simple board game can do.

I can categorically say that there has never been a game like it and, for that reason alone, I give it an unreserved 10.

This has to be one of the quintessential screw your neighbor games.  Don't play with friends with thin skins or they may soon become enemies.  The mechanics of the game require that you make deals with the other players which sooner or later you will be forced to break.  Fun with the right crowd but could easily upset some people.

tl;dr: clean design, not my style

This is kind of a weird game. You pay other players to do something, but regardless of what they do, they do get the money. This allows players to completely screw over one or more players if they so choose. That aspect of this game did not appeal to me, even though it helped me secure victory.
The struggle to get the best positions or pry the most money from other players fighting over a location, was more fun though.
In the end I think this is a pretty good design, but that first aspect I mention does make the game very group dependent.
At least it plays pretty fast and doesn't take too long.

This game is very good, but be forewarned; you need to know your opponents. Some folks just can't get into this kind of game. Lots of wheeling & dealing and backstabbing can lead to occasional hurt feelings to those who may be a bit too "kind" for this type of vicious game. You have been warned.

I don't think it's as much backstabbing as everyone says. Maybe that’s because you are forced to choose between players. Backstabbing seems to be more pronounced in games where the person didn't have to break the treaty, but did. There they've chosen to backstab me. That's much more upsetting to me than if the rules make them choose one person amongst the players.

Intrigue is a game of pure negotiation and bribery. Each turn you get income, the points of the game as well as its only currency. Your income is based on the jobs you convince the other players to give your family members. And after five rounds of seeking jobs and hiring the other players' relatives, you see who has made the most money.

Unbelievably simple, completely non-random, and entirely based on your ability to discuss outcomes and trade favors. I am the only person I know who loves it.

This is just as much a psych experiment as a game. Still, good play is rewarded, I can confirm that the "break every deal you make" strategy doesn't seem to work too well. Fun and nasty!

Diplomacy is for the faint of heart. If you want bickering and backstabing, this is the game.

Not quite sure what I think (besides Mayfair components being lame: four cards instead of a board for each palace, and scholar iconography that doesn't seem to have a common style to me). I did like it once you reach the point that you can't send a scholar anywhere without annoying someone or forcing someone to make a choice. Interaction with every other player seems likely.

I couldn't really understand why the winner won. I got why the biggest losers lost: there is definitely a popularity contest element in here. In addition to that, this game is extra nasty because all bidders lose what they bid and there is no way to guarantee that your bid will get chosen. It doesn't have to be so mean, surely? Why not just say that you keep your bid if you don't get picked.

I also wonder whether it is too easy to calculate the value of a position. Towards the end of the game it seems to be. Maybe by game end the popularity contest turns into leader bashing. My "keep your bid if you lose" idea probably makes this worse by lessening the ability to make extra money by misleading people.

Great, excellent game. Diplomacy in about an hour. Can suffer from meta-gaming, but that's indicative of the genre. The mechanisms set up legitimate reasons to screw your neighbors. It's not just out of spite.

An extremely high conflict game with players making non-binding negotiations and agreements that are easily broken. In fact, players are expected to backstab each other to gain the most money. 
Clearly, this game is only suitable for specific groups of people -- folks who like diplomacy will feel right at home.

I enjoyed the game but the negotiations can drag out for a medium-short game. This can make the game a wee bit tedious at times. There are few games out there that are that high conflict. The closest one is I am the boss but even that game fails in comparison to intrigue. Need  a few more plays to solidify the rankings but with current crowd, this game is a tough sell. I prefer I am the Boss where there is more structure for negotiations.

Every player gets a "court" in which there are 4 spots with different "money values", 8 students, two for each "science" they want to study on the courts and starting money.
In each round, you try to place your students (two) on any court in order to gain the money on that spot at the end of the round so you place it in front of that spot and make an offer to the court owner.
If there is only one applicant and noone is already there, the owner has to accept your offer and let you in. If there is one or another applicant to come in, the owner can accept whatever he wants and here starts the best part of the game, the negotiation :)
After 4 rounds, the player with the most amount of money is the winner.
This game is one of my favourites. You can lie, cheat, backstab, bluff, negotiate, promise, deceive as much as you wish. Absolutely gorgeous game, love everything about it. You just have to take it as a game and forget everything afterwards :D

RATING: 8
So. Much. Fun. It is truly a blast. The only thing that keeps it from being a 9 or 10, is that it is simply too vicious to "always want to play it." It would difficult for any, except the most emotionally handicapped psychopath, to endure such extreme subterfuge and nastiness very frequently. Note: it is likely someone will walk away from the table with hurt feelings, or at minimum walk away dispirited. Having said that, the game feels like a wonderfully wicked, psychological tight-rope walk. And you know how that ended for the flying Wallendas.

Who do you trust, who do you screw? Who screwed you that you will screw if the other guy doesn't screw you both first? A great thing about the game design is that even a "goody-always-honest-two-shoes" will have to piss someone off. The game is constructed to put everyone in the power seat, choosing between two neighbors, two brothers, two friends without any way out but the coward's: "I'll pick randomly." But I can assure you (for those inclined to the coward's path): this "random" gambit will just piss two people off!

The simplicity of the rules and the depth of screwage is simply sublime in this game. If my rating were on pure cleverness of game design (as opposed to how much I want to play) this would defineltly get a 9/10. As it is a solid 7/8. ps. Pick the group you play with well.

**Note after 2nd play-- this can fall flat with the wrong group. 2nd play was mediocre compared to 1st because group didn't get into it very much.

**Note after 4th play-- this game is brilliant! Of course, the right group is essential, but with each additional play I find myself amazed at how Dorra's design so elegantly strips everything superfluous away pitting the players against each other in some very raw, primal way.

Not quite as vicious and nasty as it's made out to be, but still has a bite to it.  You can't please everyone, but you have to be just trustworthy enough that people will at least not completely hate you.  This game is all about the metagame and gauging how human emotion affects the market.  It's like macroeconomics marketing in a board game. Toward the end of the game it's as much about trying to gauge who's going to win and trying to kick their scholars out of your palace, as the reason to keep your word goes away when people no longer have the opportunity to kick you out of their palace when scholars get limited.  Also, the amounts that things are worth is surprisingly open.  This one will probably be dominated by groupthink every time.  Definitely see a lot of connection between this one and [gameid=1345].

Good, negotiation game. Almost pure negotiation and of course screwage with less structure than I'm The Boss, absolutely no agreement is binding, and without "take that" cards. Apart from paying bribes for often immediately broken promises, only some strategy/tactics in which positions to apply for with which type of workers to avoid, or indeed ensure, conflict with others.

My only game of this was quite long, which is perhaps why I haven't had the urge to go back. The mechanics are clever, but in practice the game just felt arbitrary. This seems like the type of game that really requires the right group. I'm curious to try again but I don't have high hopes. Interestingly, I had the most fun when the game got derailed by people arguing with each other. Which makes me think that this might be like Battlestar Galactica, another game I think is way too long for its own good but that ironically is at its best when the game is being interrupted for discussion.

I like the way the mechanisms come together, and I like that it's a bit of an evil game.  For the most part, I avoid negotiation games, since I'm not good at coming up with the value of any certain thing, but this one has such a small system that I can figure that out quickly.  But, it is an EVIL game.  It definitely improves if you have a group of people who can really get into it, and role-play during negotiations.

This one may get bumped to a 9 with more plays.
Very impressive, and very deep considering what little material and rules you get.
There is an especially fun disconnect when you realize you don't have to give the big reward to the player who paid you the most. But the learning curve is quite something: not to learn how to play, but to learn how to play well. Our second game will be ABSOLUTELY different from the first one. In particular, old enemies have to realize that they sometimes have to cooperate in order to oust the leader.

The very best in negotiation games, with clever mechanics to boot.

After 1 Play: I just don't get the appeal of these types of negotiation games.  This one is particularly annoying because even deals about the issue at hand don't have to be honored.  Usually these games make immediate deals binding, but allow players to break future agreements.  Here, if we negotiate a deal for a current position, I can agree, take your money and simply ignore the deal.  

In these types of games I feel like the players are simply picking someone to win, and there is nothing to base that decision on but outside-of-the-game factors.

Wow, what a game. Get rid of all the "bad parts" of Diplomacy and you get Intrige: no player elimination, quicker and open table talk - you even have to listen while the others talk about backstabbing you :p.

Make sure you play it with the right crowd and that no weapons are allowed on the table :)

RATING: N/A
10/1/07 - I played this for the second time 2 days ago (first play was 2 years ago, probably).  It definitely made a lot more sense this time around.  It wasn't that the game was confusing;  it just seemed totally arbitrary.  After my latest game, however, the weight behind the decisions the players made was a lot more apparent.  Still, when to screw someone and when not to is still a little vague for me.  The greatest value in accessing someone's castle/palace is in the first few rounds, and screwing someone early can make a game-long enemy in short order.  The final few turns seemed a lot  less important/interesting because the value of everything people were forced to compete for dropped significantly.  

All-in-all, Intrigue has all the makings of a fine negotiation game.  The fact that Intrigue forces players to screw each other at least a little is somewhat of a relief since players are generally pretty hesitant to screw each other otherwise within the negotiation genre.  In the end  though, Quo Vadis? seems to be the more substantial game (though I have a lot more experience with it).  I classify them together because they are of similar weight and length.  I suppose my rationale here is that the hoseage in Intrigue is the impetus for negotiation, which feels at least a little gimmicky.  Quo Vadis?, on the other hand, has a much stronger foundation upon which the negotiations are built (the tit-for-tat lobbying for votes).

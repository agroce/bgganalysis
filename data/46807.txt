Excellent artwork can't save this mediocre game.

UPDATE: This title has grown on me. I don't find it a bad play these days, and find the chaotic nature of things more enjoyable than I did. It has tons of "screwage potential" if you're into that kind of thing (which I have mixed feelings about -- sometimes I enjoy that, and other times I don't).

LIKE: Tile laying, simple rules.
DISLIKE: Random with a lot of take-that mechanisms. Also the text on the tiles were difficult to read, but after a few plays this is negligible. Min/maxing at the end adds a lot of analysis paralysis.

OVERALL: Not really my type of game, it's too mean and random. Some of the combos are powerful, and if you don't draw a combo, you are left out. If it played faster I would not have minded so much.

RATING: 5
*Rating based on one play.

This is a tile-laying game with a city building theme, though the theme feels particularly tacked on.  Buildings are often moved around in the city and the effects of the buildings don't make much thematic sense.  The game is pretty straight forward with a heavy dose of "take that", but there's not enough to it to make it very interesting.  For a city building game, I'd much rather play Suburbia, and for a light tile laying game I prefer Carcasonne.  This one just fell flat for me.

Great game that is scalable to a wide amount of players. As per its name, has nearly an infinite amount of possibilities in terms of how it will play out due to its extreme modular nature. Makes a really good party game with the right people.

An excellent tile laying filler.  Has a really easy ruleset which can even be explained to nongamers in under a minute.  The gameplay/ tiles present a variety of interesting and highly interactive options.  Features some good quality tiles with great art, but blemished with some curious design choices.  Specifically, certain key game elements are a bit too hard to differentiate at times (such as the silver borders).  The tiles are also a bit cumbersome to deal with at times due to their overly large size (makes set up/ 'shuffling' and stacking difficult).  Despite these issues, Infinite City brings a lot of tile laying fun for up to 6 players in 30 minutes playtime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Cutthroat Corporate Carcassonne. 
In a way yes.  Infinite City is simply a game of placing tiles in front of you. But those tiles may have special abilities that allow you to manipulate the tiles themselves, your player pawns that you place out on the tiles or other players' pawns. You want to be the first to get all your pawns out because that triggers the end of the game but you also need to be in the lead for pints through out the scoring in the tiles. So it is like Carcassonne in the tile laying but unlike that family friendly game you are constantly doing things to trip up your opponents.

What happens when a CCG is merged with a tile laying game?  You get Infinite City.  In order to play well, you need to know the types of the tiles that can come up.  You also have to be patient for the tiles to come up in your favor.  Light game play makes this a nice filler.  Not enough to finish a game night, but as an opener and warm up - it can work.

Very engaging tile placement game.  Has a CCG feel to the tiles.  High marks. After playing a second set of games, I feel that this game remains a great filler, but has serious core gameplay issues.  There is a potential for appalling strings without setup by skilled play.  The capital is really far to strong.

RATING: 5.5
This is a light tile-placement game, quite enjoyable when played with a limited number of players. Everything is very chaotic and not controllable, and with many players everything can happen between the turns of the same player. The artwork and production are very good, and it is indeed a very attractive gateway game for new players.

Okay, played this through several times. Sweet spot is 3-player, although 4 is doable. Went with 5-player one time and it took much too long.
I like the overall concept, but still learning the subtleties. Got a great one going with Capitol, Mausoleum, and Power Stations.
Question: why is it that the card to swap hands always shows up on one's hand in pairs (i.e. I have two, swap to someone else who just swaps back - yeah, no duh!). This happened twice in our early games!

I was lucky to have the designer teach us the game. A very nice guy who did a nice job of explaining how certain tiles work. I was reluctant to try this as I frequently don't like tile laying games, but the rulebook, err, rule leaflet was so short, I decided it was worth a shot to learn. 

Well, my suspicions were right on. I didn't like it that much. It felt very random and unbalanced to me, but then again, I don't like tile laying games. So, if you do like to place a tile or two, you might take a look at this for a different spin to Carc, but if you are tired of Carc and similar games, you won't find something here.

I have one play on this to my credit and I like it a LOT, it was fast and frenetic and colorful. its very civilized in its brutality and I like that. the best laid plans can and DO go awry very quickly and the other avenues are not always so quick to open. This one is simple learn and who knows if ANYone will every really master it.No its not for everyone, but it is a fun little time that can function as filler AND main event for my current group, so it gets kudos there. 

I will score it after more plays, now that I own a copy it will see tabletime for me soon.

Ok there are a LOT more plays missed on this one, and some solo just to get back into the hang of it. I think the score is more solidly in the 7 range for me, as I find myself wanting to play this one more and more these days. It is still a fun little game that gets the tile laying itch scratched very well with some clever and wicked interactions. This may be a big detractor as well as sometimes you do not get to get into any kind of flow based on HOW competitive it can be. This makes it feel more brutal than the theme suggests and has led to me leaving it on the shelf some. This is the only nick in its armor and with some of my groups its a huge plus actually! I will endeavor to get it on the table way more coming up and then see where it shakes out, for now the current score is as accurate as I can make it.

Infinite City plays like a filler although it can last quite long, particularly with the maximum number of players. [i](November 2011)[/i]

Very chaotic game until all the players have had a chance to see the game and most of the tile types in play once or twice.  Typically this is a big negative for me as I don't like to keep the same game on the table all day long.  But, Infinite City plays fast enough that 3 consecutive games still feels like one good game session and by that 3rd game everyone has a much better time playing it.  I don't like the puny tokens but appreciate the fact that they are wood and that there are enough to play with 6 people.  Definitely a good lunch game for me.

On first examination the game looks fun: you build a city and claim tiles. Each building in the city has powers that affect the game in some way or the other.

The problem is that the chaos of these interactions means that the game is less about a long term plan and more about "what's the best thing I can do right now?". Tiles that allow you to draw five additional tiles are great, but are trumped by those that allow you to swap hands with an opponent.

Sort of like riding a roller coaster or watching a thriller: it might be a fun experience but it fails that acid test for me to be a good game.

I have only played this once.  At first I was pretty excited - the production value is high and the I appreciate the visual appeal of building this large city over the course of the game.

I found the actual game play to be lacking, though.  The tile quality varies quite widely, and players who draw the powerful ones (especially those that lock down areas) have a significant advantage.  More, players can make moves on most turns that substantially change the score of several other players, which leads to a feeling of substantial randomness.

I would consider playing again with 2 or 3 players - it might feel less random if less happened between each turn.  For now, I'm not a big fan.

Low expectations are often helpful, and going in to Infinite City expecting it to be pretty bad helped to enjoy it for what it is - which is not a lot, but sort of an interesting tile-laying game with superpowers. Not one to recommend, but OK for vacuous fare. Bad graphic design, though - a very good strategy is to specialize in the points that are hard to see, since this is a bit of a whack-the-leader game.

Holy chaos!  We only played with three, but the game is so chaotic that I can't even begin to imagine playing this with 6... heck, I'm not even sure I'd want to play it with 4!

Basically, you add tiles to the city, adding a marker of your color to the tile you place.  Your main goal is to make contiguous groupings of your markers.  However, tiles all have special abilities that make things switch around every which way, resulting in a rather chaotic exercise where you just hope you get disturbed less than the other players.

The graphic design, while very pretty, makes the game a bit difficult to play without some screw-ups along the way.  For instance, one type of tile makes the tiles next to it immune to being moved or changed in any way, but the tile doesn't look any different than the rest of the tiles to remind you of this.  This resulted in quite a few redos, as people made moves that were later pointed out as being illegal.  I guess perhaps this confusion would lessen as players get more familiar with the tile mix, but it was still rather annoying.

Overall, this is a very light, chaotic tile laying game with some interesting ideas, but I just don't see pulling it out all that often.

I played this recently with the maximum 6 players. It was terrible in this large a group. It is the ultimate "take that" game where you do things to mess up your opponent. However in such a large group it means that by the time it comes back to your turn, any strategy suggested by the previous turn is moot. This looks like it might be quite enjoyable as a 2 or at most 3 player game, but I don't recommend it with more than that. My 4 rating represents a combined 2 rating for large groups and 6 rating for small ones.

You have to always be prepared to react to the tile just played by your opponent.

Fluxx meets Carcassonne. There really is nothing else for me to say about this which is not captured by the previous sentence.

Thoughts after my first play - Carcassonne with a dagger  behind your back.  Actually, it's a lot more like Carcassonne with a dagger in your hand!  This has all sorts of possibilities for maximum screwage.  I like it!  The only real flaw is that it doesn't work well at all with only 3 players.  It needs 4 or more to play well, and 5 players to really shine.

RATING: 6.5
Multiple plays with 3, 4, and 5 players. I don't know which is the optimal amount. I had the most fun with 5.

I read a lot of mixed reviews on this game but went ahead an purchases it anyway. The cool, sort of 1930s high modernist aesthetic, and simple-seeming gameplay was what drew me to it.

 After a number of games, I agree with a lot of reviewers' complaints concerning tile balance, but haven't played enough times to observe clear instances of design exploitation/failure. Also, as many reviewers noted, it's hard to keep track of positioning throughout the game as you have to note players' contiguous influence, how many gilded buildings they have, and the point values on certain buildings. The 5 player game I played was a brain burner to keep track of.

Despite the critical remarks above, I did enjoy IC, but I'm concerned about game fatigue. IC is too long for between game filler, but too simple and unpolished to be a classic.

Infinitely boring (ooh, that was clever wasn't it?).  Extremely light, chaotic, luck-driven, and sometimes brutal game of laying tiles.  The tiles' powers vary greatly, so there's a lot of room for luck of the draw to play a big part, but even so, I don't find this type of game interesting.  Even as a filler, I find there are better options than this game.

The best thing about this game are the graphics which is the reason I bought this game.  I am pleased with the quality of the game--large tiles, durable, with a nice finish.  

This is a light-in-strategy, reasonably short game with very simple rules; the kind of game I pull out to play while we wait for the rest of the crowd to show.  

There is a lot of luck in this game, based on the draw of the tiles.

Played my first game with Ray and a friend of his.  I was coached very well by Ray, his wife, and their friend.  And I know they let me win, because the next game (with Ray, his wife, and same friend), I lost.  But I liked the game enough that I preordered a copy of it through Game Parlor.  Looking forward to playing it again.  It's alot more fun with more than two people, but two-person games are okay.  Changed my mind.  Giving it away to Goodwill.

Clever little tile laying game.  I wish there were more types, and less iterations of the same building.  We would get a bunch of the same building in a row being played, but possibly that's how it was designed!  It's definitely open for expansions out the wazoo.... I like!  Simple to learn; basically all the rules are right on the tiles.  And it is a definite struggle to the bitter end.

From BGG Secret Santa 2010

October 2011 -- We have played a couple of times, but it hasn't appealed to the whole family group. I think it will only be played occasionally by my son-in-law, grandson, and me. There are some conflicting rule situations that make it difficult to teach and remember.

Quite random 'take-that' tile laying game.  The tiles have widely-varying powers, with some of the most powerful being worth the most points, so seems quite unbalanced, given you draw them at random and there is no cost to play.

RATING: 4
A dynamic tile laying game that is just to random to allow anything more than short term reaction to the actions of your opponents on their turn. The tile art is disappointingly brown and does not build a city skyline as the tiles are layed. Otherwise the components are good quality.

RATING: 6.7
A nice 15-25 minute tile laying filler game with just enough "screw you" to make it fun but not so much (well for most groups anyway) to make it argumentative.  The short playing time also helps reduce the sting of bad tile draws or being pounded on because your the leader or you annoyed some one in the main game or random change or any other reason someone chooses to beat on your game position.

Aggressively unbalanced and random, with none of the breezy fun of many other highly-random games. Given a bad draw of tiles, you cannot win, but you will still have to wrack your brain to try to maximize your score with the tiles you have.

Chaotic and light-hearted. At its best with two players, I think. It's nice to make short chains and combos, screw the opponent over a bit... And then get some revenge the very next turn. The game is so short it doesn't matter that much if you lose to luck, which you will.

I especially like the utopian imagery in the tiles, looks like Flash Gordon meets Bioshock, only better in some cases.

RATING: 4
Very random and chaotic with five players.  Not a lot of decisions, its always pretty simple to see what your best play is.  Occasionally you will agonize over where to play your best tile, but mostly it doesn't matter because of the high chaos level.  These problems could be lessened by playing with less players OR by using the "pick one of the top five tiles" variants.  I don't think either fix will make the game more interesting.  The city building theme is original and all the bits are nice but this one just doesn't do it for me.

First played January 5th, 2011.  Taught in 5 min, played in 75 minutes with 6 players.  Good mix of stragegy and skill. Each player is given 5 tiles to start and a tile for each player is placed in the center area facedown. On a player's turn a player may place a pawun on a tile the chose to place down from your hand or a tile that is already face down.  Tiles must be played orthogonally to another. The goal is to have the most points at the end. You achieve points by having pawns connected orthogonally to at least 3 pawns total, then you get one VP per pawn, plus bonus (some have VP pts on tiles). Tiles are two basic types, silver and regular.  The player with the most active silver gets VPs for the silver they have (ties both get). All tiles have special attributes/actions that allow another play, swapping pawns, tiles, hands, breaking rules, drawing cards, playing twice, etc. Power rige (5 of them) protect pawns on them and the 4 tiles adjacent to them.  Capitol (only one) can break power grid tile rules.  Game ends when all 5 power grid tiles are played (immediatly), one players pawns are exhausted, or draw tiles are exhausted.  Good fun, worth giving a try or purchase.

 I like this game, but I don’t have a lot of positive comments for it.  Infinite City is kind of weird in that the art and theme are not silly at all, but the game play will be most enjoyed by people who don’t mind silly game mechanics.  The balance between luck and skill is heavily tipped toward luck.  First of all, your strategy is completely dependant on randomly drawn tiles that make up your hand.  Secondly, almost every play from all players will impact everyone.  You will frequently have your choices and strategy changed and mutated by all of the other players from turn to turn.  I find this style of game fun but silly. This game’s theme and art combination is serious, industrial, and elegant, which does not suggest the silly "out-of-control" gameplay.  People who are not necessarily competitive by nature and who enjoy randomness will likely enjoy this.  People in the mood for serious strategy, or who are competitive will likely be discouraged too many times to enjoy this game.  I can enjoy this game; however, I can’t say I consider it a “good” game.  I reserve the label “good” for games balanced more toward strategy and less toward random.

Maybe my rating is premature after only one game, but I want to give this 8.5.

I debated and debated on this game because of everyone saying it has the screwage, take that factor, and I generally don't like to play that way with my kids.  BUT I don't feel it is truly like that.  Every turn is basically you putting out one (or more) tokens on your tile, and maybe removing another players token(s).  Then the other person goes and does the same to you.  I guess that is "take that", but every player has a chance to do so, it's not like one player gets repeatedly screwed.  

Random and chaotic? Luck of the draw?  Gee, I guess any tile/card game can pretty much have that.   Why not just try to do the best with what you are given on your turn, that's what the other players should be doing.  If they continually mess with your tokens, then they aren't building up their own points,so they lose.

Fun, quick, easy to learn game. GREAT artwork.

Initial Rating: 3.5 (February 2014)

Regular game. I generally don’t enjoy tile placement (hate Carcassonne) games. It has some fun moments but I feel it has lots of uncontrollable luck and “attack the leader” moments. Both of these aspect are grave sins in my book. The last player also has an unfair advantage.  The scoring seems weird, pure luck if you do ok. Very easy decisions (just tactics no strategy) and no tension whatsoever.  I think that playing with 5 or more players augment the luck and chaos factor, but I also think the down time can be excessive. With 4 players the game (mercifully) is rather quick.

It features good components and ok art.
 
Forgettable game. I have a lot more worthwhile games to pursue. I will heavily oppose further plays of this.

A tile laying theme that is an area control game. Simple set up, make a cross with five tiles face down. Draw five tiles to play adjacently to other tiles and choose one of the colors to mark your city tiles.
The game is the instructs on the tiles that you play. Moving other tiles around, getting rid of an opponents markers. 
The game ends when all 15 player pieces are used, (other players get to play one more tile). When the 5th Power Plant is placed.
To win, first calculate how many tiles that you have that are adjacent to each other (they must have at least three adjacent to qualify). Add up the points on the tiles that you have a playing piece on. Last add up and deterimine who has the must silver borders on their tiles. Only the player with the must silver borders scores for silver borders. In an event of a tie after all of this the player with the longest chain of adjacent tiles wins.
Keep track of how many player pieces your opponents have left to play a better game.
Clean up is super quick. The game flows. Has enough tiles to mess up your opponents plans.
A quick playing game. Enjoy it.

----original comment---An area control tile laying game with simple instructions on each tile. Easy to play. A fairly fast moving game once you are familiar with the tiles.

This is not my typical "7" game, but I really enjoyed my first couple plays.  It may well be that much like Carc, this game is best with 2 or 3.  I don't know that I'd want to try playing with many more at any rate.  Using the 5 tiles face up in the draw row variant is necessary as well.  Seeing how the different tile actions chained together or messed up each other's plans was really interesting.  Hate that capital!  There is a lot or randomness, luck and chaos, but the game plays quickly so it is inoffensive and doesn't bother me at all.  I'm curious to see how much repeat value is left, but surprisingly, I am enjoying it right now!

Pretty good game. The artwork is stunning, some of the best I have ever seen in a game, and the components are top notch. The game play is pretty decent, and I enjoy it for what it is. Some tough decisions, and I can imagine that once you are more familiar with all the different types of buildings games would move a bit faster.I like the game play overall, and I definitely want to play a few more times. I can see the rating possibly going up.

RATING: 6
Think Carcassonne but with more player interaction.  A fun tile laying game where you're trying to create chains of properties to score points.  Laying down different tiles allows you to do different things like add another tile or steal one from your opponent.  Games can be very nasty and cutthroat but therein lies the fun.  Scales from 2 to 6.  Great game.

* I enjoy very much the mechanism of placing a tile, then execute the action. Furthermore it's easy to introduce it even in non-gamers and I like the artwork.This game works very well for me. I also own the expansion ( 6 extra tiles) which was given in Essen 09. Maybe the price could be more reasonable though than 30€.

I wanted a game that I could play with just my wife and could also play with my group and this is not that game. My wife and I played 2 times with just the 2 of us and hated it I almost threw it away the same day I bought it. Later I played with a group and it was much better way more fun lots of backstabbing good times. A few in the group really loved it for a quick no brainier game. It is very easy to learn and play so it is good when you want something light and simple. Still not my favorite but I will play.

01/16/10 Played a three-player game. I enjoyed it, but I fear with 5-6 players it would be utter chaos. I was a bit dismayed the game contained no list of tile types or the number of each. I see this as important as some tiles are much more powerful than others. So it would be nice to know if any are left in the stacks during the game. Nor did I see a list of such here on BGG. 
02/02/10 Played a four-player game. It was fine with this number. 
03/16/10 Played a five-player game. It wasn't as chaotic as I'd feared. 
07/06/10 Another five-player game. Every game seems to be decided on who is lucky enough to draw the few "good" tiles. Having all 15 of your daubers on the board and adjacent isn't anywhere near enough to win. If you don't possess several of tiles with 1-4 VPs on them you'll do poorly.

6 of the 8 points are for Charles Urbach's splendid artwork, as I've fallen love with the game after seeing the first promo shot. Fortunately it turned out to be an excellent tile laying game, which requires a good couple of plays to know the tiles, after that it's a blast. It's best with 2 or 3 players.

RATING: 6
Tile-layer.  Each player has a hand of tiles.  Some puzzle / jockeying for position with the token placement on the tiles.

Rating based on 1 play with 2 players.  Seemed to work well as a filler with that number.  Played quickly.  Not the type of game I'd want to play for more than 1 hour.  I think it might be too long and chaotic with 3+, but not sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Initial rating after one play: Too average

It’s a typical american style tile-laying game: explained in a few minutes, with 20 or so different tiles that do something (mainly screwy) to the other players once you play them. 

The meaning of each tile is clear enough that you’ll know by heart after two or three games what they all do. 

Nice sturdy tiles with good artwork on the tiles and the box. But the gameplay didn’t convince me enough. It feels like an ok “take that” screwage Ameritrash version of Carcassone. And I just don’t like Carcassone.

Sci-fi/futuristic themes don't usually grab me, but I have a feeling this is the trap I fell into with this title, as the mechanic (tile laying) is not something that grabs me very often.  The gameplay is essentially "play a tile, draw a tile," and the powers of the different buildings do a few cool things that make the game variable and somewhat interesting.  It's like a perfectly nice painting you might see in a museum (and BGG is FULL of these)...perhaps you stop and admire it for a moment, but you really came to see the Monets and Van Goghs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun game, with a very high screwage factor. Beautiful and excellent quality tiles. Very short rules (draw and place), but each tile has its own rule. The object of the particular session we played was "screw the purple!" (I, of course, was purple). The plaza is a very nasty tile (perhaps too powerful)--I spent many turns over in the slums because a plaza kept getting moved to the outskirts of town. You just can't take things too seriously with this game.

I really like this game more than I thought I would, especially for a quick game during lunch. It's very hard to have a long term strategy, and there can be plenty of king making, but for a 30-45 minute game, those drawbacks don't seem so big.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Gorgeous artwork on the tiles, I also like the simple "follow the instructions on the tiles" gameplay. Unfortunately it's a bit too chaotic for my taste, as the board changes wildly from turn to turn. The Power Stations act as anchors if you're lucky enough to get one. Not a bad game, especially for the shortish play time, but not one I want to play all the time.

Update: I hate games that render my decisions meaningless, and Infinite City does exactly that. So much changes from turn to turn, it's like tossing tiles into a blender and hoping it all comes out good when the blender winds down. I originally had this as a 6 but I keep dropping the rating each time I play it. Currently rated a 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Was pretty chaotic with 5 players, so would want to try again with 2-3.  The components and artwork are great, but the level of chaos involved seemed too high for me.  I also don't like how some tiles are CLEARLY better than other tiles, and it can be very difficult to steal tiles from others.  It's not difficult to get people off their tile, but to then get your guy on it can be problematic.  This is why if you don't draw tiles worth a lot of points, you could easily lose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating based on 2 player version. If you don't take it too seriously, and don't mind having your best laid plans easily subverted, you might enjoy this. Like Kachina, what's missing here is any real ability to manage your hand. Lightweight and fun, we like playing it when we don't want to think too much and don't mind flowing with the random nature of things. There are enough decision to keep you involved, but not enough to make this a game with legs.

I guess I'm getting more descriminating when it comes to tile-laying games. This one should be right up my alley, but left me feeling kind of disappointed. There just didn't seem to be any new ideas here, and the gameplay reminded of an inferior version of Castle. We only played with 2, but these games tend to just get more chaotic, the more players you add. I would like to try it again with 3 and see if there's some player interaction elements that only reveal themselves during play.

A game with the one big mechanic that I hate - the "take that!" mechanic with no compensation.

This is a card game at heart.  The "cards" are the ONLY source of actions and therefore you play a card and do what that card says.   

Q: Why did you get to steal my whole hand from me? 

A: Oh, because this card says I can.

Faidutti's 'Castle' set in the future! Nice weighty tiles and slick art mask a game that is a lot more fun than it has any right to be: the emphasis is on catch-the-leader screwage, which isn't always everyone's cup of tea, but the game time isn't overdone, and you can always tone down the chaos to fit the group. The rulebook is unclear on many aspects.

Place a tile. Put a token on it. Execute the tile's action which is generally to move tiles and tokens around. See your tokens get moved around in between turns, so return the favour as best you can. You're aiming to get groups of 3 or more tokens adjacent to each other so that they can score, so upsetting groups is the name of the game. 5 tiles in hand, each with actions, provides a bit more downtime than is preferable, but the artwork is great and the game can provide some semi-chaotic fun for 3 or so players. Not sure I'd want to play it with more though given the game is 10-15 mins per player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A pleasure to play. Cutthroat. Great feel. Game plays under an hour. Area control and tile/hand management. 

I enjoy the artwork, and appreciate that this game uses cardboard tiles instead of cards, though the tiles are difficult to "shuffle" so we play Carcassonne-draw style. That said, a reprint with cards would probably be better.

Plays nice as a 2 player game, but is better with more.

This is a pretty basic tile-laying game.  You have a hand of tiles, and on your turn, you play a tile, put a marker in it, and perform its text.  The texts let you do a number of different things, like move around markers or tiles, draw more cards, etc.  You score by having markers next to one another.  There's a decent amount of variation because of all the different tiles.  I like it better than Carcassonne, which is probably the closest comparison.

A little bit too chaotic. A little bit too luck-driven. A little bit too "in your face"-kinda game where you have little chance to defend yourself against ruthless onslaught.

It's a little bit of all of those negatives, but a lot of all the good stuff. It's also short, fun and beautiful. A nice addition to the collection, and it gets better with more plays as you learn which tiles to look out for and you learn to anticipate the other players' moves.

Would be better if there was more strategy and less luck of the draw.  The bigger issue isn't tile draws but rather the fact that every other action rearranges the board so it is impossible to make a strategic defense. Another problem is the power plants are game winning time and are random draws. A single player gets more then one and they have the game.

A tile-lying game with a twist. A lot more interaction than the spiritual predecessor Carcassone, swapping tiles, swapping possession etc. The theme does not do much for me, generic sci-fi, rather bland but it works fine and kind of goes well with the idea of building a network/city. Some of the other players complained about the visuals, really small writing on the cards, no symbols to tell the buildings apart etc. No problem for me but I can see how it might turn other people off. I think a hand limit of five is too much (three would have done it) but better than drawing only one (as in Carcassonne). Great variation of the classic tile-laying game and I am looking forward to more plays. Not sure whether the high rating will hold up but we will just have to wait and see.

I like the different abilities on each individual tile, but mixed together I find Infinite City a bit too random and chaotic. This is probably best with fewer players, otherwise I can't imagine there would be much control in scoring. Wish I liked it more, because the tiles are awesome quality and look great laid out on the table!

Infinite city is a tile laying game for 2 to 5 players.  I have rated Infinite City as an 8 based on my experience playing 2 player, but would likely rate it a 6 with 4+ players.  With 4 or 5 players the game becomes too chaotic - lots of things can change in each person's turn - and with many people playing the board changes so much between your turns that you can't control your own destiny.  This can be very frustrating :).  With 2 to 3 players, however, I think the game allows you much more control.  

The artwork is superb and the tiles are very thick and durable.  I would have preferred the box insert to be laid out differently to hold all the tiles more securely after being punched out, but it is adequate.

I would recommend this game for small groups looking for a game that plays quickly.

While I actually find the simplicity beneficial for getting the game set up and going vs Among the Stars (which has a lengthy sorting and setup that is different depending on the numbers of players) IC can't escape comparison and, in that, IC has a lot less variety and complexity than AtS

Very poorly designed game where you place tiles are places and tokens are placed to form a rather non-infinite city.  

Because of the intervening play between turns and hand limitation, little planning can be done.  Giving the game a "just play the highest scoring tile each turn" feel.  Often the players who drew useless tiles were doomed, and those who drew great tiles would win easily.

The artwork is a great example of form over function, pretty to look at, but information needs to easily spotted by the players.

UGH!

Surprisingly fun little tile-laying game with card-game-like effects.  They did a really great job with the graphic design...very attractive.  The font size could have been a little bigger.  

WARNING: This game comes with pieces for up to six players.  If you value ANY control at all over the course of the games you play, throw away all but (at most) three of the colors.  I see this as a very good, light, two-player game and a MISERABLE 4+ player game.

The mechanics are that you have a hand of five tiles, and each turn you play one tile that has a special ability. The goal is to score points in various ways.

The game itself probably isn't too bad, but it was hard to tell in my first play because I played with someone who took 5 minutes to make a move. . . . kill me now. It took 10 minutes to make the last move of the game, when it was clear they were 10 points behind and had no hope.

Infinite City is a tile laying game combined with area control.  The board starts with 5 face-down tiles; each player has a hand of 5 tiles.  Players play tiles from their hand onto the board so that they are orthogonally adjacent, place a token on the tile, and then follow it's instructions.  The game ends when someone runs out of tokens and players earn points for owning tiles with numbers, tiles with silver boarders, and for tiles in a contiguous path (minimum of 3).  The tiles allow players to do a number of things such as taking over someone else's tile, removing someone else's token, re-arranging tiles, protecting tiles, removing tiles, and generally re-arranging the board.  This allows players to carefully plan their set of adjacent tiles while also giving them opportunity to disrupt an opponent's.  The game is fast, easy to teach and learn, but has enough strategy and interest to keep playing.

You basically try to control blobs of at least three adjacent buildings on a square grid. On your turn, you place a city tile, mark it with one of your player tokens, then do whatever the special effects on that tile say. Which might be "swap any two tiles", or "move any token anywhere", or "remove all tokens from one tile", or anything else that might change pretty much everything about the game state. And you have to think a lot about which tiles or tokens you want to be affected, so people start to think a lot on their turns. The worst cards are the "draw five tiles, play one of them immediately, return the rest" ones, which multiply the thinking effort by 5, while everyone else sits and waits. You can't plan much ahead, because by the time it's your turn again, everything has changed.

RATING: 2
Pure chaos.  It is essentially a "take that" card game disguised as a tile laying game.  The game runs on the caprice of players, where often you lay stuff down just to, for lack of better terminology, "F*ck sh*t up". 

The scoring is strange.  You get points by controlling tiles with points on them.  If you don't draw point tiles you are pretty unlikely to win. Those that do get point tiles become targets.  So it seems that of the players that have the opportunity to win (the lucky tile drawers), those that get messed with the least will win.

The idea is that the system forces contending players to "self balance" the system.  The common concept for these kinds of games is that if you give everyone guns they will only attack those that are ahead of them.  As this is has a geography to it, that is not always the case.  Most of the time you are looking out for yourself, growing your regions to insure scoring (if you don't have three adjacent regions you don't score that section).  So you blob out in the most efficient way possible.  What this ends up doing is turning a game that requires people to attack the leader into a game where it isn't always in your best interest to do so.  So the leader, if positioned well, can waltz into victory (as no one wants to sacrifice their game to stop them). 

This dependence on geography also leads to another more concerning issue -- it is not infrequent that it is in a players best interest to step on the last place player. This happens in many games, but a good game will give a player in last place something worthwhile to do.  A player that gets wiped out in this game is left with little worthwhile to do but be a terrorist. You are given a huge arsenal with little worthwhile to do with your position (which can basically be nothing).  What is a good move?  To attack the leader so that someone else can win?  Attack the people that eliminated you?  Who knows?

I also think that the silver ring scoring is problematic.  The fact that it is all or nothing means that there is a huge swing in points.  Controlling these seems more important than most anything else in the game.  When one of these goes down it should be like blood in the water. So if played correctly it should be people just stabbing each other until someone gets it.  Rather uninteresting to me.

A small quibble, I thought that the plaza cards were really irritating.  Forcing players to place around it effectively delays players from taking the turns that they really want.  While technically you get to do stuff, I couldn't help feeling that this was a lose your turn card.  I see that this could be used in fun ways (to clog up areas to protect yourself or to interfere with other people's growth), but all in all it was more annoying than anything else.

On it's own, this game fails for me.  It does all the things that I just don't like in games: high chaos, little/no strategy, attack the leader, effectively eliminated players, "Take that" system with crazy cards, uncontrollable scoring.  But, I can't help but compare this to the far superior, near identical game Castle.  Castle is better in every way because it has a deck strategy, constraint in how cards are laid, fun midgame goals, achievable scoring, and to my mind a better theme (though this is just fine).  In Infinite City, all the control rods are taken out and players are just whirling dervishes slicing everything in their path, Castle has more control, but because of the resistance in the system more well thought and fewer arbitrary decisions.  The risks are clearer in Castle and you can plan accordingly, in IC anything can happen before it is your turn again, so why bother trying to assess anything.

This is just not my kind of game.

Love the artwork, and that's about it.  Way too random and chaotic, in my book.  Those that get Power Stations really can dominate, since those tiles are invincible and everything else is not.

First Impresiions

A pleasant change from Carcassonne. I liked the one play but i have serious concerns about balance. A stella opening hand tile draw could just about win you the game! I hope that play testing ironed this out. The game play does feel a bit chaotic at first, but i quickly learnt to keep some tiles as responses and others as offensive. However the ability to swap hands negates that.

After five games

A luck fest. An opening hand that lets you play 3 or 4 tiles is a winner.

Tiles that lets you pick up five, or swap hands or play from other players hands are too powerful and prevent any but short term tactical play.

Only rated a 3 because it's popular with causal gaming friends

Truly terrible luck fest

Single 3-players game. Chaotic smack-the-leader tile laying game. Great, chunky, tile. Good artwork. Despite fears, you only need to read (most) tiles when they're in your hand, not when they're upside down on the table. Not bad, but apparently quite expensive. I'd be wary of playing this with more than 3 players, though.

I love tile-laying games, and this is not exception.  I really like how it's basically an area-majority game done with tiles.  There's a lot of chaos going on here so you need to stay on your toes and keep your options open.  I think it's likely best with 2 players although 3 seems reasonable enough.  Any more than that and things will get messy very quickly.

This is a tile laying game.  The goal is to score the most points by the time the game ends.  Points are scored by controlling groups of 3 or more connecting tiles or controlling special tiles with a victory point value on them.  Each tile also has special rules that allow you to do special actions such as move tiles around, alter the control of tiles and many other things.

This is a pretty fun game.  The game swings back and forth between different players as tiles manipulate different parts of the already played board or even other players' hands.  This is best played with at least 4 players, and can handle up to 6.

There is nothing to this "game."  While tile placement and control games can be fun (see Carcassonne), this tries to make the tiles do things (like cosmic powers or magic cards), but fails.  The tile mix is very limited (each of us drew the same few tiles several times), and the only things that stay put (and serve as a solid base) are the Power Station tiles, which you get randomly.  So it's all luck of the draw, allows for very little planning and control, and what the tiles do is just not that interesting. Not even worth it as a filler -- save your time unless you're really into mindless screw your neighbor games.

It's hard to avoid a comparison to the cryptic Ur, but Infinite City is far easier to pick up and learn. It's also less interesting.  Infinite City needs a much greater variety of tiles (an expansion existed on day one?).

The excitement level is low, but the table is impressive once filled with that huge cityscape.

Worth trying.  It's quick to learn and has a satisfying play length.

It's a tile placement game where you try to control connected tiles and tiles with their own victory points.  What makes the game interesting is placing a tile gives you a one time use ability that may impact the ownership or placement of other tiles.

If you have a game in which tiles (or cards, or whatever) are drawn randomly, and some of them are much more powerful than others, it's really best if you provide some sort of balancing mechanism. Maybe the powerful tiles don't provide a lot of points compared to the others. Maybe you have resources and have to spend more to play them. Etc.

Designers who like more chaotic games with a lot of "take that" action will sometimes design games without this kind of balancing mechanism, with the idea that the players are supposed to balance things. Generally, a player getting too many powerful cards or tiles will get beaten on to compensate. This is not my favorite game dynamic, but that's a matter of taste. It can certainly be made to work.

Infinite City doesn't do either of these things. The tiles vary widely in power, they cost nothing to play, there appears to be no inverse correlation between power and victory points, and beating on the player getting more good tiles is highly ineffective. For one thing, many tile effects are fairly limited in scope (unless you get the good ones - but we've been over that). For another, there are tiles (the Power Stations) which lock down areas for you so your opponents can't do anything to them. I recommend drawing several of them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Infinite City is a hybrid of Carcassone and Sim City with tile instructions.  There is reasonable variety here with 20+ tile types (each with different instructions) and 3 ways to score points.

essentially a tactical othello (note i called "Day and Night" the same thing)-  your choices are based entirely on the variable power tiles in your hand, and you're trying to put your "owned" markers on as many tiles as possible.   

it becomes uncontrollable chaos at 5 and 6 players,  the tile effects are too large (and some are distinctly superior to others), so you're just praying your board position vaguely resembles what it was on your prior turn.  may be more acceptably strategic at 2 or 3 players.

a few graphic design issues as well, the borders mush together a bit much-  it would definitely have been beneficial to have the silver-ring cards more distinctly silver,  the power stations more identifiable, and the tiles with point values have a bright or distinctive signifier around/as the point value.

A pretty fun game, fairly chaotic with lots of messing with each other, fair warning there.  You're basically just playing tiles and drawing tiles influencing the city in front of you trying to connect chains of buildings while preventing chains from others.  It plays up to 6 pretty nicely.  It's hard to plan when it's not your turn because so many things on the board are being influenced nonstop, but it makes for a solid, low-key "Beer and Pretzels" game where the gameplay isn't inhibited by table talk.

With a name like Infinite City, I would expect this to be the pinnacle of a gaming experience.  I mean, the word "Infinite" is right there in the title!  This is a game that will be played forever and ever, and will have an unending supply of materials to provide an infinite game.  Unfortunately, the reality is far from the advertisement, since this is really a tile placement/area control game that suffers from a lot of chaos due to some CCG-like elements that accompany each tile.  With some tweaking, it might be more to my liking (say, only being able to hold one of a type of tile so you don't get bogged down with multiple copies of a do-nothing tile), and yes it's true that playing with fewer players eliminates some of the chaos, but even still, random lucky combination draws will favor one player.  So why bother?  There are better games to play.

But really, they should have called this game "Finite City"; since there's a specific endpoint of the game, it's certainly not infinite.

Didn't look like much when I opened it, but it's awesome!

Chaotic, almost fully random tile laying game.

A good game that plays quick, is easy to teach and had some depth. This is a game that would be good to have in the collection as a gateway game for non gamers.

Theme has little to nothing to do with the mechanics.  On the plus side, it supports six players and plays relatively quick.  More plays needed!  Update: given away.

This will click with someone somewhere. It's not exactly bad, but everyone kind of plays tiles and then there's a result. Originally I bought it for the player count. Donated.

A light, chaotic, tile laying game.  Won't be for everyone, but for a 20-30 minute game, it's a lot of fun.

A good end of the night filler.

Just got this via a BGG auction. Great game. Action reaction tile placement. Very good 2 player.

Eh, it's okay, but seems a bit random without nearly enough depth.

Properly randomizing the large amount of tiles is very difficult and time consuming.

Great artwork and good tactical gameplay.

The worst tile laying game I've ever played, bar none.

It's completely tactical and draw-dependent, and supports aggressive, full-frontal leader bashing.  And that's with three players.  With five or six, Infinite City - Odin save us - gets [i]worse[/i].

I'll fake menopausal hot flashes before I play this game again.  If necessary, I'll pad my body with chemically activated hand warmers to seal the deal.

Pretty good tile laying abstract city building game. I played a 2 player game and it was close. Like a lot of 2 player games, it seems as if it would be close most of the time.

Nice mechanisms but the power level disparities of cards leaves it feeling a little too random.

Interesting game that I suspect I will like more the more it gets played. Knowing what the tiles do will improve it as you'll begin to see how they interact better over time.

This is a decent filler game.  I think Scott was right that it would turn into chaos with more than 4.  3 is probably the best number, but 4 work as well.

More than 3 is no good - total chaos with no strategy.

A solid tile laying game with some action chaining and a bit of take that.  Trying to simply group your tiles together was interesting enough and a good change from the typical area majority you might expect in this sort of game.  Luck of the draw might be a little more prevalent than I like since the tiles have widely varied powers in terms of usefulness... but an enjoyable way to wind up or down a game night for sure.

I like the various powers but Infinite City is far too random.  The only strategy seems to be to try to score for the tiles themselves, since no one really pay attention to what's on them besides their abilities.  Attempting to go for the biggest group is a huge target and more often than not won't get you the points you are aiming for.  Game has a huge problem with balance as well.

Very little planning, but a cool concept. I like the art, but wish that there was more space given to it on the cards, rather than just a third.

RATING: 5.5
It's kind of interesting, but it doesn't really strike my tastes well, what with constantly needling one another, and the the highly tactical, go-with-the-flow nature of it all.  I do like the strategies one can employ with the power plants and some of the building combinations, but on the whole, you just have to use the tiles you get.  If you get nothing aggressive, and your opponents do, they can cut you to ribbons while you just try to string stuff along.

Love the illustrations.

This game is rather interesting. With a larger number of players, you have very little control over what others do to you (the Capital is impossible to maintain without excessive preparation). There are effective ways to mitigate damage to your scoring, however. I like the multiple scoring "branches". The game does have some dependence on tile draws, but again, this can be partially mitigated by good play.

abstract city builder.  quality cardboard and easy rules.  only major complaint is the cylinders tend to tip and roll when you move tiles, cubes would be better.

Whilst not the most challenging game , it is straight forward and a reasonable experience over 30 minutes.

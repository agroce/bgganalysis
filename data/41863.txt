A&A is either your bag or it isn't.  I really enjoy the revised ruleset but bemoan the lack of player cards, inadequate number of chips, & missing full-sized battle board.  However, the minis are nice.

Solid game, but I like the 1941-board much more.
If you enjoy the style of game, you should instead buy  the 1941-game (maybe 2 copies). 
I bought the 1941 as kind of an expansion to 1942 (using both minatures, but 1941 board and most of the 1941 rules). That works very good.

A great version of this game! I find it more balanced and challenging than the original and revised game. It also solves some of the stagnant issues of the previous '81 version, offers new units and board areas, and has a few new rules to improve realism. Though it is one for true gamers, A&A definitely has a somewhat quick learning curve. Also the miniatures are top knotch.

Epic! There's no other game so simplistic (not in rule terms, but in mechanic terms), with not so that difference from other dice based conflict games, that good.

The 8 ours I pass playing it are always really intense, with total focus given to the game and nothing else in mind. The game is so entertaining, and it takes you so deep into the game itself, that you can't think about anything else while playing it.

And though its a long and intense game, every game feels really mind refreshing!

Don't know what the complaining is all about.  Good value for the price point.  The board is very pretty (THANK YOU, ART DEPARTMENT, for the naturalistic colors--no more "oceans in the black of night" effect!).  The Shermans still look terrible in the front (this is a re-sculpt?!) and the British are still sailing around aboard Fletcher-class DDs but the new Soviet ships (BB, CA and DD) are the best sculpts yet.  The board areas are adequately sized almost everywhere.  I don't miss the play money--we never used it anyway (well, hardly ever).

After Anniversary, it was odd not seeing Italians, and the Royal Navy and USN both seem under-represented in BBs on the starting-deployment cards, but overall it looks like a fine revision.

This is a version for more advanced players, that already understand fully the basic concept of the game. I would recommend playing this game with someone the same level as you, or, if you are new to this version, with someone that is willing to work with you. It will take a bit longer to play with more pieces and more territories.

Enjoyable game but a MAJOR time commitment!  I have played A&A games in excess of 8 hours!  No not every game is that long but if you aren't willing to put in 4 plus hours there is no reason to put this one on the table.  Frankly I have other games that I like better that play a lot faster.

Probably one of the heaviest games I own in terms of a rule-set (more than Exodus: Proxima Centauri, I think). It is nostalgic for me because my uncles used to play it in the early 80s and I thought it was so cool with all the plastic minatures. If people like RISK and play more complex video games, they might really enjoy this. For me, there are too many other games I would rather play for a historical war game (Memoir 44 or 1775: Rebellion). For now, I'm keeping it though.

Επικό παιχνίδι, αλλά λίγο απρόσιτο...

Επίσης, χρειάζεται μεγαλύτερο χάρτη από αυτόν της συσκευασίας. Προσωπικά, έχω φτιάξει έναν διαστάσεων ..χαλιού, από μουσαμά, ώστε να παίζεται άνετα :p

Yet another Axis and Allies Variant.  Gameplay is similar to other versions, and nothing is particularly noteworthy (good or bad) about this version.

RATING: 9
This one ranks high because it is descended from the game that drew me into the gaming hobby.  The gameplay is vastly improved and players are less likely to fall into the same pattern of plays (as we did in the 1984 version).  Revised/updated rules, introduction of destroyers /cruisers / artillery, and expansion/redesign of the game map all lead to an enhanced experience.  I am not a fan of the decision to omit funny-money and 3D industrial centers from this edition, but I raided my old A&A game to supplement these.

Very axis favored game. Comically ahistorical in Germany's huge unit and production advantage at the start of the game compared to the Soviet Union (against whom they could never even reach parity with) as well as their turn 1 almost guaranteed victory in North Africa (lol, what?). Japan is similarly poised far too well in Asia and the Pacific and will inevitably win the game for the Axis every time as it takes all 3 Allied powers all of their focus to simply contain Germany. Requires an allied bid of at least 11. Game board is too small and causes excessive fiddliness.

Japan messed up in the beginning so we stopped when we met a time limit. On the second game the US and Britain lost all their transports throughout the game from sub attacks. No land units could be brought in, the US almost lost control of LA, Britain lost all of Africa and the Middle East, and Russia made the biggest incursion into Germany. The only thing Britain managed to do well was economic attacks against Germany. Once the allies started losing it was just a downward spiral, there was no recovery to be had. I don't plan to play this one for a long time or ever again. There's too much luck involved for tactics to be effective.

TL:DR: perfectly good starter A&A, but there's a reason its only ~30 dollars

Baby's first A&A. I bought it for approximately 30 dollars, and its a perfectly passable axis and allies for the money, esp. if you are not familiar with the franchise. But as someone who (via friends) has played nearly every iteration of the franchise, the quality of the '42 edition (cardboard chips, barely enough units to fill the starting placements on the board) pales in comparison to the other titles in the series. If your just an average person who wants a nice little wargame to play on occasion, then feel free to pick this up, but if your a hardcore A&A player, stay away from the '42 edition unless you want it for collecting reasons.

This game will make a great addition to the AA family. While this is the first game I've owned, I've played almost all of the other versions - except Guadalcanal. The new rules for pieces, and the newer pieces (from AA50) are very insteresting and add a good flair to the game. The lower number of victory cities too is something that will bring the general public into this world. The game does need some extra components if you are playing with experienced gamers - more chips are almost a must, but they are easy to find and cheap. I go back and forth on having vs. not having the actual paper IPC's, I don't think it hurts the overall quality of the game though.

I really enjoy playing A&A in all it's various releases, can understand why it's not everyones cup of tea as it can take a very long time to play and often you know the result a few turns before the end (which could take a couple of hours to get through).  Prefer to play with 2-3 players than with the full 5-6 (depends on the version) as downtime can be painful.  People complain about the dice causing luck to be too much of a factor but I've found this adds to your decision making and does represent that in war nothing is a sure thing.

I used to play this game with my room-mates every other weekend. The barrier of entry is a little high (the rule book is very long), but if you are into war games and history then this is a sure shot. I am not a fan of the lack of money & fewer chips. However, the price is right for this version, and the inclusion of the anniversary rules make up for this.

First: Very good for what it is. More involved than Memoir 44 but not has time consuming as regular Axis and Allies. However, rarely want to play because it has so many parts, takes up a lot of time. I wont be suggesting it. I wont often agree to play it because i dont to be bogged down by one game very often. by BGG Rating standards, this falls between "a good game" but not so high as to say "usually willing to play if suggested. Ive Rated it accordingly.

Axis and Allies brought me into the War gaming hobby. Yes there are many more "realistic" games out there but I still have tons of fun playing it. I still play with a group (4 seems to be the right number) and 1942 is my favorite version. It takes a while I know but I enjoy the company and table talk in the game. I will clear my schedule to play any day of the week.

More sophisticated than Risk, which appeals to me. I've been waiting my whole teenage life to try this game. Turns take forever and it's hard to find friends who will commit to a game this long.

What I like:
Reliving history. The game starts in a rough depiction of the world in 1942. It's great fun to try out some of the historical military strategies.

This iteration of Axis and Allies can be seen to strongly favour both sides in different respects and generally comes down to luck to decide who wins.

A string of solid dice rolls from Germany can more or less end the game in the first few turns but this is a rare case. The version also feels tactically limited as starting fleet deployment encourages only one or two options per faction which drives the rest of the ensuing game.

for the ones out there who like ww2 themed games with more tactical depth then lets say risk.
very tactical game with a good dose of luck but not so much that it ruins the game.
its a bit on the long side though with some fiddly rules.
and off course the board is WAY to crowded (especially Germany) .
but altogether well worth every buck considering all the components that come with it.
very amusing (somewhat long) version of risk.

Perhaps I've been spoiled by more recent games in the genre, but on both of the occasions I've played Axis & Allies: 1942, I've found it to be an aggravating experience where pure luck determines the outcome of battles and wonky imbalances rule the day.  Whereas in real life, the battles of World War II were more often than not determined by skill and clever planning, A&A reduces it purely to a numbers game.  The more guns you bring to a fight and the more powerful those guns are, the more likely you are to win.  Infantry proves to be near worthless with a pitiful attack and defense value which then makes it impossible to play a historic USSR game.  Also the lack of a health value system for units makes it so that tanks and planes can get one-shotted by riflemen and the battleships you spent ridiculous sums of money building and time moving through the ocean are felled in a one on one engagement with a destroyer.  While not impossible for these things to happen in real life, their occurrences were rare at best when in the game, stuff like this happens every battle.   With rules like this, it also invalidates any other military strategy besides Blitzkrieg as your only hope of victory is to swarm the enemy as early as you can.  This is great for Germany which starts with a pile of units in continental Europe - the highest concentration of victory points in the game might I add - but sucks for every other player.  Just to give the game a semblance of balance, my friend had to consult with the internet and come up with his own house rules which drew heavy inspiration from the combat system of Star Wars Rebellion.  With that, the game has improved and the social aspect makes it more fun, but I wouldn't really recommend the vanilla game to anyone who isn't dying for a WWII military strategy game.

This game goes too slow. I wanted to like it so badly, I even printed that huge map by ImperiousLeader which was EUR 80,00. Three plays. Play 1 with friends: about 5 hours, we all had 2 turns. second play went a little faster, with 3 players, took about 4 or 5 hours, USA was almost ready to fight when we had to stop! Then one more time with my girlfriend, about 4 hours.... nothing happened...

Its just annoying to place all pieces, and see them move back and forth without anything really happening... slow slow slow....   out-dated gamemechanics.

Ohyea, lets not forget that the board is so tiny that not even half the playing pieces needed could possible fit on this board... its just a laugh

RATING: 8
I'm a long time A&A fan, and overall, this version is great.  However, the components of the new game leave something to be desired.  

The new pieces and new rules for 1942 are great.  The addition of victory cities is a positive change, and adds to the strategy of the game.  Destroyers, cruisers, and artillery add a level of realism to the original.  Additionally, the new strategic bomb raid rules are good changes.  

The problem with the game stems from an attempt to achieve a lower price point.  This version lacks IPC’s (the money of the game) so players keep a tally sheet.  Additionally, the game does not come with enough chips for regular play.  Finally, there are no chip trays in the box, so all components are thrown in the box after play and your next game day begins with 15 minutes of sorting.

Correcting those few problems with the components would results in probably the best A&A version yet.  It’s a shame they tried to save a few bucks.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have the first edition of 1942, and must say I was impressed with the improvements made to the 2nd Edition enough that I may trade in my old one for the new one. Most annoying is the IPC board wasting about 3" of space at the bottom of the map; moved to a small stripe across the top (Arctic) in the new edition. Still wish there was a separate IPC and battle board is sorely missing. The battle "strip" works, but it's cheap and should not be found in such an august and beloved game as this series. Because of these shortcomings, we prefer Europe and Pacific to either the 1941 or 1942 global games.

RATING: 5
Light strategic wargame with a focus on combined arms and concentrating your attacks. A&A 1942 refines the 2004 edition further with additions and rules adjustments (e.g. cruisers, removal of research, no transport combat capability). I think the changes are almost exclusively for the better, but then many of them could simply be house-ruled into a previous edition, and it's not like it's a different game or anything.

Lighter version of the big combinded Europe and Pacific 1940 games. No motorized infantry and no normal bombers. As there are far less territories it plays quicker and the luck factor is a bit higher, as 1 or 2 important battles lost can easily mean game over. Still takes about 4-5 hours to play. Unfortunately there are no harbours or airfields, otherwise its a great strategy game.

In short, if you're looking for an edition of Axis & Allies that covers the global theater in one box, this is the edition to get. Skip the 2004 revised edition.

The price! With 2004 revised edition costing nearly twice as much, this edition shines on prices alone. But that's not all it has going for it.

Very nice components. All new game piece sculpts that are done very well. For instance, the German fighters now look like Bf-109s, the US fighters are P-38s. 

The map: The same size as the revised map board with the following differences...In terms of teritorial layout, the map is basically similar to the 2004 revised map, but its more photo realistic, and looks very nice. Some minor differences include the area near Alaska/ Western Canada. On the revised map, you could get to Western Canada from several sea zones. On the 1942 map, Western Canada is less accessible, as it doesn't share a sea zone with Western USA. The 1942 mapboard now also includes the IPC chart for tracking nation IPCs. This makes the actual map play area slightly shorter than the revised play area.

IPCs: The game still uses IPCs, but they no longer supply paper notes to keep track of IPCs on hand, and these must either be maintained on paper, or you can purchase some paper notes from thrid party game piece suppliers.

The game adds a new piece, the 'cruiser', adding to fleet building options. Transports are now more realistically defenseless in situations where they don't have a retreat option, as their combat value is now '0'.

There are no rules for acquiring technologies.

The old 'battle board' has been replaced with a new guide.

Overall, a very nice edition of Axis & Allies, at a very affordable price compared to the other editions. Well worth picking up.

A&A 1942 is an updated rules set that aligns well with A&A 1940 and A&A Anniversary Edition.  It replaces A&A 2004 Revised edition.  It changes a number of items from A&A Revised and all for the better in my opinion.  I would argue this rule set is the best version of A&A in terms of reasonable play length. Skilled players can complete a game in 4 hours.  

Transports cannot be taken as damage and do not block movement.  Subs do not block movement.  This is much more thematic and changes the strategies.  This really opens up the game.  

I played this again after a long hiatus and I must admit, it is still a great game.  I cannot wait to explore this set of game rules further.  I am even mulling whether I want to put this back into my top ten.

I like this game very much. I like those small pieces. I love aircraft carriers and it happens during my games that I build more of them than I really need - just becouse I want to set fighters on it.
But after several games I have a feeling that there are too many "obligatory" moves each side must perform in particular turn to get maximum of profits. Experienced player usually performs very similar moves in his first turn. Re-playability seems not to be very high.

Essential a cosmetic update to A&A Revised. This is the classic Axis and Allies game. Definitely a must-play-at-least-once-in-your-life game, though not everyone will care for it. While I prefer A&A 1940 Global in terms of strategic depth in a world-wide game, this 1942 version is much more playable in real life because of the faster gameplay. That said, I greatly prefer the theatre-specific versions of A&A: Europe 1940, and the original Pacific.

This game is a very fun game for those who are new to the Axis and Allies games. It has many, many parts and rules to it but all of these rules make the game more fun, last longer, and more fair/realistic. It is a fun game to play over and over with friends, but if you have other versions or have played other versions you may find it to seem boring. For me it is a fun, fair, and replayable game that your friends will have a fun time playing with you.

Good version of A&A. Too bad the board is quite small (1sr edition)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really enjoy this game, the game length is the only thing against it for me. There is a single caveat that I should make here. I was introduced to A&A by an ex-naval officer (non-com I think, sorry man I forgot your rank, but I thank you and your brothers-in-arms for your service) who had a unique method to play the game. Anytime I play I keep things always on the edge of the seat by using his method of play, even players like me who like shorter games will come back for more. Play with multiple sets, allied powers on one board and Axis on the other and add a person as Game Master. The GM keeps up with where everyone is and aids the rotation of turns. Each player has Line of Sight from his units and unless he has direct LOS on his opponent he can only guess at the location of the enemy. Still, with the game length I must admit I have to be in the right mood to play this game, our last game (5 players) lasted 8 hours, yes, that probably has to do with the "Fog of War" but I just can not think of playing any other way. 6/10 for game length.

The game is way too long for what it is. I really want to like this game and maybe we just did something wrong, but after playing 4+hours of seemingly repetitive moves and then Japan losing a lot of forces in the pacific, they just surrendered and no one even wanted to continue playing. I give the game a 5 still because I would still try it again although maybe reluctantly.

Seems as though the designer has been able to streamline his product through the years (I've owned the 1981 and 2004 editions also, although I've never been that enamored of the game to play it a lot). 

The rulebook is easy to follow and it's just a matter of going through the steps, in order, for each player. Although not a brain-burner, there is plenty to think about, as production is limited and real estate won must be defended. The board is on the small side, but not impossibly so, and it's a tradeoff as a production that's obviously intended to be a bargain, given the relative quality of the components, mounted board, full-color rulebook, and so on. 

The only adjustment I made to the map was to buy a set of fine-point markers and use various colors to outline the borders between some of the smaller but busier areas on the boards, because the borders as printed are too light to be distinct, which makes it difficult to distinguish borders when such areas become crowded with playing pieces. 

The game design does what it sets out to do, so I'm not given to bashing it for what it isn't to me personally. It has earned its generally agreed-upon status as a contemporary classic, in the same sense as games like "Ticket to Ride," "Carcassone," "Scotland Yard," and "Settlers of Catan." People who want something more certainly have many choices beyond these, but their contributions should at least be recognized. My rating of "7" is not so much how I feel about the game, but that it's a seminal design that has stood the test of time as its designer has added to and refined it. 

Purchased new at local B&N, using a coupon, November 2011. Sold at GenCon 2014.

This game is soooo long and boring. Its like an upgraded version of Risk. The battles are all completely random (i.e. rolling die to hit) so you can lose an entire fleet due to bad die rolls.

Very little strategy is involved in this game. In fact, I actually WANTED my team to lose so the game could end.

don't like the attacking dice rolling mechanic. Feels to much like work. my plane vs your infantry so I need a roll of 1 to hit your plane, oh wait a minute let me pull out my attacking reference chart to see if this is right....lame....kinda wish it was more like risk. just keep it simple.

The game plays quicker and that is a plus. The board could have been a bit bigger (putting the IPC chart off on the side). The artwork is much better than that awful revised version. 

We had no problem with the lack of (play) money as we would simply record how much a nation had remaining after his spending. I believe this actually saved time.

The minor rule changes improved the game (in my opinion). 

Now that we can complete a game in one evening, it will hit the table more often. 

Finally, a $30 MSRP is great as it put A&A in reach of many more players.

Actually the 2009 version is Spring '42 which is a good effort but was updated and overhauled by 1942:2nd edition, which is perhaps the 2nd best A&A version on the global conflict scale next to Europe&Pacific 1940. 1942:2nd edition has it all in one box, great map, lots of great minis and the excellent A&A gameplay!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
good effort but I felt that the revised(2004) edition was just as good, obviously a lot of people must of felt the same way because 1942-2nd edition came out a few years later and completely outstripped this version, better map, better production quality, overall better. Spring 42 is now a good gateway game for the price alone, I still recommend D-Day or 1941 however

Some of the stuff happening in this game makes very little sense historically.

Whilst not historically correct, the feeling of achieving goals that your real-life counter part didn't, make this fun.  For example the German's having a carrier in the North Sea.
This is a game that I need to be in the right mood for, due to its game length and is prone to AP.  More players the better as part of the fun is in discussing team tactics.

[3 plays] The tweaks in this version when compared to A&A Revised do not make the game drastically different, but you do need to treat transports quite differently. I still consider 2004 A&A to be the best version -- a 9 for 2 players, and about a 6.5 when played face to face multiplayer. Much in these versions is the same, so if you want my full opinion, go ahead and read my rating comments for A&A Revised (2004).

Most recent play completed 12-30-10 with Garrett.

I am 1-0 with the Allies and 2-0 with the Axis.

Extremely fun game.
Turns can take quite a while, and the game is very lengthy. As such, I don't get to play it near as often as I'd like (only a handful of times at this point).
Thus the 9 is for sheer fun factor and potential.

(9/12 update) Finally got this on the table. First thing, the map is way too small where it matters most. The gameplay, a more granular take on Risk, gets a bit tedious after a while (like Risk). Still, I'm keeping this for the nice bits, and I actually scored the early 80s version on eBay for its map. Maybe I'll frame it. 

(3/10) Found at Target on deep clearance. Not yet opened. I wasn't necessarily looking for a global grand-strategy game, but I've been wanted this since a kid.

I don't need much more than this for a passable war game experience; there's plenty to think about as you play, but never so much that you can't just start fighting and let the chips fall where they may. But the game, in any version I've played, simply has the ghastliest ergonomics I've ever encountered in a board game: naval pieces are incredibly difficult to differentiate, the board spaces are comically small for the unsightly junkpile of plastic they need to support, and by providing the absolute bare minimum of components, the publisher guarantees a ton of extra fiddlyness. I'd play it again with counters, but not until then.

I rate this lower than the original, which is a shame.  It tinkers with the original, primarily by adding in new units, but all the major problems of the original remain.  It would have been nice to see a few minor rule changes.  It would be better than the original if it wasn't for the fact that they left out the IPCs, which are a necessary component.  You can substitute Monopoly money or whatever, but leaving out a core component is unforgiveable.

Needs another play to rate, looks like 6-7. In our first game the setup & early part of the game took forever.

This is a rather simple area control/light wargame, multiplayer, with a world map and the 5 major combatants of WW2. Has an amazing amount of minis that brought back some happy childhood memories of playing with those 1/72 figures :) The minis by the way are really lovingly sculpted - a Soviet battleship really looks like a Soviet battleship (and not that many people know how they looked), not just a random hull with some stacks stuck on.

An excellent A&A experience. This is my favorite version of the game. It has the depth to give a rich war experience, and is still playable within one sitting (though it may last a few hours).

It's a much more detailed version of Risk themed and tailored toward World War 2. But, it's also more than that. Axis and Allies does a lot with very little. 

On the downside, I think it takes too long to play for what it ends up being (much like Risk) and the miniatures make it look to me like a kid's toy and not an adult game. They are also very fiddly, as the board quickly becomes a mess and the varying size of different areas make keeping things straight a challenge.

the game:
there are too many dices, even if it's possible to win through superior ability,
but there is a bigger problem that prevent a player to win with his abilities: fixed setup, fixed teams, fixed startup possibility.
the game is very long, but it has a very low longevity
I dont find this game to be challenging, or fun, and I dont find reasons to play it again.
It is also to be said: with more than 2 players, the game start to slow down, btw it is impossible to end a match in only one evening/night

the package:
there are a lot of soldiers and miniatures, they are very much... thousands.
unluckly, for this game, they are too few, and you will discover yourself playing with cardpieces with written "12 infantry" "4 tanks" "3 torpedoes" 'cause miniatures arent many enought.
Also the map is too small, so it's hard to play and unawfull to see.

This is for the SECOND EDITION. Great table top war game.  It not as grand as 1940 global but still large enough to require you to think strategically.

Very well balance, in the bests of A&A series, maybe the best.

 Better than A&A anniversary edition, I guaranteed.

Best of the modern A&A games. A&A 1940 global is the ultimate experience, but you will hardly find players to compete with, which is not the case with the 1942 version which play fast and doesn't include pesky new complicated rules.

Great addition to the series I  really enjoy some of the new units and rules but the board is way to small.   It is playable however and we enjoy it enough to not need to buy the revised 2nd edition with the bigger board.

I have been very bad this time, I know. I dont rate game I dont like, but I made an exception for this. With so many Axis Allies games series, I did not find any need for creating this one.
BUT this is my opinion, and I prefer more complex game.

RATING: 5.25
Ameritrash gaming at its glitziest.  Lots of sculpts that can't even begin to fit onto the board, obscure rules hidden in a monstrous rulebook, and a requirement to a prodigious time commitment.  Fun, but not something that can be done regularly.

My replacement for my long lost '81 edition.  I purchased two copies cheap online for the extra pieces.  I have also printed out and laminated several visual charts and references to help things flow smoothly as well as acquired a used copy of Monopoly so as to re-purpose the money for A&A.  It's a good thing I did too.  The first game went very, very well, but the charts and reference and paper money were an immense help in playing, and I do find myself a little ticked at Hasbro that I had to bring in such extras that really should have been an official part of the game.

On the other hand, I very much like some of their other little changes and additions to the rules over the years, especially to the navies.  In particular I like the introduction of Destroyers and how Transports can't fight at all now and need to be protected instead of being used as cannon fodder as they once were.  My only other complaint besides the lack of paper money and needed charts would be the size of the map.  It looks so pretty, but everything I'd read online about the small size of it being a problem is true.  The Europe portion of the map in particular is especially horrible.

Игра конечно долгая, миниатюр много, им тесно. Но очень сильная тема, эпичность. Вобщем если есть время, и желательно 5 игроков - можно рекомендовать.

Смотреть мой обзор.

--- Кстати почему 5 игроков лучше? Еще пример.

Допустим я все время играю за Германию, а мой сын за СССР. Я могу легко придти к какому-то варианту, который буду повторять раз за разом каждую партию. Учитывая кубики - получатся будет не одинаково конечно, но в целом может даже сложиться впечатление, что успех всей игры зависит именно от кубиков.

Можно конечно меняться местами, но это не слишком изменит ситуацию. Куда эффективней посадить за игру 5 человек - в этом случае утрачивается полный контроль над происходящим даже если все время играть за одну страну - а значит и две партии имеют меньше шансов проходить одинаково.

On Saturday my friends and I played the new edition of Axis & Allies. First off, The conditions for wining the game have changed from capturing enemies factions capital to victory points from capturing and controlling 9 or 12 total cities (depending on which victory option decided) in this new edition. Also in this edition there in no money and special weapon development involved and Factions income is determined through territories IPC. 

[b]Income[/b]
Industrial Production Credit (IPC) is used as income to purchase new units and is conveniently located at the bottom of the board. IPC points are listed in each of your factions controlled territories. 

When the game starts you have no income, therefore you can not deploy units till your next round.

Starting IPC's and order of factions play
Soviet Union   24
Germany        40
United Kingdom 30
Japan          30
United States  42

[b]Phases[/b]
The Order of play is in 6 phases: 
1) purchase units 
2) combat move
3) conduct combat 
4) noncombat move 
5) mobilize new units 
6) collect income

The cost, move, attack, and defense per units is conveniently located under the mobilization zone at the right hand bottom corner of the board. The mobilization zone is where you place purchased units from phase 1.

[b]The Board[/b]
This board is smaller than the original game board and is displayed according to geo-political territories on land and sea territories then compared to the original edition. The board is displayed nicely in a GIS map style with faction markers compared to a color-coded factions style map board. The board is divided into smaller territories and seems to work for some factions verses other and will be mentioned under the faction's section. There are neutral territories on the board that can't be attacked, entered, or flown over, hence they act as buffer zones between faction's located on the board in 
[b]Asia:[/b] Mongolia, Turkey, Afghanistan, Himalaya, Saudi Arabia, 
[b]Africa:[/b] Sahara, Mozambique, Angola, Rio de Oro,
[b]Europe:[/b] Switzerland, Spain, Sweden, Erie, Iceland, 
[b]South America:[/b] Venezuela, Peru, and Argentina

[b]Factions[/b]
I would have to say German and Japan have an easier chance to win in this edition. Usually, Germany gets defeated in 3 rounds in the original edition when we play and Russia has a larger buffer zone where you can fortify with troops, however not in this edition. 

Germany has a larger starting force in smaller boundary sections, hence easier to fortify. German starts out with the second highest income, 40 IPC, which helps its large army to become even larger. Germany's territory in Eastern Europe is smaller than the original board, but its forces are still larger compared to the Soviet Union, hence its way easier to conquer Stalingrad and Moscow. Germany's Northern Europe territory is smaller, but The Soviet Unions northern Europe/western Asian territories divided into two sections, which makes the Soviet Unions campaign harder to defend.  

Japan starts out with 30 IPC and Japan's starting units are more compact with the new boundary sections on the board and have a larger force in Southwestern Asia, hence it is easier to conquer England and America Asian territories. Outside of Japan's 8 IPC, Borneo and East Indies has its second largest IPC with 4, hence this is where the major conflict needs to be. Its Eastern Asian territories are only 3 in French Indo China, Kwangtung, Manchuria, and Philippines where the Soviet Unions eastern territories are only worth 1 IPC. Its outer islands New Guinea and Okinawa have 1 IPC and the other islands have 0 IPC. So Japans strategy is forty Japan and conquer Australia, India and China all easy targets. Only the Soviet Union has a strong force to contend with, but if Germany puts up the pressure and conquers industrial territories in the east a territory in the west with only 1 IPC does not cut it in placing an industrial complex on.  

The Soviet Union still is a lost cause. The Soviet Union starts out with 24 IPC and now has smaller sections in Eastern Russia to contended with; hence spreading out the army compared to the prior edition where the sections are larger creating a larger buffer zone between Moscow and Berlin. The Soviet Union only starts with 1 naval unit (sub), and in Western Russia the territories only have 1 IPC each, so building an industrial plant to produce 1 unit per turn is futile. 

England's starts out with 30 IPC, but England's territories are too spread-out with small units, so 30 drops significantly before England gets to attack. Australia is still a lost cause in this edition with only 2 IPC and 3 infantry to support. If you can capture and with stand attacks on the East Indies with its 4 IPC for 2 to three rounds and build an Industrial complex there, your in good shape.  

America has a tougher time out in the pacific since the water sections are divided into smaller portions and a lot of the outer islands have 0 IPC's, so acquiring more IPC's in the Pacific is tougher. If you can island hop and capture the Southwestern Asia Island territories (totaling 12 IPC) your in good shape. In the Atlantic America has to invade northern Africa due to the overwhelming German presence in Europe, so following a strategy similar to historical events will help in America's campaign.

Special rules for navel combat like sub sneak attacks, planes can't attack subs unless accompanied by destroyers, and subs can pass through occupied sea zones make for interesting outcomes in this edition. The more sea units is also a plus in this edition due to their IPC values to obtain, hence more units to deploy. Regarding land units, Tanks with their new blitzing rules are still the staple in a better chance in your campaigns outcome. The special supports Infantry rule also helps by increasing attacking infantry to 2 or less instead of the usual 1 role so attacking with on infantry and artillery gives you 2 rolls of 2 or less compared to the solo infantry attack of a 1 or less roll.

To make this game better we suggest the following rule changes:
1) That Eastern Asia Soviet Union territories be given hire IPC values, maybe 3 per territory.
2) Hire IPC value to Australia so and Industrial Complex makes sense to place in that Territory.
3) Large English Presence in South Africa
4) Starting Industrial Complex in Eastern Canada.
5) A larger Soviet force in Caucasus territory.
6) Starting Industrial Complex in Kwangtaung territory.

Overall we liked the game and its new rules and rate it an 8 since it plays better than the last game we played, which was WWIV.

Better map than the original, both in graphics and in territory (the Sahara should never be crossed). Little reason to obtain the older version, as the new units in this version create better strategic options and game-play.

Great classic game, but it does suffer from a long setup, play, and then tear down time. This was a favorite of mine while I was in high school and we'd all get together and play it on a Saturday afternoon, but I've found it's getting harder and harder to get it to the table because of the time involvement.

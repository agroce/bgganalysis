A pale version of Acquire.  The game really drags mid game.  While it has an interesting take on Acquire, you can clearly tell that this game did not have its mechanics polished before production.

With some heavy tweaking, this game could be enjoyable.  Definitely not worth a king's ransom though.

It appears that no matter how much people admire the design of a game, it needs something extra that isn't easy to quantify. A great design can compensate for its absence, even turning the heads of people who aren't naturally drawn to a certain game. But, I suspect, in the end, it can never quite hide that it does lack the magic ingredient. Some people, quite rightly, will always stand by the superior design, marvel at the cleverness of it all. And wonder why other people, for equally good reasons, have dropped off early on the admiration scale and somehow went, without reservation, for for the obvious uglier, spotty little brother with the glasses.

Madness. Or is it?

The key word is fun. And for some, it doesn't always go hand in hand with greatness.

I have noticed before I would line up Sid Sackson amongst the greatest game designers without hesitation, but I'd be hard-pressed to come up with one title that I'd really want to take with me to my desert Island.

It has never stopped me from admiring the Sackson mind. But it does make me glad that people like Wolfgang Kramer are big enough to pay tribute to the master, as this is my [gameid=5] sweet spot. Mister Kramer reworked a classic, and come up with a probably inferior variant that somehow - to me at least - put the fun sparkle back in. If I ever have a choice of desert Island, I would swim to the one with the Kramer games, even if I had to dodge a shark or to en-route.

I like and admire Acquire, but I get far more pleasure when this comes out, and suddenly I am not the least bothered by the luck of the draw or that the way company values work when someone invests, doesn't quite make sense if you think about the theme. Suddenly, it matters not. Technically, I even prefer the area manipulation of Acquire over the linear set-up of [i]Big Boss[/i]. But somehow I get an equally big kick manipulating this type of "grid".

And, to me, it all adds up to a bigger thrill overall. It seems it doesn't matter that the cards influence smaller areas, or that it maybe is more abstract than thematic. Making the most of the cards given, and manipulating the blocks and mergers, is still the challenge. Maybe even a bigger one.

I love the initial stages in which you struggle to squeeze any income out of the few cards that you have, and yet you know that passing up on buying any shares is likely to cost you dearly. So do you add to someone else's strength just to get some capital? Perfect dilemma.

Keeping the cash flowing is essential, and since early stock buying is equally crucial, that's a tough task. Part of the road to victory seems to be buying stocks that have a good chance of releasing their (added) value before the share piles have all dried up, and actively working towards that does help. The alternative, adding value to other people's interests purely to release some cash, is far less desirable, but utterly unavoidable. making for some interesting decisions.

It is tempting to believe that the final mergers of the big companies are crucial, but since most companies will have reached their maximum yield, it is little more than cashing in your inevitable chips early. With no shares on offer, you're simply cashing in VPs already secured. The real gains are to be had from merging smaller companies, growing the one you have shares in. It is easy to get distracted by the sheer size of the companies involved, especially if they were heading towards their maximum value anyway.

The only disappointing bit is the end game, in which the right cards that have no real "company level" effect, can still add 50 very easy VPs to your total. When people are forced to play cards, it is also the phase in which your medium company can suddenly explode onto the scene.

There are a lot of subtleties that will become apparent even after one play and few decisions are trivial. It all adds up to very rewarding play, and tremendous replay value.

Combine that with a 3D game that looks fantastic, even if the Company Value track can get totally obscured by the towering office blocks, this is one game I am glad I splashed out on. 
It won't convince the biggest Acquire fans, but it is surprising how many people have played both, and have fallen for the charms of this unassuming sibling.

It would only get closer to challenging fun perfection if it had a slightly more flexible merger mechanic. I do hope that the remake,[gameid=29610], is picked up by someone soon, as it seems to address the only thing that stops me from rating this much higher.

Comparisons to Acquire are obvious. I don't much like Acquire, and I didn't like Big Boss either. A little too luck dependant, a little too long, and mostly boring - either you have the cards or you don't, or you luck out guessing which company will be the most valuable.

All in all, nothing here of interest for me.

I dislike the "it's just like xxx" game comparisons, but this one really is just like Acquire, but without the mergers. Well, OK, there are mergers, but they don't have the same "wealth creation" effect as in Acquire, so they aren't the same game-altering events; plus, you earn at least some money with every tile play, so there isn't the mid-game cash crunch. This is very much a lesser sibling to Acquire in my opinion; getting the right tiles is even more critical (as if it weren't critical enough in Acquire). Still, it's a very different underlying economic model to Acquire, and it is a little shorter and the strategy is more straightforward, so I think it'll be a worthwhile addition to the game collection for intermediate Acquire fans. Is it worth $80-$150? I'd have to say "no" - it's certainly no McMulti, which goes for similar sums - but as these overpriced collectors items go, it's certainly not an egregious ripoff, and if $150 isn't a lot of money to you I'd check it out. I'm not buying, though.

RATING: 5
Neat game, but seemed to rely pretty heavily on luck of the draw, especially toward the end of the game where those lucky enough to be able to add/merge to the big companies can receive some high payouts.  I think Acquire does this theme much better.  Great bits!

RATING: 8
An enjoyable Acquire redux that I like more than its predecessor based on appearance and overall playability. Mergers happen a lot less often in Big Boss, and they often aren't quite as make or break as they are in Acquire either as the main component in being successful in BB is simply investing early into some good corps and then expanding them whenever possible, and as high as possible. Many people get caught up in the merging of the larger companies, but the winning margin is often created when two small to medium sized companies mix it up and grow in unexpected ways. Of course, because of the way corporations grow with the etage cards playing as wilds it is rather important to have a partner or two in your corporation. Ideally it seems that one wants to try and get an even or slim majority stake in one or two big corporations and then ride them into the win column. Predicting which corps are going to end up being the big 'uns is difficult though, and where the tough decisions come in.

Meaningful control? Well, it can sometimes be lacking in this game, but I think part of the skill to playing this is knowing when to stop buying stock and when to start loading up with cards instead, as controlling key plot development cards is the difference in causing successful mergers and making the most on your investments. That said, if someone gets a mitt full of etage cards then they'll definitely be in a winning position in this game, so I might consider working on a variant that seeds them out to players or somesuch. Still, I don't think it's really necessary, this game is meant to be lighter weight, and I think it works nicely for what it is.

Fun title, I don't think it's worth it's current price for anything other than Kramer diehards, but I like it a lot.

Note: I played this game quite a few times with the original rules, but I find that I enjoy it more using the Kramer Variant #1 where there is a face up pool of 8 cards to choose from and the option of buying off the deck remains as well. This leaves the significant luck factor of having nice cards turned up into the display, but it seems to mitigate the "I'm buying a card and I pray I can use it" thing, at least to some degree. It also makes it a bit easier to set up power plays where you found a cheap company directly adjacent to another one with the express purpose of merging them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Definitely an Acquire variant, but with considerably different gameplay thanks chiefly to the elimination of the majority stockholding element and a radically different board layout.  That being said, Acquire fans will either balk or love it.  I think it's terrific and I find that it's a little easier for me to grasp, for reasons I'm not quite sure.  Awesome production, we'll never see anything like this again.

RATING: 7
Rating has dropped with repeated play.  Seems like the winner is the player who buys the right cards from the face down pile.  In other words, if the card you buy happens to be in the mega corporation, it will be worth 45 million to you (50 less the 5 it cost you).  If the card you buy isn't part of the big corporation, you lose ground to the others.  Granted, there's more to the game than this, which is why I still rate it quite high, but the inevitability of the mega corporation and that random bit of luck of the card draw (buy) keep it from rating higher.

On initial inspection it looks like a fancy Acquire but it actually plays nothing like Acquire and is it's own game. Just wish I had picked it up when it was list price. I came back two months later and it was gone, they back ordered it but we all know how back orders and out of print games work out. It's a game that needs the players to be able to bring a little meanness so not to be played with the get-a-long gang.

An enjoyable game with lovely components, a nice quick pace, and interesting decisions weighted toward the early game.

This is a solid stock market / tile placement game, but I dont think it lives up to the hype.  I played with 6, and I think my dislikes here would be FAR less prevalent if it was played with less players.  With six players, control of mergers was fairly luck-based.  That isn't a big deal, and is to be expected in a game where card draw is so important, but you can either get screwed or crowned if a card you need is at the bottom of the deck or in the back of your opponent's hand.  Overall I liked it, but there are better stock games out there.

To give it a fair shake, I'd like to play with less than six.

I was happy to play it, due to its extreme rarity. I have some frustrations with Acquire, mainly the luck factor in tile draws and early mergers. I was hoping that this would fix these problems I have, but it didn't really do that at all. Money was more free-flowing, but the game still felt quite clunky. The best part are the huge, overproduced pieces that are pleasurable to draw out of the bag and place.

Feels like a main course game, yet plays in 75 minutes.  Really quite great.  I know this is a derivative game, the author says so in the introduction - it is Wolfgang Kramer's homage to Acquire.  But I just love how this game plays.  Turns are swift, developments on the board chug right along.  Players have to keep an eye on when the game will end, but need to simultaneously do a few different things.

Classic game by Wolfgang Kramer. Quick, easy and beautiful pieces. The only minor point is the luck in the initial draw of cards. If you don't have any of the cards to build higher floors, then you'll most likely lack the money to stay in the stock buying race (which is one of the main elements of the game). Deciding when to merge which companies is crucial (but also depends on having the "right" cards). Similar to Acquire.

RATING: 6
Although there are certain similarities to Acquire I prefer the original Sid Sackson classic.  It has more depth and options.  The one knock against Acquire is if you don't get involved in a early to mid game merger your game can often be all but over.

Big Boss to me feels less tense.  At the same time the game is certainly more relaxed, gentle, forgiving and more family orientated.  As such, a few people in my group prefer this to its big brother.

Having building cards is power especially when a few companies are approaching a value of 50 million.  Being left out of the end game certainly can be frustrating so ignore card buying at your peril.  

The latest incarnation of Big Boss seems to have two seperate building card stacks... one for plots and the other for etage or level cards.  The level cards cost 5 million more (i.e. 10 million to purchase).  This may be a slight improvement.

I need to try this a few more times before giving it my final verdict.  The bits are pretty enough.. But the ownership poles could have been flashier... :-)

I found it hard to really do what you want - way moreso than Acquire for example. If you happen to have good cards then you get lots of money, and if you buy cards and they don't mesh up with the current board then you lose out. *shrug* it was interesting in several ways, but ultimately I didn't love this game.

Light and engaging take on Acquire.  This game is all about getting in while the getting is good. You aren't shooting for majorities other than just trying to get a bigger piece of the action.  The game is simple but totally engaging as at a certain point it really makes sense to add to the mass of companies that you have no interest in as your participation can really earn you some serious dollars.  

Knowing when to spend for the tower and new cards is what this game is all about.  It's painful though as you really want to buy stocks while they are still available.

This really needs a reissue.

This was a decent game. It's similar to some other games I have, so I haven't bothered to try and pick it up. I'd play it again. Nice game to look at too.

Fantastic game to play. Easy to teach. Have not had anybody complain about this game. A lot of fun had by everyone who plays it.

Although similar to Acquire, it's still a bit different.  Your incentive to be a majority stockholder is much less in this game.  In fact, it seems the ideal position is to just get about three shares in every company so that more people will buy into it and thus more people will have incentive to make it grow.

Great game.  I really wish it was more available.  I enjoyed it far more than I did Acquire.

I love this big goofy game with the honking big plastic city-building nuggets! The tension as you build each turn is great, as is the mystery of who's going to climb in bed with you and pump your stock to untold heights. Well worth the disgusting amount I paid for it.

This was an interesting game. A few more plays would help. Apparently we had an odd game.

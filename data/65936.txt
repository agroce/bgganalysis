RATING: 10
Another great OCS game.  Great challenge for the Germans to exceed historical results.  Lots of tough decisions on every turn for Germans and French.  Supply on a long narrow string with lots of tense moments.  Only 13 turns, but they are long turns (2+ hours).  This is one I will play through a couple of times to try different stategies.

Another OCS monster game - only this time on the Western Front.
Very tough challenge for the German player to achieve the historical result in the campaign game.
German advantages of motorized/mechanized formations and airpower can be negated with tough terrain, numerous and often good quality opposition forces and an even tougher timetable (only 13 turns in the campaign game!)
If the Germans win initiative on turn 2, they can prosecute a Meuse river crossing at Sedan (and possibly other places) and attempt to replicate the 'Sichelschnitt'. Forcing the Allies into a mobile battle is key. 
If initiative goes the Allies' way, the Ardennes option will likely have to be ruled out in context of time required to achieve the breakthrough, and German player will have to be nimble to make radical changes to his game plan.
Personally I think the game lacks a meaningful strategic/operational 'surprise' effect (i.e. French forces in the Ardennes too well prepared/strong, too easy to redeploy Allied forces) - nevertheless, its a great game!

Another great OCS title, this time at the smaller end of the scale. It's 2.5 maps and only 13(!) turns. The mini campaigns are all great 1v1 scenarios and the full campaign plays well with 3 or 4. It feels somewhat different from other titles in that supply is much less constrained and the pace of operations never lets up. It's rare for a side to give up the opportunity to move first in a turn, whereas in other titles I need a good reason to opt to go first.

Playing a game of this at the club and also preparing my own copy for extra practice. Counters are the worst quality I have ever seen, horrible printing and cutting, but no problem with maps or graphics in general. Must have been a one-off event for MMP as no game I have bought from them released after this has had anywhere near this poor quality. But the game looks interesting enough and looking forward to seeing the campaign unfold.

Excellent game, that gives a lot of insights on the campaign. It's a smaller than many OCS games on the east front. Yet it's a big wargame.

For a change, the Germans are not given extraordinary superpowers. And the allies are not plagued with plenty of penlties.
All the details of the campaign are elegantly incorporated into the various unit ratings. Which shows the quality of the system.
It's very challenging for the German player to reproduce the historical result.

I just regret that the campaign end on june 10th. Especially as this game has significantly less turns that others in the series.

Part of the OCS collection, unsure whether I will ever play it though due to the scripted nature of the Allied response, which if it is lifted means it is not a game winnable for the German player. Thus conflicted about the game.

Raise rating from 8 to 9.
This game is the best OCS game to date.
The size is about right. More playable than the its east front cousins.
Even lower counter density than Baltic Gap.
The 'panzer feel' makes this game better than Burma.

[i]We at MMp are dedicated to perfection and customer satisfaction is our number one[/i] ... blah blah blah

I paid 95 Euro (123 $) and found one countersheet so badly cutted that is useless ... how they control their products?
I know they'll change with a new one but I must wait how much to play the entire game? No comment.
First time I'm so disappointed by MMP, hope is the last.
After the worst counter-cutting procedure of my last ten years, disappointment archived, I'm starting playing this mid-monster and THERE I found MMP as I know!
Interesting scenarios, easily playable and fun! Looking now at the Campaign ... that's very very interesting.
I'd recommend the German INITIATIVE on the second day, historical and balanced, and even so he has to work hard to win!  ;)

[i]There is someone, really, that reached the German VPs (minor or major)?
Please send me THE solution via bggmail!!!
This game seems, at least, unbalanced in Allied favor ... he's too reactive and too ... aware of the German's intentions![/i]

Finally, a big West Front game.  The idea of exploring the "Blitzkrieg Myth" hypothesis in an OCS game is fascinating.  Certainly the German player has no easy time in this game (supporting the hypothesis).  The counter die cut and printing quality is surprisingly poor compared to the previously published OCS games.

The Germans have lots of toys, and, unusually for them, lots of supply to run them.  But their usual trump card - a serious action rating advantage - is out of their hand here against the better British and French troops.  Not a walkover by any means - the Allies can launch a wicked counteroffensive with proper planning.  The Holland scenario is a good training game that uses most of the rules but not too many units.

On my 2nd play and this is so far the best OCS title for me as a learner. Supply is manageable, the Panzers have a chance to roll and the Allies have some fight in them.

The OCS supply-bound combat and mechanized movement fits well with the nature of the France 1940 campaign, so the system plays well.  The setup leaves you looking at the results of the initial Anglo-French push into Belgium.  After that though, the constraints imposed in the name of flawed French doctrine don't impede you much.  Slow French armor does, but not enough to stop a massive coordinated armored counterattack on the German armored spearhead as they exit the Ardennes.  Only well handled German air power (interdiction and disorganizing air bombardment) can do that.  Of course, the German would also like to use air power to ease the panzers' way through the Ardennes.  Quite a conundrum for the Germans.  From the French side one feels like a francophone Guderian who has just inherited a rather nice armored force from an inept predecessor.  I like the resulting balance much better than other France 40 games that force you to KEEP being dumb just because the historical French command was.  It may not be history, but it's a great what if and a good game.

OCS heads west for the first time.

The situation is very challenging for the German side:  it is a long way to the Channel, with lots of Allied troops and some tough terrain in the way.

I love the way OCS respects the firepower and manpower of large, sluggish infantry formations (the Soviets in GBII and Case Blue; the French here) through high combat factors, whilst recognising their doctrinal and training weaknesses through poor action ratings.

That means the Allies are not pushovers, but have to fight through their disadvantages to win.

Probably a must have for anyone interested in the 1940 campaign.  The scale choice seems to work very well. I expect replay value to be quite high.  Would be interested if any variation could save the Allies from a huge defeat.

the open terrain starkly illustrates the problem of the movement mode being waaay too high. French action ratings too generous, and ability to coordinate arty and multiple divs not realistic (granted my limited knowledge of the campaign). where is the French panic and confusion and doctrinal failures?

This is a tough run for the Germans, since there's no way to recreate the overwhelming strategic surprise of attacking through the Ardennes. The Allies almost inevitably try to defend the natural defensive line running from the river Meuse and the Dyle Line. This is the last natural obstacle before the open fields in France, so if this line is significantly breached the Allies will be likely be defeated. The Dutch haven't a hope of saving their country—their combat values and action ratings are just far too low—and it's just a matter of time before they surrender.

There are some significant realism issues with this game, probably made to keep the game competitive instead of a one–sided affair. The French and Belgians are significantly underpowered, whereas Trevor Dupuy's research shows the Germans were only slightly more powerful on a one–to–one basis and were actually outnumbered by the Allies (excluding the Netherlands). Army Group B should've been unable to break the Dyle Line without the breakout of Army Group A into the French rear past the Ardennes. The French are allowed to deploy and disperse their cavalry in the Ardennes during setup, serving as road blocks to Army Group A, whereas in history they didn't know an attack was coming and lacked anti-tank weapons.

Karl-Heinz Frieser's research shows that it was above all severe doctrinal and command and control deficiencies that caused the collapse of French defensive lines. This included falling back when even a slight penetration was dealt, for fear of a flank attack according to trench warfare practice, the inability to issue orders in a timely manner (e.g. some command posts didn't have radio, whilst others relied on carrier pigeons), and extreme French incompetence. There's simply no way to replicate this perhaps greatest of military disasters without binding rules on command and control. [b]The Blitzkrieg Legend[/b] doesn't even attempt to apply any command and control limitations.

Most egregiously, the counter density in this game is atrocious. Multiple tweezers and a very steady hand are required to play this game.

RATING: 10
Amid my first campaign as one of three Allied players vs. two Germans.  The Germans have great advantages but hard-fighting Allies with some luck in initiative rolls can make this tough for the Bosche.  We'll see how it plays out but great fun so far.

After campaign play: This is excellent.  If the Germans don't risk strat-moving masses of units in the first couple turns, don't cry about not duplicating German historical success.  

This is the game I always wanted to play.  The French have lower troop quality, less supply, are initially scattered all over the map, but if you fight well and carefully you can hold the Maginot-Meuse-Namur-Gembloux-Brussels-Antwerp line.  The French must risk precious units to delay, must withdraw at the right moment, must protect the precious and powerful French mechanized and armored divisions, and must vigorously throw the Bosch back over the Meuse if crossed.

A wonderful gaming experience and only OCS puts the proper limits on what you can do and when and where with the supply restrictions.  OCS requires you to accumulate and pre-position supplies and use them judiciously.

Unplayable if Germans don't win initiative in turn 2 or 3. Too easy to slow them. Meuse river is crossed too long after schedule to have any chance to win.

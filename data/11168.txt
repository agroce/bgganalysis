Painted two armies for this miniature system.  I use this system for WWII minatures because there are so many gamers using system; unbelievable product support; rule books and supplements are worth collecting just for history and pictures; fast play.  Remember though, it is a game and not a simulation.  Rewards combined arms tactics.

I finally built my german grenadierkompanie and played the game.  It was a good time, there are still the little issues of minatures dealing with movement and what is visible, concelment, ranges... issues that are more black.white in board games.  Also, now that I have an army I also need scenary, another issue that is in the box for a boardgame.  

That said, I love the scale and feel of the game.  The pieces look great.  The flow of play was easy to us by the end of the game.  I look forward to playing it again.

RATING: 6
Great minis. Expensive yet unplayable 'out of the box' as you will need other players and eventually more minis. Thus the buy and buy syndrome. 

The system is just not WW2. Felt like WH40K with the wrong minis. 

Rated purely for the minis and it's range for collectors.

Far too many moving pieces in a game that, for the most part, is move and shoot. My friends play this one, so this is the one I play, too.

RATING: 5
Beautiful miniatures, but a bit on the large side. This leaves little room for manoeuvreing, especially when your playing area is limited.

Furthermore this gamesystem adds little to the miniature games I played in the early 90s. There are many exceptional rules not in line with the main rules. I didn't dislike it, but neither did I enjoyed it.

More thought:
* Not inexpensive (A businessmodel or a gamesystem?)
* On board artillery is a bit odd at this scale
* why have extended data on divisional level, while you can't play at this level.

RATING: 9
Probably the last great miniature-based war game I played.  Very elegant system, the scale is fantastic, not much more to say.  I simply no longer have the time or funds to keep up with this branch of the tabletop gaming hobby, sadly.  I highly suggest this to anyone looking for a WW2 themed minis game tho!

RATING: 7.5
I have everything needed (and then some) for a 2 player (British vs. German) game.

Models are beautiful and this game really scratches the "I wanna play army, but I'm really too old to play army" itch.  Is there really such an itch?  I seem to have one.

Anyway, despite the relative simplicity of the base rule set, there are a lot of details to remember, which makes it a bit of a pain to play.  E.g. The rules for assaults are unbelievably rigid and complex.  Considering how important assaults are in this game, that makes for a lot of aggravation.  Of course, a lot of it may have to do with the variety of possibilities in a miniatures game.  If you can avoid being too anal about the ruleset and use common sense for unusual situations, the game plays very smoothly and is quite fun.

I played this one time, and it was hard for me to get a good feel for it.

I like the theme, and love the miniatures.  Also the rules seem pretty good.

But it seemed like dice rolling was a HUGE part of gameplay.  I mean, for a lot of situations, I was throwing HUGE amounts of firepower down, and not killing anything.  I just didn't like the way that felt.  Whole units went the entire game without doing anything because of it.

With that said, I'll probably revise this after another game or two.  It's got potential, so we'll see =).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
I suspect many that have called these "the best miniatures rules" have not played much else but 40k & Warhammer.

Kind of cheesy, some little gimmick for every army.  The rules are made to sell figs.  Come on, why is the division artillery on the board?  Oh I have to have this uber cool unit that can do this or that.  Oh look at that, some assault guns just appeared out of nowhere, they must have been under that speck of flock a few inches from my platoon of tanks.  Every other month they want to sell you a supplement like GW does.  You are better off with Blitzkrieg Commander where you get everything in one book.

A lot of the figs are nice except a bunch of the infantry have the same pose across different nationalities like the wooden looking leader with a hand in the air.

The support site is pretty good.

The up side of having a FOW army is that you can use it with about a dozen different rules.

RATING: 7
Complete and balanced WW2 company-level action with an emphasis on competitive rather than purely historically-accurate gaming. Very well suited to events and tournaments, although it can be played quite enjoyably by those who prefer purely historical match-ups as well. FoW has the distinction of being one of the few games that has enough of a following to allow you to drop into shops across the world and be able top play a game without encountering dozens of house rules or home-grown work-arounds for rule shortcomings. The rules have been extensively playtested, and work well (although some are cryptically worded.) For some reason, Battlefront is reluctant to provide a comprehenive index, so getting started can be slow going. If you can accept a degree of abstraction that allows a company level game to be played in a couple of hours, deal with IGOUGO turn sequence to speed head-to-head play, and get past a few annoyances with a D6 game, it is a lot of good fun. The complaints about pushing models and points-based lists are off-target. You can play with any miniatures (6mm work well) and you can use completely historical OOB if you prefer. Everything still works just fine.

Gave this one or two preliminary plays as a German Panzergrenadier force with Tiger tanks attached in support.

I play U.S. Airborne, or rather I should say I purchased U.S. Airborne [HBO's Band of Brothers made this choice easy].  15mm scale is a bit too small for me to paint (have a lot of figures still in a primed state).

Playing a lot after a hiatus due to lack of opponents.

I really like this game, well designed missions keep the game fresh, plenty of opportunity to mix things up and play around with your force.

May not be strictly accurate as a historical situation, but I like that each force has unique special rules, as it provides more game to game variety.

Both fun to play, and creates interesting decisions for the players, even if they are game based rather than historical based tactics.

RATING: 8.5
Great game, pretty well balanced.  Rule seem loosely based off WH40K, but better balanced and adjusted for a WWII setting.  My play group uses Micro Armor (6mm scale) and doubles movement and fire ranges for a more realistic feel and to avoid the "tank parking lot" phenomena when playing with the normal stock sized models.  Very ideal game for someone looking to get out of the GW tabletop minis and honestly its a better rule set and models are considerably cheaper (even more so with Micro Armor).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Though it suffers from some of the same flaws as the (by now) quite dated Warhammer ruleset, Flames of War is a competent rule system that makes more sense as a game than as an historical simulation.

Don't expect historical accuracy and don't expect your favorite tanks or weapons to be truthfully reflected.

Instead, expect a fairly well-balanced action-oriented Saving Private Ryan of a game, with a bit too much randomness, no reactive fire and factions that are balanced rather than accurate.

Expecting that, you won't be disappointed!

It's expensive, and like any miniatures system you have to work to assemble and paint an army. If you come from a boardgame background this can be a shock.  Having said that...

Great looking minis to paint and collect, and a nice set of rules to put all the pieces into action.  The rules are streamlined with many abstractions but I like how it all shakes out.  This system is a whole hobby unto itself with lots of things to buy and paint and plenty of info online to dig into.  

Highlights:  Tweaking your army 'list' and testing it on the table to see how it works. Sort of like deck building in a CCG.  Lots of replay and options here.  Throw in a couple of tanks and remove the mortars and play again to see how it does.  All battles and army lists are bound by a points system to keep things manageable.

All the combined arms elements you can fight with, Arty, transport and airpower.  All have nice models that function in the game.  

All in all a great product if you're a WWII minis fan!

  Although I'm primarily a boardgame player at this point, I find that having a miniatures system  working in the background is good for the soul. Painting is relaxing, and there is always another idea to try...

This is an above average set of WWII miniature rules, both clear and complete, which generally produces a fun game. But, unfortunately, it does have problems. 

1. Basically, there are a number of somewhat fiddly bits. That is, there are unnecessary and unrealistic rules added, apparently, for marketing reasons. For example: save rolls. I'm not a big fan of the "save" die rolls, as there isn't any good reason for them as far as I can see. For instance, say that weapon "A" hits 60 percent of the time. Therefore, in a D6 system, we can say it hits on a 1 through 4. And say defender "1" saves 50 percent of the time against weapon "A." Fine. Now let's imagine that there are 6 attacks. In this case, weapon "A" should get 4 hits and defender "1" should then get 2 saves. So, in the end, weapon "A" got just 2 hits in 6 attacks. Well, why not cut to the chase and just say weapon "A" against defender "1" only hits on a 1 through 2? What's the difference? 

In other words, when a 6-gun artillery battery needs 5 or more separate rolls when bombarding (the to range-in attempts plus to hit, to re-roll misses, to save and firepower), while there are only 3 possible outcomes (kill, bail-out or miss), one could say that the rules may be easy but they are not terribly elegant.

2. Turret-less artillery pieces can fire in a 180 degree arc and not be considered to have moved.

3. Also there is no opportunity fire. So tanks, for example, can run from one concealed position to another without the possibility of being hit in the open. It's a variant of the old "Panzer Bush" problem from 1970.   
 
4. Assaults can get too involved, as their complexity level is just out of step with the rest of the rules (there are a possible 13 steps to an assault). 

5. As it's all based on a 6-sided die, weapon systems are hard to differentiate. 

6. Another annoying factor, is that while each player buys his army with points, 2,000 points of Russians buys you a whole lot more than 2,000 points of Germans. Now, I understand that that's the historical scenario they want to use. But this generates unneeded difficulties for any player who is creating his own scenario. After all, what exactly makes a level playing field?  

7. This system has the famous "clown car" rule. In an emergency one jeep or even one motorcycle can transport an entire platoon! That must be some emergency. 

8. The ambush rule gives the defender a tremendous advantage. I'm talking a "teleport your reserves practically anywhere on the table" type advantage.  

The bottom line is that as a simulation of actual World War II combat this system can only be given a "D," but as a game with a World War II theme it earns a mark of "B." So which is more important?  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a good game sadly being hurt by following a Games Workshop marketing plan.  One that even Games Workshop has abandoned as being counter-productive.

Also, it's probably the least historical of the WWII miniatures rules sets out there.  It follows the Hollywood image of WWII more than the reality.

Despite its flaws, it's a fun game to play, and if you live in the US, it's the easiest historical miniatures game to find opponents for.

Good light war game for those interested in a "Miniatures Game with a World War Two Setting".  This game is not accurate.  This game is not a simulation.  IMHO, there are better and cheaper alternatives in both figures and rules available.  Main reason I give it such low marks is because cosidering the above the games can and do drag on way too long (6 hour+ games not being at all uncommon) and it can be very, very expensive with the many, many books.  Actually sold off two armies in 15mm because of these rules (reason #1-the lame-o's in my area will not think of any other rules in this era scale now and #2-these same lame-o's have no concept of value since they pay Battlefront prices and I was able to more than double the $ I paid for my old figures, that I bought painted)

Played a demo game at a con.  What I didn't like: It was way to easy for armor to move and shoot.  The stats where to similar for most of the stuff.  The d6 didn't give enough variance.  A HMG shooting against the rear of an open top half track had almost 0 chance of doing anything, yet a squad of SMGs could rule a side of the field.

the most played tactical miniature system for the 2WW out there. 
Played a lot... at conventions and tournaments. 
Simply stated: an interesting simple attempt at modeling the role of infantry post 1WW. 
But when you add the afvs the whole thing falls apart miserably.
really a pity, there are good and simple ideas in this design.
try rapid fire for a better game or command decision/battlefront for a simulation.

Third edition... Raised rating because this is a serious attempt at producing the definitive tournament ruleset.

Love this game! Has lists for pretty much any theatre, and allows great gameplay. I'm a big fan! I actually play this in 1/72 rather than 15mm, and for a long time played solo although I have found someone locally who also plays in 20mm so it's been a lot of fun.

Highly recommend this game!

Detractors point to "historical inaccuracies" but I have yet to see so-called accurate games of any form from said detractors. Flames of War has plenty of historical authenticity compared to MANY other wargames and I would highly recommend it. Great fun!

I didn't care for this one.  It's a giant marketing gimmick complete with 'army of the month' to force you to buy new stuff.  I honestly will never play this game again.  I'm rating it higher though because it's open ended enough to play any type of battle you want, and not just the types of battles that historically took place.

Nice, easy game to get into and up and running!  Not dfficult to teach noobs and the variety in forces is nice.  You have to be careful....this can get to be like GW''s 40K or Fantasy if you are not careful!  A lot of supplements and minatures are there to feed anyones craving and can get out of control.  Focusing in on one era of the war is a good way to go!

I came over from Battleground WWII and like the differences this system brings.  If you have a chance to play at a convention, get in on it!!!!!
While the game does not promote deep, tactical decisions due to the results of die rolls, it is a very fun game...just not super serious.
People who play seem to not be 'rules picky' and just play the game which is what I really enjoy!

Flames of War is like comfort food.  It's not all that good for you and everyone overindulges in the choicest bits (oh look, more Tigers!), but it's convenient and there's something satisfying about all the sugar and sodium it affords.  You can pretty much remember how to play the most commonly used rules off the summary sheet, which is a very nice feature.

40k the WWII edition. For some they will like that it follows many of the same gaming ideas as 40K.  I am left cold.  The game takes awhile to play which I am not averse to, I just don't find that I am having that much fun.  I have a metric ton of minis for the game just haven't enjoyedf myself as much as I would like.  So I started using the minis for other games.  

Nice minis, just don't like the game that much.  Plus the fan boy mentality of many of the games adherents leaves me cold.

Worst miniature WW2 ruleset I've played by far. Main tactic seems to be to rush up and blast the enemy, since you move AND fire before the enemy get their turn. There is some sort of ambush rule to correct this glaring error, but an error it remains.
We played with 6mm. It was pointed out afterwards that the actual minis are much bigger and supposed to be to scale... even more stupid - tank combat on a football pitch!!!

Have been playing alot of FoW since 1st edition, mostly soviets. 

It´s an acceptable pulp-action-historical tabletop game. 

Can be fun - IF: 
* a rnd scenario is picked after force selection.
* alot of weapon-systems are left out.
* you play custom made scenarios with set forces.
* you always (!) play with obligatory "across the volga" rule.
* you boycott Waffen-SS players as potential neo-n a zis.

Otherwise the rules are working well i.m.o. - I´m not overly excited here.

From a historican´s pow it´s a (sad) laugh concerning gameplay, visual effects (= what you see on-table) and representation of historical to/e or oob or combat doctrines. 

It´s mostly stereotype unhistorically composed battlegroups fighting unhistorically evolving battles using unhistorical methods/game-mechanics. 

And: It´s historical/political attitude (Waffen-SS ueber alles, soviet-meatshields etc) is - at best - questionable, made for a broad anglo-american audiance.

So it ´s mostly like saving privat ryan: 
Silly and anglo-american pro-war propaganda (with deep respect for the Ueber-Waffen-SS to rule them all) in a comical style - but somehow it´s fun anyways. Don´t forget to bring the pop-corn!

If you are looking for a N a zi-Warhammer alt. with alot of players around - go for it.

If you are interested in military and/or general WW2 history and/or military tactic (or strategy) - try your best to keep it away from your gaming group and direct them toward better games (or 40k, better Epic!).

I´d say: FoW is historical wargaming for the not so educated.

I didn't care for this. Not true enough historicity. Much effort in modeling required. Expensive. Overall, I prefer WH40K for a brain-dead minatures game, as I think the Army Lists are more balanced. Painted armies always look great over the table-top, so I guess I'd play this in a pinch.

4th edition may have finished this for me. I originally liked it a lot because of the fast moving play. But every new version adds complexity without fixing the underlying issues which for me detract from the game.

What I really want is something halfway between  this and GMTs Panzer, or this with my pet issues fixed. Don't see that happening. 
Having said that, I'm glad battlefront is doing this because it brings players into historical miniatures who otherwise would not be there, and raises the standard for models.

After many years of frustration looking for the perfect set of WW2 rules, I've finally found a set that balances playability, speed of play, flavour and ease of understanding combined with superior production values. There are aspects of the rules that the rivet-counter and anorak bbrigade may take issue with, and the abstractions made by the author may grate with those long time historical gamers who must have specific multi-phase actions on the table top. However, the strength of this game is that the core mechanics are solid enough that bringing extra detail/complexity of resolution into the mix isn't difficult. 

The tradeoff naturally then is time spent playing as opposed to rules reading. Unlike many of its predecessors, one ends up playing one's opponent and not battling weith the mechanics. The rules set a standard for presentation that most other rules don't come within cooee of, and the online support of the publisher as well as the holistic approach to gaming that is promoted allows the complete novice to play within minutes of reading the rules without feeling overwhelmed. 

I'm yet to see a set of rules cater to both aficionados of the period as well as neophyte historical gamers. The rules in the couple of years since they have been released have genreated a renewed interest in WW2 gaming with the sight of father and son gaming becoming all the more common. A cross-over product in that it meshes the excellent production values of GW with the historical gaming world and allows people to get on with playing games rather than deciphering rules interpretations. 

I've not given it a ten as it is expensive by comparison with other sets and some of the decisons made in the name of playability are not my cup of tea, but this rating is purely from my point of view. Suffice it to say, I'd almost given up on WW2 miniatures gaming until these rules came along, there's no better recommendation than that in my book.

Played 3rd ed and found it comparable to 7th ed 40k, awful. Units teleporting into stupid places and calling it outflanking etc. IGOUGO with every unit before your opponent does the same and trying to mitigate that with the customary saving throws. A system of play that was dated in the 90's and brings nothing exciting to the 21st century. Lots of player down time and little reward. Poor.

Warhammer 1942. Ejoyable world war, although not the most innovative mechanics around. Every finnish guy must discuss about WW2 strategy and finnish army when drunk, so with this one you can show how things should have been done. And being a bit drunk doesn't actually ruin this game, as it's not that hard to play after you get the rules inside your head, just like Warhammer 40k.

Great game full of interesting options: every move (and every mistake) counts!
Don't mind who says it's just "WWII Warhammer", or that it's a broken game only because there's no opportunity fire: they never really played it and they don't know what they talk about.
The rules are a bit tricky at first but full of subtle mechanics, with a good balance between realism and playability. 
The more you play the better it gets. 
Try it with serious gamers and WWII fans, not those GW-style "I have the biggest gun" kids.

I would rate this game a (3) or (4) rating, but the (7) rating is because of the game's fast play and the use of a lot of nicely painted 15mm miniatures. Flames of War is a game system designed to play fast, but more importantly, its a game system designed to sell 15mm miniatures. Using nicely painted 15mm figures - my gaming group use figures that are painted as good or better than what you see in the 2.0 rulebook - GREATLY enhances the game for me.

WWII 15mm table top game.  Its been a few years now since I played and an edition, but I still fondly remember my games and still have all my armies and table gear.

I am not a fan of the way they market the game or the company that they are modeled after.  This is one of those games that you constantly need to be putting money into and the moment you stop, the game passes you by.

But that said, the tactics, feel and look of this game can be spectacular if you follow the effort of quality terrain.  However the game plays fast and has simple structure and good historical feel and color.

Read the rules and the Ostfront book and I have to say: Man, this is bad!
It devolves into a rush for the center of the board, since noone has to fear being shot down on the run.
I have seen games of this where paratroopers advance and then dig in at the end of their move. Repeat for 3 turns, then rush enemy MG positions with everything you got. Tanks pop up from out of nowhere, fire and disappear again without the fear of retaliation.

Nice minis rules - not very complex, reminiscent of GW. You can decide if you think that's a good thjing or not yourself.

Sourcebooks are fantastic. Could even be useful for other rule sets. Website is superb - or rather it was, the current version isn't anything like as useful as the old one.

Rating creeping towards a 9 . . .  OK, after a few more games the 9 is earned

And back down to an 8. The way Battlefront are heading with this, ie constantly redoing the books means playing this is getting expensive. Keep it up chaps and this one will be a 7 shortly.

This may be a slippery slope.

This is a really fun game if you can give it a chance.  Sure it is gamey, but it is fun and most things in the game make sense even if they are abstracted.  Building army lists is a blast and so is modeling and painting.  Sure it is a bit pricey, but so is any mini's game.  The models are great and have a lot of character.  My main gripe is the way some of the army books are handled. It kind of sucks having to pay $50 for an army book to only really need 30 pages of it. 

Anyways, I have about 4000+ points of mid war Italians and Germans so far so I have a lot of variety when it comes to filling out army lists. I plan on eventually making a Late War Soviet army, but Soviets are a money pit due to the number of minis needed.  I will have to save up for a while me thinks.  

The main drawback is there aren't any stores in our city that carry FoW anymore so the player base is limited and everything has to be bought online.

It can take awhile to finish a game, but is usually worth the time spent. I do late war German and only play this casually. It is a very expensive game to get into in depth.

Warhammer plops itself down and decides to screw around with World War II.  Like all Warhammer variants, tactics seem to devolve into a massive exchange of firepower, followed by a mad rush to a bloody scrum in the middle of the table.  Ugh.World War II miniatures games should look like what they're portraying, and FoW games look ridiculous.  Exchange the infantry companies for battalions in line or column, the positional artillery for muzzle-loading field artillery and the tanks for cuirassiers, and you'd have a Napoleonic game that looks much like a Napoleonic game ought to look.  That is not good.You're paying a very, very high price for color pictures (the minis aren't very well painted, by the way) and fluff - the actual rules content is pretty sparse, and there are no original concepts here.  Nothing new at all.  Mechanics based around a saving throw?  Come on.The minis are acceptable, and a good buy if you want a man-for-man infantry platoon with all facets of its ToE represented.  So grab a German and a Soviet platoon and go play "Crossfire."  Leave the rules alone.

If you want a fun, fast, and rules-friendly WWII minis game (and I do stress "game"), then FoW is for you.

The rule book is top quality, well formatted and easy-to-follow. You'll spend more time playing and less time checking tables, etc. The whole package is complimented by an excellent line of miniatures.

A word of caution though, FoW is not recommended for rivet counters and rules lawyers... it'll drive them nuts.

Fairly light and fast, but rules could be better indexed.  Light on realism both in tactics and results, but fun to play, visually apealing and really seems to have captured WW2 flavor.  Wide audience and web support are also appealing.  Prepare for a substantial investment.  I'm hooked, at least for the moment.

My score would be higher but I am not a huge fan of WWII games. I loved the game, but there are some holes in the rules that are not adequately covered. I have only played the Brits, and against the Italians and the Germans.

I played in a tank battle demo at SPIEL '12, and enjoyed the game just as damn much as I had expected. Unfortunately, the two tanks we received as thanks for playing the demo just scared me away from the game. They were tiny model kits, requiring plenty of assembly, much more so than I would like.

The game itself though, wow, tons of flavor and details enough for any WWII history buff to whet his teeth on.

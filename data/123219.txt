Is it Odd? Yeah, a bit. I guess.

But it's actually a pretty darn competent, interesting, and streamlined Euro game. It packs a lot of Euro into a little bit of game. Worth checking out.

Oddville is a game of placing workers to get resources to be converted into buildings (with special powers) that score points.  It scores no points for originality of concept.  On the other hand, it is a well-crafted design that ticks along at a sprightly pace and I have found it quite pleasing to play.  Then again, do not mistake Oddville for a highly strategic game; the town itself, the available buildings and characters with special abilities are all in too much of a state of flux for that.

The cards are nicely produced.  I found the artwork a mixed bag, with the buildings nicely done and the characters and player cards rather inane.

A card game where people collect resources in order to build the village. Each building awards you with VP at the end of the game and also grands you a character card with a unique ability. The game is easy to teach and play. Takes around 35 minutes. Kinda cute artwork. I cant find something new in this game. It gets repetitive quickly.

RATING: 5
While it does nothing new... it doesn't do anything wrong either. It ends up providing an interesting tactical puzzle where players are constantly looking for opportunities based on what others players do. And its level of engagement increases as guild-cards can be indirectly taken by others players actions. So, there is a considerable amount to digest in this medium-light game. 

Overall, I like it but it doesn't wow me. Component quality could certainly be improved but the game was quite inexpensive.

First Play: Mechanism is simple enough but play is at the mercy of whats left by the player to your right, the randomness of the card draw and the lottery of the other players actions. I know people who like this sort of emulsion of chaos, but I really dislike the Carcassonne aspect of the right tile falling at the right time. Not one I'd relish playing again.

This is a wonderful game.  I really feel this one flew under the raider, and I am not sure why.  I enjoy the method of resource collection.  I have 196 games, and none of my games has the same system for resource collection.  The game is quick, easy to understand, and quite thinky.  It is just wonderful.  It feels bigger than it is, which is a good thing.   I really do love games that are quick, but deep.  This one is a keeper.

Oddville is a pleasant surprise. I'd heard good things about it from others as a fast, light, worker-placement-type card game. It is just that and worked okay with 3.  I suspect it'd probably work with 2 or 4 as well. You play one of your 4 worker cards or build a building. When you build, you get points and other bonuses. One of those can be the favor of one of the characters. What's kind of neat is that the characters give you that benefit until enough of those types of building are built and all characters of a certain type get shuffled up and handed out again to the next group that builds buildings of that type. Also, those characters are worth points at the end of the game. It's all very quick and simple and well put-together for something fast.

A tactical and rather light euro-game that is a race to build 6 buildings.

The rules are unclear about bonus resources, but the designer confirmed in a BGG post the bonus resources are free (i.e., when you place on the spots with a cost, you pay nothing):

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/872465/building-bonus-obtain-resource-question

Carlo Lavezzi (designer): "Immediately after the Oddville Development action, you obtain all the building bonuses (the ones on the played building + the ones of orthogonally adjacent buildings connected to it by streets) for free."

When you first see the box, you will marvel at the charming art and the adorable characters inside. Little do you know the much meatier game that lies inside. At first you'll probably only worry about hand management and scoring combos with the building cards. But soon you realize that the adjacency bonuses and guild powers are what really fuel the game. Unfortunately, you can be heavily constrained by what buildings will actually fit on the board, and you often need very specific cards to place in very specific spots. All of a sudden, you find yourself juggling money, resources, special powers, scoring combos, and spatial positioning of the buildings... Remember all that cute art? Neither do I.

I thoroughly enjoyed this game and it is a must buy soon!  Pretty simple but enough going on to be fascinating.  Enough ways to grab yourself points without it feeling like a points salad exercise.  The cards are pretty and great quality. It's got some role selection, worker placement, variable powers, and even some spacial aspect to it. The scoring is cool at the end; each card might be worth more or less depending on where it is in the city and how others played.

I have played this twice: Once with my tiny table topper (age 5/6) and once with my wife. Both 2p games. My son really enjoyed it - he liked the city building aspect of it and how simple the mechanics were to be able to build. 
Trying to time Character card possession to have at the end of the game for end of game scoring is interesting. Choosing what action to take from cards with variable strength provides for some interesting choices and kind of reminds me of Dungeon Lords (when choosing your worker placement actions). My son really enjoys Dungeon Lords, which made this one easy to grasp.

The time frame was good as it played quite quickly. For now, everyone wants to play a few more times to keep exploring the game.

RATING: 6
A quick little thing featuring adjacency mechanics, resources, and special characters; all in about 20 minutes. It's simply about building cards with the proper resources and scoring points for them in a myriad of ways. Not an original idea... But the time frame in which it is executed is. It is as I said a very quick game, lasting no more than 20 to 30 minutes, and it's actually impressive that the author managed to get this amount of stuff into the game as he did. Yet, oddly, the game doesn't feel 'bloated', probably due to the fact that the mechanisms are quite streamlined.

So far I have only played several 2 player-games where it can be a a very quick and tense affair, hinging strongly on the characters in play. I am hoping that the game isn't so short (and the characters not that out of kilter) that certain play styles are not able to develop: to date I've seen lots of use of the Cheater which is a powerful persona in that he allows to skip an action at the expense of money. In my current inexperienced state this seems a good advantage which needs to be countered by either claiming the Cheater for oneself, or some other character... But I still need to get a feel for things. That said, this will not ever be a game with a lot of depth to it, so do not make the mistake of expecting this to be the case. There is [i]some[/i], yes, but there's only so much to go around in the time the game takes to play.

For the amount I paid at Spiel 2012, I think I struck a fair deal, and I'm looking forward to more plays in order to judge whether my guarded optimism is warranted or not.

[b]Update[/b] It took me a good while before I understood how the game 'ticked'. I had suggested a variant to deal with the power of a Cheater / Bookkeeper combo, but learnt that the power of this duo isn't the real problem. The real problem is actually twofold: namely mistakenly believeing that one should go for resources first and buildings second, when it is in fact the other way around. Resources can always be obtained; buildings cannot. The second part of the problem is that chaotic interactions can cause a player to be locked out of the building bonuses he was counting on. If that happens, he loses to the players who do not experience such a setback. The game is short enough for a rematch... but at the same time there's a fair bit of rules to take into account, and to get bitchslapped this way never loses its sting.

All in all I think the game is clever for what it attempts to achieve, but it's also a tad overburdened, and prone to chaotic swings of fortune. The rate stays put as a consequence, but at the same time it is no danger of dropping any further.

What's your game kennen we hoofdzakelijk van hun big-box-games zoals Vasco da gama en Vinhos. Ook dit jaar was het de bedoeling om met zo'n klepper naar Essen te komen, maar Madeira : pearl of the Atlantic heeft het niet gehaald. Geen erg dit keer (ook Vinhos haalde het niet vorig jaar), want ze brachten nog twee andere spellen mee. Asgard (waarover later meer) en het kleine doosje van Oddville.

Ik durf u nu al te vertellen dat dit één van mijn Essen favorieten zal worden. Een klein doosje met niet al te veel materiaal, maar wel met héél wat diepgang. U gaat in Oddville bouwen aan een stad en probeert dit natuurlijk weer als beste te doen om alzo de winst naar u toe te trekken. Het spel omvat 64 kaarten die een dubbel gebruik hebben, aan de éne kant zijn het munten aan de andere kant gebouwen (dit weten we wel te smaken). Daarnaast heb je een grondstoffenbordje (lekker handig, dan heb je geen kilo's hout of fiches nodig), 12 karakterkaarten (waarmee je wat tegen de basisregels mag zondigen), 4 arbeiderskaarten per speler en 9 arbeiders per speler. 

In een beurt mag een speler slechts één actie uitvoeren, dus het gaat vooruit, dat kan ik u al vertellen. Ofwel beslis je om een arbeiderkaart te spelen ofwel ga je bouwen aan Oddville. Zo gauw een speler z'n 6de arbeider in Oddville heeft staan, eindigt het spel en worden de punten geteld.

1) Speel een arbeiderkaart : deze kaarten tonen steeds drie zaken, waaruit je er één (en slechts één) kan kiezen :
- verkrijg geld : neem het aantal geldkaarten van de stapel zoals aangegeven op de arbeiderkaart (handlimiet geld is 5)
- verkrijg één grondstof : plaats een arbeider op het goedkoopste vak van één van de afgebeelde grondstoffen, betaal de eventuele kost (0,1 of 2 geld). 
- verkrijg één gebouw : kies een gebouw uit de zes openliggende gebouwen, je arbeiderkaart geeft aan hoeveel dit zal kosten, de eerste in de rij zijn meestal gratis, de laatsten kosten je meestal wel geld. Je legt het gebouw voor je neer (max. 2), schuift de gebouwen door naar links en vult de rij terug aan (rechts)

2) Bouwen aan Oddville : 
- kies een gebouwkaart die voor je ligt
- betaal de kosten zoals aangegeven op de kaart door arbeiders terug te halen van het grondstoffenbord
- plaats de gebouwkaart in Oddville (centraal op de speeltafel) volgens enkel bouwregels (orthogonaal, wegen en huizen moeten passen, niet boven het centrum bouwen, de gebouwen niet draaien)
- zet één van je arbeiders op de pas gebouwde kaart
- ontvang de gildebonus zoals aangegeven rechtsboven op de kaart 
- ontvang de bonus van de aangrenzende gebouwen (orthogonaal) die met een weg verbonden zijn
De gildebonus geeft je een karakterkaart van de desbetreffende gilde en laat je zondigen tegen de regels (erg leuke kaarten bij)
De andere bonussen geven je een grondstof, een geld, laten je een grondstof omruilen, ...

Zo gauw een speler zes arbeiders in de stad heeft staan, eindigt het spel en worden de punten geteld :
- de punten van de kaart waarop de arbeider staat en eventuele extra punten zoals aangegeven op het gebouw
- de punten zoals aangegeven op de karakterkaarten
- één punt voor elke resterende grondstof

[b][18th Sept 2013][/b]: I really like the mashed up of mechanics in the game. The mechanics in the game felt similar to other games yet I can't really recall most of them.

I like card games with depth and I can say the same for Oddville, though it's not really complex or deep. It's a simple game IMO with some nice touch. I really like how a card can be used for one of multiple things. I like that there's a separate board for resource gathering with your workers, that's something neat to have in a card game (card games normally only contain cards).

The game adds in some depth with the guild person that does some rule breaking stuff. I find the building laying mechanic to be fine and is a neat addition to the game.

I've only played it once, and I need to play it again to really find out more.

Light city builder game. Plays quickly.

RATING: 5
I had high hopes for this one. Here's a basic premise: On your turn, you either (1) play one of your workers or (2) build a building you have the schematic for. Before you play a worker you may pay money to get your previously paid cards back at a cost of 1/card you have in your hand. Workers allow you to do either (a) place a meeple on a resource (there are 4 types), (b) get money, or (c) take a building schematic from the building row. They get replaced as their taken. The 4 workers range from best at everything to worst at everything. Your money caps at 5 and you can only have 2 schematics in front of you. There is a central building card with paths. You place your meeple on buildings that you attach to the city. The game ends when a player has 6 of their 9 meeples on buildings. When you build buildings you remove the resource meeples matching the requirements of the schematics. When you build a building you gain a immediate benefit (usually a resource) and if there is a road connecting your building with adjacent buildings you get their bonus as well. The buildings have various scoring methods.

My main problem with the game is that when you build, you can somewhat circumvent the need to use workers for resources because of the bonus resources. Some of the characters seem way better than others and sometimes it can be hard to negate someones character bonuses. It went pretty fast and it's an easy game to learn but the flaws really keep it from having hard decisions to make in the game. I can immediately think of some variants that would make the game better, but I usually don't bother with variants unless a game impresses me out of the gate. I was really disappointed in this one.

OddVille is an underrated game!
Its a game in which players build a common city using cards.
Each player have a hand of the same 4 cards.  You can use these cards to get Coins, Ressource or Building.
Your best card enable you to get the most coins, the best ressources or the best building.
You can only use a card to get one of those thing.  Once you use a card, its stays on the table and can't be use again until you retrieve it.  The cost to take back cards into your hand equal to the number of cards remaining in your hand.  So its better to use your 4 cards before taking them back.

Workers are use to indicate which ressources you have and are also place on card that you've build in the city.  The workers are limited in number.  If you have alot of worker in the city, you need to plan correctly which ressources you'll need.
When you build, you pay the ressource cost by removing worker from the ressource board.  There is restriction on where you can place your building.  Some building gives more vp if adjacent to other, some give more vp if the column is longer, etc.

There's also a number of Character card equal to the number of player.  These cards give the player who have it a special power.  But the nice thing about it is once there all gone and someone is suppose to take one, everybody loses their special power and are shuffle back to the supply.

This look complicated but a game last about 30 minute!

Deeper than it seems. And more open to wildly differing scores than in a lot of similar cube-pushers. I mean, some building are just a lot better than others.

I liked having exactly one card per guild, as happens in 2p. Though I imagine the city itself would be a little more interesting with 3 or 4 players.

Light game of city building with familiar mechanics and an elegant market system. Resource ownership and price fluctuation are indicated simultaneously by players' pawns on a common board. You use your four worker cards to acquire money, resources and building projects, but as each worker is always better or worse than the others at everything, there are some mildly interesting decisions on how to play them.

Most buildings grant control of a character with a special power and some victory points. Some powers are better than others, and the apparent attempt to balance them by amount of victory points does not work, because the characters change hands during the game and the points are awarded only at the end.

You place pawns in the city with the buildings you construct, and possibly once via one of the special characters. As the game ends immediately when someone places his sixth pawn, there is a huge advantage to the player that does it. He not only has at least one more building than the others to score, but most often also gets a special character (worth victory points), often taken away from an opponent. Of course, this also favors the players earlier in turn order and is not offset by the tiny advantage of later players choosing their starting resource first.

All things considered, this may still be a fine family game, but with a couple of big flaws that could have been fixed with simple adjustments.

Initial Rating : 6.5 (August 2014)

I didn’t have a good feeling about the game. I have seen it on many sales and discounts so I thought it was a bad game. I was ready to play it and sell it BUT I was pleasantly surprised by it. For now it is a keeper in my collection.

The game art is ok, some of the characters´art is great, others not so much but when the Ville is built, it looks gorgeous. It plays fast, you can finish it under the 60 minutes mark, also it has lots of interesting decisions with the multiple purpose cards (do I reserve a building?, do I get money?, do I get a resource?) and the timing of when to recover them. Easy to explain. 

The theme is a bit boring for me. I think it is best with 3 players.

It has some luck in the way the cards appear, but I feel (for now) that it is controlled with the cards and the cost to reserve them. It has more luck in the way the characters appear and affect gameplay, but as the game is so short I don’t mind much. The insert is awful and unnecessary.

Bottom line, a good light game. I want to play again and I will probably request it.

Oddville is an entertaining quick city-building game with a questionable amount of influence. Initially, the demand for efficiency will lead players into a more or less random starting strategy as they likely will choose to gather the least expensive resources or free buildings to not lose additional turns to collecting money. From there on, it's a question of synergistic rewards from their buildings and more or less random attribution of complimentary roles which might or might not suit the player's current situation. In essence, synergies will save turns which is even more important given the starting player advantage as the game immediately ends with the player claiming the sixth building.
As I won by a large margin, I will give Oddville the benefit of a biased view on the influence of a player vs. simple luck of the draw. Still, a few lucky strokes I didn't really prepare for helped me a lot and watching other players benefit in this way will suck.

My husband and I both enjoy this game as a 2-player. It presents itself as a light filler based on its cartoonish box and theme, BUT it is one of the heaviest "filler" games I have played. The scoring possibilities are nice but complex.  Every building placed into the city changes the score, sometimes dramatically.  Ownership of the character cards also impacts scoring and they can change hands often in a game.  My advice, be careful when you trigger the end game condition; you may not be the winner.  I won the first game 45 to 39 when I placed the 6th building, but I had to do a calculation before doing so.  Oddville satisfies my need to play a layered strategy game in 30 - 45 minutes.

For 3 or more players, I expect this game would not be a filler game, but a full blown euro with play time that exceeds an hour.  I will have to confirm this.

Interesting game, I like the mechanics however they do not work so well in a 2 player game, in the game we played one player got the upper hand in the "characters" and did not look back from there picking up all the bonuses EVERY round, needed some balancing mechanism for 2 player. A 3 player game (and from memory a 4 player game) worked a lot better with the characters being  shared out more equally and no one player getting the upper hand. The production cost cutting of using the cards either as money or building cards was not so good and just causes excessive wear on the cards, a small bag of plastic chits or a small sheet of card coins would have been much better and as no player can hold more than 4 cash at any one time would not have been that expensive to do.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Solid little filler where one either plays a worker card to gain money, resources, or building plans OR play said building plan into the city and score/acquire bonuses, including gaining a special character. City cards must connect properly which can create some interesting choices to hurt other people if one places with other people in mind.

This game is evidence that I don't hate Eurogames. It's got a lot of traditional Eurogamey stuff in it: resources, buildings, workers with special powers, arbitrary oddball rules, etc. What I've come to dislike are Euros that cram even more into this, add some kind of paddle-ball game or Manchurian Triple-Blind Auction or something, add two hours to the playing time, and demand thoughtful, beard-stroking discussion. There's nothing in Oddville that demands you sit up and take notice, but it's a pleasant game that does what it does and doesn't overstay its welcome. You won't be tortured by thoughts of whether you could have gotten two more victory points if you'd auctioned the rondel with the Foreman one turn earlier, you just play an entertaining little game.

It's amazing, that with just the deck of cards and a few markers in the box, how complex game you get. Then it somehow feels too complex, as if it tried to accomplish too many things for what it supposed to be. It mostly fell flat for us because it's fairly hard to form a solid strategy, as the city looks a bit messy, hard to see the possibilities, and we end up taking buildings almost randomly, just to end the game faster. With time it certainly gets more obvious, but there's not much motivation for playing more.

This game somehow caught my eye in all of the Essen 2012 coverage and I was among the first to pre-order it once it hit US retailers.  Overall, it has not disappointed.  For a small card game, I've really enjoyed the few plays of this we've had.  I've played it with 2, 3, and 4 players and it works well with each, although I'm not sure I like the Guilds as well with only 2 players.  The art is fantastic and I love the clever use of only 4 cards to do most of your actions throughout the game.  The game does feel a bit redundant (get a building, gather resources, build your building) but the availability of resources and building placement options vary enough to keep it engaging.  The 30-45 minute game play is perfect for the depth.

In essence it's a continual (rather than round-based) worker placement game. Workers are placed for resources in a simple system where the first one in gets the resource for free, the next pays 1, etc. However, you can keep your workers there until you need your resources (always take off the cheapest first). You also draft building cards and then build them with your resources by placing them on a Carcassonne like grid wherein you get extra bonuses for streets that meet neighboring cards.  Each building card usually gets you something and all have some sort of endgame scoring usually having to do with the other buildings on the board. There are some character cards you can gain too with various powers.  

An interesting mid-lightweight game. I must say I was often frustrated with trying to place my cards to score bonuses but that's mitigated by the fact that they're drafted and you can pay more for "better" cards. It plays quickly but I fear it would get too samey after awhile.

Edit: After two more plays rating goes down to 5 (from 7). It's not so smart as I think. It's very important to finish the game as first so you build buildings as fast as you can, no matter which one. Diversity in buildings bonuses is also poor. Fresh game mechanics seems not so well made. Repetive and very random game.

Rating after 3 games with 2, 3 and 4 players.

----

Smart little game. I play it only once with two players (not the best number I think).
It has some problems with two:
- ending of the game - first player may have a BIG advantage
- collecting coins is almost not important

Game plays very fast. First game with two took us 30 min. And for that time it has many decisions to take.
Hard to rate it. I think with more players should be much better so I give it a 7.

Giochino veloce e semplice. Edificio dopo edificio si costruisce la città di OddVille guadagnando prestigio e favori dalle Gilde delle corporazioni.

[b]Oddville[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Oddville offers a pretty unique game play experience as you race to build  a certain number of buildings in a communal tableau of cards. Oddville rewards efficiency and speed, this is most definitely a race to the finish. You do not have time to craft your own strategy, you need to look at the cards available and figure out how you can begin to build a strategy for that game. You also need to be as effective as possible collecting resources and figuring out ways to create combos when you build buildings and get bonuses. 

There is a lot to like in Oddville, it plays quick while still offering plenty of opportunity for strategic play. You will consistently lose to the better player, similar to Race, there is really little luck involved even though it is a card game. However; I did find that Oddville almost felt too quick when playing, making it a little less satisfying than I thought it would be. I will happily play Oddville whenever it is suggested, but probably won't seek out a copy since since it fills a similar niche to RftG.[/i]

A pleasant little Euro that's not odd or vile at all. It re-implements the Castle Of All Seasons / Havana mechanic where (here) you have a hand of 4 cards ranged from poor to great, and you're regularly faced with the choice of either playing a poor card (so that you'll get your great cards back for cheaper or free) or paying to get your great cards back in order to play them more often. Your cards get you gold, resources or building cards, and once you have a building card, another turn option is to spend your resources to build it in the city, thereby earning VPs at the end of the game in whichever way the building says. So you're looking down at the draft of building cards for those which has edges which will match up correctly and fit in a space that will earn it best VPs, as well as earn the instant bonuses for adjacent buildings connected via streets. Having your best card available to get a great building when it comes up is key. As is getting the ongoing powers earned by those buildings which belong to guilds, so these are eagerly snapped up and built. Turns thereby are checking out which buildings you want to grab and later build, and otherwise collecting the resources to build them (as well as the money which is needed to get non-free resources and non-free buildings). So turns are generally quick but with the occasional hard choice on which building to claim. It's all over in 30 mins or so as you only need to build 6 buildings. Add up the VPs, and that's it, a light mid-weight build-type game that's exactly the right length for what it offers.

I really enjoy the tile-laying-like aspect of putting the  building cards in the city.  You're constantly trying to determine which buildings are the best ones to buy that work best with the other buildings in the city.  And then you're also trying to make the best use of the 4 action cards you have to choose from.  Then you also have the special player powers that you might get to use.  And all the while, you need to build your 6 buildings before your oponents.  This is a good one!

Cardgame mostly, there's a small board where you put your guys to collect resources. You build a city from the cards, that also represent money (back of the card). We had fun playing this, 2 player game was quite short, but works well.

A city-building point-optimising game which looks like it would play well with a good amount of interaction which - with players on an equal footing - proves engaging. The six meeple limit feelsa bit brief and it is always frustrating when a game doesn't give each player equal turns.

RATING: 7
This is a wonderful, quick playing euro resource management game. The components consist of some meeples & player cards, a resource board and some cards representing city locations. On your turn, you either play this multi-use card and do one of the three things on it, or you build a building which will score for you at the end, based on whatever criteria the building has printed on it. The game oozes with little euro-game flourishes I love. The game punishes you a little for resetting your hand of cards before you use all of them, and the cards are similar in function, but aren't all equal in what they can do. The resource board system is clever and efficient and makes for some interesting tension in grabbing up the cheap resources when they become available. The need to grab good buildings when they become available vs your limited ability to hold unbuilt buildings is delightful. Figuring out how to place your buildings into the city using carcassonne rules of placement, where roads need to lead to roads and cities need to connect to cities is delightful. There are nice little combos where you get benefits of the building when you build it and also the benefits of all city cards connected to your new one by a road. The game shines with 2 players, but with more players the points and ability cards that get handed back and forth become more swingy in terms of points and power level.

Assusta na primeira vez, agrada na segunda, conquista à terceira... É um jogo que pouco tem de relacionado com o modo mágico como as cartas se fundem num tabuleiro de jogo, mas que retira deste mesmo pressuposto um grande proveito. Não é muito palpável o tema, o que, para um jogo que se quer temático, acaba por o prejudicar!

It is neat to see a mechanism that was in my prototype (wherein it was never fleshed out perfectly) work nicely as a mechanism; it shows that my mind is on the right track, just not enough time to work through the problems to make it work with the rest of the idea.

I want to try this and see how it compares to what I had. I speak of the your workers are the resources mechanism ala Neuland-esque.

Good streamlined euro that can hold its own, but ranges in difficulty around a medium to medium light game.

RATING: 6
way more serious and well thought out than the title and theme suggest.  I like how the mechanics work together to create a weird dynamic and hard choices about tempo.

I worry that there is too much chaos in when opportunities present themselves (e.g. happening to get certain guild leaders or happening to get the first shot at cheap resources).  To play carefully around such issues slows the game way down, but to ignore them makes the game quite random.  There also seems to be a notable first turn advantage, despite attempts in the rules to counter it.

One play.  Meh is the perfect desription for this game.  There's nothing wrong with it, and using the roles and resources you pick up to do more stuff gives you things to think about, but there just didn't seem to be very many real exciting decisions to make, and at times it almost felt like your moves were so obvious that the game was playing you.  Nothing wrong with it, just very unmemorable and without anything to make me want to play again.

I expected more. Maybe I was tempted of the fine box cover. Nevertheless it's a relatively short game with easy rules where all players build the town "Oddville" and hope to earn most victory points in the end. Nothing really new ...

RATING: 8
Cleverly designed card game that takes the mechanic of multiple-use of cards to the next level. At any given time some cards can be either money, projects or buildings, while a different type of worker card can be used in three different ways to get access to either money, resources or projects. Add in some guild member cards that give access to special powers (often allowing to bypass a default game restriction) and clever tableau construction for maximizing end-game points, and you have a delightful, fairly quick-playing game for 2 to 4 players.

RATING: 7
This is a fine game. Works quite well with 2 players, and even better with 3 and 4. There's a good amount going on for a small, inexpensive game. Doesn't take too long or take up much space. Provides some good interaction and planning ahead. The scoring is interesting and the choices are satisfying. I think this'll be a game I end up taking various places and teaching to various people.

Played once with 3P. OddVille is a tile-laying game which squeezes quite a lot of rules and gameplay into a tiny box. On their turn, players have a choice between playing a card from hand or constructing a building in the city. Playing a card allows a player to either get coins, resources or an available building from the lineup. While each player has the same set of 4 cards, each card is different and players have to manage their hand or pay a penalty to bring back the previously played cards back to hand. Also interesting is the way resources are handled, as players put workers into slots to denote the resources they have on hand.

Constructing buildings introduces a spatial aspect to the game and quite a few buildings score points relative to their placement on the board. Most buildings also allow the player to recruit a corresponding guild member, which grants him or her ongoing benefits. With so many different elements in the gameplay, it is surprising that OddVille is more of a short tactical game as you have to depend on the types of buildings that turn up in the lineup, and that guild members change hands. I feel that OddVille would have been more satisfying as a slightly longer, and more strategic game.

A fun city building/action section/resource management game with unique mechanisms. The special characters can provide some over powered abilities in the right combo, so players need to be alert to preventing others to achieve that, which could mean a run away winner. On the other hand, combos like that can provide a thrilling come from behind victory. Great little game!

Thus my house rules variant:
Playing any number of character cards at one time counts as the player's turn. Used character cards are placed on the used worker pile and can only be reused once they have been returned to a player's hand in the usual manner. (Characters still in hand do not have to be paid for when reclaiming the regularly played worker cards.) When a player plays the 4th worker card, all cards are returned to the hand at the end of the turn, thus preventing the chance to play powerful character cards two turns in a row. 

This helps to overcome the run away winner problems provided by various combos. It also allows the rest of the game's mechanisms to be enjoyed to their fullest, rather than having the current game experience in which it is most important to work to prevent (or achieve) powerful character combos -- setting up point scoring and resource building opportunities is secondary.

I hesitate to give any game such a high rating, but the fact is that this game has stood the test of time and remains a constant favourite. It has a bit of everything but does not feel like a mish-mash, the several familiar mechanisms make it easy to teach, so it gets played with new and old players alike. It plays reliably quickly, often under an hour, so makes a good end-of-evening game while being so much more satisfying than a quick filler.
Its small size makes it highly portable and results in a great price, I can't think of any game that gives better value.

Oddville isn't a deeply exciting game, but it is a solid and perfectly functional game. The guild members are pretty much all useful, some perhaps more than the others, and the game plays quickly and avoids too many incidents of downtime.

The role cards are simple, but perhaps a little too similar to each other and so the game feels mildly repetitive. I seem quite down on the game, but I enjoyed our plays of it and would happily play it again.

The end game trigger is a slight let down though; I'd prefer an equal number of turns.

7 -> 5

Another game where you earn recources to gain buildings that gives you VP. But it is a little bit different.

The game is very fast (2P - 30 minutes, i think with more experience maybe faster), but you have many choices.

One problem (?). In my first and only game i won easy, but i was the starting player. I think in a 2 player game the starting player has an advantage, but must play more to be sure. If it`s true it would be very bad. 

I must also try, how the game works with more players.

Edit: I think the advantage of the starting player is not so big. My first play was with a rule mistake...

But after two more plays, the game is not so interesting. All the bonuses, guilds and the other things is not so important. You must build new buildings as fast as possible. It doesn`t matter what card you build. So you don`t have so much options. Replaybility is very low, because every game you play exacly in the same way.

Oddville may not be very original in terms of mechanics, but it is for a short, fun, good looking city building game in a small-ish box. And it plays very well with two. I like the fact that you really have to consider the spots in which the most coveted buildings will (or will not) fit, as well as the combined benefits you obtain by placing a building. The rest comes down to timing. Definitely recommended!

Je n'ai pas été convaincue par la mécanique des guildes et leurs personnages qui m’a semblé à part du reste du jeu. De plus, drôle de feeling pour les pointages qui sont difficiles à retenir en cours de partie à cause des multiples conditions inter-reliées... De ce fait, les joueurs ont rapidement arrêté de tenter de calculer qui était le meneur et se sont dépêché de déclencher la fin de partie en espérant être le vainqueur (ce qui nous a tous laissé une impression bizarre). 

►VARIANTE(S) UTILISÉE(S):
Δ MAISON : je n'ai pas essayé cette variante mais il me semble intéressant de la mentionner : certains joueurs ont fabriqué des pistes de score afin de suivre les pointages en cours de partie (ce qui doit effectivement aider à l’expérience de jeu mais pas de là à me convaincre de le réessayer).

Card driven city builder with worker placement. Draft city cards and buy resources that will be needed to add them to the city. Variable power workers cards are spent to place dudes on the resource board to reserve shares of wood, stone, clay or crystals. This is a clever mechanic that avoids the need for resource tokens and it adds a tradeoff decision with your finite supply of workers. The meat of the game is a surprisingly deep strategy on solving the city placement puzzle to properly align streets AND combine the best bonus scoring options while trying to control guild members for their abilities. A satisfying big game in a small box for very reasonable price. This is a great game for our camper collection. It is hugely AP prone for my wife, but that is a good thing because it means she is enjoying it.

No score track and cards as coins. They were probably trying to keep the cost of production down but still a fairly charming little game. Can be AP prone as players look for their options. Iconography is good and art is very nice. It can take a little practice with the building cards to see where the roads are.

Initially it felt a little random. My main complaint would be that for such a small game it is finicky. It is easy to forget small rules. The randomness seems to decrease with multiple plays. Once I ceased to mis-remember the rules and learned to lean on the powers of the guilds it improved.

Oddville is a game which combines the best of Stone Age, Carcassonne and San Juan.
That’s exactly the line I read in a review of this game, and let’s be honest. The three games that were named, aren’t the worst games to play in the world. No, mentioning those games made me curious in a blink. It made me want to play the game. Last night we did play this game. After playing we only can say that there are some advantages on this game. You can explain it in a couple of minutes (the rulebook contains only 6 pages). It is surprisingly fun. It’s clear. It has a nice playing time. You can tease your opponents a bit (just enough so it won’t become annoying). Due to the different cards, every game will be different. Of course there are some disadvantages in this game. Let’s go. All the information is open on the table. If a player wants to, he can count and calculate all the cards. You will have to take care not to play this with somebody who would do this. Such a player can destroy this game.

Conclusion. This game is fun. After you’ve finished playing you’ll want to play again and again. And again. But let’s be honest, there’s no (two deck) cardgame that would justify the pricing of this game. This is overpriced with 30% minimum. EUR15,- would be the maximum for the components provided. Great game or not.

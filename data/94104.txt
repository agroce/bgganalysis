My first purchase! You never know what the opponent will do. I should have picked up the edition with metal coins, as the small coins are hard to handle.

Note: 7 Unit card hand limit and 10 coin limit by end of turn.

Con: Rules are hard to grok and retain. Seems swingy.

Das Spiel an sich hat schöne Mechanismen und interessante Siegbedingungen. Die Karten sind schö (und passend) illustriert.
Allerdings sind die Effekte zum Einen sehr stark im Spiel (Karten & Gold des Gegners "vernichten"), zum Anderen existiert keine Interaktion - kein Gegenspielen von Karten ist ausserhalb des eigenen Zuges möglich. So sitzt man da und nimmt einfach nur hin und sieht die Auslage und die Kartenhand und das Gold schwinden.
Das ist eher frustrierend, da man den Effekten hilflos "ausgeliefert" ist.

It's a two player vs card game, so there is a ton of competition. This really feels like a mish mash of some of those other games, and I think I'd rather play Conquest (RIP) for some of the similar mechanics. It also felt pretty swingy.

RATING: 7
Nice 2-player, low fantasy card game. The game is set in ancient Greece and players gain Victory Points by pleasing the Gods or by pillaging cities. The rules are simple enough and each card has its own abilities. The optional draft variant is what makes the game great. With the normal rules there is much randomness and you cant really plan ahead. By drafting your cards you can make a tight deck and try to actually follow a strategy.

Not something every 2p opponent would enjoy. It's a direct conflict game and you mess with your opponent's plans A LOT. Getting this to the table was a hit and miss situation as far as I've experienced it. Experienced gamers seemed to like it but casual gamers found it too complicated.

I would call it a mix of MtG - Blood bowl type of card game. So far i have only tried the standard way of play, cant wait to try the omega rules way with 1 copy of each card in the deck. As for the gameplay, it is really interesting and Omen  surely is a hidden gem which deserved more attention.

*Update: Tried Omega. Its better than standard. Makes it more cutthroat.

This card game is really REALLY good, crammed into such a small package. (Not in terms of gameplay) it gives me those warm fuzzy vibes similar to games like Race for the Galaxy and Innovation where I'm thinking to myself "Oh wow. They packed SO MUCH GAME into such a small deck of cards"

After a dozen games, I can confirm that Omen (2015 edition) is a very strong board game for 2 players who like a "eat that" mechanism.

When you play Omen, you can't really predict anything, you have to play for the current round and the current only as you can lose your entire hand (and you will lose it) just afterwards.
When you play Omen, you feel desperate when you see your empty and powerless hands while your opponent has 5+ cards. But then, with the game's magic, you reverse the roles and you feel so happy about it.
When you play Omen, you will use a lot of "Eat that" effects. And you will suffer a lot too.
When you play Omen, you only have powerful cards and you don't know which one to use... Then you cry when you know that your remaining powerful cards will be discarded because of your opponent.

With the 2015 edition, you will receive the base game + a few very interesting mini-expansions.

The best part of Omen is that it really cheap for what it is worth!

Initial Impression: Although my copy is a PnP, I was stunned by the artwork of the cards. The brushstroke artwork is perfect for the theme. The gameplay has interesting decisions during each phase of the players' turn. This is not a "Battleline" derivative as each unit card has abilities that can be activated in different ways. The game can be won using various interesting strategies. The good news is that my son enjoyed the game so I have a partner to explore various tactics.

Still searching for my favorite ruleset.  There are many new ways to play and alternate rules, so the game encourages players to customize to their style.  I would agree that there is a first player advantage, but the new variant definitely helps.

So many choices in such a small compact game.  Multiple uses for each card leads to lots of agonizing choices during a game of Omen.  Exploring card combos is also part of the allure of Omen.  The biggest issue that I have with this game is that I simply have not had a chance to play it enough!

Enjoyable game that's easy to learn, but it suffers from down-time on occasion.

Occasionally suffers from really ridiculous turns.

I'd suggest playing with the Io's Embrace and Emissary of War optional rules.

Despite the luck, I definitely tended to win more often than not - it was 50-50, I'd say, when I went second, but I tended to win a lot more when I went first.  I think there's a first turn advantage (even with Emissary of War to reduce it).

Played this one three times with Tom. First game, I got an awesome combo that meant Tom didn't have a chance. Second game was a more even battle, however I was holding out for the Oracle cards again (in the hope of the killer combo again) which didn't come. Meanwhile Tom went ahead on conquering cities. Third game, Tom got an awesome combo which meant I didn't have a chance. 

The game has a very large element of luck based on the cards you are able to obtain in the early game (and also the draws when the Oracle cards are in play for the bonus effects). Based on these three plays, my view is that the game is not well balanced. May improve when the advanced components are played with (spirits and heroes), but won't hold my breath.

I now own the [-]Olympus[/-] Omega Edition, after previously owning the Second Edition.  The OE, especially with the Spirit and Hero cards definitely has a different feel, but it is one I enjoy. The OE has a slightly more exciting pace.  The players will circle around each other for a while, then someone will make a vicious strike that suddenly achieves several feats and/or takes a couple cities and ends the game.  This could also happen in 2nd Edition, but combos are even more potent in the OE due the the very powerful Spirit and Hero cards.  

I also like the single-copy-of-each-card deck because it adds another layer of strategy.  I know that if I have a card, my opponent doesn't and I also need to think about denial tactics for cards I don't want to fall into their hands.  

Because the Spirits and Heroes are so strong, and due to the overall slimmer deck, I think the OE may be at its best using one of the drafting variants.  This is probably the sharpest evolution of the Omen design, requiring the most skill and providing the most intense battle of the wits.  I'm not totally in love with either of the drafting options in the rulebook, but I have yet to find something better.  The OE still plays fine if you just shuffle up and deal, but there will be more luck involved.

And the art....just amazing.  The OE shows off the art better than ever before and really makes the old format look pretty shabby in comparison.  I'd love to see this game done on tarot-sized cards just to get that art bigger.  Favorite card art: Lady of Grace (gimme a poster!)

I don't really know if this game needs to be rated higher or lower.  From my experience with it, it seemed to be extremely swingy and very, very confrontational.  While the latter doesn't really bother me in most games, I felt like almost every other card was designed to fuck with your opponent.

The biggest hang-up I had with the game is that the oracles exhaust the deck way too fast.  If both players are dumping oracles all the live long day, you'll see wonderful card after wonderful card being passed by straight into the discard pile without any sort of chance to use them tactically or strategically.  Couple that with a 50/50 chance of an oracle helping you or hurting your opponent, and pretty much everyone is going to be crippled from doing anything decent in the game.

If oracles only worked when played, I might have a different opinion of the game.  Unfortunately, I never had a chance to test this theory.

Still, on the upside, you have a game that plays well with two and so long as you're not overly competitive, it does its job pretty well.  The art is fantastic, of course, and the deluxe edition comes with some ridiculously nice, but ultimately useless, coins.

If I had my own copy, I would sleeve it.  The cards, while nice out of the box, seem like they would get really flimsy and gummy after a few plays.

[i][b]Regardless of it's final rating and comments, I have to say this:[/b] Too many new editions (see the description for this game) in a short time with different cards and rule variations pisses people off (think Puzzle Strike). Omen is not the only example (see Hemloch) of Small Box Games doing this. Make a game, stick with it for at least 5 years before making a new one (talking base games here, not expansions). Include maybe one rules variant... not tons. Ugh. It's for this reason I am very skeptical of supporting future games from Small Box Games.[/i]

It's been a while since I've played this, and the only thing I really recall (other than the multiple iterations), is the wonderful artwork not making up for the gameplay. I think I felt that the scoring was a little tight and not much else.

By far the best base/area control card game I've ever played. I appreciate the struggle to balance your economy and card drawing opportunities. The dual victory conditions create plenty of room for some deep and varied decisions, and offers some creative on-the-spot card-comboing. End of game scoring has been really tight so far. The artwork for this game is remarkable. Each card is unique and beautifully illustrated making for a rich and cohesive fantasy gaming experience.

An interesting card game.  I liked the mix of different unit types that all work to complete different aspects of the game. I wouldn't say that Omen felt particularly innovative, but it has some neat ideas and uses them to good effect.  Excellent artwork! Perhaps a little too much "take that" effects. I like player interaction but there were one too many moments of screwage which just felt injected rather than well designed. Overall, a good card game to keep around for those 2-player days.

Nice production value regarding that small publisher. Solidly designed game which reminds mildly me of Battle Line of course "on stereoids" (with more flavor). Rating is for the standard game and as a card game it suffers on the same itch: your victory may depend on a single lucky card draw. Some omissions in the rule book, f.i. "Are you allowed to play a card (soldier/oracle/beast) in a city when already all reward cards are gone?"

This does have the intended "CCG in a box" feel, though like a lot of CCGs, the actual gameplay is a little anticlimactic-- what's fun about it is seeing how well the deck you've constructed plays in practice. Even within the game, the interesting part of the battles is when you build your forces up; the battle itself is just "okay, I win".

And unlike a CCG (or even an LCG), the card pool is fixed, so I can't tell how much longevity it'll have.

For all that, I've enjoyed the times I've played and am glad I found a copy.

RATING: 9
I can't imagine playing this single-deck style. Draft mode is the way to go.

It's also a curiously passive game for its WAR WAR BLOOD theme; there's no drama in fighting (you almost never start a war you won't win) and performing flashy feats to grab achievements feels at least as important as battles. It's plenty [b]interactive[/b], just... I don't know, it's a very mellow war.

Like many Small Box Games, this has awesome and varied female characters but mystifyingly uses only male pronouns for players.

This is a game for recovering Magic: The Gathering addicts.  The units are strong.  The abilities are all game breakingly powerful, yet there is a nice flow and balance to the deck.

I have the Olympus Edition (3rd ed., no duplicate cards) and it is gorgeous.  The art pops off of the cards and the layout is great.  Custom metal coins elevate the set to a thing of beauty.

There is a bit of a learning curve for new players since each card does something different (and many can be used for multiple things), but it's easy enough to learn in a sitting and games flow smoothly.

I love this game.  It's a shame more people won't play it due to the small print runs.

My rating and comments refer to Omen: A Reign of War Omega Edition. I just got it as a Kickstarter, but there is no listing as yet for that specific version here at BGG. 

Great "slaughterfest" as my buddy called it last night. It's a punch in the face type game where you will get your nose bloodied, but be able to punch back. 

Elegant design that flows well and makes sense. I love how the Soldiers, Beasts and Oracles (haven't tried the Spirits or Heroes yet), make sense. They all have their own uses and each one of them is different. 

You have to balance the economics of getting enough resources to pay for puting units into play or using their abilities, as in the case of Beasts. But along with the resources you will need, you will also benefit from having more variety of cards in your hand to make fun combos that can gain you one or more feats on your turn, win you a reward from a city, or cripple your opponent's hand of cards or forces in cities. 

The artwork is fantastic, I love it. There is a ton of different art, as all the units are unique. The metal coins that came with the kickstarter are awesome. 

Overall, I'm very pleased with this game and it will certainly be one I keep in my game bag when going to game night.

Olympus Edition.
Finally got to play this game and I immediately fell in love. Superb design of abilities, balance of options, and a thrill to play. While the power can swing dramatically from turn to turn, you never feel as if you are out of options or unable to make a comeback. I wanted to try this as many fans of SW said this game appeals to the same audience, and is a game like Summoner Wars. I can certainly see the similarities: Two Player, card based combat, territory control, and a tightly managed economy via hand management are all the same reasons I like SW. Clowdus struck gold on this one, and won a permanent fan.
Oh, one more thing, some of the most gorgeous artwork I have seen in any game, I received several compliments on it when I broke this out a game night.

Omen: A Reign of War is a tense game of hand management, tactics, battles, and card combos. The decisions you make and the timing of executing them are crucial for success. I especially like the design choice that the winner of combat suffers more casualties than the loser. This feature makes committing your forces to a particular city a calculated risk. This game is not for the faint of heart as it can be punishing if you make a misstep or fall behind your opponent. The artwork is superb and places you in the stark atmosphere of the game. Omen offers a deeply satisfying, challenging experience in a short time, and it is a worthy title in a market flooded with 2p card games.

John Clowdus knows his audience, and it isn't me. I do respect that this is essentially a combat card game that gives just as many points for meeting objectives (card play patterns, discards, etc.) as it does for winning battles. The five unit card types are all played a little differently and make for some real options on your turn. Omen is an action-point card game where you collect both action points and cards and need to use one to play the other. There are three cities where battles are fought when enough cards are placed next to them. Winning a city battle gets you a powerful reward worth points and, if you choose, a VERY powerful action to use. You can also get points for accomplishing "feats", which entail placing certain unit types next to all of your cities, forcing your opponent to discard 3 cards on your turn, playing 5 units to one city, and so on. Some unit cards are weaker, but give you a steady income. If you don't draw and play these as much as your opponent, you will likely lose. You need a steady stream of cards and action points coming to you or your options will be few.

Yes, I have balance issues with the game. The cost of a card is not always commensurate with its strength and abilities. Some rewards can be ridiculously over-powered. These aspects of the game can make the card draw a little too important for a game that has so many levers to pull. The best moves on your turn are usually pretty obvious and can often be undone on the next player's turn, making your plays often feel pointless. There's lots of hand showing, discarding, and removing of played cards through actions. If the game were more balanced, I might raise this a point. The cards and some of the mechanics work well, but I just don't have enough control for my tastes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very fun game that offers lots of tactical decisions. The card text is dense- takes several plays to become familiar with their attributes.  The artwork is terrific. Omen’s enduring appeal has allowed it to blossom into something of a franchise- there are numerous expansions and stand-alone games based on the original design. While it may not be the cleanest entry in the Clowdus canon, Omen is a clear testament to his singular genius for creating quirky and engaging card games.

It's a scrappy little game of inflicting ruthless card combos on your opponent and piling up the victory points.  The Emissary of War variant is a must use for how it helps smooth out the first mover advantage - haven't tried any of the other mechanics.  The game can often feel like it turns on who draws the Hades reward card (or a killer turn one hand), but it can be a hoot to play.

One of the best 2 player card games I've encountered.  The rules are simple.  You're attempting to dominate 3 cities using soliders, oracles and beasts, while also performing tasks to please the gods.  Making the right combinations to actually get this done is fun and challenging.  A fast playing time is nice, too!

Picked this up after seeing Bruno Faidutti's review.  I'm not as enthusiastic, but I can definitely see what he liked about the game.  It is a fun 2-player that is tricky to play.  It can get a little mean with lots of card stealing and destroying, but that goes together with the theme and is part of the fun.

With further play I can see the rating go up.  The game deserves a better production - though the VHS case is functional and unique, it certainly isn't very inviting.

Its a channel game, like Scarab Lords, where players fight in 3 channels for supremacy. Despite the simple rules its quite a long game and extremely take-that.

I think I would have preferred a game with more strategy for the length it took. Its just too random to have to keep on discarding cards and drawing from the same deck as the other player.

Most már elég sok olyan játékot próbáltunk, amelyben egy központi sor két oldalára kell lapokat pakolgatni, és direkt konfrontációval, egymással harcolva próbálunk győzedelmeskedni a másik felett. Ez egy nagyon jól sikerült darab. Egyrészt fantasztikusak az illusztrációk, egyáltalán nem a megszokott stílusúak a rajzok. Másrészt viszont a szabályok egyszerűsége, érzetre, elég komoly mélységet rejt. Nagyon érdekes kombókra van lehetőség, ami az alapváltozatban mondjuk elég véletlenszerű, mert egy nagy pakliból húzzuk a lapokat, és így nehezen kiszámítható, hogy miképpen alakul az egész. Viszont több játékvariáns is tartozik a játékhoz, többek között pakliépítéses és ugyanolyan készlettel induló lehetőségek is vannak. Ezek azért tervezhetőbbnek tűnnek. No de félreértés ne essék, az alapjáték is nagyon élvezetes. Az egyetlen dolog, ami zavar, hogy nagyon sok változata van az Omennek, és még újabbak jelennek meg, kicsit nehéz követni és belőni, hogy akkor mi merre mennyi. És azt sem értem, hogy ezek miért nem kaptak új bejegyzést BGG-n, más esetekben kisebb változtatásokért is új listázást kapnak a játékok, itt meg gyakorlatilag teljesen megváltozott az egész játék az évek során...

RATING: 9
I got this game because I read it was a bit like MtG without having to buy an endless amount of cards. I was not disappointed. It's a great game.

[b]I quite like this game[/b], but there are a number of things I'd change:

1) I really think half of the [b]Feats and Challenges[/b] should be beefed up and I can't decide whether they should all act like challenges or feats, or the easier challenges should be feats and the harder feats should be challenges. I wish we got twice the challenges, like the feats, so we could mix them up to our liking as I'd probably do the latter.

2) Some of the hero abilities are cool and all, but when I think [b]Heroes[/b], I want specific fairly well-known people or characters from Ancient Greek times, like: Achilles, Hercules, Hector, Perseus, Theseus, Odysseus, et al. There are many to choose from. You could easily do 6 or 12. Instead, what we get are abstract characters, none of whom scream hero. I think I'd also make them cost say 2 each and if they helped you win a war then they're worth 2 VPs instead of just the 1 had you left them in your hand or left them in a city. After all, if a hero doesn't help you win a war then he's not that great of a hero now is he? Later, see my point of tying relics to them. 

3) Maybe I need someone to sell me on them, but [b]the Relics and the Whims[/b] don't do much for me. They seem to be thrown in just for the purpose of throwing in more things when, really, I'd much rather have better heroes. Having multiple types of cards and ways of playing are great and all, but at some point you should say, "okay, that's enough, let's improve the stuff we already have instead", shouldn't you? 

4) The idea of [b]Relics[/b], or Godly items, isn't a bad idea in itself, but they need to be better explained. If I understand them correctly, they don't hurt you points-wise or hand-limit-wise by taking them, so why do the rules say the words "(you) may"? And do they stay at the city once a war has been resolved or no? Do they count against your city or hand card limits? I also think they should be face down so they're more thought of as random gifts from the Gods for accomplishing feats rather than chosen items. Maybe they should need to be attached to heroes and taken into battle, like worn by the heroes, to make them harder to play so you have more of a decision to make of whether you should take them or not.

5) Instead of the [b]Whims[/b] acting like how they act, I think they should be random events that both players have to deal with on their next turn. They could be positives and/or negatives, but both players would have to deal with them. I like it when games throw wrenches into our game machines, but these Whim cards counting against your hand limits are too much and too random if both players don't have to deal with them. Only question is, how should they be triggered? At the start of your turn reveal the top card and if it's a Beast or Spirit then they activate? Add a handful more to ensure they happen throughout a game and you're all set.

6) I'm a bit disappointed that with the Omega edition you can't play [b]the 3 or 4 player Blood Feud variant[/b]. I admit that probably wouldn't hit my table very much, but I quite like the idea of having your own cities and defending them while attacking others'. I suppose I could buy another set, but I also heard some people were disappointed that not all the cards were incorporated into that variant. Still, some more tweaking and maybe it would be more viable.

7) Maybe the biggest mistake the designer made with the game was saying to play it with [b]a common deck[/b]. I think he should have said to play it with 2 [b]different decks[/b] and recommended a couple of easier and faster drafting variants. So many of the comments I read about the game complain about the luck of the draw and even my own wife complained about it and while I definitely agree with others that there are plenty of ways to combat a bad draw, regardless of whether it's that bad of a problem with the game or not, the perception is there and I have to think those initial bad impressions needlessly turn off too many people. No, what he should have done was said randomly give out half of each unit type to each player then said, but if you want to cut the setup time you can try playing it with a common deck, or, better yet, try one of these drafting variants. It's a pity reading those comments and thinking, "if only they were told to play with separate decks right off the bat, maybe they'd love this game as much as so many others do".

8) Finally, for now at least, and I admit this is only a minor issue, but [b]the rulebook[/b] is way too small. I get it, you want to keep the box small, but gee whiz, if it wasn't for PDFs I probably would have put off reading the rules for a long time. Unless you're young, that small type is just too small to bother with. If you want to be funny, include a cheap magnifying glass. It could also do with a bit more proofing.

[b]All that said, I really do like this game.[/b] I just can't help but want to tweak games, even games I like very much like Omen.

After a video review: I like the idea of small 2 player cards games. There seems to be interesting decisions because of the multiple use of cards. Does not seems like an awesome game, but could be worth playing.

You are basically playing cards, for special abilities, military units or sacrifice for favor to get more resources. You try to get military control of cities to get one time use victory point cards.

According to user comments: There is some balance issues, and the game pretty much plays by itself so you depend on the luck of the draw.

Olympus edition.

Good quality cards: nicely printed and cut. Nice metal coins (not a big fan of the color, though, but it's personal). Nice small box.

The rules are not perfectly detailed, but they are fine (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1108693/3-card-draft-how-does-it-work,…). They are not completely streamlined: 4 initial cards, 4 initial coins, 3 Wealth actions, 7 cards in hand maximum, 10 money maximum, 5 units on one side of the city, war-torn for 3 cities on the opponent's side, or 5+ units total,… Many numbers to be remembered.

The powers of the learning game are really not very varied or too disruptive: they are relatively boring (in the same category of shorter card games: compared to Magic, or Course, but also Hellas, or even Blue Moon).

The flow of the game and the powers remind me of Gosu, which I prefer to Omen: the powers are more varied, the game requires more thinking, more cunning moves, etc.

John Clowdus truly has fine tuned Omen with this edition, limiting the cards to one each in this version of the game. Still, I would have preferred the inclusion of turn summary reference cards and for unit ability flavor texts to have remained in this printing.

I think that Blue Moon or Dominion MIGHT scratch the same itch as this game. This game (in it's 2nd edition version) seems to be priced fairly considering that it's $45 on kickstarter and comes with the original game and TWO expansions:

Extremely intelligent 2 player game and in some aspect even better than my personal favourite, Summoner Wars. Don't bother asking, just go and grab a copy!
edited after 2 non drafted plays on 20/12/2014:
Haven't seen Mr Tsin for a long time after his surgery, and played 2 non-draft games with Bun and Mr Tsin respectively. The game still feels fresh after these years, but the luck draw really matters. I believe the draft mode (anyone, chosen from all together 3 modes now) should be implemented in every single game of Omen once players familiarise with the rules.
BTW, nothing is better than playing good old games with good old friends!

This is a really good game. I can't fault it design-wise at all. The only reason we got rid of it was that it was too conflict-heavy for us. The cards felt like they were focused on hurting your opponent for the sake of hurting them rather than doing something to them because it helped you. That wasn't fun for us.

Omen never really clicked for us. It had been compared to many of my favorites, which gave me high hopes. Battle Line is a honed, focused game that reveals layers of depth beneath its stark simplicity. Glory to Rome has "swingy" combos that are the results of tough decisions and plans you hatched turns ago--plans that attentive players can slow or stop. Magic has nearly 25 years of design ironing out the broken combos and degenerate play (though they still miss sometimes).

In contrast, Omen comes up short on all these fronts without really offering anything new of its own. The rules aren't refined, providing numerous [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1358613/am-i-missing-something]illusions of choice when really the decision is obvious[/url]. The game swings wildly, but not because of any clever but stoppable plans. Instead, you luck into drawing that string of Oracles or happen to have a synergistic mix of cards in hand that allow you to have a super-turn. Sadly, the game swings in the other direction as well, wherein you have little to do and cannot make up any ground. Unlike Magic, there's no gradual increase in power of the cards, so once you're behind, you can't really hope to draw some amazing 7-drop to bail you out. Some who were frustrated with this luck of the draw turned to deckbuilding, but the game [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/812977/super-fast-deck-too-fast-draft-and-deckbuilding-va]isn't really designed for that[/url] so subsequent editions (I have the 2nd) removed it as an option.

Magic players would be much better off building their own Battle Box, which is basically the same thing. Follow any of the guides out their on the internet, and you'll have something that serves the same purpose as Omen and is probably better balanced to boot. Battle Box designers actually advise [i]against[/i] packing in too many synergistic or "tribal" effects for exactly the reasons stated above. They also bar effects that allow players to dig through the draw or discard pile, which Omen unfortunately includes. When these come into play, the game slows to a crawl as one player sifts through dozens of cards.

We tried a couple drafting variants, including the popular [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/816960/deckbuilding-12-6-6-variant]12-6-6 format[/url] recommended here on BGG. While I enjoyed drafting, it didn't seem to make much a difference in the gameplay, where the first player still had a tremendous advantage and the overall feel of the decks remained the same. I honestly don't see myself playing this again, unless it's against someone who is using a very specific set of variants and optional rules that in my opinion should have been part of the original design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Mostly luck-driven, given how overpowered many of the cards are, and how much they can swing the game if you happen to be holding them at just the right time. Given this, very little long term strategy is possible, and every turn is basically a tactical response to whatever your opponent did on his turn. Look at your cards and pick the best move. Rinse. Repeat. Still, it's an enjoyable experience, if you're not expecting more than that.

RATING: 7.5
A 2-player card game in which the players are trying to complete a range of Feats to earn VPs to win the game. 

Each turn the players can play units to the 3 cities that can be battled over. The 3 unit types are Soldiers, Beasts and Oracles. 

Soldiers are straight forward offering strength and the greatest total can win the city, which in turn offers Loot that can be used to gain a power.

Beasts offer up even greater strength than warriors but at a higher cost. Alternately beast cards can be discarded for their text ability but this also requires the payment of their cost. 

Oracles offer a basic power but this can be amplified if the next drawn card from the draw deck is a certain type...simulating the Oracle telling the future. 

The game uses an Action Point Allowance system that can be used to draw cards and collect coin. Coin is then used to pay for cards as units or for their benefits.

This is a really neat game and feels similar to games like Battleline and Revolver but plays differently.

Initial impression of the Olympus edition components: the box is crappy and covered in cheap black paper. It is the kind of box you would buy in a craft store for $1. This will absorb water easily just like construction paper would. The embossed gold looks nice though. There is no other info on the box so you can tell the boxes was produced cheaply and meant to sold directly to consumers. I LOVE the coins. Nice hefty feel to them. The art is also very nice on the cards. I do miss the flavor text, but I can understand why they did away with it.

File under: Probably pretty fun if you play it a lot and learn the cards well enough to mitigate the chaos but I'm not sure there's enough fun in the game to get to that point.

Nice cards. Mechanics are clean. Strategy (or rather tactics - not a lot of strategy on display here) seems straightforward. However, the weird mix of chaos and grind left me feeling like I was pulling a succession of levers over and over again to see what new configurations come up. Maybe there's some opportunity for hand management that I missed. Or hidden depths to the war over cities. Maybe. But it's not likely I'll find out.

A 2-player "battling" card game - although there's nothing especially vicious here - which feels a rather different from all other games of this type that I've played. I've only played once, way back in Autumn 2012 when I'd just got the game, and don't expect I'll do so again any time soon. But while I wasn't wowed by the game, I saw plenty of good things all the same.

26-05-2015. Rated after 1 play. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.
It's rarely that I enjoy a game to this extend at my first play. Some games just wow me.. this one is one of them.

Omen is YET AGAIN one of these card/area control games, similar to Smash Up and Slavika. This one is a bit different, as you don't score VPs (but treasures) and aim to achieve certain 'feats'.  In Omen, you aim to score VPs and end the game. You score VPs for accomplishing feats and getting treasures, both which can end the game if 5 (of 6) are accomplished or the trreasures at 2 of 3 cities depleted. At the end of the game, each feat is worth 2 VP, each treasure in your hand 2 VP and everything else I can remember 1 VP.

In Omen.. you start with a step in which you can choose to spend 3 actions getting coins, cards or a combination. However, if you choose 1 or the other, you get an extra bonus. You can then play cards from your hand by paying money. Then, oracle cards activate and give you money. Then you go to war, scoring cities if there are 3 opposing critters OR 5 units total. The winner of war gets a treasure, but loses 2 creatures and his opponent just 1.

This game is highly interesting. All choices are meaningful and you make a lot. Are  you going to aim for VPs from feats? Treasures? Both? Do you want to keep this card to sacrifice? Artwork is stallar. Cardstock more than fine. Omen is a gem of a game.

This is an average game (we kickstarted it), but it is pretty mundane.  Its not bad, just that is has several mechanism, each from different games, that others do better. For instance how you "battle" in the cities....Smash up does it better.  (JW)

Now this is my kind of drug. It's filled with combos and tactical nuance, all of the things that appeal to me most about collectible card games, but without the overhead and commitment those games require. The design is incredibly polished, with lots of terrific trade-offs that remain hidden at first, but become more apparent as you go. Besides that, the artwork is among the best I've ever seen.

Very polished battle game with nice artwork. Turns fly by once you've got the rules in your head and seen the cards a few times. Games should come in at about 30 minutes, which is just right for this level of thought and luck. There's some good choices to be made as you juggle coin and card income to read objectives (Feats) off and on the battlefield. You're battling over three city locations and the cards with abilities you can win. Winning city cards costs you more than your opponent and you're looking for some good card combinations as you weigh your options. Looking forward to exploring further - the base game is a keeper in the small box.

A surprisingly economic game. This game is largely about getting a good income of cards and coins. Soldiers combo together, oracles provide you with a more consistent income, and beasts are just strong. The card play is interesting, and I really enjoyed the draft at the beginning of the game to determine your deck, though the setup time coupled with how hard it is to teach the game kind of killed it for me. There are a good variety of abilities, and you really need to think about how you are going to deal with your opponent's capabilities. Using a central deck makes setup extremely easy, but makes the game much more random and less strategic. It also becomes much easier to teach.

Lurid, attractive artwork (mmm, oracles...). Feels a lot like Blue Moon, where you decide whether to escalate pitched battles or live to [floatleft][imageid=972699][/floatleft]fight another day, except there are 3 duels occurring simultaneously instead of 1.

This is the apotheosis of Blue Moon, though this genre is not a huge favorite because it depends heavily on card-draw luck and leaps of faith on what your opponent does and does not have. Omen does address these issues somewhat through hand intelligence.

Two areas for improvement:

[b]1.[/b] The cards are not very interesting, and can be condensed to mere permutations of targeting soldier/oracle/monster and drawing coin/card. This is sometimes symptomatic of base games (e.g. Dominion), and probably won't be a problem with future expansions.

[b]2.[/b] There needs to be a more streamlined pre-game drafting variant to construct your deck, in order to still label this card game instead of customizable card game (with a metagame driven by in-depth discussion of card strength and weakness). Having all 24 types of cards on display is way too overwhelming for new/casual players, which is a shame since the rules are so simple. Even with experienced gamers, it presents a somewhat unnecessary startup "cost" before you actually "start playing". This will get even worse as more cards are added to the game. Campaign Manager 2008 handles the issue very well through its draw-3-keep-1 pre-game deckbuilding system.

Also, due to 1, the deckbuilding process just degenerates to Play 1 picks A, Player 2 picks anti-A, and so on.

A quick, easy-to-learn game - we were playing in about 5 minutes.  Not too much text on the cards to digest and clear mechanics make this an easy game to teach to non-gamers.  The feats seem a little hard to keep track of sometimes, but getting that comes with time.  Nice back and forth and built in catchup mechanic that doesn't seem forced.  I really like it.

Played once with Ryan.  It was OK, and I was a little disappointed.  The art is fantastic, it plays relatively quickly, and there are some interesting decisions to make.  But I hold "dueling" card games to a pretty high standard, and I also don't generally give them much table time (nowadays prefer to play bigger stuff).  I'll try it some more.

Great theme. I like portable card games that make you think.  Lots of decisions, quick setup, rules not too complicated once you have the steps down.  I liked weighing using a beast for strength or effect, maximizing use of cards and their effect with limited money, keeping an eye on accomplishing feats but not to the extent of losing battles.  Lovely artwork.

I originally backed this on KS partially because it had metal coins that I knew I could easily use in any other game but also partially because the artwork looked nice and it had decent reviews for previous versions on BGG.  Then it sat on my shelf for over a year never seeing light.  Well this week I pulled it out and played it and was pleasantly surprised.

I only managed to play 3 games but my heavy background in strategic games (magic, netrunner, pandemic, dominion, etc) let this game feel familiar yet unique.  A lot of the reviews say it's "swingy" and this may be the case, I definitely steamrolled my opponent all 3 games I played but I'm not sure if that's me being a more experienced gamer or what.

I'm definitely wanting to play more games right now as the gameplay was surpringly good for a game with only around 50 actively used cards.

Another one of these "advanced Battle Line" games where two players put cards on either side of locations which will eventually be resolved. Where Battle Line has only a few special powers, though, here everything does -- Soldiers have a special ability when they first move to a location, Oracles have special abilities which activate every turn they remain in play, and Beasts can be discarded instead of played for incredible power. (New unit types in expansions, such as Spirits and Heroes, have similar special effects.) Even the location cards, once won, can be spent for powerful one-off effects.

There are some powerful combos to be had, but nothing that can be counted on. Play tends to be tactical as many abilities generate sweeping changes, like wiping out large numbers of cards or all of a player's money.

Ultimately, it's a little like a combination of Battle Line and the "if everything is broken then nothing is broken" attitude of Epic or Innovation; games will be wild and woolly. That's an approach that I generally like, but it just doesn't seem to work very well here.

The overall feel of this game - mechanically, thematically and aesthetically - is the closest I have experienced to drafting and playing M:tG without actually just playing Magic. That's not to say it's the same game (it's not) but it scratches the same itch for me, without the cost and without the occasional land screw/land flood issues. 

Lots of ways to score points and win, good balance of strategy vs. tactics and plenty of combo-riffic synergy between various cards.  Frankly, almost every card in this game is a "bomb" in the right situation. Recommended to anyone who digs said qualities in a game. 

I have the Omega edition; I dig the extra level of decisions that the various expansions bring to the experience.

Kickstarter. Two player card game. Rules are fairly simple but several cards causes problems (and you frequently have to visit the bgg forum). Leave out all expansions and play with as few cards as possible (no heroes or spirits either) - it's actually better that way. The game shifts quickly between turns. Don't plan for your next turn - too many things will change in your opponents turn and long term strategies are quite pointless. There's more luck than skill in this game. If you get the right cards you'll win. If you don't you won't. If both players have the same amount of luck then the game can be fun. If not, well... both will find the game quite boring actually. Will play it occationally, but it's not exactly one of my favourites.

Gorgeous art, nice components, 'in your face' gameplay.
What's not to like? One thing. And that really kills the game up till the point that I sold it off: it is possible to completely shut an opponent down up till the point they are just figurines in your glorious play to victory.

NOT, I repeat NOT a good game to play versus your spouse, unless you want to force a divorce. First time ever we almost got into a fight over a game.

Please note, this might be a good game if you regularly play versus an opponent on 'exact' the same skill-level. But I go for Babel anyday.

Omen could be described as a streamlined version of MtG with area control (a la Smash Up, Blood Bowl Team Manager, Draco Magi, etc.) and fulfilling objectives serving as the win conditions. Moreover, Omen comes with several mini-expansions that can be added individually or all together and drafting rules to tailor the game experience. Overall, Omen is a clever and compact entry in the "battling card" genus of gaming and definitely worth the cheap investment!

Wonderful game. I own the Olympus Edition and have Kickstarted copies of the Omega Edition to give as gifts (this game deserves more visability!). This is my favorite two player card game and is in my top ten games (out of over 100) and will probably remain there. So many great decisions to make. While there is a luck component, it is a very fun one that feels less than the roll of dice (better than, say, Summoner Wars), and in a way reminds me just slightly of the way Stefan Feld gives you options to mitigate the luck factor in his games. The game really speeds up and shines when both players have a few sessions under their belts and are familiar with the cards. A ~30 minute play time, small size (great for portability), with so many rich decisions and good expansions make this an absolute must have.

This game might be great if I wanted to invest 50 plays into it.  Some cards reference opponent's cards, which means I have to stop and read each of those cards in order to keep going with my turn.  This takes forever!  and would be mitigated if I had all of the cards memorized, which I don't, and with my memory, probably never will.  Not bad.  Not great.  Though I really do think this game would be great if it were the only game I owned and was on a desert island.  
Rule book has classic John Ariosa issue of rules that are not tightly written- get some others to look them over and tighten them up.  Same with rule summary cards which are missing key elements (for example: hand limit of 7, coin limit 10) and are over wordy.

A deep, involved two-player card game (there are variants for more players, but this really should remain a two-player affair) with beautiful artwork and quick game play. Plenty of room for clever play and a LOT of decisions on how to play cards, given that almost every one has multiple uses and abilities. One concern (if not playing with draft or constructed decks) is that a player drawing many more oracles than their opponent is likely to win pretty easily, given that the oracles build your resource (card and money) engine. Other than that, Omen really shines in a lot of areas.

I really liked some of the mechanics, but it was bogged down by a few things. 1) the card special abilities slowed the game down quite a bit, because of all the reading. I'm also not a fan of "GOTCHA!" cards, which this had. 2) the game didn't really "flow" all that well to me. I kept forgetting steps. It was a good game, but not really my cup of tea.

RATING: 10
I love this game. Like many of the offerings from Small Box Games, there are plenty of tough options and multiple ways to end the game. Every card is brimming with possibilities — do you attack with your soldier, and where? Do you discard that tough beast for its powerful ability, or use its huge combat potential? Do you build an economic engine out of oracles, or sacrifice them for extra cash? Tons of fun, and surprisingly thematic.

I like the system overall, but a whole lot of randomness brings the game down. The luck of the draw seems to determine the winner more than anything else in most games. Sometimes you can have a fun back-and-forth slugfest, but sometimes you just have a blowout.

In a recent game, for example, I was the first player and based just on the random cards that I had, I was able make my opponent discard most of his cards and I completed about half of the victory objectives on the very first turn of the game. Now on his first turn he had almost no cards and was already way behind. We cut the game short after another turn or two.

I don't play many two player board games. They just don't get played in my board game groups. But I do enjoy them.

Omen is a game where you're playing cards to three cities. There are battles that happen in those cities, but it's not the main focus of the game. Basically you're trying to get the most points before the end game is triggered. That's largely done through "feats" (goals you're trying to accomplish), cards you win in battles and hero cards you draw randomly.

Every turn you take income, either cards or coins or some combination. Then you play cards by paying their cost. They come in different flavors (Soldiers, Heros, Beasts, Oracles, Spirits) that get played in different ways. Most cards either get played to a city to help defend/fight a war, or just get discarded for a special power. And almost every card has some cool ability, even when played to the city. After you play your cards, there's a portent phase when Oracles do cool stuff. Then you check to see if you've completed any feats (one endgame trigger is completing five feats) and then resolve any wars. Finally, you can discard a card for income (Cards/coins/combo).

The game is largely about figuring out how to use the cards you get. Every card has a cost to play, a fight strength, an "offering value", it's class ability, and usually some cool nifty power that either triggers during it's normal operation, or that it can be discarded to trigger. So figuring out the cards, and especially the interactions between different combinations of cards, is really the heart of the game.

That does make it bit of a challenging game to pick up. Every round I had a hand of new cards that I had never seen before. And there's a fair bit of reading to figure out what each card can do. But that's hardly unique to this game, and that should largely go away when you learn the cards.

The game is fairly quick (or at least if you edit out the time I took reading new cards it would be) but there's a lot of meat on the bone here to chew on. Figuring out how to best use your cards takes a good bit of thought. Like any card game, there's some random luck in the draw, but the special powers give you the ability to mitigate that to some degree. Also, it's fairly easy to draw cards which means you'll usually be able to find something that works for you.

In addition to the gameplay, I really love the artwork of this game. This is just a beautiful game with lots of visual appeal.

Omen: Reign of War is deceptively simple and elegant with with thought provoking game play drawn out of interactions between cards with well defined roles, both on the field of battle and in the realm of intrigue.  The two paths to victory as well as the ability to spend some of your victory points to gain in play advantage are ingenious.  The artistic direction seals the deal that Omen: Reign of War is of the highest water.

You could be the greatest warlord the isles have ever seen. Your thirst for power is matched only by your strategic wit and cunning. You know no rival, aside from your brother.
\13\\13\
As sons of Zeus, you stand poised to conquer all of Greece, but not without the blessing of the gods. To determine who shall rule the domain of man, the gods have devised a contest and lent their most powerful forces for the cause: pillage and raze three cities. When the carnage ends, only one brother will be victorious, while the other will fade into antiquity as just another half-god spawn of Zeus.
\13\\13\
To compete in this contest, players will take on the role of one of these two brothers with access to a powerful array of units including soldiers, beasts, and oracles; each with various uses. Soldiers are powerful, and affect the city they are played in Beasts are easily double the strength of the average soldier, but occupy two slots in the player's available army, and may be discarded to access powerful special abilities. The oracles offer passive boons to the player, but leave a lot to be desired in strength.

Omen: A Reign of War is a two-player card game by Small Box Games and features two distinct game modes: standard and draft. The standard game has players drawing cards from a collective deck, and accessing cards from a collective discard pile. The draft game allows players access to their favorite units, with each player drafting his own deck to play the game with.

RATING: 7
A fast paced card game from a small indy publisher, Omen: A Reign of War is one of the best games I've played this year. The fantasy artwork is tremendously well done, feeling understated and classical instead of the usual over-the-top fantasy fare. The game play is just as good. There are two ways to play, either as an out of the box duel using a shared deck or as a drafting/deck building game with both player's having their own unique deck. Both versions play well, although the shared deck game features a bit more luck and it can be a little harder to put an opponent away due to the unpredictability of the card interactions. For this reason, I think the draft game is where it really shines. The various card interactions make for a very interesting draft and the resulting decks feel much more under the player's control. Literally the only complaint I have about the game is that I wish there were more cards, as the draft format is so good I don't want my picks to start getting predictable or repetitive. There is at least one expansion coming out, but I hope the game is successful enough in the marketplace to warrant more. If you are a fan of card games or deckbuilding, buy it. You won't be disappointed.

A cool two player card game that reminds me a bit of Battle Line (albeit, Battle Line on crack).  If you are just playing the basic game (without drafting decks), there does seem to be a chance for some to get card hosed.

There are no tokens to fiddle with. All scoring is done with the cards. Omen is like Race for the Galaxy with more player interaction.

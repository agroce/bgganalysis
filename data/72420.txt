Didn't click for my family. Could see that it was supposed to be funny, but didn't quite succeed, and there's not much game play. Maybe if I'd being playing with a group of half drunk adults it would have worked.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Slightly frustrating that you can be left without a 'middle' card and consequently have no story to tell.  Needs to be a way of, say, discarding a card and pickling up a middle (maybe one played by an opponent in previous round) if you have none.  Does not over stay its welcome - just.

RATING: 7
Initial Impression: This game easily falls into the "take-that" filler category. Given that this is not the class of game I normally gravitate to, I have to admit that my one play of the game was a surprisingly enjoyable experience. The rules are fairly simple and straightforward, and the game has minimal downtime. The overall enjoyment comes from crafting the zaniest stories with one's "Scene", "Deed", "Foe", and "Result" cards. Adlibbing (is that a verb?) to the stories enhances the overall experience. Of all the "Munchkin"-like games, this is one that I might actually consider pursuing for my collection. Of course, it must be experienced with the right group of people (and possibly copious amounts of alcohol).

If English was my native tongue, I would probably rate it higher and I can see some funny moments in this game when you tell stories, but it's not really language independent, so I traded it away as it would likely never hit the table (I got it for free).

Besides this, I'm not really a big fan of story-telling games, so this was never going to be a hit with me, but I so see why some people would love it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very light and fairly random story-telling card game. Mildly amusing with the right people. The retelling of a tale in which you have 'lied' can produce some good laughs. Limited longevity.

Now this game is just fun. You won't feel like you did much, and the game is really only phenomenal for the first play through, but it's fun. A great, great game to play at the bar over some beers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I was initially disapointed there wasn't more of a storytelling element to this game. I was hoping for something more improvisational that would reward outlandish and creative tales but it's pretty prescrioptive in that regard, although it helps if players get into the spirit and read their cards accordingly.

Nevertheless it's a fun game, and genuine laughs when someone's carefully built up brag ends with the character pissing his pants or something equally ludicrous. That said, it's still fairly straightforward and certainly more on the filling time side of things, albeit fun-filled time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I'm surprised this games scores so low on bgg - everyone in my gaming group loves the silly fun of Braggart. Quite a few people bought it for themselves after I brought it down. It plays quickly, so it's easy to fit in before/between/after big games. And it's always funny, as long as you get into it. Can be frustrating if for few turns you're not getting a right card, but it's ok. The purpose if this game isn't to strategise a lot to win it, but to make the funniest stories, get into character and laugh your ass off.

A fun filler game that doesn't take itself too seriously.  It's good for a few laughs, and I love the cartoon-y artwork.  I worry that it would wear out its welcome if played too often, but in small doses and with a group that is more focused on enjoying themselves than winning, it's a blast.

Picked this up from the designers when they had a stall at a games day in Lichfield nearly a year ago. They were talking about trying to get sales in the US, and I hope they can do it.

This is a great pub-game, where we can exercise our talent for self-aggrandising and watch helplessly as our opponents point out our heroic deeds were not so heroic after all.

Great fun, and can get very competitive.

Really quick, easy, fun game!

Its an absolute hoot. I love it. But it suffers from a lack of variety and needs more cards badly, so it can't get a 9. Vastly better for those able to do silly voices!

RATING: 5
Cute story telling game using the cards to tell it (so you don't have to worry if you are not a bard). The scoring mechanism, while it works, leaves a bit to be desired. Since you have few actions in the game and are subjected to the whims of card draw... you can often find your best laid plans ruined and go from 1st to last place in a heartbeat.

Played at BayCon2012. 

Some fun to be had here and the stories told can be very amusing however suffers from luck of the draw. If you draw more results or settings you are going to 'win' more stories and therefore more points and therefore the game.

Ploys are nice but a little repetitive.

A silly game of tavern boasting. Control and strategy are severely limited. The fun mostly comes from the outrageous stories (and from twisting those stories into something else entirely) but since this storytelling part relies a lot on card texts and a humour somewhat similar to Munchkin I'm not sure how much replay there is in it. It's certainly good for a couple of laughs and fortunately doesn't overstay its welcome as certain other games do.

Own a playtest copy.  Play tested with with several different groups and a vast majority of the people had a lot of fun with this title.

Mass chaos, but in a fun way.  Light filler.  While it's listed as a 30 minute game, I did have it last a bit longer once or twice.  Normally though that was when too many people were have too much fun messing with each other.  So, it was still fun at that length.

Now that it's in print, still enjoying and decent art work.

I've only played the prototype but this is an excellent game. One of the few games where you enjoy reading out the full text on the cards even after playing several times, something that gets left behind in other games where it's just the points that matter. I've often seen players go for lower points because the Brag is going to be more entertaining. I just hope that "Simon the Lonely Ogre" is still in the final game.
I've played this a few times now and was also lucky enough to come 4th in the world championships!! It's fun, pure and simple. If you go into this for laughs you'll get them. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Disappointing. There is just enough text on the cards to tell a story so that there is less incentive (certainly no game requirement) to improvise a story. Some mildly entertaining moments when stories are challenged but the gameplay is not really rivetting or challenging. Few choices to make really.

I've only played two games so far, but suspect this game will have very limited replay appeal. Looks to be a light-hearted game to play with non-gamers, or as a filler for complete brain downtime, but feel the "storytelling" tag for the game mechanic is slightly misleading and hasn't turned out to be quite what I expected.

Very light, but the humour alone can make it worth playing.

Normally, I steer well clear of anything that has a story-telling aspect, as I'm rubbish with anything that requires improvisation, or any kind of performance. (Yep, I'm a socially inept geek.) This, however, has the story written out for you, which makes it a lot easier. And the card combinations contain some gems that give a good giggle before you've even played them.

A good game for non-gamers too.

RATING: 5
Won in a game day raffle. I would never buy this.
A light party game about telling tall tales. Lay down up to four types of card to tell a story, but a minimum of two (a Deed, which is green and a Foe, which is red; in addition you can play a blue Scene and a yellow Result). Each card has a points value. Whomever gets away with the biggest boast wins the round. Players with appropriate cards can steal cards from others or accuse opponents of lying, in which case they can exchange one (sometimes two) cards from the opponent's boast to reduce its value. The winner of the round scores all cards from the boast; the losers score only their highest value card.

It's fine, and I'll happily play, but it doesn't give any buzz at all. The kind of game you can bring out at Christmas so you don't have to sit through Trivial Pursuit again. Very very luck-based and, for me at least, no sense of excitement or anticipation. Nicely produced, though.

Stupid, silly fun. Play cards to make up really funny stories, and call your friends out for lying. This is like a storytelling game with purpose. You aren't just given cards and are expected to make up a story with some arbitrary scoring mechanisms. This is about playing cards of different colors while trying to match symbols. If you have a group of friends who can talk in silly accents and get into the theme, this is a really fun game. 

Probably the only downside is that there aren't more cards, but at the same time, considering the deck is the timer, I wouldn't want there to be too many more. If anything, I'd want there to be more "You're Lying!" cards to mess with people. This is supposed to be a take-that style game, but there isn't quite as much take-that as I'd like. It's actually pretty tame as far as these sorts of games go. Still, very fun, and succeeds at being a remarkably good design in the same bucket as games like Munchkin and Red Dragon Inn.

An entertaining giggle, subtle card mechanics and a step ahead of Red Dragon Inn in the end-of-night-silliness stakes. Simon The Lonely Ogre is possibly the best character in any card game ever!

Good fun but not much 'game' here. Play it when you're in the mood for some light hearted piss-taking and it's all right. Gameplay-wise, it's pitched at a similar level to Fluxx, but is more 'fun'

I find these story telling comedy games fun for about 5 minutes but then they just get boring.  At least this one has more structure than something like Aye Dark Overlord.

Traded - Storytelling with a scoring system. This is a simple game, albeit one that I think is really fun for family time. Don't bother taking this to your gaming group, I am pretty sure most gamers will not care much for it. The storytelling is not really creative, as you mostly just read the cards, so the experience does not compare to other storytelling games. However, this also means that people that have a hard time weaving a story will be able to play this game.

If you can stop your players yelling 'LIAR!' like it's the Princess Bride, you *might* be able to enjoy this. However, that's unlikely as there is barely even a game under the veneer of storytelling. Weak and annoying: hard pass.

A fun party. Although it can be played without knowing any English just by the mechanics alone, the main appeal of the game is heroic stories that are formed - or somewhat less heroic versions after being "corrected" by other players. One of those rare games you don't even necessarily need to be sober when playing.

Fun but ultimately limited in what it has to offer. A game to play with kids.

Played with the right group, this was a lot of fun. It might well be almost entirely random and with 6 players (which is probably best) it seemed to split into two groups. Group A would collect cards while Group B scored them and then vise-versa but this isn't a game you really play to win so strangely it didn't seem to matter.

With 6 it finished just quickly enough. With fewer players, I'd be tempted to remove some cards to keep the game brief as I think it shines if it's over quickly.

Theme - Doesn't extend much beyond the humor on the cards. The game has you play through the entire deck in a session so the humor wears thin after 2-3 plays since all of the cards have been seen.

Gameplay - It plays like munchkin. Players make a play and other try and weaken that play. It does have a minor drafting mechanism to give you some knowledge into at least 1 of their many cards. Action cards have cards in your play  swapped for a lesser value card in another players hand. This leads to players making the biggest play they can when no one has action cards left, usually when they're the last in that round.

Too long for the weight of the game that it is. Very little strategy and if you don't draw the necessary cards you can't even make a play.

Cool little game needs some creative players to be really fun so they can embellish, otherwise it's just throwing cards. 

I got to play this a lot prior to being released as a play test copy from Revier games.

As fun of a game as this is, it just doesn't stand up as a 2 player game...at all. Prior to this playing, I had only played this with it's maximum 6 players...maybe there was a 5 player in there but I don't think so. The laughter and fun that is generated from this game comes from the crazy interactions between different players. You just don't get that with 2.

I wasn't sure what to think when I saw this one being cracked out of the film, but actually, there is enough going on here to make me happy to come back. It's never going to be my favourite, but it's got enough silly while still being a tactically interesting game with a combination of reading other players and pushing your luck.

You sit in The Hero’s Return, a tavern renowned for its
heroic clientele. You’re not a hero, but you talk a good
game. You and your friends are holding court, regaling
the crowds with your tales of derring-do. Can you fight
your way through a drunken haze to concoct the best
boasts? The most believable? Or at least ones that are
funny?

Pointless.
You don't even have to say anything convincing when you play a card. Just play cards. If you are lucky enough, these cards offer you many victory points, and thus win the others without even trying to be a braggart.

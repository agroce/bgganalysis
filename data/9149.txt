After 18 plays I've upped my rating from a 6 to an 8.  This game works beautifully with a mixed group of ages. It's one that our 3 year old can understand and can engage in at the same level as his 5 year old sister and parents. There are very few games that keep up all happy.

It's fun to see the structure drop a little bit with almost every pull.

A good game for younger kids but not one that I especially ejoy playing with children.  I think that by the time they get to 8-9 years old they are ready for something more challenging.  However for the younger set this would be good and gets them to practice their dexterity.

Light and fun.  This is a neat variation on the idea of the classic 'pick up sticks'.  I like the various additional rules (different points for different sticks, can choose not to remove by paying one etc), it makes for a fun little dexterity game that is colourful, attractive and enjoyable.  The game plays quickly and is easy fun.

My wife's game.

DEXTERITY GAME
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A pretty silly dexterity game, where there a bunch of wooden sticks with a hoop around them, causing the sticks to stand.

Each turn, you roll a die and must pull a stick out of the color you rolled.  Each stick you successfully remove is worth points.  If you cause the sticks and hoop to fall, you score no points for the round.

That's about all there is to it!  Roll a die, remove a stick, and don't be the person to make it fall.

Eh. Not bad. Children's games are hard to rate, and I have a few dexterity kid's games already (Gulo Gulo, Animal Upon Animal, etc.). 

After one play, it's not as good as these other options... but that's me. I played it with my wife, so let's see what kids ultimately say.

Update: well... this game was actually destroyed by my daughter! First game that left my collection without me actually having a say in the matter!

Leave it to the Germans to take a bland kids game (Pick-Up Sticks) and turn it into a good game for everyone.  Now there is a definite, unarguable endpoint.  If you think a move will be difficult you are allowed a pass (under certain conditions), but you give up points.

A great little children's game that also plays well with adults.  I'd like to see a larger version perhaps that would extend the length of the game but, I almost think that it's just perfect the way it is.  My biggest annoyance is setting it up but, if you get it just perfect, you'll have a game that really comes down to the last few pulls.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting idea - it's a very simple game and extremely easy to teach.  I'm still not sure how well small children would do at this game, but it's easier to take out the little sticks than it is to stack the animal pieces in Tier auf tier.  It provides a similar sort of thrill as a spectator as a game like Bausack or Bamboleo, though it's not as unique or engaging.  If I was playing a dexterity games with adults, I would probably choose something else.  But for small children, this is small, portable, durable and very easy to explain - a good alternative.

Game in a Nutshell: Pull sticks out of a ring without toppling the whole stack.

Played as: 2 player

Pros: A simple to play, lighter, very compact dexterity. I thought they did a good job designing a relatively smart point system (I'm looking at you Villa Paletti) around the game to give a clearer focus to the game over several short rounds. There's that edge of your seat excitement to the game due to it being a dexterity.

Cons: I mentioned it's compact size as being a strength, but it still doesn't keep me from wishing it wasn't done on a grander, more eye-catching scale. It seems to me that it's not too difficult to play the game and not worry too much about knocking the stack down as sticks seemingly roll into a pretty stable position after each one is taken out. This diminishes the drama to a certain respect.

Other: Playing with two players is probably not something I'll try again, but I am looking forward to playing some rounds with a few more people.

Best Use: Not all dexterity games make good quick fillers, but I think this game makes an excellent example of one that does.

I like the way this dexterity game plays in that it's light, fast, fun and fairly forgiving.  However, from a competetive gamer's perspective the scoring  is a bit silly since usually the person who was lucky to roll the blue the most ended up winning.

Good combo of dexterity + strategy for adults and kids.

You take the sticks and put them in a ring and set it up so that the ring is suspended. You roll a dice, pull a stick, and see if it falls. When it does, the person with the most points wins.

This may be the game that pickup sticks always dreamed of being when it grew up. The ring holds the sticks up off the table, providing more of a 3-D effect. Much more enticing to play! This has been our savior game when needing something to play with very young kids! We have added the fruit variant to our gameplay for more fun. Basically, you say the name of a fruit first (that matches the color of the stick you are trying to take) or you must return the stick!

A little bit like pick up sticks.  Very simple dexterity game where you roll and try to pull out a stick or that color.  You do this until the stack falls.  Playing on something with friction is a must as the smooth surfaced make the stick slip down so you always get down to three sticks.  A carpet makes the slipping much harder to predict.  Good quick kids game.

A quick filler of a game that is fun to play with kids.  Each game lasts but a few minutes - so can get in quite a few games while waiting between games or as a fun activity with the family.  Only minor issue - the thin yellow sticks tend to warp - but that just adds to the challenge of removing them as it isn't a straight pull...

High quality, good looking game, my 2.5 year old plays with the pieces on her own and we were able to play a modified game (roll then take till it falls but only count the number of sticks vs their value). I think a table with a cloth would be recomended, but we have played just in the box.

I almost passed on this thrift find, thinking it was too much like pick-up sticks. I'm so glad I didn't, as it has become a favorite game to play with my 4-year-old. It's very quick, so it's easy to squeeze into short breaks when he's needing a little attention, but I don't mind playing several rounds in a row, either. As an added bonus, he's picked up some great math skills due to the scoring mechanism of differing points for the sticks (for now, we ignore the rule that says whoever knocks it over scores 0 for that round). Rating is for a kids-with-adults game, lower for adults only.

RATING: 6
A variant of pick-up sticks. Players are pulling out dowels of different thickness in an attempt to score points. The thicker the dowel, the more points you score, presumably because it is much harder to remove the thicker component. The key to it all is to prevent the wooden ring that surrounds the dowels from hitting the table. It will happen much quicker if the ring is position in the lower half of the bundle. The only annoying thing is that the die roll may ask you to pick up lower scoring sticks. I guess, one can abandon the die completely.

A fun game and much better than pick up sticks. Looking forward to sharing the game with my daughter.

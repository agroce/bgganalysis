I bought this on a whim - after cracking it open, I realized that it's a hardcore war game that can be played in single player mode... still, artwork is superb, so I may end up keeping it anyway. TRADED: Decided that space on the gaming shelf is more important than a game I've never played (and probably never will in the next 5 years) or really looked at twice.

I have both editions - each are essentially quibbles regarding which is better regarding one change versus another.  The system as a whole works well for this period, but it can be disconcerting to see your larger force get destroyed by a much smaller but more cohesive one.

I owned this for over 10 years but never even punched out the tiles, because I never found anybody willing to even wade through the rulebook with me.  It looks like an absolutely fascinating, very detailed samurai war sim with fantastic maps of famous battles from the storied Sengoku Jidai, ending in Sekigahara.  But with video games like Shogun 2 making this tabletop version redundant and cumbersome, nobody will play it with me.  Not that they will play Shogun 2 with me, either.  Anyway, I finally gave up and sold this on Ebay in late 2016 as I started emptying out my precious board game closet since my kids will no longer play anything with me.

RATING: 9
I'm playing through anegawa solo. I really like this game so far, I won't rate it till face to face play, but so far I like all the mechanics, even the challenges and busho fighting that I thought i wouldn't like are not as dominating as I expected. 
Played my first game, I really liked it. The trump mechanic is great.
Now that I have played face to face I can say I like this game a lot. I like that both side's units are quite similar (as they would have been). A lot of the historical background is innacurate, which is odd because I've read most of the books in the bibliography. The use of missile troops as skirmishers for example is odd, the emphasis on personal combat is to be expected, but the use of Samurai and challenges is rather gamey for a period that sees the development of professional soldiers. I still like the game, since I don't care that much about historical accuracy, but it does raise a few questions.

Recently acquired.  Played The Anagawa as a learning scenario.  As the Asai, I was never able to trump and the momentum rolls would not go my way.  It was over soon, but fun getting there.  With no weapons superiority, one step in the (normal GBoH) combat sequence is removed, so combat goes a little quicker.  Units a nice to look at, but either the maps needed to be a little larger, or the units a little smaller.  In a crowded battle, units are easily sent flying.

RATING: 9
     The easiest of the Great Battles Of History" series to get into.  With scads of senerios, over different types of terrain the tactical options are excellent and varried.  My only complaint was that some of the maps have to be reused with statements like "ignor the river runing from hex # thru hex #"  If you have lots of time I guess you could find a map/overhead photo of Kawanikagima and drop a hex grid over it.  If you do please email me a copy ;)>

Musketeers vs. swords of Samurai...Japan is on the brink of a big societal change as she determined to become a modernized nation.  The gameplay is very interesting as two different war disciplines clashing on each other.  Musket firing range and artillery shells are on the modern troop side.  While close range melee and cavalry charge are on the Samurai side.  The GBoH system applies to the Samurai neatly.  Somehow I thought the system is just a system that can handle any tactical combat before the age of powder.

This game system has plenty of swings in the action provided by the "continuity", "momentum" and "trump" mechanics.  The 9/16" uniform counters in the 2007 reprint make the game a lot easier to play in terms of moving units and placing hit markers.

Good start to the GBoH series. First play took longer than advertised, but other scenarios should be shorter after getting used to the system. I like the system overall, and the components are very good. It's nice that the basic rules for each volume are the same, but that there is also enough "local flavor" to make the games interesting.

GBoH goes to Sengoku era. Interesting adaptation to this kind of warfare where daimyos, clans, taishos, bushos and samurais were so important. Rules have two main changes, the first one is about clan activation and the second one is about continuity and trump options. Do not think that if you are a GBoH expert you will be able to play this one without a carefully read of rules. This title offers a good number of different battles in which it is possible to try every tactic fight. Cavalry has also a different treatment from previous titles. Charges were less decisive in Japan. A fun approach for series enthusiasts and hictorical era lovers.

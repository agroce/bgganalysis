I listened to one of the reviews here at BGG and the guy made it look easy, I bought it because I am a sucker for dragons and fantasy themes, I didn't know that I was getting a wargame-like game with high difficulty and just too many rules, it flows Ok if you can get over the rulebook without falling asleep a few times, and the artwork looks a bit dated and bland for a recent reprint

A simple tactical wargame in fantasy clothing that really plods over up to 30 turns of rinse and repeat.  Also boasts the most abstruse rule book I have read in a while.  The Flatlined  box and board artwork is quite pleasant, while the counters are dull but functional.

Dragon Rage is a classic battle game with quite old mechanics and a long game play. The design is consistent and there is a massive amount of luck. The are many rules which make the game quite complicated without adding a lot of complexity. I am not sure I will play the game again.

  Got mine new in 82.  A favorite game when I was in my teens.  Easy to learn and play.  Used the chits for a lot of AD&D battles, too.  I still have the counters, but unfortunately the map and rules disappeared when my mother purged many of my belongings after I moved out during college.  Bought the new version in 2012.

big fearsome creatures burning a stronghold ... people on the wall shouting "DRAGONS" ... a retro hex&counter fantasy-war game nicely redone (2011) with well written rules ... for long-term motivation there are several scenarios with different creatures and even a campaign ... I wish there would be more such games. you can see the love put into the details of this game.

RATING: 8
Hex-and-counter fantasy wargame from the early 80s with rules that are easy to pick up. Definitely on the lighter end of my taste in wargames, but still immensely fun. Don't be too aggressive and land in the town early if you're playing the dragons in the first scenario, you'll get absolutely destroyed!

I wish the box for the reprint was smaller, there's too much space for the components.

RATING: 7
Played as defenders in intro scenario (2 dragons attacking).  I liked the game - seemed tough on the invaders.  I like the theme of defending a city with various units and capabilities (inf, cav, hero, wizard, etc..).  Component quality is top notch.  Rules fairly straightforward.  Will play advanced game and adjust rating accordingly.

RATING: 6
Dragon insurgency warfare? Awesome idea from Pulsipher. Offers a variety of strategic and tactical options in how you approach and conduct the siege, delivers on its theme. The new edition comes with a ton of scenarios. Probably a little too basic to give the hex and counter format any real meat though.

RATING: 6
[1 play] This is fundamentally a 2p game and I've only played it with 4p.  It adapts moderately well on the dragon side--each player gets a dragon--but on the city defenders side, it really becomes cooperative, which can add significantly to the game length (and downtime for the dragon players) as the two players have to discuss what they're doing every turn.  It also is subject to what I now think of as the "Letters from Whitechapel problem"--the players have to discuss their strategy and plans in front of the other team, which is potentially problematic.  So I don't think modifying to 4p is a great thing for this game, though I'd like to try it again with 2p.

This is sort of like a fantasy-themed hex wargame, which is not a genre I have any experience with.  For someone who wanted to try out that sort of thing, this seems like a good game; it doesn't take eternity to play, and the rules are both manageable in quantity and extremely well explained.  There's one rulebook that's sort of general rules and a second one that's like an index of questions/topics.  We had to look up rules a good few times (as the teaching player was only moderately familiar with the game, and it was new to everyone else), but never did we have to interpret something ambiguous or make our own ruling on something not covered.  If you have a rules question, it has an answer in this game, which is very nice.

 I think this game would really benefit from the same people playing enough to become pretty familiar with it.  It'll get more interesting as you internalize the rules and reach the point where at any moment you know, without having to think about it, what you CAN do, and can focus on figuring out what you WANT to do.  And of course the process of experimenting with different strategies and counters to your opponent's strategies will be the fun part.  Since this is a fantasy game, I think the two sides are more different than they would be in a reality-based wargame; one player has human troops (including a wizard), and the other has two giant ferocious dragons.  So a case could be made--depending on the taste of the players--for either switching sides so both people get to try out both sides, or for keeping the same roles and becoming expert at them.  

Initial impression is that the dragons seem to be at a bit of a disadvantage, because the city defenders can concentrate their fire on destroying a dragon's legs, and as it becomes more injured in the legs it loses movement powers, which is significant.  However, not sure how this would play out over more experience.  Maybe the dragon needs to do more damage early while still mobile?  Take more of a hit-and-run approach?  Who knows.  

This new edition of the game includes an expansion that introduces a lot of new stuff, none of which I have yet tried.  I think it would have been helpful to have separate expansion rules, or maybe just distinguishing type or something, because the one criticism I have of the rules is that they include all the expansion stuff, so if you are just trying to learn & play the base game, you have to wade past and ignore a lot of stuff that only relates to the expansion.

I own the Flatlined Games edition, which has very high production standards.
Gameplay is good old-school fantasy strategy with an interesting asymmetrical warfare approach (two dragons vs. different military units).
In later scenarios, other monsters (Trolls, Giants, Orcs, etc.) add to the game.
Even campaigns are possible.

systeme simple bien que pas forcément clair pour de nombreux points de détail.
le theme rend le jeu attractif pour des jeunes joueurs. Par contre le scénario présenté comme celui à jouer pour commencer est le pire début au jeu. Les dragons ayant beaucoup de règles spéciales à apprendre. Il est préférable de faire un scénario sur la carte du camp gobelin avec des unités simples et sans spécificitées

Good: Adventure - Tactical - Easy

So the game is finally in and the first impressions are positive.

Plus:
-Great looking and quality components
-2 booklets with clear descriptions and scenario's
-Easy to learn system and there is more to the system than it might seem at first glance
-Many different unit types
-Magicians that can spent spells with different effects up to a maximum of 10 spell points per game (different effects cost a different number of points)
-Good reply value: there are 2 different maps, different units and different scenario's s. You can also design your own scenario's so there is a lot to explore. 
-Very good gateway for gamers interested to explore something new and fresh (despite having old school mechanichs).

Negative:
-Smallish gameboard, could have been a bit bigger
-Quite a steep price (had to pay more than 50 Euro)
-Battle resolution system is fairly basic; 6 to hit...
-Orcs and Humans have same capabilities just the symbol on the counter is different. Would have been cool if the Orcs distinguished themselves a bit.
-If a Dragon loses a leg he hampered severly in his attack capabilities; more than you would imagine as a dragon with a handicaped foot would still be able to be devastating as he can fly.  


Cool game, my nephew and my non-wargaming game group members are intrigued by it.

RATING: 3
Unlike some real gems from the 80s like, say, cosmic encounter, this game has not aged well.
But, isn'it it fun you might ask?  After all it has dragons and wizards.  In the days of yore when you had the choice between 10 or so games, I would not be so picky.
But today there are games that are so much better designed that you can safely ignore this one.

RATING: 6
Old style tactical combat (i.e. when units neighbour each other (or fire from distance), you roll the dice for each attack) seems too one-dimensional, too mechanical and too repetitive for me right now.  But of course the game works.
The replayability value is high (2 maps, plenty of scenarios delivered and possible to create, extra monsters with their own sheets supplied), but you need to like the basic mechanics in the first place to profit from this.

Sadly, serious gaps and contradictions in rules were not adressed in the new (2010) edition.  The complete rewrite of the rules is required and the chance for it was wasted.  The messy and descriptive style of 80s is not acceptable nowadays.

Sold.

Unlike the other Dwarfstar games I never hunted this one down, thinking it might be too limited. I now bought the new edition and find I was wrong, lime most of the others, it is chock full of variation on units, chrome and scenarios.  Very clever fantasy take on the Ogre theme.  Love the alternate Orc town map.  Fast and furious, want to play this one again.

There's more to this than meets the eye. Whilst there's a big crapshoot element with the dice, you roll enough of them to even out and there's a surprising amount of tactical choice under the bonnet although it takes several plays for this to come out. I also love the variety on offer - two different boards, orc and human troops and a whole grab bag of fantasy monsters including dinosaurs! Not massively happy with production quality (board is too cluttered, art poor) or rules (a number of clarifications needed) but still a good choice for a medium length two-player game.

The rating is for the reworked version, which has pretty good components.  This is a standard fantasy hex and counter war-game, which has multiple scenarios for both sides of the game board, so there is pretty good replay value.  Once you get past the rules (not complex, just things are in weird places) the game plays pretty quickly.  A solid effort, but not sure how many times this will hit the table.

Flatlined Games 2010 edition looks great with excellent production values.  Nice retro touches with the map graphics and the reverse of the unit counters that look like the original counter artwork of the Dwarfstar edition.

Dragon Rage is a tactical level fantasy wargame that plays quickly, has strong thematic elements and offers a good amount of replayability.  This is a very good low complexity wargame that is well produced and enjoyable to play.

The new Flatlined Games edition adds a new map (Orc/Goblin village), campaign rules and tournament rules.  There are 12 scenarios provided (6 from the 1st edition?)... 6 scenarios that use the city map and 6 scenarios that use the Orc/Goblin map.

With the mix of invading forces and unique abilities of  the monsters, there is a variety of tactical situations presented, increasing the replayability and fun of the game.  In larger scenarios, this game can be played with more than one player per side.

Good overall game package and one of the few tactical level fantasy board wargames that I'm aware of.

What a lot of fun! Yes, ok, if it had awesome miniatures, it would be even better. Also, it needs a thorough back story to add greater theme and depth of experience. But that aside, this is a very good game that’s competitive, easy to learn, with good quality, nice looking components. The layers of gameplay allow you to start simple and then dive deeper. The variety of scenarios, and forces make for loads of replay value. All in all, a very nice game.

A fantasy version of Ogre - sort of.  You have to be very tactical with the dragons and avoid using them like Ogre Mk. III's.  (Like Ogre the defending has to take dragons down by hitting various parts of the dragon thereby eroding their capabilities). Combat is simple, all you do is cross-reference the attacker and defender's combat rating then roll a die to equal or exceed the given "to hit" number. And like GEV, not all scenarios use dragons. There is a variety of units and monsters that you can use to create your own scenarios, and like Ogre, each has a point value.

RATING: 6.5
Pretty tough as the dragon player. Three plays and the invaders are yet to win.

Dragon seems to always have a quick start but slows down. As soon as the reinforcements come in its a very tough game for the invaders.

Fairly simple rules makes for a quick and fun game.

Nice design. Love the Hit Points Board for big monsters. Great replay value. 
Easter and Halloween components (available for free on the publisher website) are a nice addition to the game.

I have a hard time remembering all the movements and actions that can be done (my first hex-and-counter wargame ever) but I should succeed with pratice and player aids (both in the box and on BGG)!

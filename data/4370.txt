Very limited appeal with 2 players! With multiple sets and tables, it becomes very enjoyable and quite sociable as players swap back and forth between games. Downtime can be a problem if players crowd on one table, but this can be rectified by moving back to the quieter board - an interesting decision you don't see in other games. This is a unique experience.

This is a rare game that is actually designed to be best with 15 players playing on 3 copies of the game.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  It’s a real time game, so it encourages quick play.  You get the quirky artwork by Maura.  What’s more, you get a market mechanism so prices fluctuate based on activity on that particular board.  Additionally you get a series of canals and rafts which are a form of expressway.  

Several of the shacks are pretty straightforward, but some of them (brown) can be confusing the first time through.

This was the first time that I had seen the mini poker chips from meeplepeople.  They are the perfect cash tokens for a game like this.  I also need to come up with an alternate set of pawns as 2 of my copies are identical.

If you've got duplicate sets, the pawns from Ricochet Robots work well as an additional set.

Good solid game, OK nothing really new, but entertaining. Play it light, fast and fun or serious and beancount everything. Set up mechanism ensures that two boards are very unlikely to be the same. Lots of player screwage of an amusing/annoying type. A few use once only powers are thrown in to add a little spice/uncertainty/planning. Language independant, nice graphics, nice thick card.

Ok, so you have to stroll through the map, take boat rides, sell, buy and barter random items and finally turn them into fetishes, no dice required: quite a themed game, isn’t it?

Nonetheless, even with its programmatic lack of any theme whatsoever, Fische Fluppen Frikadellen wouldn’t be as bad, were it only shorter: actually by the way it plays, feels and looks like it’s just an overgrown filler that takes too much time for the little fun it gives. [i](February 2012)[/i]

Very different from anything else I've played. The only thing I don't like is that you can have a turn in which all you do is move your token but don't get to take any actions. Played with 3 players. I think it would be pretty chaotic with more, but I guess it might be more fun, too, as long as you're in the mood for that kind of thing. I enjoyed it and definitely want to play again.

The multi-table thing is doomed by uneven pace of play. Soo frustrating being stuck at a slow table, and not being able to get away. Single table is better, but ends up a weird pick up and deliver that wasnt worth it for me. Super awesome 2F art, as usual, btw.

Okay economic game.  It's essential to use the river/rafts wisely.  It's important to watch what other players are buying/selling as item values are based on supply & demand.

UPDATE 2012: The multi-board version is too frantic for me. I like the genre (pick-up-and-deliver), but I think it boils down to recognizing a fast way to make money and having turn order in your favor (i.e., timing). You need to study the board and devise an efficient plan before/when the game begins.

I know I shouldn't be rating this after one play... but we had such a blast at Gamestorm 10 playing with a full complement of 15 players and 3 copies of the game that I couldn't resist. Not a deep game, but this is a rarity. I think it qualifies as a Gamers Party game. It's not a standard Party game, but the enjoyment and "lightness" factor in a sort-of-gamers-game environment is great.\

I now own all three versions!  WOOT

Need more plays of this to see if our take is correct, but it appears as though this works as a stand-alone game, or as a three-board mega game, but not as a two-board game. It's definitely too early to tell, but we played last night and on one board ALL of the players finished before our board. Didn't work out as well as we'd hoped.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After 3 plays of the multi-table game, I've had to revise my rating downwards a bit; this is a game with interesting ideas and a lot of promise, but it just doesn't quite work; every game seems to result in a logjam at one table, which is very bad. The skill required to play the game well is simply too hard to acquire given that this just isn't a game you are likely to find 12-15 people to play very often.  Anyway ... probably best with 3-4 players, or with multiple tables which is clearly the main thrust of the game. The game itself is not quite as inspiring as Funkenschalg, but it plays quickly and it has sort of a "Merchant of Venus lite" feel to me (I like MoV). Another virtue of multiple tables is that it cracks down on the "analysis paralysis" neatly by putting a definite upside to being a fast table (although if people don't grasp this at your table, you can be screwed ... in one game I played, a player at my table got into an extended discussion about the game with a passerby ... during his turn! Bad form in any game, but particularly problematic here. He required very heavy pressure to get back into gear). Clearly best with 8+, but really, how often is this going to be practical?

RATING: 7
This rating is dependent on there being enough players to play on more than one board.

Basically, all there is to this game is utilizing various market stalls to buy/sell/trade various goods in order to eventually trade them in for end goods.  The first person to collect a set of all three different end goods is the winner.

This is all pretty unexciting (but still fun enough) until you get to play with 10 or 15 players.  When playing with 15 players, there are three completely separate playing boards, with 5 people at each board.  Each board may have different types of market stalls, and each board only has one type of the end products.

Since you need to make all three end products, you'll need to move around to all three boards, taking all of your stuff with you and going to play at a different table with different people!  You're also not allowed to peek at the other boards, so you have no idea what you're getting into when you move.  This also means that the boards may all end up with varying numbers of players, and since the game is a race to get those end products, a table with 3 players has a considerable advantage over a table with 7 players, as those players will be getting more turns!

Overall, just a really cool experience when you have a large group, and probably a pretty blah experience with 5 or less.

I found this a very bizarre game and cannot really finalise a rating until I have played it a few more times. Still not grabbing me - I would like to play with multiple boards. Update after a three board game. You buy stuff, you sell stuff, buy low - sell high if you can. Move around. Not exciting enough for me to want to play it anytime soon. 3 Plays.

Based on 1 play, with 3 players: Fun little game. Not a lot of deep thought, but it's a nice mix of strategy and racing. Love the artwork/components. I get the feeling that the game improves with each player added; I'd love to try it with two and three boards! With three the game is a little less frantic and people are a little nicer. I can see it getting a lot more cutthroat with more. Might have a bit of a runaway leader problem. Would love to try with four or five!

Provisional ranking only based on a two person trial game which probably does a poor job of accurately reflecting what a larger group (say at least 4) is like...I would assume a bit more wild and wooley, with some definite chaos, but in a game like this that's not really a bad thing.

Basically though this is a move and manipulate game...you speculate in commodities, and then try to sell them in at profit while collecting sets to trade in for fetishes. The actual gameplay itself isn't super special, though the changing shoppes from session to session (you draw a random run of 12 from a deck of 36...hence variability) and the accompanying powers should help it. Definitely is gaining a bit simply based on the wonderful Maura art and style though...trading in cheap booze for fennel has never been more fun.

Interesting move and deliver game, especially with more than one table going at one time.  But with a multi-table game, if you&#039;re at the table with the SLOW player, you are not going to win no matter what you do, since the other table will get far ahead of you.

Another solid corker from Friedemann Friese; great sense of humor, great artwork, and a clever design. 

Players must travel between a randomly placed set of 12 merchants and traders (36 provided), to collect pre-defined sets of commodities (Fish, Cigarettes, Meatballs, Fennel, and Moonshine...gotta love it!). Merchants buy a certain type of commodity and sell a different type. Traders allow players to trade one type of commodity for two of another type. Players trade in sets of commodities to collect each of three different "fetishes" or idols (they look like tiki dolls...think, Brady Bunch goes to Hawaii). The first player to collect all three, wins the game.

There is a chart that tracks the current value of each commodity. When players sell a commodity, the asking price goes down. Certain other actions, make the asking price rise. Like the stock market, the ideal strategy is to buy low and sell high, but of course, there are all sorts of sneaky actions that make it difficult to get the best price for goods and this adds a good deal of chaos to the proceedings.

The most innovative part of the game is that with three different sets, you can set up a 15-player game in which players must travel from board to board to collect all of their goods. How cool is that?!?

A special mention must be made for the superb artwork provided by Maura Kalusky, the talented artist that also lovingly created the top-notch artwork for Power Grid and other Friese titles.

Highly recommended.

Strange game - players wander around a board buying/trading/selling goods for different goods or cash.  The ultimate aim is to cash in a set of 3/4/5 goods to acquire three fetishes to win the game.  Felt like a race game of Samarkand, but with so much going on between turns it felt difficult to plan ahead - this is because every "shop" that is stopped in triggers events that can occur all over the board.  Essentially a pick up and deliver game, with a gimmick where you can play with three sets (15 people) and swap tables.  Looks great, plays quickly, and certainly not awful.

Ah the fabled FFF.  This has a definite appeal to me in that the multitable aspect is unique in my collection.  This added dimension forces the players to litterally think on their feet.  Although I only played on a single board I have every reason to believe that the game definitely shines once a crowd can be summoned and played on all three boards.  The math in this game does not appear to be as balanced as in PowerGrid but it still works.  My concern lies more with some the tiles and potentially broken combinations of stores.  All in all, I enjoy this and look forward to a full-blown session.

Enjoyed the track-plotting aspects, but felt strangely flat over the first couple of plays.  Will certainly be trying again, - I'd like to like it to get that second or third set...  2006 - first play in a long time - doesn't quite capture me still, but there is definitely a game in there.

Played one game with nine players on two boards. Not sure what to think; I love the idea, I love the artwork, and I generally like pickup-and-deliver games, but something was disjointed about FFF; with more than one table you'll want to play as quickly as possible, but the game is a little on the convoluted side (are there, like, nineteen different icons?), and moreover there's a lot of information to consider on your turn, so I felt a little frustrated at not being able to take my time. I'd try it again, but my gut tells me that the game just should have been simpler.

Sure, the multiple-table gameplay is pretty cool and innovative, but it's just not a fun game.  I don't think I've never seen a game with more "players' actions randomly screw you HARD" than this game, and that was even with only three people at the table.  Later in the game you're more resilient to these sorts of things, but early on, what's basically bad luck can cost you the game.  And not only does it penalize slow thinkers, but it penalizes EVERYONE at the same table.  Ugh.  I don't want to play this one again.

Played 15-player at BGG.con. It was a very epic event; three copies of the game for 3 separate boards, you won if you collected a fetish at each board. I was dismayed at the speed my starting table was moving at but one of the guys who started at my table ended up being the winner.

RATING: 6
Once you've waded through the long rules and understood the cartoon graphics, this turns out to be a simple 'travel and trade' game of opportunistically buying low and selling high. The movement rules are clearly designed on a 'more players the merrier' basis, but this gives the game a high chaos factor as stalls generate production on other stalls and you could throw the game to an opponent without realising. Not a game to take too seriously and as much frustration as fun.

My first game, I played in a 3-board, 11-player game.  The whole board switching mechanism makes it a unique experience.  You're buying and selling resources, trying to get the correct collection of resources to collect a game-winning token (called a fetish).  In the 3-board version, you need to collect one from each board.

I had a total blast at playing this with nine players my first time.  Rules are a bit longer to learn for such a medium weight game tho.  It's such a cool idea, and mechanic, that you can ferry yourself onto the another (different) 2nd playing board.  Bartering and playing with the commodities board and tactical movement all combine for an excellent menu of actions to fulfill with high interaction between players on the same board.

Finally got to experience this after a couple false starts in years past, and played it with a great group of friends. It was worth the wait just for its unusual table hopping mechanic which left me alone for a short while at one table with nothing to do. Overall, the gameplay was a tad underwhelming from what I expected; but it still made for a good experience to share with the full complement of 15 players. So, I'd recommend it to play at least once.

Very funny game - a pity some of the humour is lost on the translation (or non-translation). There are many options each turn and it's hard to think ahead, but the game will suffer a lot if players take too long to make their moves. It offers an interesting dilemma: if you try to get rich a fast player may win the game before you, if you go too fast the lack of money will certainly slow you down later. Of course, it's so much better (and chaotic) when you play with 3 copies and 11 or more players! However, it has lots of 'upkeeping' each round and it can take more than 2 hours to end.

This game is a ton of fun. I have played with a single board, and with 2 boards. I think that the more boards the better the game. With multiple boards, speed of play matters so if you get on a slow board you will be at a disadvantage. For this reason I think 3 boards is the only way to go here. 

The game plays faster than you would think for the number of people in the game. Worth a try and certainly good to see FF keeping things interesting.

Played with 2 boards and I thought it was a really fun resource-management racing game. My biggest complaint was that it ended earlier than I expected & I would have loved to have kept going (should have played for second & third place). Ingenious design as each city (board) has the same stocks but different stock systems. You don't know the value of the stocks in the other city until you travel to it via ferry. Nor do you know what commodities the store-owners are looking for. When you're ready to ferry to the other city you literally take all of your commodities, money & fetishes and walk over to the other board and sit behind (to the right) of the player who's currently taking their turn. You have to collect 3 fetishes to win but cannot collect your second fetish in the same city you collected your first one in. Remember it's a race game so a large number of players in one city slows down the turn cycle. The rules can seem overwhelming at first but it's really a simple game with a ton (20, or so) of icons to learn ... just print out a few player-aids an you'll be up & running in no time.

[played twice]

ok, it's not a bad game, but there's few points that makes me give 6.5 as rating:
1. in my group it's a very slow-paced game: many moves takes long amount of time, although the group is not composed of chess-player-like people.
2. adjusting quotation of products it's a boring task to do and sometime we forget to do it :-(.
3. sometimes happens that two or three nearby shops allows one/two players doing very good loops between them early in the game that skyrocket them towards the victory.

Really nothing exciting here. It's a somewhat random, multiple solitaire, trading/production game. The pace of the game gets bogged down by the slow movement around the board, which doesn't really serve much purpose. Also, the market system, while isn't as broken as in Supremacy, does have a flaw or two: we managed to have all of the fish stockpiled in one merchant, with the price stuck at the highest level, and essentially no real way to bring the cost down.

Multiplayer solitaire game (like Pangea, Tikal, Goldland), but way worse. Players wander around using ferries or on foot to buy 6 different commodities, then sell them to get 3 "fetishes" to win the game. Confusing buy/sell mechanisms between traders and merchants, then they trigger a random event after you deal with them, in our game someone sold goods for $600 almost running the bank out, prices of commodities were randomly fluctuating, and on top of all that everyone gets a random action (eg close a merchant for a turn).

One session played with 2 tables and 7 players. Interesting ideas and amazingly good production values for an FF game. I found the game way too chaotic, though, as you couldn't plan your next move because, inevitably, the board situation would change drastically before the play rolled around to you again. I also had some trouble absorbing and processing all the various icons quickly enough to analyze my position and options before I felt I was slowing things down too much for the other players (especially since in a two or more board game, speedy play is something of an issue). I would like to try the game with 3 tables and an even number of players on each board, as well as a single board game. If you were looking for the next Funkenschlag, you're going to be terribly disappointed, but I could see my rating increasing as I became more familair with this very strange game. *UPDATE* The rating went from a 5 to a 6 after a single-board game recently. I still don't think it's a great game, but I did enjoy it much more without the time pressure.

Well it's certainly good novelty value. It's actually a dressed up, sped up Samarkand. Go around and around between locations, spend money to gather goods, trade goods for better goods, and then hand them in for your winning objectives (fetishes vs more money in Samarkand). But all the rush-rush hides the fact there's not much game there.

RATING: 5
An interesting game when played in the multi-board format as it introduces time pressure, but not as extreme as if there was a timer on each of your moves.  The base trading game seems solid but a little dull, so the spice of inter-table movement is nice.  The movement rules and special actions are perhaps a little fiddly for a speed game.  There is certainly inter-player interaction which is unusual for this sort of game, but it feels a little unbalanced: at the traders there is no interaction, but at the vendors the actions of other players in buying up the supply of goods is key.  This seems to make a trade-heavy strategy desirable over a sell-buy one, as it minimizes the risk of someone messing with your plans.  Some of the shop powers like swapping goods around inject too much chaos in a game where you need to be planning a few moves ahead.  Workable and of some interest, but I think the best ideas in it will eventually be realised in a better game.

I've only played this with 3 people, but expect it to improve with more players / sets. There's some subtlety there in the financial system, but it would be hard to get enough players and sets together on regular basis and get to know it.

RATING: 8
This is an extraordinary, if flawed, game.  The central concept isn't that interesting (buy and sell at different shops to manipulate prices) but the sheer insanity of the idea that you can play across multiple boards is nothing short of inspired.  It's just a shame that it doesn't quite work properly (the systems for dealing with cross-board play are fine, but prone to breaking.)  A slightly unclear set of rules doesn't help.  I would never want to play this as a regular single-board game (it's just dull.)  With some slight modifications this could be astonishing, but as it stands it's not quite there.

Need to play again! The multiboard aspect of this game makes it very original but in my one playing we found the table with one fewer players got more turns and therefore advanced more readily. The fact the larger table were more inebriated may have had something to do with it as well. I want to play with even numbers on both boards at the start and see how that goes.

Fische Fluppen Frikadellen -- I've never played with more than one board.  Under the enjoyably silly artwork, this game has some real bones.  The board layout doesn't change, but which Vendors are on the board (and at which locations) does change.  Limiting which Vendors (Traders and Merchants) are on the board to any contiguous sequence of 12 of the available 36 is a great way to maintain balance while guaranteeing variability.  While it is clearly more tactical than strategic, strategy  can play a significant role.  I hope to have the chance to play it with more than one board.

RATING: 6.5
An interesting combination of a race, trading and movement. Players have limited movement points to get around the board in order to buy, sell or trade items. The ultimate aim is to get enough items to trade for fetishes (3 of the same to get the first, 4 for the second and 5 for the third). As with euros, there's always a desire to do more than is possible.

The artwork is quirky and there seems to be replayability with the varied number of different traders. It's a well playtested but not wholly exciting game.

RATING: 4
Doesn&#039;t work for me.  Things can change so much between turns that long term stategy is fairly useless and your options are so limited that there isn&#039;t much choice when your turn does come.  Perhaps it&#039;s more fun with more than one table, but I&#039;m not really interested.  The art and wacky style ARE quite cool, however.

Wheee!  This is a wonderful resource management race.  The funny thing about this is that while there is a well designed economic model here, it is easy to forget that you are only getting money to get goods to get the totems (Fetishes).  The game requires you to urge your table along, take advantage of spaces that others have occupied and make the wisest movement decisions under a frenetic pace.  While you could technically play this game on one board, I feel that the majority of the tension would be striped from the game.

When you include another board into the mix, the game spurs players, on as you don't really know what it going on at the other table, and you don't want to be left in the dust.  Really, this is one of the most fun party games for gamers.  If I had another table and more room in my New York apartment I'd get the third board.

My only complaint is that it may be anti-climactic if a player wins on another board. I suggest playing for second and third place.

One of the more interesting mechanisms I've seen, as we played with two boards.  Overall, still fun, despite a couple problems:  slower players can slow you down through no fault of your own and the game plays somewhat randomly.  Exciting towards the finish though.  For a large group, I prefer Fantasy Business.

Great fun, but only if you play on multiple boards. Then it becomes a really frantic game, where the rush and excitement of running between different boards and urging your fellow players to hurry up outshines the fact that it's basically a pretty average game of logistics.

RATING: 7
Interesting game where players move around the board trading commodities such as hamburgers, cigarettes, fish and booze in an attempt to build sets.  Friedemann's trademark sense of humor and penchant for the color green and words beginning with the letter F come together in a quirky and enjoyable game.  I haven't played with multiple tables.  It seems that it would be very interesting to play it that way and I could see it would be a very different game.

Based on one playing only: it is fun and relatively light-hearted, but I didn't find it particularly subtle in terms of its mechanics or the options it gave you.  It seems that your early moves really dictate what you end up doing for the rest of the game.  Not a classic.

I've been lucky enough only to play this with 15.  The race element feels like it adds a lot to the experience, as does moving between tables.

I may give it a go as a five player, but it seems that the AP may prove unmanageable as players min/max their turns.

Four things I love about this game: 1) Combining boards to play one big game  2) The simulated stock market  3) Opportunity to figure out clever ways to exploit the types of stores, different every game  4) The interesting board movement options using rafts separates this game from any other.
Only downside is it can be a little on the longside and harder for new gamers to pick up.

Have only played this once, on a double board surprisingly.  I liked the novelness of it, and the buy/sell/race aspect.

Decent move optimization game with a considerable take that element and excellent components. The large number of booth tiles and variable setup ensure replayability. Do not play with players who are prone to AP.

I consider this game my &#039;Best Buy on Spiel 2002 Essen&#039;. It has a lot going for it: tactical/strategical, lots of interaction (you can make your opponents game life miserable ;)), excellent graphics, and a good dose of humor. Another pro is that you can actually play this game with a minimum of 2, and when you have more than one board, up to 10 or even 15 players, due to the ingenious (I quote) &#039;dynamic table changing system&#039;.

A fun game with 8 players.  We play that if a person is left alone at a table, they must wait for someone else to arrive before play there can continue.  It's important to remember that you cannot have more than 7 commodities and your movement is over once you take an action at a merchant.

An odd game, but fun.  I'm not sure that it will have too much staying power.  The strategy doesn't seem to be that difficult to get a grip on.

After another play, it seems to me that not only is the strategy easy to get a grip on, but more importantly, for any board set up, it seems like there aren't going to be more than one, or maybe two ways to win.  If it took 45-60 minutes, that would be ok.  For a longer game, it isn't meaty enough.

First play with 2 boards with 8 ppl. Very enjoyable game.. game felt prematurely short however as we did not play with the errata that we have to change table everytime we pick up new fetish. Some ended up with only 1 fetish at the end of the game. Did not feel the downtime as i feared even when we had 7 on our table at one time. Very much looking forward to play again.

Played 15 player 3 table version at BGG Con 2015. Game is a pretty basic economic and pick up deliver type game but the 3 table thing made it pretty unique. Was very interesting to be able to get up and move around to tables. This also added an element of being rushed by other players to take your turn very quickly which I didn't like. Fun to have played but probably wouldn't want to do it again.

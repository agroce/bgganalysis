As much as I love the theme, the movement and unit recruiting were too fiddly for me.  I didn't like having turns where I couldn't possibly recruit, and because the movement is so random, you can't set up for future movement either.

I don't know what to think about Titan. I DO like the game a great deal, but I'm uncertain as to whether it's luck or strategy that saves the day for the average player. I need to read some older articles from The General regarding strategy for this. Also considering experimenting with the solo rules to see if it can serve as a good solitaire game.

Update: Playing Titan using Colossus is a great way to become familiar with the rules. You need to slow things down quite a bit when dealing with the battle boards though. Still, the more I play this, the more I find Titan an interesting game. I look forward to playing it at the WBC next August.

Scheint ein sehr nettes taktisches Spiel zu sein. Damit man da aber strategisch gut Handeln kann, muss man das schon ein paar mal spielen, damit sich einem die Evolution und deren Fähigkeiten einprägen. Dann kann man sich auch besser merken, wo welche Einheiten versteckt sind. Das Spiel ansich ist aber kein SPiel, was man mal gerade eben so spielt. Das dauert schon mehrere Stunden, wenn man es richtig spielen will. Aber mal echt was anderes. Leider noch nicht auf Deutsch zu haben.

With a surprisingly simple rule system, Titan is not a complex game per se. However, movement plus mustering is ferociously time consuming for newbies. The game is designed (apparently) to take an enormous amount of time to play plus has player elimination - double strike. Turns take an incredible amount of time as well, so you could (and I have!) play a side game of any number of fillers while awaiting your turn. The on-line version (Colossus) takes *minutes* to play in comparison - demonstrating the obstuseness of this venerable monster. Avoid it.

Reedición de un clásico de los 80 de pegarse toñas, de tu titan que arrastra ejercitos, a lo wargame tipo un heroes of might & magic. Igual de largo o más que el juego de PC xDDDD A ver, este juego ha envejecido muy mal, en los 80 seguro fue la bomba, pero ahora el mencionado videojuego, el fantasy general o su version PC "colossus" le dan mil vueltas porque no hay quien aguante 1,5 horas montando ejercito sin pegarse y que cuando te vas a pegar es otra eternidad en cada tablero especial de cada terreno y tirando quinientos mil dados y reglas especiales de cada terreno. Repito este juego, para PC. En mesa infumable.

RATING: 7
I'd rate this higher but for two things.  First, usually someone gets bumped out of the game quickly and they get to sit around with not much to do.  Second, the battles can take a bit too long at times.  I've looked at the reprint and it looks artistically nicer, but I'm quite happy with my AH version.

I am a total sucker for this ridiculous game!

The original art from the 1980 edition is SO evocative of its time and its theme.

I was surprised to see it reprinted in essentially the same form. I would have expected nicer battleboards, and a giant box full of plastic, and perhaps some overhaul of the simplistic chuck tons of dice combat. Oh, and adding decks of spell cards for the wizards and titans, of course LOL

RATING: 3
This game reminds me a lot of the old genesys game "master of monsters" where you recruit ever better monsters and evolve them into even better ones in order to build an army and conquer other gods. In Titan, you are doing something similar but recruitment of better monsters is more determined by your current army configuration and the lands you visit. The game has a following but is dated. The rules are written like an engineering manual (1.1.1, 1.1.2) with few if any visual examples and lots of block text. If you can get past that the game is fine. Though it has player elimination and can run long so this can end up to be not fun if someone is eliminated early and the game takes several more hours to resolve. Titan is a great game for its time but times have changed.

Best game I have played. Its main drawback is that players are eliminated and the variable length. However, it is one of the few multi-player games which rewards aggressive play and which it not subject to a lot of kingmaking.

I had the pleasure of being introduced to this game by a Valley Games rep at Origins 2008.  I had a great time in this four player game even though my Titan was destroyed in turn four.

The inspiration for the Heroes of Might and Magic computer games? Fun for a while to collect and upgrade creatures and play out the battles on separate boards, but it becomes repetitive as the game stretches on for hours. It's particular variant of roll and move leaves me cold as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Titan is a fantasy wargame for 2 to 6 players.  Each player will move, muster and engage in combat with his forces of monstrous characters. Each player receives one Titan and if it's lost the player is out of the game.  There are two areas of player interaction: Masterplay and Battle. The strategic area, Masterplay, involves the movement of each player's forces from land to land.  Forces are grouped into Legions and move throughout the 11 types of terrains. There are 19 Characters (creatures) that can be mustered from the various terrains.  Battles are played on the tactical battleland corresponding to the land (terrain) of the engagement.  In battles, character will perform better in their own terrain.  Have your Legions search for recruits, then find the enemy! Who will be Lord of the land?

Expected playing time is about 3 - 4 hours.

One of my favorite games of all time.  It has both interesting strategy and tactics.

First 2 plays on colossus app. I'm impressed. A very complicated game with very simple rules. The good thing is that i can see how deep this one goes in terms of strategy despite playing two times. It is boundless! 

I can understand why this game is not more popular but i must say it is wonderful! 
Luck is present but rarely game breaking. The amount of information that you must assess before making your move is absolutely breathtaking. Not only you must move the legions but you must assess whether you will be forced to attack a stack later or be attacked by one and whether you will have tactical advantages in the terrain you are standing and whether it is worth skipping a muster for it... and it goes like this all game long.

For the time being i am unable to calculate all this stuff but i know all these are present. 

Conclusion:  This game has very deep strategy but very steep learning curve. 

PS. WOW. I am still wondering what train hit me!

update 10/03/2013
I wish i could rate this higher than 10. :P
20+ plays later, i can safely say that this game is wonderful and very well balanced. It should be since it stood the tournament test for 30 YEARS and had already been in development for 10! This is a very rare game that fully justifies the time you spend on it. Don't let the "luck of the dice" deceive you. Luck is present but not prevalent.

RATING: 6.5
I like mechanics, but if played until the very end, it could become too long; after many plays it could become pointless; if played with more than 3 players, each one with many legions to manouvre, it surely becomes annoying: what have to do the other players while one moves or two of them fight each other?

Decent game.  I can see the appeal, though it is really not not my style.  I played with three players, and I honestly can not imagine playing with more, especially as long as it took (I didn't even get through the whole game).  But, it was fairly easy to pick up, and while the intricacies came slowly, I felt like I got enough of a taste to maybe try again.  I'd have to have more of a block of time, however.

Great theme - love the evolving stacks concept.  I've played 15 minute games of Titan and 8 hour marathons of Titan and loved them both.  Lots of chesslike elements - especially in the 2-player version.

After seven plays, we found this game uninspiring, even in the company of ardent and enthusiastic players.

Jó ideje ki akartam próbálni ezt a több, mint 30 éves játékot, végre sikerült, és nem is okozott csalódást. Az alapötlet szerintem nagyon jó, nem tudom, hogy honnan merített, de én még nem láttam hasonlót társasjátékban: van egy fő játéktábla, ahol a légióinkkal mozgunk, ha pedig ellenséges légiók találkoznak, akkor előveszünk egy külön táblát, ami az adott tereptípusnak megfelel, és ott lejátsszuk a csatát (mintegy rázoomolunk a térképre), ami szinte egy önálló játékkal felér. Mivel elég sok tereptípus van, a sok tábla miatt a szó minden értelmében nehéz a játék... Ami nekem nem tetszett túlzottan, az a fő táblán való mozgás: kissé nehézkes, és túlságosan véletlenszerű: nehéz tudatosan toborozni, illetve csatára kényszeríteni a másikat. Ami tetszik, az az egyes csataterek megoldása, a pontszámlálás (egységek pontértéke, Titán fejlődése, Angyalok idézése, stb.), az osztódás, és a hierarchikus toborzási rendszer. Ja és külön dicséret azért, hogy volt önkritikájuk, és egy csomó rövidítési lehetőséget beépítettek a játékba. Mi pl. 2 órás partit játszottunk, de lehet pl. fix pontszámig játszani, vagy bizonyos lényeket kihagyni... Valószínűleg többen izgalmasabb (mi csak ketten próbáltuk), de szerintem biztos vontatottabb is.

Volt, aki a sakkhoz hasonlította ezt a játékot, de sokkal inkább wargame (toborzás, kockadobálás, támadási érték, tereptípusok, stb.).

A kivitel szuper, jellemző a kiadóra! Amikor anno megvettem, volt egy dohos bája, mintha valami borospincében gyártották volna, mára sajnos elmúlt ez a szag:)

Mint a régi játékok általában, ez is tud olyat mutatni, amit a sok mai egyenjáték mellett igazán más (és jó is).
---
Megjegyzés: a szabályban nem esik szó arról, hogy kevesebb egység kerül-e játékba kevesebb játékos esetén. Így viszont nem sok értelmét látom bizonyos egységek korlátosságának.
---
Negatívumok közt muszáj megemlíteni a hely- és az időigényét. Bár dicsértem a rövidítési lehetőségeket, az igazsághoz hozzátartozik, hogy pár óra alatt viszont nem sok minden történik. Valamit valamiért:)

One of the all-time greats. If two people fight, a third player may gain or lose. Compare most games, where "You and him" fighting is good for me. Very difficult to attack the leader. I've played ~200+ games (before logging them here).

It does help to have a short game to play when a battle breaks out (unless you like watching the battles).

RATING: 2
The concept sounds brilliant - wandering around the map, hiring ever stronger fantasy creatures and pitting them against your opponents in tactical battles ala PC's "Heroes of Might and Magic". Add to that that this game has very good graphics and it all sounds almost too good. Unfortunately in practice it plays out far less impresive than it sounds. The tactical battles are indeed very fun and are the best part of the game but the movement on the "world map" is more of a grind considering that you can have up to 12 legions and before considering where you will move each of them you need to look what troops are in there, it's exhausting doing it each turn in, each turn out. Maybe the simple solution would be to decrease the max number of legions to 3 or 4 but then it would be a different game. The other slightly disappointing thing is that despite huge number of creatures they all kinda feel the same, you would want them to have some inherent unique abilities much like in HOMM, and not just gradual increases in two basic stats with different names/pictures on them.

Titan always brings back great childhood memories.  I remember playing the game for the first time at my Cousin Craig's house and the great flood of games played after.  We were kids and 4-6 hour game time was not an issue during those long summers.  I've played in a Gencon tourney in the last 10 years and played a few games of colosus computer game (free titan clone), but have not had the desire to pull it out and play a live opponent.  Titan is definately one of the best that AH produced, but its days at my table are pretty much over....  Titan still  gets a 9 in my book because of its classic status and that I still would not turn down a game.

After one play in which I was quickly eliminated in round 3! Seems to be the game Heroes of Might and Magic was based on, although the roll and move mechanism leaves something to be desired, leaving perhaps too much luck as a determinative factor. Tactical battles are much better, with the player having full control of unit deployment and moves. Looking forward to examing the Valley Games reprint.

I neither have been very long nor very deep into this game - so the rating may be a little optimistic - but I'm enormously attracted by the blend of classic boardgame virtues (setting up the best movement odds like in backgammon; trying to tell the hidden stack information from the rational actions of your opponent like in poker) on the one hand and the ameritrashy theme and mechanism of tactical battles on the other. 

After a unpromising start, the game got better and better. In the meantime I have played 10+ matches against human oppponents and a lot more colossus games. I still feel there's a LOT to learn, an aspect that means much to me.

Edit: I'd love to give this game a better rating, but I simply can't, since it has gigantic drawbacks from a modern persepctive: Playing Time, Downtime and for the most of all Player Elimination (which can happen very early).

I like the mechanics of gathering armies and the battle mechanics. What kills this one for me is the down time and length, especially since it is play elimination.

My rating would be higher without the down time and elimination.

I've always liked the way this game scales between strategic army movement and individual battles on battle boards.  It takes so long to play though, that I've only played it three times in all the years I've owned it.

RATING: 6.5
2017 - (6.5) - I think it's unlikely I'd play this face to face ever again; it is (potentially) a very long game that largely comes down to simple dice.  I have reached this conclusion, however, after logging something like 250 plays on the IOS port, with a win rate hovering right around 50%, so there's obviously something about this game I still find engaging.  The ~ 20 minute playtime on the app is a big plus.

2008 - (7.5) - Oddly, a very long dice-fest that I actually enjoy.  The longer it gets since my last playing the more the rating goes up ;-)  It helps that there is a Java version of this game playable in about 20 minutes.

Well, I managed to snag a copy of this on Ebay last year for under $40, I got lucky, and after playing it a few times, I really don't see what the big deal is.  It's an ok game, but it plays slow, the components are dated and ugly, and it has a few mechanics problems.  It needs redone, streamlined and a face lift to make it worth the prices it sells for.   Don't expect to finish a game of 4+ players in one evening.  Lots of down time between turs while you watch the other Titans do battle.  Even though I could easily double my money on Ebay, I think I'll keep this one.  Some in our group like it.  Ok the tedium of downtime finally got to me, I don't really see the appeal.  Sold on ebay for a profit and bought like 4 new games. THANKS whoever you were.

Classic game with cool concepts. I find the development of units a bit cumbersome and out dated, though many would argue that this is the beauty of the game. Knowing the board and how to split for optimum recruit options is still dictated by a die roll. Yes it is true that you could choose to not move and wait for the roll you need, but are you really gaining anything? No, this just adds time to an already long game. A two player game may be the best option for this one.

Updated rating to a solid 7. With more plays this game grows on you. Fun tossing dice.

This is a truly excellent game. Really like the mechanics, something rather computer game like which I really enjoy. You have these big groups of monsters which you get to attack your opponents with when hey land on the same square, really fun battles! The only problem I have, and the reason why I never play it, is the play time involved. Several hours, I would say 4+ most often, and if I have that kind of time my friends usually want to play Warhammer or something else.

RATING: 8
The relic of an age past, Titan is what I call a real game: lots of dice, a solid theme, heavy interaction among the players and that kind of fashion (some would argue a better word is «naivety») you can only find in the old games’ simple art and graphics.

As far as Titan goes, it plays very long, with no other goal than to obliterate every other player: this means long periods of downtime while the active players are exchanging courtesies in an old-fashioned style, yet even staring them and commenting their actions is part of the actual fun.

I’ve started playing Titan very recently and there are many things I have yet to discover: still, the game is quickly climbing the ladder of my preferences and placing among the ones I like the most. I’ve no doubt my rating will improve even further over playing it more.

If you love to roll dice as much as I do then Titan is the realm of your dreams.

A fun little game.  I tend to play overly aggressive with my Titan stack, and suffer the consequences.  A bummer if you get knocked out early.  You might as well go home then rather than face the three more hours of kibitzing.Fun strategies.  I did well in one game with the Choo choo train strategy in 'the slot.'  I don't think I won, but everyone got out of my way, and I had a lot of fun.We also used to play erroneously that the loser got kill points too.  The Titans were really gruesome then!The best strategy I've found so far is to try to dominate the center.  Those Collossi are yours!The tactics are the standard maximize the 'your monsters in melee' vs. 'opponents monsters in melee' ratio, although a Titan stack allows for the fun suicide attack on the Titan tactic.  Especially effective for the attacker with an angel somewhere.  Don't fall into the trap of overly relying on range strikers, especially if you are the attacker.I love this game, as the worn condition of my pieces and boards can attest.

I used to play with a bunch of Titan grognards who kind of ruined it for me.  They did make for fast games, though.  They would regularly finish a game in under an hour, by attacking each other constantly.  It's only a marathon if you're too timid.  Remembering the contents of stacks is very important.

Classic slugfest from Avalon Hill at its peak. Up to six players build fantasy armies that rove (roll and move) about a "masterboard" in individual stacks that are recruiting (to a maximum of seven creatures per stack) while maneuvering to do battle with each other (made problematic by the roll and move mechanic coupled with movement restrictions built into the unique hex board structure). Once two stacks manage to collide the battle may (players choice) be fought on a battleboard that represents one of the eleven distinct terrain hexes in the game, where each creature in the stack has its own movement and combat capabilities. The combat system is an early form of "buckets of dice" but is actually very elegant in its execution.

A game with a very satisfying combination of operational and tactical elements but which suffers from aspects that are seldom tolerated in modern multi-player games: "roll and move," player elimination (last man standing wins), serious downtime issues (as most people define the term) and long playing times.

I predict interest in the Valley Games re-print will pretty much be restricted to gamers like myself who missed it first time around and want it mainly for the nostalgia factor. I somehow doubt that I'll get our group to play it more than once...

Note: the VG edition is out now and it is absolutely drop-dead gorgeous! What a labour of love. It is basically identical to the older AH edition (rules wise) but with every component upgraded to today's standards. Congratulations VG! On the other hand, what I said about the game itself still stands. It's going to be interesting to see if the game develops a new following of any size. I've given this edition a decent rating just for the care and attention given to the presentation (which is also captured well in the IOS app).

In the 80's this would have rated a 10 for me (played it over and over and over), but now ... it has player elimination which isn't good (in many circumstances), and also it's too long. Oh, and there's a definite steep mastery curve - a beginner is gonna get creamed by an expert! And a game with mixed skill levels isn't good, Saying all that, if someone asks to play, I'll play ... definitely great as a 2-player.

Own Avalon Hill and Valley Games version (I think the Avalon Hill just wins out as I love the counter art)

Avalon Hill version is 2nd copy - wore the first one out (so much so the stack markers were unrecognisable).

Bring forth the TITATN!!

This is an awesome game where you try to run minions through terrain that will allow them to spawn the very best offspring.

When you think your stack of chits is better than your opponets you chase them down and bump them.  The battle ground appears and you duke it out.

It is both strategic and tactical.

Primarily it is a memory game.  Secondarily it is a game of luck.  Crappy dice rolls can ursurp the greatest of wit and planning.

A big board full of hexes and counters! Where every hex expands into a separate board with MORE HEXES!! And then you throw a CRATELOAD of DICE into your dice tower and eat your opponent with a GIANT SERPENT!!!

Takes an entire evening to play? Good.
Some downtime between turns? No worry, keep another quick game on the side.
Players eliminated and there's probably two hours left to go? DEAL WITH IT.

I love everything about this game. I played it as a child, thought about it off and on for ten years and then bought a mint Avalon Hill copy (still in shrinkwrap!) on eBay for far too much money because I'm completely insane. I REGRET NOTHING. It's certainly not for everyone, but with the right group of people that are willing to invest the time and play aggressively (and taunt each other throughout), there is no comparison. This is the game that made me love board games.

One of the greatest, if not the greatest 3 player primal combat games out there, IF playing with the card variant to reduce luck on mustering. They don't make games like this anymore: No cubes to push, no candy coating to protect players, no artificial game ends and no artificial Eurorised elements. This game usually always has an epic climax, and even after hours of play an/or elimination, no other game creates such feelings of excitement, survivability, fear, power, greed as this one. If you an old school gamer like me or even a new age gamer who only has tried Euro's, do yourself a favour, commit an evening, and give this a try. You won't be dissapointed. I would still rate this in my top 5 games of all time, even after playing 100's of the new generation of Euro's and others.

UPDATE: I've just discovered Colossus, a very nice Java program for playing Titan. I'd like to "thank" Peter Haslehurst for introducing me to this program on his nimrods blog, because now I am wasting a good deal of time playing Titan against computer opponents. It's great, because the computer opponents are actually pretty good, and you can play a game in a fraction of the time face-to-face requires. I'm better at the face-to-face games, because getting a read on your opponents is a fairly useful skill face-to-face that doesn't come into play here, and because I can track legions better than most in the relaxed atmosphere of face-to-face instead of the lightning speed of the computer game. But it's still a lot of fun. Colossus provides many variants, my favorite of which is Ultimate, but it can be a little long and the larger board size means it can take a clearly winning player a little too long to track down and finish off a weak position. But I like the new creatures, and I like the new board space, both of which I think are well-designed additions to the game.
---
Another one of the very few 20-year old games that has hardly aged; as much fun now as it was when it first came out, and almost infinitely replayable. The player-elimination problem is an issue, but get past that and this is a first-rate game.

I have realized recently that if you accept that Titan is a great game, you also have to accept that Monopoly is at least a rather good game. Funny how that works, sometimes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The new Valley Games edition of Titan is very nice, probably their nicest game yet. The only possible quibble is that the Green and Black colors are a little close, but that's minor. I really like the spacious and colorful board, and the substantial chits. I originally thought the CGI monsters wouldn't work for me, and while they certainly are overly-detailed, the effect is good.
---
I rate Titan a 9, but you need to be aware of a few things:
- It's an elimination game, so you gotta get past that. Good for game gatherings and games days with lots of people where you can just go play something else. It's also a great 2-player game.
- It's gotta move along reasonably well. On the one hand, there is a lot of depth to the game. On the other hand, there is a lot of luck too. It rewards thinking about it and being careful, as mistakes can cost you; but you don't want to go nuts. Respect the time of your fellow-players.
- The game really rewards a good memory. In my younger days, when I had an exceptional memory for this sort of thing, I was almost unbeatable at Titan. Nowadays, not so much; you just can't play as well when you're missing information. For me, this is another good reason the game should move; the faster the game moves, the more likely stuff is going to stick in the memory banks, and everyone concerned can play a better game. But, having harped on this twice now, I don't want to harp on it too much; moving too fast means mistakes, and games of Titan can turn on a few mistakes.

I do love Titan, but it does have two problems in my mind: a tendency towards getting bogged down just by the nature of the game, and a somewhat unpredictable length. Not Dune-level unpredictable, but still. A game with 4 good players played briskly should go 4 hours. But it can also go 2, or it can go 6, or sometimes even more if a very well-balanced situation develops. I wish it could reliably check in at 4. If it could, it would be perfect.

I'm not sure where the sweet spot is with respect to the number of players. 2 players is great. 4 works well, although it can be long. 5 or 6 is better than you might think, although someone will almost certainly check out pretty rapidly.

Chris' Play Tip: The game tends to be about Ranger/Gorgon kill stacks and building up one, maybe two power stacks, most likely with Serpents or Hydras. The Colossus track is  an incredibly difficult one and outside of 2-player games, it requires luck to work. Unless you get the right rolls early and get on the track quickly, don't try to mess with it. Instead, the game is about maintaining balance, keeping your options open, building up quickly, and knowing when to strike. This game is not for the timid.

Good, solid fun.  I like "growth" games and find mustering new units more fun than it probably should be.  :)  That said, die rolls can make a massive difference and board movement is a bit clunky.  There's also a runaway leader problem.

Titan is one of those games you need to have played, so I’m glad that I finally got to try it. I was very surprised by the gameplay; it wasn’t anything like I had imagined. I don’t really know what I had expected, but certainly not this. The game was actually quite interesting, and my somewhat low rating is only because I didn’t really understand what was going on (played against three experienced players and one other beginner) and because I rolled poorly. The movement on the board is quite confusing for new players and decreased my rating of the game a bit, but I’m sure it will be easier to maneuver and plan ahead after repeated plays.

I loved the tech tree and how to get new creatures; tech trees and upgrades like that is always something I enjoy! Oh, and the actual combat with those creatures was quite cool! I think the different terrains for each of the battles add to the enjoyment and replayability of the game. However, there is some downtime as the other players need to watch your battle and vice versa.
Also, the length of the game and the player elimination truly sucks – therefore we played with the variant (just this time, normally the guys play the full game!) that we count up points after one Titan is dead. I would like to try the “real” game in full, but most likely just with 3 or max 4 players. I’ve heard so many stories about the game taking 8-12 hours, and that’s obviously way too much, but if it can be done in 3 hours or so I am intrigued. Even though the player elimination is a bad mechanic in the game, I guess you can just play another game when at least two players are eliminated. An interesting game which I will have to explore some more; my rating is likely to slightly increase.

Dice?  Dice?  Did you say Dice?  I don't think the game includes enough dice!  You need more dice!

A slugfest at its best, and one that will frustrate those who hate chaos and randomness.  In a game of four or five people, make sure you bring something else to do while you wait for everyone else to get eliminated.

A really enjoyable game with the right people, and the Valley Games reprint is gorgeous to look at and downright pleasant (and nasty) to play.

An excellent game, but the playing time increases dramatically with each added player. Apart from that, it works equally well with 2-5 players, and the solitaire variant is not bad either.  Plenty of scope for tinkering, also.

RATING: 2
Fantasy, war/fighting, roll & move, nothing to do on someone else's turn, and impossible to keep track of your own pieces means this game is nothing but an unenjoyable slog. I'll find just about anything else to play.

I don't know how to rate Titan.  I really like the gameplay, but I think the downtime could just be too high with many players.  With two players, I think it would be pretty fun.  Maybe if you have experienced players it won't take as long, but I doubt it.  There are many innovative ideas in this game.  It also has less luck than you would think at first blush.  But, for myself, I think there's just too much downtime for a game of this length.

I recently grabbed the AH version (I'm a nostalgic). It's impressive for its elegance, depth and replayabilty. Maybe too long in multiplayer, it's perfect between two players. After just a few games I do not hesitate in stating that's one of the best games in my collection.

A labor of love.  Brilliantly crafted and thought through, this game is a paragon of design.  Yes, it is long, and yes it relies on player elimination, but both qualities, while sometimes frustrating, are elemental extensions of its design.  A game that demands and rewards careful study and maintains  tension and excitement throughout.

Technically, this one belong to my son, but since i purchased it for him (to the tune of $100), i feel some responsiblity to rate it as well.  I REALLY like this one.  The movement around the master map can be frustrating, but the battles are fun.  This one can take a long time too, but how fun is recruiting creatures and then slamming your opponents army with them?  Neat concept and cool.  Some of the pieces are cumbersome (the damage chits for example), but there are ways around them.  Dedicate an entire day to learning and playing this one though...

If it were 1986 again and I was in the same place I was then (i.e. no job, no car, no girlfriend, no responsibilities)then this would have been one of my favorite things to do.  I think it's sad that games like this are dying out because I did spend a large part of my formative years huddled over a table all day/night long with like minded geeks playing things like Titan whilst my "peers" were out going to sports events, parties, and other soulless, meaningless endeavours.  Not that I wouldn't still play it, but I just can't commit to it these days...I _would_ love to see an updated Titan someday, with new bits, streamlined rules.

When I moved to Maryland in '88 I soon found a board game club and tried to hook up with them. There were about 10 or so regulars, most of whom worked for the NSA (a few for NASA, whom I knew from working there and that's how I hooked up with them). They had some odd habits that drove me to distraction (such as telling jokes in Russian all the time), and would not play anything other than Titan. I tried to learn, but they were very cut throat and I would end up sitting around staring at the wall after about 15 minutes, and none of them would even consider any of the games I brought. After several instances of this I stopped going to their meetings. The experience left a bitter taste in my mouth regarding Titan and I've never been able to give it a fair shake since then.

RATING: 6
I loved this game back in college when I had all the time in the world. Now I can't be bothered, as there are some many other games to play. I think that the movement on the main board is really interesting even though it boils down to a basic roll and move mechanic. To me that the fun of the game mostly lies in the movement on the main map board and the mustering. The battles in the Battlelands are only ok and are what really slows the game down to a crawl.

Try out Colossus, a Java version of Titan. It is quick to play, supports multiplayer, has an adaquate AI, and offers several variants. I give Colossus a "10".

Titan is the root of all evil, the reason you can read this text and check my ratings. I started playing it in a home-made copy of '00.

RATING: 6
Fascinating fantasy wargame with many interesting tactical decisions on the main board (master board) and on the miniboards (battlelands). I have the Valley Games edition. The components and art are exceptionally good, except the color scheme of the master board (rating +1). The storage system rocks! (rating +1) Most boardgames fail miserably in providing adequate storage, the VG edition Titan is perfect. However, the age of the game shows. It is a long game and an elimination game. Someone's gaming night will be cut short unless you play with two. (rating -1). IMHO luck plays too much role, especially as regards the movement on the masterboard. The more players, the worse it gets. (rating -2) Sure, in the long run the more skilled player wins more often but it is entirely possible to lose the 4+ hours game just because you had very bad luck in the first three movement rolls. There are other situations where individual roll is crucial, e.g. whether you will be able to summon angel in time or survive to round 4 in order to reinforce. Fortunately, if you play Titan as a two player game the main weaknesses of the game (elimination, luck) are not a factor or have much less impact. (As a two player game I would probably rate the game 8 - it is too early to give definite rating.)

If ever there were a game that struck me as requiring the right group and the right circumstances, this is it. There's a lot to like here. This does a really nice job of balancing macro/micro level of unit management and combat. I've only played on the iPad, but it seems like playing face to face would take forever. And players can be eliminated starting about turn 2 or 3. And there is a ton of dice rolling. But it's all balanced pretty well. As a multiplayer combat game, I find it much better than Eclipse, as there is proper incentive and ability to attack other players right from the beginning. There is also ability to try to run away. And a really nice monster tech tree. I would rate the iPad app +1, and face to face -1 (estimated).

A true classic.  Yes play time can be long, but the game is so engaging that this shouldn't matter.  There is a steep learning curve and because of this, players can be turned off by the length, movement system, and massive amount of die rolling.  Ultimately, I think the investment is worth it.

I can't give it a 1 becuase it's not broken and it is technically a game.  That doesn't mean that I ever want to play it again.

Kind of a shame about the tactical combat system, though- someone should make a better game backbone for it.  It'd probably add 6 points to my score.

I have trouble getting into any game which requires you to bring other games to play during your downtime between turns. (Wait, no - you should be spending other players' turns committing their army compositions to memory. Now that's entertainment.)

I really [i]want[/i] to like Titan, and the positioning, recruiting, and tactical sub-battles can be loads of fun - but the careful tallying/maintenance of scads of damage tokens, the structure which rewards early player knockout in a very long many-player game, and the repeated interminable waiting around... not so much. Two-player games can be entertaining, because you're always involved, but the more players there are, the more painful it becomes.

Note: There's an online java version which speeds things up immensely. Playing that against the computer can be occasionally entertaining (if not overly challenging); it might even speed up multi-player games to the point of reasonable fun per unit time.

Takes quite a long time to play. Some down time for those players not involved in battles. You are pretty much stuffed if you are down to just your Titan, as you then need to get to a tower to get new troops. That is easier said than done if the dice are against you. And on that subject: This game uses a lot of dice. Could be too much of a luck factor for some people. A good game in its time (and still a good game for those that don't mind the long playing time, dice luck etc), but its time has probably been and gone.

RATING: 9.5
An epic scale fantasy wargame where the main feature is that the game is played over two different types of boards - the masterboard which is where the legions move around as determined by roll-and-move and by set route paths which can diverge depending on where they started moving from, and the battleboard where the real action takes place when legions collide.

Man, I don't even know where to begin to describe my feelings with this one. I wish I had the Avalon Hill printing of this in my childhood because Titan is absolutely nuts. It feels like that Heroes of Might and Magic took heavy inspiration from Titan. The wildly variable playing time (the fact that the Valley Games reprint suggests a playing time of 30-240 minutes is a source of great amusement, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's only for 2P) makes this notoriously difficult for me to bring out especially with multiple people but I always, always love playing this. When I was playing this for the first couple times I had made a critical rule mistake that allowed Titans and other lords to freely move around ignoring movement restrictions if they had revealed their legion after rolling a six. The end result was a bloodbath that ended very quickly in a 3P game, but I was largely amused by this accidental house rule. I've yet to play a game that has involved mustering tech level three creatures, but I would love to see how crazy it can get when Titans have twenty power and Colossi are roaming around the masterboard. Chucking buckets of dice to resolve combat is a tactile orgasm.

Fantastic theme! Building an army monsters and fighting is so cool!
Good battles and theme unfortunately can't save it from some extremely poor attributes.
Battles only occur between 2 players, meaning other players have to sit out for long periods of time.
Players can be eliminated early, and the game can last 3+ hours. Elimination is a requirement for the game to end.
Overall it takes far too long for what it is.

I just had a lot of fun running around, recruiting different monsters and duking it out on the battle boards.  Looking forward to another play!

RATING: 10
Titan is one of my all-time favorite games. The theme may be a bit thin, "A monster slugathon", but somehow it managed to still feel very rich. It has a large hexboard for strategic movement, in which players can move through differing terrain types to add monsters to their army that correspond to those areas. There is a fairly arbitrary movement restriction system to move between the hexes, but it served to add a puzzle element to the game; players had to figure out not only what creature was best to add to his or her army, but also how to get to the proper terrain to muster that creature. It has seperate battle terrain boards for each terrain type on the larger board. When a player's army stack entered a hex with an opposing army, they would reveal the army units and place them on the tactical board to battle. The graphics and bits were excellent for its time.

The system had its problems, though. Oftentimes, a player that got attacked early on would get slaughtered and be out of the game immediately, only to sit and watch the other players slug it out for the next 5 hours. This also led to another problem...turtling. Because players didn't want to risk being taken out early, they tended to avoid confrontation and just prance around the board, for turns and turns, just building up their army stacks. Anyway, those weren't deal-breakers for me, especially since, at that time, there were plenty of games out there that were much more clunky than Titan. Much of my interest in the game, I'll admit, is due to nostalgia, but there is nothing wrong with that. Titan is one of the reasons that I became a gamer, those many years ago, and it is one of the reasons that I design games to this day.

Definitely NOT an intuitive game. The movement is kind of funky and it takes awhile to memorize the creature hierchy before the turns start taking reasonable amounts of time.

Something about the game though - I love it.

There are parts of this game that I think are wonderful.  But I have to give it a 4 because the truth us that I will always turn down playing it.  It is too long for me.  I also don't like playing long games where I can get knocked out and will have to wait around for the others to finish.  I especially don't like having to wait for others to have their battles.  This said, I love how it is difficult to gang up on the leader.

What more can be said? The ultimate game in my book.
I highly recommend the Colossus computer version in JAVA. It plays 5x+ faster and has a lot of cool variants built in which I would have never tried otherwise. The variants I mostly play are standard, unified, and pantheon. Of course I will always play face-to-face (whenever I have 3+ willing opponents and about 5hours to spare).

Playing the board game once almost killed this for me.  But it was interesting enough that I tried the computer version and I was hooked.  Run out now and get the Java client Colossus.  With all the ridiculous counter fiddling taken out, you have a pure fantasy wargame with a tech tree.  If you like Warlords or Heroes of Might and Magic on the computer, this game is for you.  Doesn't get to be a 9 since in my mind it is a computer game with a bad boardgame port, not the other way around.  (In fact, I'd call the boardgame a 2.)

RATING: 5
After playing with 6 players 8+ hours it was clear that this dicefest doesn't have enough meat on it's bones to be orbiting the game board for so long. So a bit no-no with 6 players.
I hoped it would be better with 4 players, but the game is just too simplistic and random with this dumb roll-and-move mechanic. It lacks some diceroll modifying power cards or action card mechanics or what not. That can be blamed only on the ancient 1980-s game design which is not up to par with 21st century boardgame standards.
Basically this game is won by the player who can hold off battling the longest. Or in other words the first players to attack each other are probably the first to be eliminated.
So don't get me wrong, it's not the micromanagement and the length of the game. I love some longer games, but this one just doesn't have any meat on it's bones to justify the play time.

RATING: 8
Move large stacks of monsters around.  Crush smaller stacks in search of their Titan.  Recruit better, bigger and nastier monsters.  Surprisingly a lot of strategy.  The monster slugathon is one of my favorites.  

Oh man, after all these years, I knocking down Titan a point 9 --> 8.  Played face to face, there is just too much group advice going on.  Too much stalling around trying to build up.  It takes too long to play nowadays!  Especially with 5 or more.  I still like it in theory.   Maybe I'll just stick to online.

RATING: 4
The potentially interesting boardplay didn't make up for the excessive downtime in a four player game. To make matters worse, the downtime wasn't even really that interesting, as other's moves were not that entertaining to watch. I do not intend to play this one again.

RATING: 6
Unplayed Valley Games edition.  Very heavy box.  Strongly recommend leaving the components out to air off.  A very strong smell of ink in the box, especially the counters which felt damp.  Both these problems seem to have gone after a day in the garage.  Some countersheets mis-cut.  The components look nice; rules are a clean read, despite the problems with the layout.

RATING: 6
The unique, classic monster slug-a-thon. This isn't a cuddly pokemon creature duel, it's a convoluted abstract dice-fest that is unlike anything else. 

It has a lot of charm and there's some fun to be had for sure. The strategy is there but it's at the margins. Good players are timing battles, deciding when to split stacks and other esoteric decisions. It's a game that rewards replay and study, yet a game with buckets of dice and lots of downtime. 

When you add in the player elimination and the fiddling involved, it's easy to see why it doesn't see a lot of modern play. I think asynchronous play via iPad may be ideal for Titan... but there is that irresistable fun factor reaching for 18 dice with a serpent... what an enigma!

&quot;Hall of Fame&quot; game that I never tire of.  The adrenaline of rolling 18 dice for a Serpent and pounding out 10 sixes to defeat a Colossus is stupendous.  The odds are always hoovering over the game, but sometimes the impossible happens, which makes this game never a dull experience.  Every roll of the dice changes the scope of the game and your Titan always has a chance for the incredible come back.

Rating based on one play. I won, but why? My mustering was largely thwarted by the dice, but I luckily blundered into a player's Titan. There's nothing quite like the feeling that I won, but I didn't deserve to win. 

By the time the game was over (and it was a short game according to the one veteran), we were also watching television. Gee. Exciting.

Another old-school game best left to computer implementation.

{Also, both the new and old boards are hideous. At least the old-school counters *look* cool, but Valley games eliminated them in favor of crappy CGI}

I'd rather play Power Grid, and I HATE POWER GRID.

Apart from some quirks such as the movement rules (which you could argue gives the game personality), this is a tremendously fun dice combat game that always makes me think of the Heroes Of Might And Magic series.  Gotta move to muster, baby!  The zoomed-in battlelands are a blast.  Rolling buckets of dice has never been this much fun since Warhammer.   Valley Games edition has gorgeous graphic design.   This is a classic game, best with 2 or 3 players.

RATING: 8
This is the only "player elimination" game that I'll play, and usually only as a 2-player game.  It's an AWESOME 2-player game, but gets old fast with more people because they start getting eliminated as you play.  It's an 8 for 2 people, but quickly drops to a 4 or less when you add more people.

i mostly play this on Acts.warhorsesim where it is awesome. A long old school game. The main thing i'd say about this game is it reduces the king of the hill situation most multiplayer war games suffer from (first player to pip a head gets whacked by everyone else). Because its roll and move you have to go with what your given and can't necessarily attack whom you want. Its still a very tactical high skill game though.

Ugh... to much number crunching for my taste.  

Also, it's supposed to be a fantasy game but it's so painfully abstract that it does nothing for me themewise.  If they could have come up with a way to make the main board a fantasy realm map that looked and felt like you were wandering around in a real world then I probably could weather some more games, but that mainboard is a huge turn off.

Thankfully when I finally sell it on ebay I'll be getting plenty of money for it.  In that regard it was a great investment!

Very ambitious game, reminds me a lot of (Master of Monsters) for the Genesis.

This is a great and visually engaging game.  The Fantasy Flight Game version does not do this justice.

One of the classic AH games, which has some of the drawbacks inherent to games of that era: player elimination, downtime, long playing time.

A classic that time seems to have passed by. What was probably innovative in the day now seems laborious. I get that the tech upgrades give an addictive sense of progress, and I liked the way battle worked. It was quite interesting to "zoom in" on the battle boards to use the different attack abilities. But rolling for movement is still too old school for me. 

About 3 hours into the whole thing became a bit stale. Roll, move if you can, collect if you can, otherwise try to roll better next turn. Everyone moves around until they get a bigger stack than someone else and then they go in for the kill. Too much attrition and not enough devastation. Can't we do this in less than 8 hours though? At hour 7 with more of the same ahead of us, we called it. This is for hardcore ATers only.

A great multi-player game that can be a load for new players, but it's much less of a load with 2.  If you're not sure about Titan, try it with 2 players.  It's a fantastic 2-player game.

I played Titan dozens of times before I got married (and way before I started recording all my plays on BGG.)  I have been happily playing it for about 35 years, so I guess I can conclude that I don't expect this will change!

RATING: 3
Whilst this game is at the nostalgic heart of many a player, this game is OLDER than my entire game group! 
No nostalgia for us!
.. and I believe it needs that nostalgia.....

This game employs roll and move mechanics which in themselves are not too bad however the board is very restrictive and there is a lot of forced movement. 
As a group we found many times it was not a case of what is my OPTIMAL move... mearly where am I actually allowed to move too *sigh*

Mustering is a good word. I like it, should be used more. 

Battle is very interesting however only two players are actually playing at that point and the remaining players have to sit and watch such *epic* battles.

Player elimination SUCKS! After a turn two elimination for one player and a simultaneous 2-player head-to head elimination on turn three the remaining players circled each other for what felt like an age before red player was in the possition to sacrifice themself an allow everyone to play again YAY.

In conclusion whilst Titan is classed as a strategy game its roll/move mechanic with restrictive board and 'bigger creature is better' dice-fest battles, it certainly doesn't feel strategic to me at all.

Titan will be relegated back to the shelves in a friends Dad's loft... and there it will stay.

Titan isn't a bad game. In fact, it's fun. It does, however, have a few issues that kind of make it hard to justify playing it when there are so many other options around. The biggest of those issues are probably player elimination and downtime.

As with other games that can have players eliminated, there is a problem if the game can go on much longer after that has happened, and with Titan, it can go on for quite a while. The battles being fought on separate boards are awesome on one hand, but on the other only two of the players will ever be involved which means a coffee break for everyone else. Therefore, playing with more than three players is probably a good idea only if you have something else to keep people occupied during those breaks.

Overall, a fun game, and if it could just be streamlined a little, it could even be great.

My rating is based off of two plays and reflects that I have had such a blast with this game.  Although it is a dreaded lenghty dice fest, Titan is one of those wonderful experience games where great gaming moments are born.  Very few gaming moments can beat when your back is against the wall (or swamp grass), with only a couple ogres at your service and your enemy is flanking you with a few angels and an army of warbears, centaurs, and lions, yet, somehow the shine of the dice gods glimmers through the thick growth of the wetland canopy in order for you to make an heroic stand; slaying the winged ones as your ogres valiantly sacrifice themselves for the better good. A worthy classic.

2 plays of this a long time ago, and the game was fascinating- although heavy on die rolls. When there were fewer (Fantasy-War) games like this to play, this hit the spot. The graphics, by today's standards, are very hard on the eyes, rendering the game useless. It's a shame the board game cannot be redesigned as a more eye-friendly (and aesthetically pleasing) sometime soon, as well as trim down the play-time required

[b][i]Titan[/i][/b] is a classic. The player elimination, complicated recruiting tree, convoluted movement rules, and combat system are not elegant. And yet the game shines because of these quirks. This is a fun game with deep strategy. The first time you play, you'll likely feel as though you're floundering through a random maze. Repeated plays, however, will reveal multiple recruiting and movement strategies and the tactics of the combat boards.

New players should start playing with the [url=http://colossus.sourceforge.net/]colossus game client[/url] to quickly understand the movement rules.

Fantasy monster slug-a-thon of secret armies and player elimination.  The game is divided into two realms, the strategic masterboard and tactical battleboards.  Mechanics are relatively simple but expect to use the reference material often, especially if you are new to the game.  I first learned on the 1980 edition, and own the 2007 revised edition.

To be honest, I really wasn't looking forward to trying to learn this game on my own. But OMG did I have fun. This game is absolutely amazing. Yes there is a bit of a learning curve and it is a very long game, but it is really worth the time and effort. There are so many strategies and tactics in this game to keep it interesting for a very long time. I don't see a problem with the luck factor that some claim. You just need to examine your legions and plan your moves. Now if you just roll the dice and move without looking at your legions move options, then of course it is a matter of luck. Unless your really that bad with rolling dice I don't see a problem with luck and I am a horrible dice roller myself.

Trying to make plans for all your legions really can make the game a lot longer than it already is, but I see this as being a game to be played over the weekend in parts anyway.

I never had so much fun teaching my self to play a board game as I have had with this game thus far. I am looking forward to many, many more plays. Even if I have to play by myself. It's just that damn good.

Wargame.  Classic Avalon Hill.  Many faults --takes a while to learn, too much downtime, and generally long, 2 hours++   But, the strategic depth is quite high.  I rate this as one of the most nuanced dice wargames I've played.  For the heavy wargamer only.

Everybody has a story.  Behemoth with 6 hits versus a titan.  Serpents bogged down in the swamp. Hydra blitz in the desert.  Everybody has a strategy.  Serpents to protect you titan.  Colossus or bust.  Dragons vs giants.  The game has flaws, e.g. player elimination, length of play, necessity of raiding all you other games for your D6's.  Therefore I cannot rate it as an 11 and must rate it at 10.  P.S. We play with cards and not dice for the strategic board (highly recommended).

First off, thumbs up to Valley Games for reprinting an older game like this. I am sure the old fans will be happy for this reprint.  For me, the game falls seriously flat and the design is showing its age.  The game consists of rolling a die and hoping your troop of critters can "Chutes and Ladders" its way across the board to a space that will allow them to muster more critters, or to a space with an opponent so that you can attack. You can't really plan ahead since the die roll dictates where you can go and if you can muster or fight.  When you do fight, the game stops for everyone else.  In the end, it isn't worth the time commitment for me, especially when you factor in player elimination.

The overall production values are very nice, although the graphic design of the board is dark and unclear.  It really does look like you playing across a marbley guitar pick collection.

This is a great game.  I played a lot in the 80s, and would like to find a new group who plays.  Have another game ready, for those who get whacked early though, so they don't have to sit and watch.  Plays best with 3-4 players, although lately I've played 2 player with a friend, which is equally challenging.  Games with 5-6 players often result in 1-2 being crushed early, but I have played a few with 6 skilled players where everyone got a top tier Creature(Serpent/Hydra/Colossus/Arcangel/Titan) stack and there were good battles.  Titan is a good game for e-mail (vs. web) that last months, kind of like chess, and I would welcome a group to play by e-mail, as well as in person.

The game is simple. But figuring out the mustering track is hard. I'll be mustering second level critters, my opponents will be mustering Dragons. I've never figured that out. Plus the whole 10 hours to play it thru thing. Still fun if you've got a co-operative group that you want to hang out with for several hours, hence the 6.

A great classic game about shopping for monsters.  Dice are fun to roll, but unfortunately that same fun-factor also cost this game a 9 or 10 rating.  There's nothing more exciting/lame than having a Cyclops get sixes on your titan, and in a 3 hour+ game, that's more lame than excitement.

RATING: 7
Titan has 2 problems: potentially long play times and (possibly very early) player elimination.  The first problem is usually (tho not always) seriously reduced as the player become experienced.  The second is sadly unavoidable.  If one player rolls two or three 5s in the early going they're just hosed.  But even with these drawbacks Titan is a great game.  You just about can't buy it anymore so I recommend the Java version Colussus very highly.  I especially recommend the Abyssal6 variant for anyone already familiar with the game.  There's a lot of dice in this game but the strategy is deep.

If you can't get hold of the classic Avalon Hill edition, this could be used as a substitute, as the gameplay is unchanged. However, the vastly inferior, muddy, repetitive and boring graphics makes it much more cumbersome and less enjoyable. Based on literal reading of the rating guidelines I should have rated it around 2.5, since it is very unlikely that I will ever play this one when I also own an AH copy (rated a solid 10).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Absolutely brilliant, multi-faceted design with a variability and depth of strategy that rewards repeated play.  The tactics of the battle board are fairly easy to learn, but it's the strategy of the master board that separates the expert from the novice.  Titan has a reputation as marathon game, and not without reason.  But there are ways to mitigate the length: play with 2, 3, or 4 players only, and play aggressively - remember that you win by eliminating the other Titan(s), not by having the coolest creatures.  Once everyone gains some experience with the layout of the master board, most games should finish within two to five hours.

Getting ass-handled by the (generally very nice) mathematical geninuses that play this game all the time in tournaments or on the web is ... not much fun. But slugging it out with other clueless newbies that are struggling just as much as you are trying to figure out what the Hell is going on is a rollicking, old-school bit of fun. But be prepared for a L - O - N - G game. They truly don't make them like this any more, and trying to streamline the game would rob it of much of it's charm. There are all sorts of convention-breaking odd bits sticking off the chassis of this one, from the defender moving first, to counting your own hex when measuring range, but those oddities are part of what makes the game unique. And there is something really cool about any game that lasts this long with and with such a high body count ... especially when it comes down to two Titans squaring off on the battlefield where only one can survive. Awesome with the right crowd and the right frame of mind. And the iPad version is a terrific 30-minute diversion.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
In the late 80s I spent many an hour playing this Avalon Hill classic. The unique iconographic look is both very functional and makes the game a certain abstract quality.

At its heart the game consists of two parts. 

Its main mode is a luck-based legion building game with some tactical elements based on the topology of the game map. You move your armies around, trying to recruit new creatures into your legions. At the same time you strive to position those legions in such a way that the possibility and quality for/of later recruitment is improved. 

The game switches into secondary mode whenever two armies clash. Then it reveals a tactical combat game. The creatures are unleashed and briefly fight it out on a hex-sided battlefield of limited size. Terrain and creature abilities add a lot of variety and need for tactical considerations. 

Basically, the game depends heavily on dice in both modes, but for anyone who just enjoys legion building and pitting legions of various composition against each other this one is a must.

I don't know if Titan would be considered "Ameritrash", but it is probably the most Ameritrashy game I own. I was introduced to this by Battlegroup Baltimore, a gaming group I got involved with in the mid-2000's in order to start playing Star Fleet Battles again. It was over an hour's drive from home to go play with them, so I didn't do it very often and eventually stopped altogether, but after playing Titan with them for the first time I went looking for my own copy. 

This was before I understood many of the gaming terms I know today, like "player elimination" and "roll and move" ... but despite it's flaws, I still like Titan, even if I almost never get to play it.

Played AH version a couple times many years ago. Having to deal with the luck factor in battles was one thing. But, also having movement choices very dependent on it... I always felt like I was on a giant slow motion centrifuge being thrown out to the ineffective edge and then run over by stacks of folks who had been building up in the middle. I knew what had to be done to move up, but the dice usually prevented me from doing much useful.I'm one of those folks that is truly dice challenged and so have moved to more luck-limited games. If you've got good, or even average, dice luck then you'll likely have a better opinion of this game.

Might play if folks agreed to a dice deck or similar way to dampen the affect of luck on movement choices.

Played it a lot with my brother and friends when it came out decades ago and we loved it at first.

'6' is for two-player, about '3' for multiplayer due to too much downtime and the very real chance you will get ganged up on and eliminated (time to go home!).

After playing 150+ times since 1980, the '6' is based on 'been there done that'.  I certainly considered this a '10' a hundred games ago.

Titan is perhaps one of the greatest board game designs in the history of the hobby.  It combines strategic play with tactical, and includes a number of great mechanisms to avoid pitfalls common in gaming, such as "gang up on the leader," and runaway victories.  You can win titan with only one stack when your opponent has 20 so long as your one stack lands on his titan-stack and has some beef on it.  Absolutely fantastic gaming experience!  Well worth the now inflated Ebay prices, IMHO.                                                                                                                            When you play this game, you'll realize that it is the father of the modern CCG.  Magic was based heavily on titan, and many basic CCG concepts were invented in wargames like titan.  The game is a masterpiece.

Update:  Following the Valley reprint, I have this to say:  I encourage anyone to at least play this and try it.  Its a really great game, nothing like a lot of the popular euros out now, but a game that captures the imagination and the analytical side of the mind in an uncommon manner.  That feeling of wonder and awe you got the first time you played magic the gathering and realized all the choices available to you?  Titan provides a similar fix in a boardgame (some would say wargame) package.  Titan is forever a masterpiece.

Update:  production values on the VG version also rate a 10.  It looks beautiful and durable.  The hex art is very functional.

Update:  Some more thoughts on this great design.  The longer I game, the more I appreciate Titan.  This is a stark contrast to many older games, which become more and more out of date.  For example, although we see the tech tree upgrade design all over board gaming, its almost always used to upgrade some aspect of the base game.  Titan used it as the primary method of gaining units of strength to use against your opponents, and no one since has done that.  Another example, in many many many board games, two people interacting, especially if they are fighting, is often good for the third player.  Titan doesn't have that problem and in fact two people fighting can often be bad for the third player.  More games need to include mechanics to do this.

RATING: 10
This is my all-time favorite game.  It is a strategic game where you build your legions to battle and wipe out your opponents.  Players do get knocked out, but the game is so engaging that even the losers will be interested in what goes on in-game after they are no longer in it.  Still, it is a good idea to have some short 2-player games as consolation for those leaving the game early.

What I like about it: the two-tiered gaming, with the strategic movements across the lands where you recruit your army, and the tactical maps where battles occur.  The balance is perfect.  It is strategic and skill based -- the better player will win.  Though dice are involved, in battle you roll so many of them that luck always evens out.  And this is speaking as someone with terrible luck in gaming!  The movement roll in the beginning of your turn is a single roll that can be important, but a good player will use his different legions to his advantage such that all rolls will be beneificial.

This is an intense game in which each player is both hunter and hunted. The many things you need to track, and the constant deductions and sleuthing you need to perform, hinge suspensefully on a tight and streamlined combat system. Rolling and moving on such a complex and clever board allows you to sway your fate even though it isn't quite in your hands. The six hours or so it takes to play this game fly by. It feels like more is at stake in a game of Titan than in any other game.

Glad I finally got to try this game. I'd even like to play it again sometime! But man oh man is this thing long. The board is a constant source of confusion for me.

I'm not sure I can exactly define what that something is, but no doubt Titan is a special game.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting game. The excitement builds right from the beginning since you want grow up the creature ladder and strengthen your armies. 

Titan is best played with 2 (maybe 3) players. Another advange for a pleasant game is when the players do know the rules already. 

When playing with unexperienced gamers this game might take a while. I once played this game with 5 players but a lot of waiting occurred which killed the fun. A game of Titan can also take many hours while playing with 2 players, which I often enjoy. It's important to take the time for this one. I also played various games under 1 hour which is also possible when players try to battle each other right from the start. The battle's are the most exciting part of the game and they are best when fighting with large armies and high creatures.

A nice way to play Titan is to remove the 3 tower creatures from the game and use the troll, lion and centaur as tower creatures. This speeds up the game a little and also can lead to unpredictable battles in later parts of the game.

Critical notes: A game of Titan can make you tired because of it's length (never a problem to me) and the fact fact that you have to physically arrange and inspect your armies (this includes searching for creatures in the stacks and the game box). 

Another critical note is the luck factor when moving over the gameboard. The die decides how many steps you may walk and the path markers decide where you should go. This might be frustrating sometimes when you want to go to a specific location but can't reach it right away. On the other hand this fact creates an extra challenge. 

The battles are very neat but the disadvantage of playing with only 2 players is that you can run into a titan-army by surprise and slay the titan with weaker creatures. The titan-army might have been stronger but since the Titan died this player is eliminated from the game (and the game ends because you where playing with only 2 players). This means that the scores and other growing armies, extra angels, higher creatures etc, don't matter any more. Especially when this happens in the beginning of a game it creates a kind of an anti climax.

This game might not be attracting for gamers who have no interest in fantasy games so you need to find the right motivation for this one (I don't like the fantasy genre but I always enjoy a game of Titan for it's exciting amry development and battle encounters).

Titan is an interesting game, where combatants must weight the merits of recruiting and increasing in strength against the difficulties of movement, and the possibility of a knockout blow. It comes from the age of Ameritrash, and it is a knockdown, slugfest, dice-pitching kind of a game, which apparently can go on for hours until the final battle decides the fate of one or more Titans.

Players start with even forces in towers on a central world-board, and as they move from region to region, they can recruit additional, stronger forces depending in part on the units in the legion.

But no legion can have more than 7 units, so at some point these legions need to split, or move into combat, which offers some interesting risk/reward options at times.

Each player is represented by their Titan- one of the strongest pieces on the board, but also liable to player elimination if it is killed (something like the King in Chess, with better mobility and a chance to increase in strength.)

In addition, moving anywhere is a very random process, because the central world-board has a very confusing set of traffic signals that direct legions' movement, so that optimizing where your forces are for recruitment, or trying to push them forward for battle can be difficult.

This randomness can be frustrating, and trying to track down the pile with opposing forces you can eliminate, or even your opponent's Titan can be difficult.

So players have a number of movement decisions every turn, and occasionally, they get to fight as well.

Battles are removed off map to smaller battleboards where two players can maneuver their forces, perhaps summon a reinforcement, and try to slaughter the enemy.

Players also have the option to negotiate the results of battles, if they think the outcome is inevitable, or to simply concede and rob the opponent of full points for slaying fleeing enemies.

The separate battles tend to pull two active players into conflict, while the other players (up to 4 more) sit and wait out the results- this is likely why the negotiation clauses are included (because at some point both beer and pretzels run out).

This is a game which if played seriously could take a long time to finish, suggesting strategy, but on the other hand, in many cases it doesn't need a ton of attention to every stack, unless one is truly trying to remember the units all opponents have in each of them, and the randomness of movement can reward risk-taking tactics at times.

So, Titan is definitely an older style of game.

What do I think? I am highly impressed by the beautiful artwork of the Valley edition, and I am somewhat fascinated by the cache of the AH edition, but I found that the game was both rewarding and random to play, often very near to simultaneously.

It's clever, especially for the time it originated, and yet it still recalls the days of whipping out handfuls of dice, tossing them, and searching for possible results.

I think that it's good enough that I'll definitely keep at least one copy, but not so great that I will play it much, especially with smaller player counts.

It's kind of a fascinating blend of fantasy miniature games and strategy abstracts, with randomized movement. I think an old UK expression, 'a Curate's egg' may apply here.

I'm starting this at a 6.75 after a first play, but I could really come to love this game more in the right circumstances, I expect.  I intend to keep it around and give it that chance.

A classic AH title I played back in high school, and managed to pick up a new copy on eBay for $$$. Who knew AH was going away? Glad to see the Valley Games reprint.

This is a wargame that is essentially a strategic resource collection game (i.e. building your legions) crossed with a tactical battle game a la miniatures rules (but there are hexes). At the strategic level you roll a die, move your legions, and recruit fantasy creatures to do your bidding. At the tactical level these same creatures do your fighting (unless you are involved directly), in a massive, Yahtzee die-rolling contest. Combat is brutal, slows the game down significantly, but one cannot help but live vicariously as one watches desperate battles to the death. AP could be a problem with newbies, as there is much to learn. Game length is rather prohibitive at five-six hours or more depending on the number of players, and whether they want to play to the bitter end (we just stop when one or two players are eliminated with highest score being the winner).

I tried teaching this to my group, but it is almost impossible with five all new players. I recommend indoctrinating one or two new players at a time. The online version, Colossus, is fast and speeds the time-consuming portions of the game, which is pretty much everything: movement ("Where do these arrows go?"), mustering ("What creatures can I get, and into which stack?"), and combat ("Now, what am I supposed to do?"). Unfortunately, the AI is not too bright, but serves as a good introduction and teaching tool: "Here, play the online version and we'll talk..."

The theme is thick and heavy with the fantasy world, although the board is rather abstract. The Titan is your avatar, so everything becomes literally a life-or-death struggle. There is plenty of luck with the movement, but it is about maximizing your options and balancing it against patience. Battles are a dice-fest, where luck can be overcome with tactical skill, but then again, bad/good dice rolling can be devastating to friend or foe alike.

It just takes so long to play... but the time investment is definitely worth it.

Update (10/10/11): It takes too long to get people to agree to play it, and then it takes too long to play it. This is having great difficulty getting traction in my current gaming group, most who are not war gamers. Downgrading from a '9' to an '8'.

Update (07/13/12) 4 plays: 3-player game, had to stop after 5 hours. Two of the players had played once before, a long time ago, with one having extensive experience with Colossus. Although that helped that player play better, it still didn't help that both players spent a LOT of time looking and re-looking at their stacks. This is where most of the time is wasted for newbies. A recommendation was made to keep the creatures off the masterboard, hidden behind some player screen. Only the legion marker and a die/counter would be on the masterboard. We may have to try this to speed up play.

Update (08/18/12) 6 plays: Have played two 2-player games with creatures kept off the masterboard, hidden behind player screens. Instead of a die, we use stacks of mini poker chips to indicate the height of each stack. The legion marker corresponds to the same symbol on a player tableau. Each symbol represents a row with seven spaces, where the creatures are "stacked". Thus, at a glance, it is possible to see the composition of each stack, without the looking and re-looking of stacks. This speeds up play immensely, although the game footprint is larger due to the tableaus. With two/three players this is manageable, but a large table could get crowded with four or more.

Valley Games has done a great job with their reprint. Great counters, great boards, good art (looks vintage but not cheesy) and includes a nice tray to store all the chits.

My cup of tea, but not sure if anyone would play it with me (there is an online version apparently, and rules freely available).  Long until you get the hang of the complex rules, but sounds like it's worth it - player elimination, good with up to 4 players, strategy and tactics and luck factor controlled so that it's not usually a problem.  Many players seem to rate it as their fave ever game. Out of print, but Valley Games about to re-print (writing Oct 07)

For me this is a top three game of all time.  Lots of strategy and constant strategic decisions to make every turn.

Only downside to this game is that the playing time can be pretty variable sometimes it can run a little long.  Experienced players can definitely blast through games pretty fast.

An odd game within a game system that rewards careful planning. Titan suffers from some problems, most notably its length and the tendency for players to be booted from the game early leaving them with nothing to do. The board and counters are very very nice (but not, alas, waterproof). If you like the idea of sending your rag tag legion of lions, bears, and centaurs off to face a well trained troop of Behemoths and Gargoyles, this game is for you.

A tried-and-true gem of a game.  Multiplayer wargame that avoids the associated pitfalls of gang up on the leader and the best turtle always wins.  The game is long, and the play length is highly variable (My personal min/max is ~15 min and ~11hrs).  However, I never feel, as with some games, that the experience would be better if condensed.  Titan features player elimination, something often highlighted by its detractors.  On the contrary, I view as a blessing that releases players who are in a hopeless position from having to continue to play for 4 hrs.  It also helps avoid kingmakers situations because players that aren't in the running tend to bow out.  Finally, the idea that lots of dice = lack of skill is completely false.  When an expert plays with 5 novices, the expert should win just about all the time.

This game has intriguing elements and an attractive core concept. However, it suffers many of the worst deficits of board game design in this era: potentially early player elimination in a game that drags on for hours; the forced, frustrating, luck-oriented, and bizarre movement rules on the strategic map; and the long downtime between moves. Given the many superior contemporary alternatives which share some of the core elements -- Mage Knight most obviously -- I see no reason to ever play this game without a complete rules overhaul.

I finally got to play this one, and I'm very glad I did. I would love to play it again in the near future.

It took much longer to play than I expected, as we were all completely new. Even with four hours to play, we barely cracked the surface.

I wish there was a way to shorten the game considerably without losing some of the unique flavor of the design. I think I need to try this one two-player.

So the game is super dice heavy, has player elimination, is way too long, and has VERY few meaningful decisions to make...Umm, why is it so great again?  I've only played a half game so I shouldn't have the strictest background to make a rating judgment, yet I can already tell it isn't my type of game.  The master board movement, while unique, is pretty lame.  It's like a centrifuge of death where you have little, if any, control.  Battle is just dice chunking like mad with no interesting powers or abilities.  I'm sure it was great for its time, but its age shows.

Only part of the game played.

This is an oldschool type of a game, fun for a while, but very tiring in the long run.
Downtime when playing with more than 2 players is GIGANTIC.  Battles are resolved on separate boards and can take a while to finish..  Players not engaged in combat just watch and yaaawn.

I really appreciate the general idea and several concepts from here, but dice-fest during battle resoution, long playing time, complexity (in a bad meaning) and general feel of 'oldness' put me off.
Still, it might be a decent game for 2 players.

I have the old Avalon Hill purple box version, though the box is now extremely tattered and torn from being thrown in a backback to bring to friends' houses.

Like a childhood teddy-bear, I hold a lot of nostalgia for this game.

I don't feel I can rate it accurately though as I haven't played it since I was a kid and I know we didn't follow the rules exactly.

One of my favorite games ever!  It has a wonderful combination of strategic maneuvering on the master board and short but intense tactical maneuvering on the battle boards.  You move around on the master board, angling for best position on a tangled board, recruiting a pile of monsters, and then throw them at another pile at the right moment to smash them into dust!  To have a good fun, it's important that everyone understands the general principle of "frustration breeds aggression."  Anyone can stifle anyone but then they have nothing to lose by attacking you.  So table talk diplomacy is critical, to keep them from moving in front of you (unless you know your stack is strong enough to eat them heh heh).  So lots of interaction.  The only downside is that people get killed out when their Titan is killed so very much an Amerigame in that respect but then once the killing begins the game is pretty close to ending anyway, barring really bad luck or bad moves.

This is a -great- game. I don't use that term lightly. it has strategy, tactics, depth, hidden and revealed information, controlled randomness--the design is breathtaking. With the recent re-release from Valley Games, the presentation is finally the equal of the gameplay. This is stellar work, and should be in every "Gamer's Games" collection worth its salt. 

I don't think there is a better (non-war)game dealing with the interplay between effective strategy and tactics. The Masterboard requires some savvy to navigate well, and the battleboards are all about maximizing damage and minimizing losses. This game is great people, reward the folks that make it.

DragonCon 1999.  I was judging Magic tourneys in the area next to the Open Boardgaming area.  Three guys were playing this amazing looking game with piles and piles of big chunky chits on a weird, gorgeous board.  I wandered over and watched whenever I could snatch a free minute.

Fast forward to 2002.  I had found BGG and the rules for Titan.  I had to have it.  I bid on every Titan auction on eBay for at least six months with no luck.  Complete sets were going for $80-$100 at that time, and I just couldn't drop that much on a game.  Eventually the market cooled a bit, and I snagged a copy that was missing a couple of stack markers (which are easily replaceable) and had a tear on the box lid for $42.  Joy!  The Precious was mine!  I play two-player most often with my wife, who thrashes me because her stack management is far superior to mine and anytime dice are involved, my chances of winning go out the window.

Titan is a very fun game, to a point.  You just have to be completely ok with some random dice roll completely hosing you.  As in, a few bad rolls is all it takes for several hours of game go completely down the tubes.

A game of mustering legions of fantasy creatures, and battling the legions of the other players. Last man standing wins! One of the greatest boardgames ever made. The combination of a backgammon-like strategic game and a chess-like tactical game makes for an incredibly deep experience, which literally takes hundreds of games to get really good at.

A really fun combat strategy game.  Each player starts with a Titan and a number of other monsters, and must defeat all of the other Titans to win.  However, there is a big strategy element to it in the form of the 'Masterboard', the arena across which the various legions move and recruit.  What a legion can recruit is based on the terrain the legion lands on and what monsters it already contains.

I'm such a sucker for 80's epic games. There's so much delicious chrome in the design. Different terrain types with different creature recruiting trees, a couple dozen different creature types all of which have different strengths, skill factors, flying/ranged attributes, and recruiting potential. I love the recruiting. Smashing the recruited monsters into each other is tons of fun too, but the recruiting is a delicious puzzle reminiscent of my PC gaming days.

The player elimination is the obviously difficult aspect to reconcile with modern game tastes. Happily player elimination is not an issue in the 2-player game. Still I can see why it might be a philosophical problem for many, and to be honest it would be a huge practical problem for me if I ever tried to devote a game day to a 6-player match of Titan. I can't justify clearing an entire day away from the spouse and little one, only to possibly be eliminated within the first 90 minutes. The one circumstance in which it might work is at the beach gaming week I have done in Mays past, where there are plenty of other gamers at the ready to get into a game with the eliminated players. Such a game actually occurred at this convention in 2010.

The other issue is with the dice for movement. The master (strategic) board is difficult enough to understand on a first play that the subtleties of leaving oneself multiple good movement options are hard to grasp. I've no doubt that skilled players can play the master board like a finely tuned instrument, but I felt like a caveman whacking at it with a club. FOUR? I don't like four. I want warlocks in tower. Tower on five. RRARGH!

Actually, with a little less number sense that could be a two-year-old boy but I digress.

I can get over both of these issues with appropriate pre-game planning and game experience. When those fade away I'll be left with engrossing strategic play and a combat system that is actually pretty intuitive 90% of the time with relatively easy-to-understand exceptions. I'll be excited to play Titan again soon even though all the new Essen games are beckoning.

This game is all too random for my taste. The few times I played it (my son really really wanted to play it, even though he had lost big time the first game and so I found my self set up for yet another game of Titan) I noticed that with 4 players, one or two almost immediately got wiped out and since it is a very timeconsuming game ... well, I can't imagine anyone thinking it is fun having to look at others play for hours while waiting for it to end, so you could play again.

You have very limited influence on movements using a dice to determine how far and because of the way the board is constructed. The battles are also very randomely settled with lots of dices (which may be why my son liked it so much ... his childish mind probably feeling a sort of glee at the thought of having this serpent ... all the dices he would have ... all the damage he would deal).

It is simply just too annoying ... I shudder at the thought ...

ValleyGames edition.  A delicate balance of choice between strategy and tactics.  Moving your legion(s) into new and potentially dangerous terrain in order to 'muster' new creatures versus gaining strength by 'engagement'.  Knowing just when to concede or fight an engagement/battle seems to be an acquired talent that is only attained through experience as well as understanding the location and hierarchy of creature-tree recruitment.  With exposure to only 2 & 3 players games, there is much more of a learning curve to achieve than the rulebook implied before the game arrived, though I'm currently enjoying every moment with it.  So much to consider here.  Long game play, considerable downtime, player elimination, and random dice rolls will all factor into just how much future re-play value this game will have.

The overall production quality by Valley Games is exceptional and is simply drop-dead-gorgeous to behold!  The box insert is a 'huge' plus too.

RATING: 8
Jaw-dropping reprint of the 1980s Ameritrash classic. After a fair amount of play on Colossus, the Valley Games art does grate a bit--their creatures are nowhere near as instantly recognizable as the originals. 

3 players is probably my upper limit for an in-person game. Don't be fooled by all the dice--this is a game that richly rewards skill, which takes a long time to acquire.

RATING: 4
Ugh. What a disappointment! It's really the movement rules that killed this game for me. First, it takes a long time to consider your mustering options at each location for the stack you want to move. Multiply that by the number of legions, and the game quickly becomes interminable. Not so much while you are moving, but while you are waiting for the others to move. Because you roll a die for movement, there is absolutely no advanced planning you can do. When we played, by turn 4 players had already turned their attention to other games on my shelves. This is truly a game that feels dated and irrelevant. That said, the production for the Valley Games edition is beautiful and the rules rewrite is fantastically clear.

I attended conventons in the early 80s with hopes of playing Magic Realm.  I found that people were playing Titan instead.  I found the game to be pretty dry, lacking the narrative richness of Magic Realm and for a game so abstract, it lacked strategic depth.  

I only played it a few times, so maybe I am not fair with judgement.

RATING: 4
Played a bit many many years ago, thought the game was very very slow and boring with more than two players when you were the one watching the 7 turns of someone else's battle or battles on a battle board.  Also, the fact people can get knocked out early (like Werewolf, Bang and Poker) is a big negative for me.  Traded my copy for a couple of newer games right before the OOP copies started going for triple digits.  New edition looks very nice, but still not for me.  Oh, well ...

RATING: 6
Odd game. 

Titan has a reputation for going on forever even with only 2 players, and it's even more notorious as a multiplayer title for both player elimination and monstrous downtime. 

What surprised me about the two-player game is that it doesn't feel slow. Things move along rather quickly. Each player begins with two armies (stacks) that quickly reach their size limit, subdivide, and then continue recruiting. This process continues as each player fields more and more armies. Occasionally, two armies clash, and a separate battle takes place on a small hex-board off to the side. Whoever wins gets points based on units killed, and these points "level up" a player's Titan (leading general). The game keeps going until only one Titan remains. 

Because recruitment is ongoing and fairly rapid, Titan becomes a rather repetitive game of attrition. It's fun to build stacks of elite units (behemoths, gorgons, minotaurs, etc), and fairly satisfying to win battles. But barring an early elimination of a Titan, you really have to grind down the other player, slowly putting them at a significant unit disadvantage from which they cannot recover. No individual part of the game feels long, but it takes an enormous amount of time for the games natural processes to reach a climax. You have to really love dice-brawls for this to sustain your attention. 

I don't see a lot of depth here, though Titan has a tournament following. This is just a continual process of recruitment and destruction. There's almost nothing else going on. 

I had fun playing once, but I feel glutted. Would much rather play more complex games for this investment of time.

If Rail Baron is Monopoly with trains, then maybe this is Monopoly with angels. While not technically very complex, the gameplay is so arcane that if I didn't know Titan is counted as a modern classic such as Cosmic Encounter or Dune, I wouldn't dare guess it had captured the hearts and minds of many more than the designers and a few like-minded compatriots. (Then again I suppose something similar could be said about a good many games.) When rolling and moving, you may or may not get to recruit new units. For each of your stacks, you find this out by finding all the legal destinations on the map, then cross-referencing their terrain with the (hidden) contents of the stack. When it's everyone else's turn, you may or may not be attacked. If you fight and win, the spoils may or may not compensate for any resources lost. If you split your stacks to speed up recruitment, they may or may not be overrun by bigger stacks. If you're doing your share of fighting, you may or may not be ambushed and lose everything. On the tactical combat map, you perform countless attacks deriving dice counts and target numbers and may or may not be able to invoke terrain bonuses, all of it by referencing and cross-referencing creature characteristics... Experienced players will of course go through these steps much quicker and may even skip combat entirely by negotiating an appropriate outcome in terms of lost units. Movement becomes less convoluted when you learn to see the map as concentric circuits with transfer points. When you pass a tower, collect a Demi-Lord.

I have spent more time playing Titan than any other game.  I prefer the Gorgonstar version with the expansion set and would give it a 10.  Hydras with 3 2-die range strikes, Rangers with 1 die range strikes, and Serpents at 16-2 was the better balance.  The Avalon Hill version is appreciated because it brought the game to the masses but it drops my rankning to a 9.

Muse:  Back in 1980 I attended my first ever game convention somewhere in downstate Illinois.  I recall playing Titan at that convention.  The game was not an Avalon Hill game, but came in a big coarse cardboard box.  The guy teaching us the game was a bit appalled when I attacked relatively early, revealing my Titan, and I was eliminated fairly early.  

Since then I have played a few times.  In 2016, after a long hiatus I decided to give this another whirl.  I played a few turns with a friend as a 2p game, and had fun.  Not sure if/when I will ever play a full game though.

On my first play I found it interesting and original, mainly thanks to its "fog of war" mechanism, though had the feeling it dragged a bit. 

A few games later and I'm forced to admit it: it drags. With two players its length is tolerable, if still on the long side, but with more players it's boring, plain and simple. If a four player game could somehow be finished in an hour, maybe two, it would be awesome. As it stands, it never gets played.

That said, the game speeds up a lot when playing a digital version against A.I. opponents, so you may want to give one of those a look.

Example of real ameritrash game. Based on fun, rich components, huge downtime, big randomization and player elimination.

It is somewhat like HoMM. Battles are very interesting (even for watchers) and the game gives much fun. Walking on main board is old-fashioned and weird.

The biggest drawback is downtime. I have been playing with 2 players and we have played 6 hour game which ended unexpectedly (it could be played for few hours more). I tried to play with 5 players but after an hour we decided it is no sense.

Fun game, with layers of strategy and tactics only apparent after playing a few times.  Which monsters to combine in which stacks for better recruiting; where to recruit to get the top monsters the fastest; how to move to trap or hunt opponents; when to fight or surrender.  Lots of dice, but that's OK and skill should beat luck in the long run.  But a game takes a long time.  Die early in a four-player game and you can go watch a movie.

Egad.. only "length of play time" really turned me off about it.  I know there's a good following of Titan gamers but this one just doesn't do it for me at all.  I like the cool theme and the idea of a fantasy slugfest by raising & building up your armies.  BUT, it just takes way too long b/c there are other fantasy themed games that I enjoy more, some are shorter and some as long as Titam but more fun (i.e.- Descent).  It's probably an excellent computer or PBEM type of game.  There are too many good marathon long games that I much prefer to play.  If the length were cut down extremely, like 90 mins, I probably wouldn't be bothered by it and would probably like it.

I really enjoy the "tech" tree to building troops and the combat system really needs to be used in another game.  The combo of how many dice you roll = hit points and the skill level = greater potential to hit is well done.  The battle boards add a bit of spice to the game so that each battle is a bit different.  However, there is a ton of down time in this game - even in a three player game.

This is a very difficult game for me to rate as I enjoy the mechanics a lot but I have a big problem with the play time.  I also enjoy the strategic challenges of the main board and the tactical challenges of the battle boards but I dislike the way in which combat grinds the game to a halt for all of the other players in a multiplayer game. I enjoy this game two player and can understand the charm of multiplayer if everyone playing was experienced and very quick but I have not yet played enough to reach that point and likely never will.

Many wargamers are sucked in this game to my suprise.  Generally not my cup of tea as a brutal one-on-one individual fighting game in a space arena.  Non-historical is the usual problem for a game like this to me.  but then, sometimes when you gather 4 to 5 players for a no-brainer head-on contest, this should be a good choice.

Looking for Valley Games new edition, for nostalgia sake...but heck what an expensive game.  Some comments from others indicated that the movement rules might either drive you crazy or make you want to play the game over and over again. For truly multiplayer groups one downside of the original Titan was the early player elimination.  I would love to hear more how it does compare to other wargames...though this one is si-fi themed.

Can't even say if it's the randomness of movement or the simple battles on the battleboard. *shrugs* Can't like every game :-)

[size=18][b]Best of 1980[/b][/size]

The epic monster-army slug-fest. The depth of this game is impressive, especially considering the two very different but perfectly interlocking levels: the operational master board and the tactical battle boards. The master board movement system is simple enough, but offers a staggering number of decisions, probably more than any other roll-and-move game. The battle boards are a whole other game in themselves, providing an impressive lack of luck considering the fistfuls of dice being rolled. Indeed, the luck in this game extremely mitigated by some simple education of the game mechanics. This is one of the things that makes combat both simple and brilliant. If you have several hours to spend, Titan is the way to spend it.

I was forced to play this game a lot as a kid with my dad and a family friend. Back then, I hated it. However, in my old age (I'm 25.) I have developed an appreciation for this game. There is a lot of depth to this game and it is never the same. It is probably best as a two player game, so that there is no down-time for players not in a battle. There is an excellent program available online called Colossus that allows you to play online or with AI of different skill levels. You can also customize the board and change the ruleset. I mention it only because it seriously changed my opinion of this game.

This is a game I think I should really like, but it just drags on longer than it should, especially considering it is a player elimination game.  I'm not a big fan of the map either--a tad too abstract looking for my tastes, not to mention confusingly labyrinthine.  I really like the concept of strategic movement of armies and tactical fighting of the battles.  Somehow, though it doesn't all come together for me.  This game is definitely not worth the price of admission (even if it is being reprinted).

This game has subtle strategies for recruiting and fighting.  It was fairly unknown but one of the best of the old Avalon Hill games.  Playing again recently, I noticed that the picture of the Cyclops has two eyes, so they didn't quite get the concept.

RATING: 6
4/2009 Titan is probably more challenging/entertainging with more players - but takes even longer time.  Dice rolls isn't a big issue and seem to even out in the long run.  Movement on the board is very limited though and locked to you movement roll.  As a classic it's had it's glory days.  There's just too much downtime compared to the games of today.

Yes, there is a high degree of chance in this game, some of which can be difficult to recover from, but that can disguise the high degree of subtle strategies this game possesses.  There will always be a copy of this game in my collection.  There's a bit of a thrill rolling a dozen or more dice at a time.  And nothing like Ogre vs. Titan getting five 6's for the kill either ("Tommy, I told you not to attack my stack!").

RATING: 10
I admit this game has some features that may not be very pleasing to all types of gamers: player elimination, long downtimes, somewhat oldish outlook. These critics nonwithstanding: I love this game! How do they say: "If you can't stand the heat ..." . Like all of my favourite games it has a steep learning curve, loads of different possibilities and very clever mechanisms. This game is a classic, and believe it or not: it is possible to play this game in under two hours (full length game, no early winners, 3 players. Been there, seen it, done it several times).

RATING: 2
Roll and move that forces you to play on a track? I'll pass thanks. Not much strategy to this game, roll the dice, get forced to move along a track, attack folks. I love dice but the combat is just boring to watch if you are not involved. Too much downtime for other players once combat is initiated. Id say it shows its age. Wont be playing this again.

I bought the new edition after reading the rules (and the insistence of my FLGS owner that this one's a classic that has aged well) and after one trial, I'm glad I did. Very unique, very fun and leaves you craving for more. Incidentally, the game can go in under an hour if you're playing as reckless as I did against somebody who's playing as ruthless as my wife did.

For learning games, we've fared very well with two or, at most three players. I would not be eager to play with more, unless everybody already has some experience.
Played 5+ times.

A great game with 2 flaws - it can take a very long time, and if played multi-player the eliminated players have nothing to do.  The counters are evocative, the battle boards each have their own character, and the mustering/moving decisions are a game in itself.

RATING: 10
All I can say is wow. For a rather simple set of rules this game has tons going on. It is a classic multi-player slug fest where the skill of the other players makes the game. Sure there are dice but a good player will win this game every time. 

If you have not tried this one you should... It is a classic. The game is very hard to get at a good price right now, but it is a rather simple game to make yourself. I also dig the retro simple (yet cool) artwork.  

The Valley Games version of this game brings it up to another level with modern art and top notch production. (the AH version still gets Style points IMHO) 

A great game and it has taken hold in our game group, even with some early doubters.

RATING: 7
Speaking objectively, this is at best a 7, but its hard to be objective about this game. This slugfest was a huge favorite in my gaming adolesence and I would never turn down a game.

RATING: 10
A wonderful game. A good mix of strategy and tactics, abstract mechanics and thematic element, luck and skill... above all, it is really exciting and fun. Resource(creature) management, possiblity management, and strategic and tactical move. A lot of dice, but skillful play pays.

It eliminates many problems of multi-player wargame. Ganging up on the leader is hard because of all the movement restrictions. Beating the weaker is not so easy because there are many ways to take advantage of the movement restricstions and succeed to flee. Run-away leader is usually not a problem because losing only one battle can make you eliminated, no matter how many cool monsters you have. "Make-them-fight" is not a good strategy because aggressive play gets you angels and a more powerful titan.

On the masterboard - Build your legions, gather stronger creatures, use them to protect your Titan and weaker legions, use them to hinder other players movement and recruit.

On the battleboards - Move your creatures to take advantage of hazards, and throw tons of dice! It is a sheer excitement to strike creatures with so many dice - and even woth so many dice, luck effects little on battle result.

Of course there are some issues like long downtime and player elimination. But as players get used to this game, downtime would be shortened, I guess. I think I should play this game only in boardgame gatherings, when playing with 3 or more players.

(I play almost on Colossus. I'm logging only face to face plays.)

Excellent map and muster system, can get very long.  Having returned to playing this one...  a classic.  Absolutely one of my favorites from a few years back.  Muster system, map and movement system, combat are all interesting and enjoyable.  Player elimination is part of the game, shocking!

MUST have the new edition - we do get to play this some - the kids will love it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating based on 4 & 6 players.

I liked this quite a bit--I haven't played many games with combat and dice, and this game is stuffed with both. Fun battles, and I personally don't mind the roll-and-move mechanic. Yes it increases luck, but part of the game is dealing with what comes your way. 

However, this games takes a *long* time to play, and there is a *lot* of downtime, especially later in the game where each player may have several legions that can muster, and doubly so if you're not interested in watching other people battle. Player elimination also means that if this is the only game you're playing, people are going to get left out early and often. These aren't necessarily bad things, but it has to be played on the right occasion. Due to the game length, this isn't something I could play too often.

interesting and deep game BUT it doesn't really do it for me. I feel like I've tried all the strategies that interest me and at this point the only thing left is too just embrace the luck aspects of the game. Don't get me wrong I love luck and chaos in games but the time commitment this game requires to both learn and play makes loosing to luck painful.

This much luck would be more appropriate in a quicker game. I see so much potential for a purely tactical version of the game with no luck but that would make the game into nothing but another logic puzzle to be solved and then discarded. 

This just isn't what I'm looking for at this time in my life... though I must say the reprint is beautiful!

Good game, but long...more than two player will feature a lot of downtime. I played this a lot with my neighbor when I was in high school, and played a few times in college, when I was mostly involved in D&D. Playing out the tactical battles really slows down the game. I own the AH version.

Edit: edit for a comment on the iPad version. It is very faithful to the original, and mostly has a good UI...if you can find opponents online, a very fun game. Still the same issues multiplayer, though - can get knocked out early, and the game can go on forever if players avoid combat and try to recruit instead. I would play the iOS version long before I would play the cardboard version nowadays. There are just better designs around now.

The ultimate king of the hill game.  Fun to play but has some serious issues that don't let it compete with today's games (besides the fact that it's OOP & costs a fortune): player elimination, turn-time, fiddliness and the fact that only 2 players legions can battle at a time (everybody else watches and the battle can take awhile).  It's also a dice-fest but that's the least of it's issues.  I love the chits and would play more often but I'm no longer a teenager who gets the entire summer off!  Perhaps more plays, if I get around to it, will show me the hidden depth this beast carries within it.

A solid classic. I'm not sure what number of players would be best and at least one early elimination seems a given with 4-6 players. Playing this solitaire was somewhat tiresome.

----------------------------

Valley Games has been knocked for their customer service, but in my experience (2 times), they have always come through.  I look forward to their future releases.

----------------------
Sold my old AH version and purchased the VG edition.  Some mixed feelings:

- box is not very sturdy and split seams are inevitable.
- artwork overall, was better than expected.  Personal taste really if you prefer the stylized AH graphics or the VG CGI type graphics.
- master board graphics are fine, but not sure about durability.  If VG had gone with a Hannibal puzzle board here, I would have been happier (increased durability).
-  battleboards are well done and printed on thick cardboard.
-  storage tray and dice included are also well done.
- damaged countersheets don't seem to be uncommon.
- don't like the blood drop damage markers, prone to damage.

bottomline:  good graphics overall, more than a few quality control issues.  Marginal value in upgrading (I do however, really like the new, sturdier battleboards).

--------------------

Looks good, plays better.  A classic (and unique) design.  Has aged well.  A great "I want to kill things" game;   the monster slugathon game indeed.

This game is one of the best board games ever made. The mechanics, probability, strategic recruitment + battle tactics all make for a very engaging and fun game worth as many replays as one can get.

One thing I find especially elegant about this game is the elimination mechanism. Yes - you read this right. There are too many multiplayer games out there which attempt to make sure everyone can play to the end - but I find that the player who is far behind can often kingmaker. In titan this seems like it would be rare, because .  Of course, the two strong players who butt heads might mutually eliminate, making the remaining 3rd weak player the winner, but that is an entirely different thing (is there an opposite of kingmaking? :)). 

The one downside to this game is the long downtime during battles. I view this as a price to pay - the best way to deal with this is to be prepared by having other games/entertainment close by.

Now, if only I was actually better at playing the game...

Received in MT, with the Titan expansion figurines.

---------------------------------------------

First play was sort of irritating. Perhaps I am not used to these old-skool Avalon Hill game mechanics, but the whole roll & move nonsense made me feel like I had very very few meaningful choices to make on the masterboard, and often the player who just rolled luckiest was the one who was able to muster the best monsters into his legions.

That said, the tactical combat on the terrain boards was really fun - the manuevering, the rolling of piles and piles of dice... just super fun.

It's a shame to me that Valley did not bother to update the mechanics of this, or that there isn't some variant that allows for players to make meaningful choices for movement on the master board.

As it stands, I can understand why it is a well loved classic, but it just doesn't seem like its withstood the test of time...

Traded away after playgroup refused to play it ever again.

RATING: 3
A good example of how a classic game from the past looks totally unplayable now. The recruiting and movement mechanics are interesting and if you love rolling dice then the gombat is really interesting. But Titan's use of a highly uncertain single dice to move legions make Titan a frustrating game. Also, the potential for very early elimination of a single player in what can be a long multiplayer game to get down to the last two players manouvering around each other and climbing the recruitment tree to find the winner makes Titan a tough game to introduce to the table while eurogames offer the same or better buzz in shorter time makes Titan a difficult prospect to get to a table of more than 2 players. I cant think of any way of playing Titan unless it was computer moderated. The iOS version is ok.

RATING: 8
An old fashioned (old Avalon Hill Title) sluggathon where players traverse various terrains to recruit different beasts. The aim is to defeat the other legions traveling the board and each terrain will effect different creatures in different ways. A good 4-5 hour experience but a joy every time I pull it out. Real beer and pretzels stuff.

Don't get to play this one much, and am not particularly good at it.  But I was fascinated from the minute I saw the board, and the gameplay did not disappoint.  Originally I would have been disappointed to learn that the playing time drops dramatically with increasing level of play, but now that I'm no longer in college it's nice to know that, should I ever get the opportunity to play again, it probably won't run for twelve hours.

RATING: 4
Played a partial game.  Rather play Small World, Heroscape, Nexus Ops, or Neuroshima Hex.  Too complicated and long for me.  I suppose I'm lucky that I didn't get stuck playing a full game.  It would have taken at least 6 hours.  Way too tedious and annoying trying to manipulate and memorize the stacks of tiles.  Movement while interesting is quite abstract.  Getting a secondary board out to do battles, takes more time.  Basically other games do it better, and with less down time and fiddliness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fascinating game that is far too long for any reasonable gaming session. There's some maths and probabilities that can be employed in order to speed up the game. If you concede a fight you only award the opponent half the points and it takes ten seconds instead of conducting a 45 minute battle that only 2 of the six players compete in, just to have the favoured player win ALL the points. Learn to strategically concede and play the main board well and the game will go swimmingly and players very interestingly.

I had low expectations going into this since I've heard this was a beast to play. Sure enough, this did not exceed them. I liked some of the ideas such as the battle system and the recruitment ladder. However, none of that matters if you can lose your titan (which gets you eliminated) 1 hour into a 5-6 hour game. I can see why this is so popular among the hardcore wargame crowd, but that's one group I have no interest in joining.

Titan solves many of the problems that most multiplayer conflict games have, and for that it deserves a lot of praise. I also like the theme and the mechanics, and the total package is a very fun game.

But Titan is too long for me to fit into my schedule any more, and because of the long downtime and player elimination, it's basically just a two player game for me now.  I still have a lot of love for it, but I don't see it getting played except on very special occasions.

RATING: 8
Classic Avalon Hill game where one moves along a master board recruiting different creatures (minotaur, gargoyle, etc). Stacks have a limit of 7 creatures and when stacks collide, they fight on the terrain, where the creatures have special abilities. Combat is decided by dice rolling, each creature having a number of dice to roll and a skill factor that determines how hard it is to hit. Elegant game, and I've played it more times than I care to admit when I was younger. I still would enjoy playing it, but my gaming group would not share the same enthusiasm, as it takes a long time and people get eliminated. I've also played a variant called 12 Man Titan, where 6 other players have a Titan as a Colossus (and 1 stack), but next to nil recruiting and combat is done by table lookup. In my books still a fun game to play.

I've only played the Valley Games edition - the production values are out-standing!  The game itself is ok, but I have to wonder why there was such demand for this to be re-printed.  Like I said, it's ok but frankly is nothing special.  I like the theme (building up armies of fantasy creatures and stomping around the board trying to wipe out the other players) but it takes sooooooooooo long and gets very repetetive.  I don't mind long games at all but this one really takes ages.  Your first couple of games can also feel more like hard work than it's worth - trying to figure out how the main board works and where and how to recruit all of the various creatures is a skill you need to develop and before you get familiar with these mechanics individual turns can be excruciatingly  long.  Sadly it's just a bit boring really.

I've only played the one game and found it a bit difficult to rate. But at least I can make sense of it when people talk about it now.

The elimination aspect wipes it from most family / social gaming offerings of course. Memorising the recruitments made seems to be a critical success factor.

When I finally got a copy of the AH version I was surprised the game wasn't too complicated. I thought the movement rules would be difficult to get the hang of, but after playing a round or two gameplay was fairly smooth.

Great game from when I was a teenager and at university, but my interest trailed off in adulthood, though I still played it a few times. My favoutered strategy was to send a convoy of armies round the edge of thge board, splitting one off each turn so that I could juggle them as they moved so as to pick the best lands for them to end in. I sold this on ebay in my 2006 clear out of old games I had not played for years and it went to a German fan for over £60.00, the most I have got for a wargame.

Amazing presentation from Valley Games. The game itself is definitely old school: it has some downtime, luck and player ellimination but none of those things bother me, since this game is fun to watch even while its not your turn or you are out of the game. Since the game is played on two levels there are both strategical and tactical decisions to make. How and when to split your armies and which ones to move on specific roll is not so easy to do figure out (so there is quite a bit of thinking to be done when its not your turn). The goal is to muster better and better creatrues quickly as possible, but at same time survive and not give away easy points to opponents. Tactical level battles are typical hex and counter (lite) war game battles with some interesting decisions. Overall this game reminds me a bit of Heroes of the Might and Magic PC game series which I love.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Embarrassing joke of a game. It seems that somebody dressed up the most ludicrous kids' game they could find with endless esoteric rules and boilerplate fantasy monsters and said it was for adults, and people believed them. The "tactical combat" portion of the game is almost laughable as to how immaturely it handles almost every aspect, yet still seems to be supremely disjointed and clunky. Add on an extremely ill-fitting score mechanic and a silly on-rails map and you get what might be the most bloated, cobbled-together piece of trash I've played in a long time.

I really like it doesn't have the usual pretentious fantasy Tolkien-esque background guff: you just cruise around a delightfully abstract board and smash one another to bits.
A bit over-long sometimes and a bit much dice rolling but easily my favourite fantasy wargame, where the authors realised "fantasy" can mean far more than a whimsically painted map with "here be dragonnes" written on and artillery renamed "wand of fire".

Tentative Rating (needs replay)

This game has a very nice mechanism but its weakness is that the tactical options in the small scale battles are limited by the small boards.  However, this does keep the battles of short length and manageable.  A tendency is that many times the game becomes about running around the board aimlessly until someone wins.

Need to replay this soon.

In my first game, I played 2 player and we played for hours building armies and figuring out the mechanisms of the game.  At the end, we just played a few battles with the armies we created in a tournament.  Was fun.  I do hope to play this again - the sooner, the better.

Wargame. Hmm. Not sure if this is really an "8" game anymore.  The real fun is mustering your armies and anticipating how fearsome they will be in battle.  The less fun thing is the actual fighting and seeing your strongest legion usually reduced to only a couple units after a battle.

This really is a very good game. It has subtle strategy and exciting game play. But the board and movement mechanics don't appeal to me.

Also, a lot of the game feels arbitrary to me. If I want to enter a tower, why do I have to keep walking straight through it until I roll the number to be able to stop ON it.

I had other similar complaints, but I don't remember them now. It is a good game but overrated I feel.

RATING: 10
Best fantasy strategic wargame ever, IMO.
Very long, though - tough to get players to stick with it. And if you go for a quick kill to speed things up, it'll knock out a player, leading to difficult scheduling.
But the incredibly balanced, intricate recruiting progression combined with the creature combats (special abilities, terrain effects, and tons of dice!) make this a game for the ages.

I'd rate this with a dual rating, 10 with a practiced set of players, and a minus 1 with newbies.

With 4 experienced players, it moves quickly, doesn't take forever, and moves don't stretch out interminably.

With 6 newbies who can't remember what recruits where, what the terrain means, and how the tactical maps work, it's pretty unbearable.  

Big learning curve. But a monster game when you're up for it.

RATING: 9
This game can be played by 2, but it's better with more.  Although it's turned-based, the other players can be attacked which keeps them involved.  It's a good idea to pay some attention to what the other players are recruiting so you can keep track of what creatures their various legions include which helps you decide when there's a good opportunity to attack.  The biggest negative is that once a player has been eliminated, there's not much to do but watch the other players continue to duke it out.  There are ways to mitigate this using rules variations which end the game before a final titan is the sole survivor, but this should be decided before starting the game.

Magnificent!  A quite simple game but surprisingly deep - it is all about risk management.  I have been playing this game for 20 years and I imagine I will still be playing it in another 20.  I like how multi-player interaction is regulated, but I don&#039;t really like the big down time or risk of player elimination, so I prefer to play 2 player.

Titan was a game that my game group desperately wanted to like, but it was just too long. We would routinely spend six to eight hours on a game of Magic Realm, but we tried Titan on several occasions and never came close to finishing a game in that same amount of time (with three or four players participating).

This is a very origional game which bumps the rating by a point. In high school and university I played this a lot, but now I don't have time.  :(
This is a LONG game, the 240 minutes is VERY optimistic I think.
     My major complaint on the design is that the creatures native to plains don't get any advanatage for fighting in their home terrain.

Great game, never played the original which was a favorite at Fallcon for years and I would have many friends involved in a game. They would come by to tell me they had just been eliminated or waiting for a half dozen other players to finish theirs. They always seemed to really enjoy the game so when I saw the new version by Valley Games I decided I must give it a go, We played a 2 player and 3 player and I think that's about as many players as I will most likely ever have at one time. The down time between players can be very long and the elimination factor could have some negative effects on some players. Otherwise it's a really great game.

One of my favorite battle games. It may bog down at some point, and I wouldn't want to be in a 6 player game of it but for a 2 or 4 player game it works very well. It is really 2 games in one. The moving mustering of legions, and the detailed battles. There is a great deal of strategy to this game and as a result, it plays different each time. Great EPIC game!

The fantasy setting may put off some historical wargamers but the marriage of strategic and tactical play in this game is for me unsurpassed. The superb artwork of the counters by David Trampier coupled with the tactical dilemma's on very small battle maps make this game a gem. Like the first scenario in Squad Leader you can have a lot of decisions on a very small teatray surface.The game works best with 2 players. Though I could see 3 or more experienced players having a good game. Finding board wargamers as opposed to boardgamers  is very difficult here in Birmingham, England. Fortunately there are a few boardgamers otherwise solo only. I can teach a novice to play this one but will avoid a multi player game of this with novices due to downtime.

I am surprised that the system hasn't been tried for Napoleonic's; substituting different troop types for the monsters. Each stack would be a corps.

Classic epic fantasy wargame. Enjoyable as a 2-player duel or as a multiplayer game. Can be long, players will get eliminated, and that's all fine.

One of the few games I wish I'd kept when I purged all my stuff to relocate to Poland. One of the few games I am rating retroactively (instead of based on plays since I started rating games at BGG).

I like the iconic clear counter art of the Avalon Hill edition.

RATING: 10
3 copies (Avalon Hill)played too many times (and they show it)to count, 2 copies NIS

Titan has provided me with more entertainment then any other game. When I first learned, it was long and boring. As time went on, disinterested players fell away, the learning curve shortend the game (2 1/2 - 4 hrs), and it became great. For 4 - 6 years, we would play most Fridays from 7:00 PM until whenever, many times until the sun came up. In my mind 4-5 seasoned players is the best game, but I can understand how others might have a different opinion. There can be down time with seasoned players during battles as well as between moves for inexperienced players, long waits for eliminated players, but that is part of the game. The best way to play this thing is in a bigger gathering of gamers, so eliminated players have something else to do until the next game starts. I'd encourage play with good friends where friendly gloating and conversations about other things are possible during downtimes. One other thought, the people who complain this is a dice game or that the dice are "always" against them have allot to learn about the game. If you are in the Chicago area, agree that gaming is best played with friends over a beer or six and trying to put a Titan group together, give me a call (unfortunately our group has fallen apart).

The very high rating I have given Titan is SPECIFICALLY for a 2 player with 2 dice game. (definitely not recommended for 3+) Each player chooses which of the 2 numbers rolled he moves any particular stack. This prevents any ruts developing and makes Titan a really enjoyable, dynamic, 2 player game. EVERY game we played using these rules has been an absolute pleasure comparable to the very best games around. It would be most deserving of reprinting specifically as a 2 player with 2 dice, and I'm willing to bet it would easily achieve the to 300 games as such.

Is there a word for games that you must play online because playing them face-to-face is borderline impossible? Because that's Titan for me. It's cerebral, intelligent, and nuanced.

Played it once, against a seasoned veteran. It was an interesting experience. I liked how you had to decide between splitting stacks or not, moving or not, preparing for growth or preparing for war.

I love this game. I own three Avalon Hills, only one of which is in good shape, unfortunately. I've been playing since high school and have possibly played more games of Titan than of any other board game in existence.

I am such a fan of this game that I created a variant called Tactical Titan, played on a giant version of a battleboard with multiple terrain types where you muster characters directly into battle. Each player has a huge force to move around and slug the other players with. You can play a campaign version in which you earn XP to improve your Titan and accumulate an honor guard of higher muster order characters to accompany him. Some day I'll publish the rules for Tactical Titan online and upload them here.

Here's what I think about the new edition. The strategic board is not as nice; too dark and the movement symbols are even more confusing. The battleboards are an improvement, with the additional reference information. The hit chits are better, too. I think the art on the tiles is nice, but I miss the feature of the AH edition where every silhouette was unique.

I am currently fascinated by Titan after picking up a copy of the Avalon Hill edition. 2 player is great - I would dearly love to play a 6 player game, but how to justify the downtime and the ruthlessness of the player elimination? I wouldn't mind it personally (I think) because as I say I find the game fascinating, but am unsure of the chances of finding 5 like-minded deviants.

Titan is such an unusual game, so simple, so tense, and incredibly enjoyable. Depending on how many players one can rally to the cause, the game can last anywhere from a matter of minutes to what may seem like an eternity. And yet, those overlong games rarely feel tedious, that is, so long as you are not losing too badly. It inspires strong emotions, which I suppose most folks here would truthfully say of so many games. But for my crowd, this game trumps all others. Defeat is particularly bitter, and victory is so exceptionally sweet. To preserve every players shame or triumph, we keep a book with the game in which we chronicle every match. We praise the victor, and log notable achievements and battles. I know that it is not really relevant commentary on the virtues of the game, but I could not help but bring it up anyways. In the interest of honesty, among our wider ring of friends, we apostles of Titan, are in the minority. But we defend it with all the fervor of Provost Adam Wayne!. It truly is an outstanding game, and I encourage everyone to give it a shot.

A great semi-abstract wargame.  Very satisfying to recruit monsters to your side and wait for the right moment to attack your enemies.  Plays best with 3, but a 2-player game can be quite good (and you don't have to worry about the player-elimination issue).  The biggest down-side to Titan is the length of gameplay (assuming someone doesn't get eliminated in the first 10 turns).  My best Titan experiences were in graduate school when my roommate and I kept a game running for about a week, with periodic bursts of playing activity.  We'd often take turns moving and mustering by ourselves (honor code), and let each other know when we needed to sit down & battle out an engagement.  A full-length Titan session in one sitting is just too exhausting for me.

Over all a good game.  The game has 2 major problems however.  The worst is that players are eliminated from the game one at a time, and often a player will get eliminated (or nearly so) early, meaning they have nothing to do (go home).  The other is a long wait time between turns especially when two players are in a battle.  This game is an all nighter (if you started at noon).  Extremly long, *tons* of dice rolling (which mostly eliminates the luck factor of the dice).  Recruit bigger and bigger monsters and smash your opponent's pitiful stacks.

A game that has conceps ahead of its time: players move their units across terrain and upgrade them based on a tech tree. The ultimate aim is to meet and kill opponents Titans and be the last man standing. Units have different attributes (range, flying etc) and battles take place as a sub-system on a smaller board. Expect to roll lots of dice! Also expect lots of downtime with anything more than 2 players!

Many other games have obviously been inspired by Titan (Dreamblade echoes some similarities). A solid game design that is probably better implemented by a computer game. Oh, the game is best encapsulated by its box blurb on the spin: The Monster Slugathon Wargame!!!

Annyi idős játék, mint én. Hihetetlen, az pedig még jobban, hogy jó is. Simán megállja a helyét a mai játékok között, sőt! Wargame, némi taktikázással. A játék több táblán zajlik. A fő táblán a játékosok légiókat irányítanak, amikben maximum hét egység lehet. Ezeket adott területeken különböző teremtményekkel lehet bővíteni, illetve adott esetben később szétválasztani két légióvá. Ha két ellenséges légió találkozik, akkor ezek a harcot egy tábla egy kinagyított hexás részén lejátsszák. Nekem eddig ez az egyik legjobban kivitelezett csatalebonyolítás, amit ebben a játékban láttam. Egyrészt az egyes területek különböző szörnyek számára nyújtanak előnyt, másrészt az adott részen 1-2 külön érdekes tereptárgy vagy tereptípus is lehet még. Harc természetesen kockákkal dől el, így a szerencse nem kicsi, de nagyon jól ki van dolgozva az egységek ereje. Adott számú kockával dob, adott célszámokra. Amik a védőtől függnek. Jól kidolgozott, mégsem bonyolult. Negatívum, hogy a nagy táblán a lépésszám kockadobással dől el és így a toborzás nagy szerencsefaktorú. Érdekes, hogy ezt nem gondolták jobban végig. Illetve a sokszínű térkép és a kicsit átláthatalan kötelező útirányok rontanak még az összképen, de összességében egyértelműen pozitív a véleményem a játékról. Jó dolog az is, hogy lehet meghatározott ideig vagy pontig játszani. Hatan elképesztő hosszú lehet és nagy memóriára is szükség van, mert az egyes légiók szörnyei titkosak, csak csatakor derülnek ki. A játék bőven megelőzi a korát, a csatarésze a PC-s Heroes of Might and Magic-et juttatta eszembe.

It's like... what? I'm sorry, where? With who? This is strategy & tactics in its purest form. Makes your head hurt and the pain enjoyable. I have the new version (from the same series with hannibal and rome) and it looks great as well. I understand what I am paying for when I lift the box.

Generally I prefer German style games but This wargame has a lot of subtly to it that  many first time players miss. Its only real downfall is that it is an elimination  game which makes it hard to get a group together when one person could be out quickly.

RATING: 6
This game is absurd.  It is fun building up your stacks and trying to determine the best results when upgrading all your monsters, but most of the game is randomly  meandering around the board hoping to avoid battles until you are big enough that you think you can take out a smaller stack, then two players take 30 minutes minimum duking it out.  I can't imagine playing this with more than two players, in fact I outright refuse to.

Turn order is a bit of a problem, the first place player always gets to attack and muster before anyone else can do the same, so they will always be better fortified.  

That said it is mostly fun and it is great to see the results of this 8 hour dice vortex, but I feel that perhaps my time is better spent playing other games.

Would have been great at 14 when I had a whole summer vacation's worth of time to kill.

Fun, but long and players are eliminated. Use house rules to avoid those downsides.

Newbies have a difficult time picking up the masterboard movement rules.

Alternate Point Scoring: make all tower creatures (ogre, gargoyle, centaur) worth 3 points; all 2nd level creatures worth 4 points (cyclops, lion, troll); and 1 point for each higher level recruit. Award angels at 25 points. This makes the math much simpler and quicker and it is fairer in handling flying/rangestriking abilities.

Note: I own the Avalon Hill version. I've seen the Valley Games version, but prefer AH.

Still haven't played it all the way through, I'm not sure I get it, I doubt it's really my thing--but I'm so intrigued by this weird hybrid of abstract game and fantasy wargame. It violates many of the standards of today's design (player elimination and truly long downtime are both here, plus it can be an 8 to 10 hour game), but maybe that's what makes it so cool somehow. Lots of strategy is possible even among all the dice-rolling. The Valley Games edition has special appeal to me; I can think of no other instance of the art design of a fantasy game being so classy that it almost looks like a parlor game when it's set up on the table!

Aiieeee!!!! The innovative mechanics and the theme were excellent for its time, but has grown a little dated now.  Takes a long time to play and you're luck's little b**** in this dicefest.  Owning one is retro-cool, with the late 70's/early 80's pulp novel cover and wargamey counters, but I was happier with the money I carrried off for selling my copy.  Unless you have actually played and found the experience better than sex, I wouldn't spend a fortune acquiring it.

What can I say about Titan.  Well, it is epic, and it has some really neat ideas and concepts, It creates interesting decisions and is mostly deserved of its reputation both good and bad.  I can see understand the cult following it has but after playing it, I have to notch that up to nostalgia.  The game has too much downtime.  Now personally I don't mind turns that take a while as long as I have something to think about while others are taking their turn.  But in Titan, you can't really plan ahead.  the movement mechanic simply doesn't allow it.  The turns take a while not because of tough decisions, they take long primarily due to fiddliness.

I really like Titan and have only managed to play it a few times.  The game makes no sense because it swings between the abstracted and the hyper-realistic.  Its game length is 1 to 16 hours and there is no way to tell before hand.  If you play with more than two players, everyone should bring a book.  Despite these tremendous flaws there is something really awesome and obsessive about it.

Own Valley games edition.

I don't think this game is ever going to be played. It is just too fiddly, and the whole player elimination element also makes it a little unpractical. 

Have played it on computer sometimes, and the game has some appeal, but a game that is just too impractical to play IRL is hard to rate better than 5.

When they decided to reprint it, they should really have redesigned the whole game using more "modern" game-design-ideas - there is a good game here somewhere waiting to be dug out (IMHO).

RATING: 10
A worthy member of any Hall of Fame.
It has a perfect mix of skill vs luck, which sees more experienced players win far more games, while the losers think they were just unlucky. There is a lot of strategy involved when moving on the master board. And I have seen many players (including myself) blunder a winning battle on the battle boards by executing the wrong moves.
Drawbacks are the long playing time (although games with 2-3 experienced players are regularly finished within 3 hours) and the elimination aspect. What do you do with players who get eliminated if you are not playing at a convention where eliminated players will find a new game soon after?
I have played more than 150 games, mostly 2 player.

You should also try the new iPad app by Valley Games. While the computer opponents aren't very strong, they are strong enough for beginner-to-intermediate players and the game plays very fast!

Ignoring real world considerations (time, eliminated players) this has to be one of the best pure game designs out there--each player has his own avatar, the army mustering process is fantastic and creates a real sense of gathering power for a climactic battle, and the movement system prevents much of the "team up on the leader" problem that most multiplayer games which allow combat suffer from.  Just brilliant.

Great concept; recruiting monsters and battling is fun.  Too long, too much downtime, terrible player elimination, and you often don't get to use the higher ranked monsters.Suggestions to speed play (but not enough):Figure stack splits during other players turn, then finalize or cancel the splits right before you roll.Have a stack of tokens of various colors; when a player rolls, have the other player start counting moves for some of her stacks that she's not currently moving and placing tokens indicating where they can possibly go.

This is a multiplayer battle game that has gotten around the turtling problem.  Multiplayer battle games often benefit the player who doesn't get into battles, because they are oftentimes detrimental to the battlers, but in Titan, winning a battle has benefits.  The recruiting element of the game is very interesting as well, and it's complicated and subtle enough that experienced players will always have the advantage

the die roll to move on the master board can be a pain in the neck, HOWEVER, it does not kill the strategy.  For them who say "Titan takes 4+ hours" you are playing it wrong.  My last several games of Titan lasted less then 2 hours each (including 6 player games, yes).  Play super aggressive, fight right off the start, don't play run around-avoid-recruit....it is a war game, make war!

Classic game allowing you to roll tons of dice. Play it often online solo(colossus.sf.net). Recent in-person 5-player game sucked when my friend's fiancee attacked my Angel stack on turn 2 for no good reason. She had only played Colossus, and thought that was a good idea. I won due to her poor battleland tactics, but my Titan was exposed and eventually died due to being forced to move into a bad position.

The first thing I thought to compare it to, oddly enough, is Heroes of Might & Magic IV - you build up an army that moves around the board, along with a super unit (hero/titan), and the armies can meet and go to a separate combat mode to resolve it. The analogy kind of breaks down shortly after that, but that's what came to mind. In any case, it was an enjoyable time, but I kept feeling there was something wrong with the game, I just couldn't pinpoint what. I thought it might've been the ease of eliminating a player, but if that weren't the case, the game would just go on forever. The movement system was kind of odd, but I see what they were going for. I'd need more plays to properly assess it, but right now for me it's a 7.

RATING: 4
For some reason this game never did it for me.  I tried it several times but it's just too slow with WAY too much downtime, especially with several players.  I do like the main board where you move unit stacks around to get more units, but the combat boards bring the game to a halt every time.  Probably much more fun with only 2 or 3 people.

Fun strategy, but the off board battles between two players takes too long, a time where all other players has to wait.

Excellent game. Reminds me of Heroes of Might and Magic. The only bad side is that this game is so long. Or so short :D and if playing with multible people it might be boring for the people who drop out early

RATING: 7.7
while this game is quite long, it is a very cool game...for the right people.  I played this game most of my young adult life.  However, I only am keeping track of recent plays since I joined BGG.  I have played this game probably over 30 times and it has great pros but a couple of cons.  Pros:  Strategy for placement and gathering (mustering) monsters is cool.  Building armies to kill other legions is cool.  The battles on a separate board is very cool.  The satisfaction of building up your angels, and titans is pretty neat.  Cons, overly long (5-8 hours really.), the game can become a little unbalanced as the game progresses.  If you do not know how to play simultaneously, it becomes a little boring as you have to wait for the players to think where to move.  The people I play with know the game well and we plan as the other person is summoning (mustering) their monsters which greatly cuts out on wait time.

RATING: 7.5
Have Valley Games version.

Titan combines gameplay similar to abstracts like Chess and Backgammon with tactical battles. 

Elements of luck are balanced by:

a) Legion positioning
b) Legion composition
c) There being so many dice rolled throughout the game that dice outcomes will average over the long run. 

Titan rewards you with XP for winning battles which "level up" your titan, grant teleportation abilities and award powerful Angel and Archangel units. Hence, you get stronger for playing aggressive versus becoming a target. 

Its an elimination game, so if playing a 4-6 player game, plan on having a supply of 2-4 player games so eliminated players can move to other games if they wish. 

All in all, I am glad I added this to my collection. While not a game for all occaisions, this is a classic that holds up well over time.

A deck of cards and some plastic chips should not be able to give you so much fun. Mind you that this "8" is not the same "8" that heavier games would have but I was totally surprised how good the game can be for this price and components. Not to be played with more than 4 persons (probably 3) though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great game, though the updated components from VG can't entirely mask the age of the underlying design. The game definitely revolves around the strategic decisions on the Masterboard - the tactical considerations on the Battle Boards are significant, but not terrifically subtle. However, there are certainly some very interesting strategic decisions to be made, especially in the two player game where you have a bit more breathing room. But damn... this is a long game and the gameplay doesn't really change dramatically as you go. If I had this game in high school when I had whole nights to kill, I'd have played the heck out of it. But it's going to be awfully hard to fit it into my schedule these days.

I know that player elimination is theoretically annoying, and its length prevents frequent play, but this is still the most streamlined and satisfying dice-based Amerigame I've ever seen.   (Although I'm admittedly not an expert on that particular subject.)

I've only played once now.  It was a wild 6-player game that lasted nearly 7 hours (and the 2 remaining players agreed to a draw rather than play it out).  I'm not sure what I'll ultimately decide regarding Titan, but, for now, I'd love to try it a bunch more, especially in smaller settings (either 2 player or 3-4 player).

RATING: 10
We've played this much more than listed.  Started with 4-6 player games in the '80s and bought it for ourselves.  We've kept track of our two player victories, so that's why Titan has the most plays.

We love the game.  With more than two, you have to deal with the elimination factor.  That was usually done with video games back when we played 4-6.

The game's not for everybody, but everybody I've taught it to likes it.  It seems like it has too much luck at first but eventually you have to learn that managing the averages is part of the game.

We play socially, not "dead serious, better memorise the stacks or else."  Usually.  We'd love to sit down with David or Bruno (not that I've ever met them, but they are definitely Titanic names in the game) and get destroyed sometime.

Ordered the Valley Games reprint ASAFP and couldn't be happier.  Ok, the legion markers are stale and drab, but we didn't get our undies in a bunch with the various delays.  Business as we expected.  The titan figurines are used mainly for intimidation.  We also made some killed markers from the die-cut leftovers.

We haven't tried using the old legion markers with the new game yet.  Yes we have, they work just fine. :)

(One play) Okay, so some of the mechanics seem interesting, but in the one game I played it took 3 hours until we actually got to any combat. And combat was probably quite interesting for those involved, but I wasn't one of them. The inability to plan your turn due to the roll and move mechanic meant that I was quite bored when it wasn't my turn. We ended the game after the first combat, for which I was very very thankful.

I feel bad ranking this so low, but I don't see myself ever playing this again.

Reminds me of Heroes of Might and Magic though, which is a big plus.

RATING: 5
This would be awesome if you played this 20 times with the same group, but the realities of new game every minute take that option away.  I simply can't give very good marks to a game that has such huge rules overhead, but still may see a player eliminated through no fault of his own in the first half hour.  If the rules take longer than the game, that's a serious weakness.  I don't usually mind player elimination, but there has to be at least SOME build up to the finale.  

As for the game itself, it's chromed out to a really fantastic degree, with lots of little exceptions.  The different terrains are very interesting, and make the battles quite interesting as well.  The battles are a real treat, but unfortunately, only two players are involved in them.  Everybody else at the table has to sit and wait for them to finish, which can lead to interminable downtime between turns.  It's really the quintessential 80s Ameritrash game, with all of the benefits and problems associated with it.  I wouldn't recommend buying it, but it's probably worth playing it once to see if it's your thing.

Heavy, cumbersome Titan is an excellent example of Ameritrash, and a great game in general.  The strategic movement on the board coupled with the recruiting system make the strategic game a lot of fun.  When legions meet, the hex they meet in is expanded to a tactical battlefield.  This imaginitive strategic-becomes-tactical play is a lot of fun, and I look forward to playing Titan enough to write a review.

This classic game of the Fantasy Monster Slug-a-thon is a standby from the Avalon Hill of yore. The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches. The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards. On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process. When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in. After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.
\13\\13\
The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan. As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow. But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game.
\13\\13\
The last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game.

Long, very long. You recruit monsters as you move around a game board (which looks like a maze). Then, you fight to the death. To enjoy the game, you really need to pay attention and remember what your opponent recruited and what's in his stack. Also, some sort of timer couldn't hurt either. The rules could be modified to play to a certain point goal, but the original game is all out elimination.

Reasonably innovative system of recruitment irrevocably marred by the horrible, time-consuming hassle of moving around the board, a process determined not only by randomization (die roll) but also restrictive terrain placement, effectively making it impossible for players to reliably attack who they need to when they need to. To compound the problem (and the length), victory usually just favors the person who fights the least because high level monsters are superior to Titan experience unless a Titan manages to get insanely strong. Long, long, LONG. 6+ hours of downhill. For what it's worth, the game improves remarkably when played using the Colossus computer program, which includes cutting the length of the game by 95%.

An absolute classic. Titan successfully melds a strategic level game of movement and recruitment with a tactical battle game of moving counters and rolling dice. Skill at oddsmaking and looking ahead are at a premium. The mechanics are elegant (if wargamish) and require constant tough and meaningful decisions. The only black marks on this game are that it is very long and that, with more than two players, some players will be out of the action for long periods or may be eliminated entirely.

This is a really hard game to rate.  I think that it has aged very well, and is still well worth owning and playing.  The art and game design mesh well; it is a joy to look at and play.  That it fetches such absurd prices (which I didn't have to pay for my copy) makes it cool to own as a collectable.  Down sides are player elimination and game length--two things that don't combine together well.  I'll give it a '7' for now but that could only go up I think.  If you like this kind of game it's a 10.

What can I say here that hasn't been already said? A great game and continues to keep me engaged, even after all these years. Takes long to finish, but the journey getting there is half the fun.

Great game, but unfortunately for FTF multiplayer has serious elimination, downtime, and length issues.

12/31/11 -- Oh Titan, how I love thee.  I enjoy playing you so much, I'm giving thee the maximum rating.  

01/27/09 -- I think my feelings on Titan are a lot like the story of a nobody actor who becomes an overnight sensation because of a new movie.  I really had pretty strong feelings that Titan was mediocre, and more a product of a bygone era than something modern gamers would want to play.  Boy was I wrong.  The Valley Games release was so good looking that I had to buy it despite my feelings.  And buying it made it so I had to play it, and playing it again made me realize how much I was missing before.  The Colossus Java version really went a long way to shortening my learning curve too.  I never thought I'd be saying it, but I really look forward to games of Titan in a way that's reminiscent of a time when a single game would stay on my mind for weeks and weeks.  What an enjoyable experience it's been.

01/22/09 -- Rating quickly on the rise after recently discovering that this game was better than rad.

10/1/07:  In my experience, Titan has pretty much been the SIM CITY of fantasy monster army building.  While modestly intriguing on its own, I'm slowly coming to the realization that you're probably supposed to fight at some point, if for no other reason than to end the game before eternity.

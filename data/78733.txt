First outing - 2 players - and very pleased with this one - perhaps the best of the series, although I've never played Key Wood - why oh why didn't I buy the latter when I had the chance all of those years ago?

Can't wait to try this with 4 players - it must be very challenging when trading in the market. Lots of different strategies I suspect, and we've just scratched the surface. Another keeper from the R&D stable.

Just played a 3 player - this is a tough game!

More complex Key game, but it still played pretty smoothly.  The mechanics were novel and worked together well, but the field boards were just bloody and brutal: cramped with very few options.  It was pretty fun, but I don't feel the need to own it...especially not at its current going price!  :O

RATING: 8.5
+ The different guilds give you a little bit of a puzzle feel as you decide which abilities to piece together; It's a fast game, and is packed with tough decisions throughout.
- For an expensive game, this really has some pretty lack-luster components.

Key Market bears all the signs of a game from R&D, - difficult decisions that are hard to assess, a reasonable playing time (90 minutes), a changing environment, replayability, plenty of ways to make your plans pay off or fail. And now - great graphics. 

The game has a different setting for the board each time, so the start is never the same and the clever use of the guild tiles mean that the routes to scoring victory points will always change. It’s a bit like the different options you get from playing Dominion as the changing options are one of the best elements to both games. Then there is the simple, but effective market conditions of resources which come in at different prices each turn, and the whole environment creates a stimulating resource management game.

I have played Key Market in two versions now - an earlier version (Sept 09) which had significant concerns from my view point and the current version which is a polished game (March 10). Definitely one of the best games to get at Essen 2010.

Update Dec 10: The published game is one of the best of 2010, with a tremendous range of options to earn VP's and the changes made each game suggest a better longevity as the options will be different prfrom each previous game. Certainly in my top 5 for 2010.

I wasn't expecting to enjoy Key Market; it is after all a game of harvesting resources and turning them into victory points in the most efficient manner possible.  Did we really need another?

Putting my finger on why I've quite enjoyed my plays of the game isn't easy.  I guess that what it does it does well.  While there are several subsystems, they all mesh together nicely and I didn't feel overwhelmed by a huge variety of commodities (just six) or a bajillion things offering special powers (seven guilds at most).  At the heart of the game is a market, which works well to create tensions between cashing in resources for a profit and spending them on things that will earn vps. While Key Market is not a quick game, repetition is also kept in check; you play just eight rounds.  So, overall a game that doesn't get bogged down in details and lets you focus on the critical decisions.

I found the rules verbose and poorly structured.  The primary colours and relentlessly cheery medieval characters of the Key series aren't particularly to my taste, though it's all entirely functional.  Production quality is up to R&D's usual high standard.

I playtested this game.

A great resource-producing game. Maybe even worth a higher rating, but I was very tired the first day I learned and played. Lots of choice in what to do, and variety in the different guilds on offer. Next time, make sure I go for guilds that help me produce more goods!

Un eurogame más, con un aspecto gráfico muy bonito eso si. Pero a fin de cuentas adolece de lo mismo que todos, tema pegado, frialdad y mecánicas repetitivas y no demasiado originales. A los enamorados de la optimizción con nada de factor suerte les gustará. Yo necesito mucho más tema.

En líneas generales no está mal, pero no creo que tenga nada especial más allá de su corta tirada. Así que mejor venderlo.

+ Nice game and one of the best of Spiel2010, even if not particularly innovative. Reminds me of Planet Steam (market & resources production with some confrontation), and adds the guilds, which provide rules changes with some cool combos to be explored. 
- Well, Planet Steam's market is more interesting, and the combos part you can get on... Troyes, e.g.? It certainly isn't worth 100$, but it's a fine game.

My favourite of the Key series I've played so far. Lots of things going on that you need to plan for. I particularly liked the different guilds, they help make the game more varied and interesting, not to mention spicing the game up with lots of rule breaking powers. Most negative point I can think of after the initial play is that the play order can be particularly important, and some players have to burn an action to change it, while others might not need to.

RATING: 8
First game in Key Series from a designer other than Richard Breese.  Game has same look and feel as earlier Key games, but is a little heavier.  Game is quite unforgiving.  In particularly you need to plan your money carefully, not only selling sufficient to pay your workers each season, but also to hire a new worker in the following season.  You also need to keep sufficient resources to enable you to hire or promote an apprentice.  It is likely that you will therefore simply use the buy and sell market option in at least one season in year one.  Game strategy changes significantly depending on which guilds are in play, offering plenty of variety and replay ability.  Retiring workers appears attractive and provides a nice story arc, but of course once retired they are no longer productive.  Recommended if your opponents don't suffer from AP.

Ez az első "Key...", amit próbáltam. Szép, jól kidolgozott, élvezetes játék. Nem bántam meg az 1 óra szabályismertetést + 2 és félóra játékidőt. Egész komplex játék, a grafika alapján (nem tudom, miért) egyszerűbbre számítottam. A táblák színvilága helyenként zavaró, beleolvadnak a munkások a terepbe:) A játékban minden kétnyelvű. A segédlet alapján teljesen kezdőként is lehet követni a sok lépést, amit megtehetünk körönként. Szerencsét az eladás visz a játékba, de azt is ki lehet küszöbölni. Újrajátszhatóság szempontjából is elég jónak tűnik, nincs két olyan játék, ahol azonosak a lehetőségek (bónuszok, terep). Szívesen játszanék vele bármikor, ha nem vagyok fáradt. Mert elég alapos figyelést igényel. Nagyon szoros lett a vége: 3-an 5 ponton belül voltunk.

RATING: 7.5
Key Market is the first design published by author David Brain, and it is a very good game!
It is a worker placement game with an "agricolaesque" theme: a family of farmers works the land and breeds animals to make a living. But the similarities end here.
The game is played during eight seasons/turns, and the goal is making money. During each seasons the workers in the fields produce a variable amount of goods, and the goods are used to improve the house, to send some family members to the guilds following a career, to retire family members, or simply to make raw money selling them to the market.
The placement and movement of the workers in the fields is tricky and clever, and the presence of 12 different guilds (with only some used in a given game) grants lots of interplay variability.
The game has also very good production value, with nice artwork (altough a little confusing) and pretty wooden components.
This is a wonderful game, and only its rarity prevents it to reach a higher ranking.

First Play: The rules are a chore to wade through. Yes they make sense but there is alot to take in and one read didn't dent it for me. Luckily my first game had two players who had played before and that helped alot.

The player aids that come with the game are essential and this is a game where you need to understand the periferal information properly before you start. This time its the Guild Cards. They expand your options and production massively and you must understand fully what they all do pre game.

Once you start this is a proceedural game, not much interaction, minimal options to block or stimy but there is a monster of a game lurking here. I enjoyed it and look forward to game 2.

RATING: 9
Mar 2011:  This is certainly the best of the Key series yet that I've played.  At the end of the first game I really wasn't sure what the optimal path was, which I think indicates that there is a lot of depth and many layers to this game.   The different guilds seem to offer good replayability, particularly if different combinations are available each game.

Concern #1 is that perhaps there are some combinations of guilds that are simply too powerful.   I hope this isn't the case, but potentially there are some combos where whoever makes it to the top of 2 particular guilds will almost always win.   Concern #2 is play time.  While it wasn't incredibly long, it's certainly on the Le Havre side of long, which isn't necessarily a show stopper, but it does mean that the game will only make occasional appearances.

For any other game I would rate it an 8, but I find the artwork of this one particularly appealing.  I can't think of many more attractively done boards and bits.   For this reason, Key Market gets a 9.   If the "overpowered guild combination" theory becomes a reality, this rating will certainly drop.

See my full review [thread=608922]HERE![/thread]


[thing=78733][/thing] is a game that took me on quite the journey of exploration.  At the moment, I think it is a masterful design on par with anything in BGG's Top 10, and, in fact, is most reminiscent of [thing=35677][/thing] (though, with only six productive seasons per game, Key Market is a resource efficiency sprint compared to Le Havre's marathon slog).  

It is an undoubtedly strategic game, and the most enjoyable moment often comes at the end, when my wife and I discuss which strategies we should have pursued in retrospect.  (That may sound damning, but, trust me, those are [i]very[/i] enjoyable moments).  It is a game that is a bit tough to learn to play well; all of the game's moving parts are highly inter-dependant, and the ability to anticipate future needs was not something I was particularly adept at.  My first several sessions were actively frustrating.

Now, I love the game because it makes me think extremely deliberately. It usually exhausts me, but I find it rewarding to watch my plans succeed.  There are certainly multiple viable approaches to point-scoring.  I largely focus on market timing and manipulation, my wife tends to look for lucrative guild combos. (I just don't think I'm that into special-power-combo-building as a board game mechanic.) But no matter what your strategy, the key is to be aware of the flow of the game and the various opportunity costs at issue. For example, being able to foresee production seasons where you would be first in turn order (turn order is extremely important in the game), plan for them with particular low-level guild powers, increase demand for the anticipated surplus crop a turn or two in advance, either monopolize the board spaces for that crop or simply deplete the supply, and then have a massive sell-off at market day.  All of that needs to come together to avoid frustration.  

But once you reach that level, you can understand the game's brilliance.  I've gone from just wanting to understand the consequences of my actions to wanting to squeeze every ounce of efficiency from the game. The more I think about it, the more I feel like it could be a masterpiece.  It should be on my shelf for a long time.

As a strategy hint, one of my initial issues was that I tried to approach Key Market by optimizing each action within a turn. But rather than this optimization producing additional resources and thus expanding future options, as in, say, [thing=41002]Vasco da Gama[/thing], optimizing each Key Market action purely in terms of money (points) ends up [i]restricting[/i] future options because of asset liquidity issues, producing net inefficiencies.  Taking a longer-term view of the game largely means recognizing when sub-optimal actions this turn nevertheless produce a more desirable game state for the future.

Key Market can be nasty hard, but it's also wicked sweet.  Perhaps it should have been billed as [thing=39683][/thing] on steroids; it might have garnered the same hype that accompanied [thing=39684]Merkator[/thing]. I think it's definitely worth a play by just about anyone.

RATING: 7
Key Market, though not designed by Richard Breese, reminds me a lot of one of his games, and not just based on the game art. Like many of the R&D titles, it has a fairly simple premise, but there are enough complexitities involved to make playing it well for the first game or so rather unlikely.

Essentially, players have worker pieces that hang out on one board collecting stuff for players, occasionally they move around because harvest conditions change. The stuff they harvest can then be used to either make money in the market, or tithed to get other workers into cushy jobs (that grant special powers and end game VPs) to retire workers permanently (for end game scoring). The basic play of this is not all that similar to most worker placement games, as workers stay where they are and continue to harvest rather than needing to be replaced onto spaces anew each round, though there is certainly positioning aplenty.

Also unlike most games that feature resources and workers, there isn't a lot of alchemy going on, most of the things that you make are used in their current form, and there is little in the way of play chaining or anything of that sort. Most of the variety in play comes from the guild sub-boards, where players both gain VPs and special powers that will affect how they can approach the game. There are more of these than are actually used in a single game, so they will provide some variety from outing to outing. Think Keythedral where instead of tithing resources for straight VPS they are instead tithed to give players special powers (that have VPs attached) and where there is an additional money economy where they can be outright sold to the market.

Like most R&D games, I like but don't love it. It seems to fit together well, there seems to be some interesting depth to explore here, and I would welcome the opportunity to replay it. Seems unlikely to move up in my ratings, but it's within the realm of possibility. Up with Key Harvest as the most interesting games in the R&D line for my money.

RATING: 5
Clearly one of the more involved Key titles with some elements in it which make it feel a bit like Key Harvest, but just a bit, and then mostly in subject matter. The game itself is a variation on the age-old ‘get resources and transform ’em into VP’ genre, with guilds acting as a means to bend basic game rules. 

The very first time I played this game was a learning game which lasted two of three seasons; a few days later I played a full game to the bitter end. I found the game pleasingly rythmical and simple, but in the end somewhat repetitive too. Market and farming sections of a season feel like two very similar action series, and given that you cannot do very much save for harvesting and then selling vegetables or using them to move Key workers around for a rather fixed price in order to get more vegetables, the game did overstay its welcome by about 15 to 20 minutes. I also didn't care much for the final race to the end, when capital and vegetables are transformed into points. It seems like the obvious move to start retiring workers as these give you points the quickest, but it can be a drain on your vegetable economy as you need a lot of these in a short time. Guilds give you extra actions which offset their point value (as you need more resources to get to the master-level), but the extra actions still need to be [i]taken[/i] before you get the points from them. The retiring-route is conceptually easier.

All in all not a bad title, but at the same time not one which grabbed me by the throat either. I suspect that its length will ultimately prove to be a bit prohibitive to get this to the table, and in anticipation of that decline I'm being conservative with my rate. We'll see how things develop.

[b]Update[/b] I've played twice more since the time I wrote the above. I think there is some sort of ... imbalance... between the combo building in the guilds and the rest. The small area where workers collect goods you can sell or turn into guild members (or eventually retire) feels very simplistic compared to the detailed abilities of the guild members. It bestows Key Market with puzzle characteristics not unlike, for example, Agricola or even Shipyard, but then in a setting of Breese's happy fantasy land Keydom. Although that comparison can only be taken so far: the guilds only allow for a limited number of people present, so diversification is more or less forced on everyone. 

And that brings me to the two aspects I still don't like, even consider them flawed. For diversification to work, every path has to have some sort of equal chance of succeeding, with an effort which is comparable. Not so with flaw #1, the market, which stubbornly refuses to become a proper market in my games. It takes a lot of funds to both produce and purchase the goods, and the corrections at the end of the season force the market towards a common average state nearly every time. Either my group is doing something wrong, or we are not being sufficiently creative, or something else: all I know is that the market doesn't function at our end. This renders financial speculation, even supported by the market-oriented guilds 10 & 11, useless. And this brings me to flaw #2: the master level of the Key worker guild (4). This insanely powerful extra awards the Key worker with 2 extra resources (in practice, 2 luxuries); once a player attains that level he will be (very) difficult to stop and end very highly without much effort. In all my games to date the player who became Master here won to an extent which made viable alternatives really difficult to envisage. Richard Breese can put his foot down as much as he wants [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/article/6014241#6014241]here[/url]: that ability is simply too powerful to be allowed to proceed unchecked, especially in conjunction with a dysfunctional market. Perhaps with strong play this strategy may be curbed, but it will take considerable effort, whereas retiring until you run out of people to retire is boringly simple. Next time I play, if at all, I'll adopt the variant rule to bar a Key worker from entering a town. This will certainly improve matters, possibly even fixing the market issue at the same time.

Would I purchase the game myself? No, not for the price it currently commands, and even at a normal price it would only interfere with similar games I already own. It is probably sufficiently nice to do on occasion though.

Dry brain-burner that I would describe as more of a gamer's Agricola (sans the cards). Players allocate workers, collect resources (produce and animals), then sell the resources for cash (used to pay workers), or trade in resources for points. Resources traded in also allow you to promote workers (not to be confused with those workers working the fields) in the various guilds, which incur a benefit during the game as well as VPs. 

This is a brain-burner in the sense that you will get punished for your mistakes. Seems to be a good mix of tactics and strategy. Good, fun game, but I'd rather play Agricola.

This is a good game... but it doesn't deserve its highly-desired "grail" status.

Strangely, given the game's name, the economic market of the game is actually a little limited. (Prices normalize/reset each round and you have very limited chances to buy from the market. Mostly you are just selling.)

The game is more about which guilds to pursue for points and special abilities--and how to manage the spatial element of the farming fields to your best advantage. Also, retiring workers for endgame points seems almost essential to winning.

If you're looking for games with a significant economic/market aspect... I'd suggest several others before this one:  Masters of Venice, Navegador, Furstenfeld... even Princes of Machu Picchu has a meatier market section.

EDIT: After being contacted twice by the designer to explain to me that I do not really understand the game, I've lowered my rating.

RATING: 6
A good strategy game that is mentally exhausting the way great games should be. It has a great market mechanism, with six resources that are handled pretty much equivalently, which makes it a country mile more elegant and clever than Agricola for example.  The only disappointment are the guild cards, which probably make the game unnecessary fiddly and offer too many options on each move, where a smaller tech tree would work just as well. This, I feel, is an opportunity missed, for if the designer had gotten this one right, the game would stand out as one of the greatest games of its kind, as opposed to being only a pretty good and somewhat fiddly game.

Key Market, by David Brain, is the latest in R&D Games’ worker placement series known as the Key-series. The only game in that series that I have played is Keythedral, which I found interesting but ultimately not to my tastes. Key Market came to my attention as part of my general survey of the [geeklist=58780]Gamer’s Games of Essen 2010[/geeklist]. The rules were enough to convince me the game was worth ordering, and I have since played it four times.

Key Market takes place over the course of eight rounds, each of which represents a season, with each season appearing twice. During each round, players are able to place hire workers, place them on the board to generate resources, sell resources at the market, and then perform a guild action, which allows the player to either appoint one of their workers to a guild (granting them some victory points and a special power), advance the workers in the guild, retire workers, buy resources from the market, or get a little bit of cash while influencing turn order for the following round.

The main way that you compete with your opponents is through fighting for access to resources that are going to be advantaged by the particular season while avoiding the disadvantages caused by the periodic production disruptions caused by the change of the seasons. This board maneuvering is particularly sharpened by the special abilities granted by the guilds, which modify the rules of every conceivable rule in the game, from how and when you can buy, to how much particular locations produce, to how frequently you can hire workers to how much you can pay them. The presence of the guilds, the fact that the available guilds vary from game to game, and the competition that exists for spots in the guild adds multidimensionality to the game that moves what would be a merely average game to a good one.

None of this is particularly new or innovative, but they fit together in a rather unique way which almost reminds me of an alternate reality version of Agricola. It is tense, it is tight, and it requires a solid mastery of the input and output of money in order to avoid financial catastrophe and to successfully defeat your opponents. I quite like the game and, while I never expect it to be an absolute favorite of mine it is an easy 8, without any expectation of that rating to drop any time in the near future.

Oh, Key Market, how do I love thee? This is one of my top 5 games; a desert island game for sure. The first attribute that jumps when I think about why I like this game as much as I do is the dynamism. With a different set of guilds in play each game, different board configurations, and the way the market evolves, it's always a different play. You can go for low-level guild spots and hit the market heavy and start retiring people by turn 3 or you can go for some powerful guild combinations and/or endgame bonus gambits. I've seen people win by every way. Turn order considerations, long a favorite of mine, are present here. There is an immensely strategic experience packed into 90-120 minutes of game play.

Next I love the spatial considerations of the fields formed by the four playing boards. The boards are set up different every time meaning different goods may be more or less abundant. Your workers cannot be adjacent to each other, not even diagonally, and since the middle square which gives out valuable luxury goods is adjacent to every other spot on the 3x3 boards, once you go in there, you're full up on that board. Your workforce must be paid at the end of every turn and it's by no means a unidirectional process to get more workers like in a lot of games; here you'll fire people because you either don't want to pay them or for turn order consideration (fewest workers goes first). Catch is, you can never re-hire more than one per turn. Oh, that is not an easy decision, trust me.

There's a bit of a forced interaction with each other as one step in the turn is Market Day whereby each player must sell at least one good on the market in a closed-fist reveal. You'll probably want to sell more to pay those hungry workers you have but the price decreases after every sale so you'll hope to not have any competition when you do (it can be quite painful). 

In summary, the game is a truly strategic joy whereby you have to plan ahead based on field production (you can anticipate the face up bonus and penalty markers for each season), the current market, guild openings, and turn order. I am only hinting at the depth contained here by this brief comment, and I recommend anyone interested in this game check out one of the best reviews I've ever read on BGG, [thread=608922][/thread], as the author gives the treatment of the game I would if I were as eloquent.

While the first play is usually a head-wrapper before you can get the tempo of everything, the ratio of rules to depth is superb and provides a consistently satisfying play. Fortunately, my group and I love this one equally so we're always happy to pull this one out. I'd like to give a kudos to the Best Player Aid Ever and all that lovely artwork to boot.

Lastly, I am aware that I'm crowing about a game that is unavailable and only a few hundred of us were lucky enough to get our hands on copies, and all I can say is I hope one day that the game is reprinted, Kickstarted, whatever as it deserves a wider audience of hobbyists who will appreciate its brilliance.

Worker placement, comodities market with special powers locations and exclusive titles. I like the initiative system (fewest workers). This one is about timing and forming a strategy before you start. Very unforgiving if you lose focus even for 1 turn.

A rich interplay of commodity manipulation, quantity vs. quality, special abilities, investment, board position, and the other players.  True to it's "market" name, fans looking for a great economic game won't be disappointed, but there's a lot here for other tastes as well.  

At this point it's really a matter of how interesting the guilds end up being as to whether it's just excellent or one of my favorites.

Thematically, Key Market feels a bit like a cross between Agricola and Loyang: Hire workers, harvest stuff, sell on market. It is, however, heavier than both, a hardcore optimization game with lots of moving parts. Workers can also be sent to various guilds that provide a bit of an economic snowball effect.

Many paths to victory seem possible by specializing on different parts of the economy, yet some of the elements seem deliberately more fiddly than they would need to be considering their actual gameplay impact. The spatial element when sending your people to work on the fields, for example, certainly is something that you need to keep an eye on but all those considerations seem largely irrelevant in the big picture. Also, curiously, the eponymous market is mostly uninteresting. It still has a significant effect because you must sell something each turn but that is a rather forced import. Then there are the five different produce types that all work exactly the same which is a bit of a disappointment. Do I want fish or apples? Don't care. It mostly doesn't matter what you get as long as you get a sufficient amount of different types, the more the better.

Key Market is a fine game with interesting decisions (and a board that you can use to play hide-and-seek with your workers). I cannot help but feel it could have been even better.

Agricola-esque resource collection VP churner. The individual hand of cards of Agricola have been replaced by a random communal selection of rule breaking tech tree powers available to all. This sounds appealing, with everything out in the open and all players on an even keel. But in practice, it's still just a battleground for best combo picker. Once you've chosen your Guild path, you better hope it pans out, because you're in it for the long haul. There's some interesting games of positioning out in the farmland, but these are really just a sideshow. Key Market is all about the Guild combos, and combo exploitation just doesn't excite me these days.

RATING: 8
Running neck-and-neck with Key Harvest for my favorite game of the Key Series. This one isn't as opaque as Key Harvest, but it's still a gamer's game that demands planning and careful attention. Key Market is a game about managing the size and efficiency of your work force. Money is very tight, which means you're constantly employing fewer workers than you would like, and having to sell more goods than you would like. You'll also be making tricky decisions about how to manage the turn order, which guilds to pursue, and when to start retiring your workers.

Key Market does appear to allow multiple viable approaches to solving these problems - although they will all involve investing in one or more guilds in the early game and retiring workers in the late game.

I'm happy to see several random elements in the setup (guilds, fields, seasonal variations). These should keep the replay value reasonably high.

I finally got it to the table and it's not the beast I feared it would be. It's actually pretty easy, but very hard to master, as there are PLENTY of things to think about.

To me it looks way too mathy. Since money = victory points, you can and probably will check each decision twice. Do I sell the goods for 4-6 points, or do I invest them for 5 points at the guilds?

I dislike the player order system, as there are many tiebreakers and you don't have a good control over it at all. Well, you do, for a price you can't afford.

All in all, not as good as I hoped for and thought at first.

Key Market is... (a) the 1st game published by R&D Games not by Richard Breese, (b) hard to acquire, (c) trés expensive, (d) not intended for the light-Euro crowd- and (e) most likely worth every penny I paid.

1st off, it is definitely a Key-game, no matter whom it was designed by. It requires thought and planning, it uses worker-placement and resource acquisition along with a nicely developed economic market, and offers plenty of paths to gold/VP's.

2nd off, the artwork in the game is among Juliet Breese's best, and really lovely, even for an owner of other Key-series games.

3rd, it offers tons of meaningful choices between turn order, resources, purchases, sales, employment, and location-location-location. Choosing one or two of these generally means not accomplishing others, at leats not this turn.

4th, it leaves players even more action-starved than Agricola.  Two short years, 8 turns, and that's all you get.  The challenge to build maintain and tune the engine in that short a time is terrific, and fun.

5th, despite that, it doesn't have quite as much take-that as Agricola, even though the steps are quite as logical and planned.  There are multiple places to get that resource you really want- but it may cost you more to get there, and then will you be able to promote that Guild-member/retire that Worker?

I felt like the play was more productive than Agricola (the closest commonly-owned game in theme I can think of at the moment,) but it felt like rather than waiting for a needed resource to "be invented" I was building my ability as a player to accomplish the goals for which I was racing.

At the same time the variability of Guilds, layout of boards (linked, so that everyone gets to fight over spaces,) seasonal production, and options available given other players choices make this every bit as replayable as Agricola, but not quite as random in the initial deal (occupations/improvements) and more in the player's control.

So I am starting this at a round 8.0 after a first play, which jumps it just over Agricola.

Key Market... when a thinky game gets it right.

這遊戲有一些很大的問題，首先是起始玩家根本沒有優勢，放了版塊立刻放人最多也只能踩兩個資源，後家基本上一定會卡你而且選有三個地方可以踩的，這還不是他刻意要卡你，而是遊戲設計上讓人不得不這麼做，然後工人的九宮格內不能有工人讓遊戲的進行跟情境都很詭異，唉呀，公會的人比生產的人還多，公會的人能力超強還不用付錢呢～而且另一方面又鼓勵玩家把農莊的人拔光來搶順位，更神奇的是工人都沒有上過工就直接讓他退休了呢！然後說好的大市場呢？不特別的市場機制也只是讓順位玩家多賺點錢尾家少賺點，直接改名為大公會啦！果然是傳說中的名作玩過就好啦~~

Initial Rating 6.5 (April 2014)

I thought this game was designed by Richard Breese (a designer I respect a lot), when I found that wasn’t the case, my desire to play it took a plunge. However we play it and I was a bit disappointed. I had huge expectations from the game, and it is fun but I thought it would be better. I have to confess than I was distracted in my only play because I had a work issue so I need to play again to form a better opinion.

For now, it is the worst Key game I have played, that’s not saying it is a bad game :D. For now my favorite is Key Flower followed by Key Harvest and then Key Market. 

I like the variable guilds and board setup. This assure that the game has lots of replayability. I also dig the low luck nature of the game. The rules are not very complex, but the game has some hard decisions and the strategy is not obvious in any way (a huge plus for me). The art is pretty cool too. Money is very tight and if you make a mistake it can be very hard to get in the fight again.

It Is very AP prone, also in our game the market wasn’t very significant. 

As I´m writing this, I’m thinking this should be a great game and right up to my alley, so I want to play it again soon to see if I enjoy it more this time. I’m reasonably confident it will enter my list of 2010´s favorite games.

Current Rating: 6.5

RATING: 9
There’s a lot to like in this very tight middleweight economic game about farm production and sales.  The guilds are the standout feature and are the game’s variable player powers, which players select in the early part of the game.  The upkeep can be tight and the variable production challenging to work around.  I’m hoping to see a lot of replayability in the various guild combinations.

A potential 10.

Not as good as I expected from an initial 8.2 rating on BGG. Key Market is a game in the vein of Le Havre or Caylus which is probably a big part of the disappointment. When you are willing to invest 2hours+ in a hardcore eurogamers' game you expect a hard struggle, nailbiting decisions, a tough economy. Somehow Key Market dragged along and caused a lukewarm reaction. One of our players even got completely annoyed. Don't get me wrong, decisions certainly matter and a good player always will outperform others. Many strategies to victory are provided. My feeling is that there are too many possibilities on each turn. If somebody stops one of your plans just do something else which let's you score a similar amount of money. The challenge is finding the best of the many available actions, not so much managing in a tough economy. Hello, AP! More experience with the game might prove me wrong but I doubt this will happen. The competition in this field is too tough from immediately capturing games to leave table time for Key Market and I don't have enough hardcore Eurogamers in my gaming group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Key Market is admirable in that it somehow feels somewhat different than other games even though everything about it is recycled somewhat.  The theme is very bland and the market and harvest mechanisms are not necessarily new.

However, it all blends together nicely.  The choices are constrained enough where it feels manageable.  The rules, while dense, end up feeling fairly intuitive and are not too hard to teach.  My only problem is with the play time, which seems a tad long.  There isn't too much downtime and you are involved the entire time, but it feels like it should move a little more quickly.  Hopefully this will correct itself with experience.

Rating after one play. I suspect it is a strong candidate to move up to a 9 with more plays if I can get them in. I figured I would enjoy the game, but I liked it even more than I thought I would, though not quite as much as Keyflower.
It has many difficult and interesting choices and even after that one play I could see that there were many paths that we didn't take with all of the guilds. And how the game could change with different guilds and different board setups.

Finally some improvements for the Key-series. Keythedral was superb, later ones were more or less too dry or some other way "not soo good ones". Key Market works nicely although it's still missing Keythedral's competition of getting resources. Good game, which I'm ready to play again.

LIKE:

* Variable guilds leads to a different game each time (only 7 of 12 are in play in a 4 player game).  Guilds bring in a lot of creativity and uniqueness in special abilities and/or end game bonuses.  Some combo on top of each other while others do not as you improve your position within a guild.  The key worker guild is not overpowered as some suggest (although it could be in certain guild arrangements - maybe).
* Spotting and pursuing the different possible combos make this an interesting game.
* Winter season brings potential of pain and frustration.  If not prepared, you practically have to start all over again due to lack of income since production of goods is much rarer or impossible.
* Early play will make you think retiring your workers are essential.  This would be a very poor assumption as each worker you retire loses you potential production and potential points.  Retirement may still be a key strategy to consider in some guild arrangements, but don't forget the loss of production and points that result from potential production.  
* Very beautiful artwork.
* Variable production of different goods by season adds an interesting twist to the game.
* The way the market is set up depending on what resources are used to build your initial farmhouse is quite clever.
* Market play is quite variable and changes from game to game depending on guilds and player strategies.  My first couple games I thought the market quite boring and static, but the last couple times we've played, the market has been crucial to winning.

DISLIKE:

* I wish there wasn't a green worker family.  The workers blend in too much with the green cabbage patch and can be easily missed.
* The wood tokens are cheaply made and I have a couple wheat tokens that will need to be re-glued.  
* If you play poorly or less optimally, there is little catch-up in this game.  While I don't mind this, this is a factor one should know getting into this game.

Only 1 play but I felt very limited in what I could do.  I had an initial strategy that didn't work out and every turn felt like harvesting a few resources and then selling those resources to just barely have enough to pay for my workers. Rinse and repeat.  It felt like treading water.  

I can see the nuances to the game and the depth but did not particularly enjoy the mechanics enough to really want to play this again.  I am very much a strategic gamer but this game was very tactical. 

The game has vegi-meeples but in the copy I was playing on they were falling apart. They are apparently laminate and will break apart.

RATING: 9
I spent the first half of my first play thinking "is this all there is?". I continued to wonder about the marginal gains everyone was making. I continued to be unenthusiastic.

The second half of the game was an awakening. I had developed a rhythm for putting workers on the board and when to take them off. I had promoted workers in my guilds. I had also gotten good and arranging the turn order I needed. Indeed the game blossomed into everything I had hoped, even if our first play was a little long.

So we have Breese's classic interpretation of resource gathering and worker placement combined with a ladder climbing affair coupled with resource management. In all, as long as the play times come down I certainly look forward to playing this for many games to come.

Although there are a lot of smart ideas thrown into Key Market, there is no lack of mediocre ideas, either. The jaggedness of the rules coupled to a very confusing graphic design made my first game no more than a muddle-through, and I did not feel that the burden thus placed on me would be repayed by great strategic depth with more familiarity. Since I feel that the challenge in a game should be in playing well, not in playing correctly, this first game of Key Market was probably the last one, too.

Don't agree with that this would be close to 4 weight.Little bit over colored board for my taste. Feel like solid worker placement with little market twist (not too deciding) and some randomizer, that may not be so balanced.

Even simple map is plus, a lot of text on guilds need to be learned 
(well it's small fraction comparing to Le Havre cards). Game is just mildly unforgiving - no one will be completely pushed out of game.

Solid mid-weight+ economic game that has all the feel of a "Key" game even though Breese did not design it.  There's a lot going on but once you get through the rules it all comes together nicely.  

I appreciate the guilds, which give small powers/bonuses and the fact that you can build-up, rearrange and tear down your engine with relative ease.  The commodity market works well too.  It's certainly a game of timing and resource management.  Turn-order turns out to be very valuable at times (for selling/buying, playing into guilds and hiring/moving players into fields that are expected to have windfall production in upcoming rounds).

Retiring workers seemed to net more points per resources+actions than working up the guilds but I suspect that with experience understanding the right guild combinations (and they're different each game) can beat a pure retirement strategy.  I also expect there are some tricks to working the market for huge gains (money=points).  Initial rating (7.5) until I determine how much strategic depth this game has.

It might appear to be procedural, and in the first round it probably can't help but be so, but Key Market really comes alive and coheres as it progresses. The game felt just right in terms of arc. A wonder that so much could be done with 6 agricultural resources divided into 3 categories (vegetal, animal, luxury). It didn't feel long, however it did take over 2 hours to play a 4er.

RATING: 5
Worker placement on a modular map for resources, then turn those resources either to development or to money(same as VP). To find the right balance between the two along with changing the turn order in your favor is important. Developments need workers also, that are placed on guild cards with three tiers. There is competition for limited room on the guild cards - two workers each can go to tier 1 and 2 and only one can go to tier 3. The workers can be also withdrawn from the game turning resources to VPs.
I find the favors on the different guild cards a little unbalanced, sometimes turning the game to a race to the top tier of a particular guild card. Further play may change this point of view.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Has a replayability scheme similar to Troyes: The guilds available are randomly assigned from a large set, so there's a different selection of guilds every time. The fields are also modular.

Lasts for eight quick rounds, of which the winter round is a diabolical invention. The guild workers give a nice engine building aspect to the game, and the farmer placement is surprisingly tricky.

I'm ultra-impressed with the numerous self-balancing tendencies within this game, the subtle acceleration gradient and - as ever - the glorious individualised artwork.

However - and a big however - I think there's really one too many layers of complexity here, and the geometric aspect to the farms is both unnecessary and randomly frustrating. A really, really great economic game wouldn't need this step. Keythedral has much the same problem.

Key Market is a highly interactive economic game in which players compete for harvest locations, guild posts, and in the market itself through player-driven commodity prices.  Margins are razor-thin in the game, as recruiting your workers, sending them to the fields, and keeping them from turn to turn all cost money.  Sending your workers to the guilds give you special abilities, but costs the resources that you'd otherwise sell for critical income.  The game is very tight, and any randomness is mitigated by the ability to see what's coming turns in advance.  The game includes alternate guild boards, which provide nice replayability.  This is a difficult game, but if you're up for the challenge, it's rewarding.

Game finally acquired. Spent more than I should have on it, but it was far less then what is being offered in the market right now. One of the last grail games that I've been itching to own.

While it's not [i]quite[/i] as good as I remember it, I still really like it. I think with 3/4 players, it would play a little better. I do worry that it might be a little bit slower at that player count, but I don't think there is so much in this game to cause significant downtime. The guilds in this game are a big boon to it's replayability. I can't wait to try mixing and matching different guilds for all kinds of wonky combos and strategies.

The market starts to become a bit more dynamic when you're buying and selling goods instead of just doing another guild action.

On a side note, we completely goofed up the worker adjacency rules. I had it in my head that you could not be orthogonaly adjacent to anyone, but outside of that, you were fine. Well, apparently you can't be adjacent at ALL (including diagonal) to your own pieces and as long as you're not sharing an area with another player, you're fine being right next to them. Effectively gaining the luxury good spot of a tile shuts the rest down for you as you cannot be adjacent to that worker. We only figured this rule out when I realized a 4 player map was incredibly tight and everyone really only had like 3 workers tops on the board. It drastically changed up the map soon after.

I dunno, maybe I'm entering the Jeremy Clarkson stage of my life because even though mechanically Keymarket runs fine it just wasn't a thrilling ride.

I think I can put this down to the design being a typical gamer's Euro in which you have to mentally work out where the optimum route is so you'll only feel tension if you've eyed a good spot which you sense someone may see and take. I desire accessible drama and uncertainty especially late at night.

Even if I had my thinking head on in the session, I had issues in that the artwork in the fields is too busy (with my eyes) to be functional and I didn't feel like I was farming (unlike in Agricola which I add has the subconscious threat of begging to create tension) because there were too many elements and mechanics to wade through to connect to the theme.

The overall impression though was the endgame strategy felt scripted in that you retire as many workers as you can into your Manor house (which for some reason cost me a lettuce, a sheep and a rare bottle of plonk to build!), I could go on but I don't want to sound like a curmudgeon!!

Nov. 2013: Tried this one with new buddy Kurt E at Euroquest.  I love Keyflower, but this game is very different and in my opinion not nearly as much fun.  For me at least, there was too much taking moves back and trying it again to see if there was a better way to do things.

Had a chance to play this last night. If you have played Agricola or Le Havre you know what this game is about. You place workers who generate resources, you expend resources to earn victory points. While resource management games are very euro this sort are just a touch heavier with multiple interacting resource types and usually having to reinvest your victory points for further production.
I have for the moment rated it 8, slightly ahead of Agricola and Le Havre, but likely I will push those down and this will drop into the high 7's. It is a good game, the competition amongst workers to harvest goods is original and quite clever; the market in which selling goods pushes the price down and buying them pushes it up is completely unoriginal but I think it is probably the best implementation of the idea I have seen. It is also much more elegant than its competitors. There are five resources which work in an identical way (no 'if you have two of those, or one of those then you get...' to remember) and one resource which works in fundementally the same way but is a little harder to get hold of and a little more valuable when you spend it.
There are some disappointments. The mechanism that causes production to vary is so-so, it does the job but doesn't impress. There is a purchase for points in the game that is such a good exchange rate (3.75 per resource, as opposed to a norm of about 2.5) that its a complete no-brainer. And then there is the tech-trees. These are guild cards, in which you can sponsor people as journeymen then promote them up through two levels, gaining points but more importantly bonuses(greater production/movement/reduced costs etc). This bit is a real dissapointment. After the rest of the game showing you can achieve the effects of Le Havre/Agricola without the fiddly nonsense this rather spoils it by using the same multiple cards (six guilds) doing functionally similar things. Rather than the random cards giving each game a different feel it just adds that pointless proliferation of options that irritates.
That one real fly in the ointment aside (and my suspicion is just house rule, No. of Guilds = Players -1, and Mansion House scores 0, will largely fix it) the game is quite entertaining. Probably too heavy to play with a family, potentially not competitive enough for a gamer group, but more deserving of a high ranked place than its two already mentioned competitors.

Rules look intimidating to start with lots of possible actions, but flow very quickly once they are understood.  Not that difficult mechanically to play especially as the icons help nicely.

How the moving parts work together is the challenge.  After our first play, lot's of discussion of the small improvements here and there we could have done to be more efficient in each of our engines.  Expect this to get better with repeated plays and a quicker flow through the game.

This game is great because it has a lot of different paths to victory and a lot of variables that fluctuate enough to keep the game from getting stale. The modular boards, variety of guilds and fluctuating market make this a worthwhile game for those who enjoy tight worker placement games.  I like the fact that the guilds act as a technology tree, that really adds something for me.

As for play time we find that we can play in 45-50 min for a 2p game.

Eleven beautiful sheets of cardboard art to punch out, plus two boards. You get a lot of goodies in this game and I find myself admiring the artwork when it's not my turn. I should be thinking about my future turns because there's a lot of planning ahead in this one.

The game itself is entertaining enough, with an interactive puzzle like feel, without being revolutionary or groundbreaking. It's a solid planning ahead exercise that's kept interesting game to game by the assortment of guilds that can appear (or not). Guilds allow special actions or points scoring and there's a race between players to get into the ones they either perceive to be the most useful, or the ones that fit their plans the best.

The rulebook looks a little overwhelming at first, but it's actually all quite straightforward just a tad verbose. In fact, it's got one of the best player aides you'll encounter and if you just follow that for the first couple of turns (consulting the rule book on occasion), you'll be up and running in no time.

If I was play testing this I'd say they needed to tweak the actions so they could be performed simultaneously (except for the farmer placement/movement and guild action) where possible. Unlimited resources should allow this and result in a faster game with less downtime - the weak point in the game.

I'm certainly a complete fan of the artwork and presentation, and this may influence my ranking somewhat. Time will tell. Worth getting to the table to try again and it plays quickly once you're familiar with your options.

A very solid economic/resource management game. There's a nice bit of area control as to what to harvest and the yield changes from round to round, meaning that you need to move your workers around. The market is well-modeled and the selling of goods blindly causes you to have to do some advance planning and also has some psychological aspects. Not quite so sure that I can give it a top rating yet, as I need to play it with more players.

UPDATE: Played with more players, and it's really solid.

1 play, 4er

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Construct the play area by giving each player a random 3x3 tile; they place the tile and a worker on one of the 8 non-village fields. There's a market board which is seeded with a number of each basic resource. Players start with one of each type of basic good (there are 5?), although they spend 2 of them (different for each player) to build their initial farmhouse. A number of randomly chosen guilds are also placed in the play area. Also start with some money. Another board tracks the 4 seasons of the 2 game years. Each season, two types of board locations production amounts will be modified (0-3).

On your turn, first may move workers (pay coins), then add new worker to board (costs 1/worker already in fields). Then, all workers in fields produce based on their location on the board (basic production is 1 or 2, modified by the current season's modifer tokens; no basic production in winter). After everyone has done these, do the market step: all players simultaneously commit 1+ resources, then reveal. In turn order, may either go to market to sell one type of resource (sell them all; earn price showing in market; ONE resource goes to market board, lowering price) or take one special action for this turn. The Specials include:
- get cash = 5-(# field workers); move to top of tiebreaker board
- buy one type of goods from market at current price; may buy as many as available
- may spend resources to send a worker (from pool or the fields) to a guild; or promote a guild member to a higher level, if available; or convert farmhouse to mansion; or retire a worker (if you have a mansion). All of these cost 2-4 [i]different[/i] resources; luxury items, produced in villages, can be used once for each payment to substitute for any 2 resources.

After every player has sold all their resources at market and taken/passed on their Special, they pay 1 coin/worker. Then, set the new turn order based on # field workers (fewer = earlier); if tied, use tiebreaker board to break the tie, and the winner moves to the bottom of the tiebreaker board. Reveal the current season's modifier chips, as well as Year 2's chips for the previous season.

After 2 years, get VP for retired workers, guild members, mansion, and remaining gold/resources. Most VP wins!

[b]--- Comments ---[/b]
What a cool game! Although the initial read through the rules took quite a while, the game play is very straightforward; the complexity in the game is from the interplay of the mechanisms -- right where you want it! There's a nice economy in the costs of recruiting/maintaining workers, goods production, and the buying and selling of goods in the market. There are several different ways to earn VP (retiring workers, advancing in guilds), and at first blush they seem to be pretty well balanced. I do wonder if a production/market-based strategy can work at all ... probably not!

I wish it were republished, but apparently that's not going to happen -- boo!

This one is difficult to rate. It's not a bad game for start but I don't enjoy playing it! It has lots of elements but the flow of the game and the dynamics don't convince me. The market, every time I played the game (twice so far!) didn't work at all and didn't seem interesting. Repeated actions all the time make the game a bit dull.

I've been a follower of Richard Breese and his R&D games, but I somehow managed to miss this one, as it was old out before I had the chance to pick it up. And I've been aching to play it ever since!
As the name implies this is a trading game. And being a Key game, you may expect some intense player interaction. What surprised me was how cramped the resource board was. This was very limiting and the amount of movement was very limited over the course of the game. This did not, however, lead to a stale game at all. Every turn was tense and thrilling. Every decision felt like the whole game depended on it.
I made a mistake by not paying for settling a town. By the time we found that out, none of us where sure if I could have payed for it. I paid for for it with interest at that very moment though, but that mistake might have won me the game. But it's hard to tell because I won with quite a lead.
In any case, despite this unfortunate mistake, the game still felt very thrilling and challenging all the way through.
Damn, why didn't I pick this up when it came out?

You need resources. You sell the resources at the market and get money. You need money to move and hire workers and the board (they get the resources), but money are also victory points.

You wan`t have also guild members. To bring a worker to a guild you need resources. Guild members helps you during the game (like you produce more, or pay less for workers etc.) and some at the end of the game.

You usually try to get luxury. It a joker for 2 resources and you can produce luxury in winter (where normaly are no production). It`s not so easy to get luxury.

You must manage your workers and resources. Look at the player order. So things that you do in other economic game, but you do this in Key Market in a different way. The farming theme is just like in Agricola, but Key Market is a different game. But like in Agricola many hard choices to make.

The only problem (maybe) is the replaybility. You have different boards, different guilds, but is this not to less? Will you be not try to do in every game the same things? I don`t know. I want to play more to find it out.

I think my rating will go up, maybe it will be a 10!

Is Key Market a gamer's game, or just a three-ring circus of ideas?  The game's namesake, the Market, has very little price movement.  Six cardboard buildings function as short tech-trees.  And a modular farming map adds area control and becomes the most interesting piece of business.  A fussy turn order is necessary to shuttle transactions between these diverse entities, and good luck finding an elegant flow.  Key Market is more fun to think about than to play.

RATING: 3
Should I say I've gotten a chance to play this considering I loathe this? Yes, gaming's great and that way I can truely say that is the kind of game least suitable for me. Non-intuitive, brutally unforgiving, no mechanisms of the game to balance itself (only elements of luck could do that - and the lack thereof is probably why people like it) and dry as I never thought dry could be. Sure makes me want to sail the ocean Gobi. Plus a gaming time that is unacceptable for this type of micromanagement. What the .... ? What's the point in playing games where you see who's going to win in turn 4 of 8, yet you have to endure for more than a further hour? In that regard it goes in the same vein of Sceptre of Zavandor and Augsburg 1520. So if you like this game you might want to give those a try. I can explain the praises for this game only because of another motivation: If I were to make retirement arranges and plan to later sell them - I wouldn't drop a single bad word about them either.

Wow.  One of my favorites of 2010 after only one play.  A clever and brutal economic game.  Reminds me of Planet Steam (minus some things like the turn order auctions) crossed with the worker placement and cute artwork of Keythedral and with a tech tree added in.  Really want more of this one.
A second play has confirmed if not strengthened my initial view on this.  I think this will probably settle into my top 10 when all is said and done.

RATING: 7.5
The Key series of games is a bit of an odd duck. To be honest, I thought the common element was that they were all designed by Breese, but this one isn't. So they're all set in medieval times and illustrated by Juliet Breese? Mechanically, they all work a bit differently. I've only played three now and mostly I like them. Key Harvest was a bit of a dud for me, but Keyflower is a game I liked a lot. And so is this one.

In Key Market you're hiring workers to farm your fields, which have some placement/movement restrictions. Then, every season, you're harvesting crops/animals, selling goods to market, and doing an extra "special" action. Most of the special actions relate to the guilds, and require different types of crops/animals. Every game has different guilds in play. Guilds give you the ability to train workers for points and special abilities. The interaction of different guilds will give each game a different puzzle to solve.

Much of the game is about placing your workers in the right field areas and selling to market effectively, but it's the guilds that really define the game and is what I found really interesting.

In my first play, I really undervalued resource production and how powerful being able to have more goods, especially different ones, would be. One other player went into guilds that let him produce more goods and the other went into a guild that let him sell his goods for lots of money and then buy them back cheaply, all before anyone else had a shot at the market. I struggled as a large chunk of my goods were just converted to coins, and I hadn't invested in a way of getting more resources effectively.

One topic of discussion during the game was about the selling price of the game, which is going for hundreds of dollars. I like the game a lot, and I'd really like to play more of it... but I don't think the game is worth hundreds of dollars. There's nothing about this game that puts it in a magical $200+ range. It's a good game, no doubt... but there are a lot of good games that you can get for $40-$60.

Not bad, but despite colorful graphics, actually quite dry. 

As in so many other "complex euro-games", there are plenty of rules that are there just to make your optimation process a bit harder (like the rule which tells you how you are allowed to place workers on the fields). I don't like this aspect in games in general.

Lots of decisions and lots of different ways of scoring points. You only get a small subset of guilds in play each game, so which ones are present and how they work together will provide lots of variety.

Really challenging spatial element on the farm boards, in that you can't have workers next to each other. And the area surrounding a worker is huge compared to the size of the boards, a single worker in the centre makes the entire rest of the board unavailable.

There's also a really nasty winter season mid-game, where you get no production. So you spend year 1 building up a nice workforce, then have a hard time paying for them. You can dismiss the workers to avoid paying, but then you have to slowly rebuild them up again...

Key Market is a multifaceted heavy Euro about money management and long term strategy. The different guilds, seasonal effects, and modular map give each session a different character.

Worker placement farming and gathering game with a auto adjusting commodity market. Random startup terrain map is small and requires clear strategy on worker placement. Random start guilds will influence your in game strategy as you promote workers to gain powers. Seasonal phases influence harvest yield of your apples, grain, fish, cabbage, and sheep. In the city you can produce what we call luxury eggplants (purple tokens). Part of year end is to pay salary to your workers or just FIRE them! This is a little heavy for us but maybe we will be up to the challenge by the next re-printing.

Een landbouwspel die de diepte in graaft.

Spelers verbouwen de landerijen om keytown en verhandelen hun goederen uiteindelijk op de Key Market (vandaar de naam). Hiervoor moet men zijn/haar werkers inzetten op de verschillende delen van het land om verschillende grondstoffen te verzamelen. De speler kan echter ook zijn/haar werkers laten werken in één van de gilden, wat zorgt voor zeer diverse voordelen in eigenlijk alle aspecten van het spel.

Het idee van de gilden is zeker leuk, maar er zitten iets te veel haken aan dit spel om een echte topper te zijn. Is wel nog steeds een leuk spel om te doen.

Its one of the best games around,not a boardgame per se,but still,its a game that you all should try. The minis are simply beatiful,the game play its very easy to get along,and with multiple options to choose from with each unit,you can headbutt enemy´s,shoot them with scatter guns,run them over,throw huge spears,cast spells,etc,etc.

Fun.  Has all the things that people want in a miniatures game- beautiful looking minis, simple and easy to learn rules, plenty of strategy.. all combined with the pure bestial rage of a horde of warbeasts charging into your enemies front lines and ripping them to pieces.  What's not to like?

Also, the game is fully compatible with Warmachine, so if you like that, you'll probably love this.

Skorne player. The game has really grown on me; I nearly didn't get it at all, and now I crave two other factions. What I love about Skorne is that it plays well beast-heavy, or can be treated as a primarily martial army.

Wonderful skirmish tabletop game and wonderful miniatures combined with good fluff.It might be a bit complicate for beginners as every miniature has its own special rules but I like this feature. It feels like a good miniature game combined with the wily combination of effects like in Magic the Gathering.Also good is that a starter box is enough for many interesting plays.

Privateer Press new fantasy based game.  Same base system as Warmachine, in fact the two can be played together pretty well.

I like the model lines (though they are not up to the standard of the old Rackham metal models) and the fact that the game is designed with smaller forces in mind, which prevents you from having to buy/paint many multiples of the models.  

I only got a handful of full games in and was in the process of learning the system when the boardgame bug bit me, but the system seemed fun and well balanced, though like most miniature games you can make weaker and stronger armies as you desire, and eventually a 'best' strategy for each army will be developed.

I expect to get back to this game at some point, as I have a few models left to assemble and paint to complete a fairly large Legion of Everblight force.

There are only four factions available for the game with is somewhat limiting.  With the expansions coming out as often as Warmachine expansions, you'd end up having to spend a fair bit of money each year to 'keep up', as the expansion models generally outperform the base models on the table (PP seems to embrace power creep in their games).

RATING: 9
The sequal to WarMachine is a much more elegant solution to that excellent system.  They have learned from their mistakes and put out a first rate product.  The book is absolutely gorgeous and the models so far have been excellent.

Picked this up because I like Warmachine, and it sounded interesting. When I realized I only wanted to build with the mech-like stone golems, though, I figured I should just stick with actual mechs.

RATING: 9.5
An incredibly fun game, tons of theme, and a tactical challenge, too.  Ultimately a game of risk management, Hordes plays more recklessly and enjoyably than Warmachine.  I look forward to much more to come for all the factions.   Overall, a really fun game that I'll play anytime.

OK.. I won't rate this game before playing but I have high expectations about it since it's a re-development of the original Warmachine with new twists. Really liked the new focus rules presented in the Qick rules (new options, risk of loosing control). Will give a rating as soon as I get my copy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A further refinement (and yet backwards compatible) of the already excellent Warmachine game. Armies are cheaper as beast-heavy forces are more viable and resource allocation decisions are made on the fly rather than at the beginning of the turn which allows more adaptability in your plans.  A worthy improvement!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A bit more flavorful in its gameplay than Warmachine, Hordes' "risk management" component has been amply covered elsewhere. Though I love both games, I think the addition of Hordes to the arena allows for wonderful synergy with its predecessor that elevates both games.

RATING: 9
More Warmachine action, but with creatures. This particular expansion brings under one umbrella, all the errata and Warmachine rules all wrapped in one fine cover. Have yet to finish reading the rules. What else is new. I just can not help it. Rules make me sleepy.

RATING: 4
It is just brilliant to release a separate game that is compatible with your previous game.  Haven't had a chance to play Hordes vs Jacks, but Hordes vs Hordes feels excelent.  I worry about my first game actually crossing over, because the Hordes models seem more powerful (Heavies that generate their own focus?  That's a special power of like two Jacks, but all Beasts can do it.) but hopefully that is just because they are new.

Update 8-4: Heh, on more plays, this is indeed a great expansion to Warmachine, because it takes all of the annoying bits, and makes them even worse.

This is Warmachine's little brother.  Whereas the WM factions are about giant steam-powered robots, the Hordes faction are about nasty monsters: trolls, four-armed elephant monsters, stone golems, and so on.  Hordes factions play fine with WM factions; the only difference between the two is how the army leaders (warlocks) interact with their main units (warbeasts).  Where the WM magic mechanic primarily is about resource management, in Hordes it's about risk management.  You can push your beasts much farther than a WM 'caster can push his robots; but you risk losing control of your beasts as a result.  The mechanic is simple and satisfying.

From a game design standpoint, I think the new factions and magic mechanic is slightly superior to WM.  From an aesthetic standpoint I much prefer WM's look, as the robots look mighty cool and I find those factions to be more original and interesting in general.

Ugh. My kingdom for a new idea. I cannot believe the year that this came out. A complete rehash of every minatures convention with nothing I could see to set it apart from the pack. As with all minis games, it is expensive, impossible to store, time consuming to play and paint, and an eventual dicefest. The theme has been done a bajillion times (which doesn't make it any less cool) and so have the mechanics (which doesn't make them any worse). But there is also no reason I can see that I would ever want to buy this as compared to any other game.

Hordes is basically what you get when you make a CCG in miniature form.  I realize it's not collectible, but there's a definite feel of rocks-paper-scissors that you get from a lot of CCGs, couples with "killer combos".  That's fine, but it wasn't what I was looking for.  For trade.

I like Hordes better than its counterpart, Warmachine (I'm more of a push your luck than resource management guy).  I do find Hordes/WM to have a much greater variety of play options than Warhammer/40K but the special maneuvers and combos can make the game feel too luck driven.  Given the choice, I'd prefer to play Song of Blades and Heroes, SuperSystem, or Mordheim but I do enjoy stomping my Circle models about occasionally.

RATING: 7
The game is fundamentaly a resource denial game. Warbeasts generate the one resource in the game: fury. As you destroy the opponent's warbeasts their resources dwindle. Warlocks in Hordes lack Warmahine's Warcaster's ability to come from behind and win. All in all the game is fun, but less promising than Warmachine IMO.

Okay, this is a good game, but for me Warmachine is so much better. There is just too much of rule ignoring (Legion of Everblight excels in that field) and too much fiddling with fury. Well I know that this is the reason why some people prefer Hordes, but not me :) I happen also to prefer the steam and steel theme to shamans and tribal sorcery.

Good miniatures game, where you must combine your abilities to take your opponent by suprise. Nastier than most other miniature games I've played, so learning curve is quite rough. However, knowing your opponent and yourself certainly pays well here. So perfect game for people who like to read a lot and plan ahead before actual game. I prefer Warmachine slightly over Hordes, although there are only minor differences in actual gameplay.

Fast and furious miniatures combat game.  Unique resource allocation mechanic called Fury, which allows you to push some of your models to do things they wouldn't normally be able to, such as cast spells, throw, head butt,slam, etc.  Has a sister game called WARMACHINE, which uses giant steam powered magical robots instead of raging beasts.

Hordes is det newest evolution in the Warmachine franchise. It is a stand alone game, and there are enough new and exciting stuff for it to stand up for itself. I've played and enjoyed both Horde vs. Hordes and Hordes vs. Warmachine and think it fits nicely together. The great thing that make this game stand apart from other tabletop games are the brilliant possibilities for cunning combos. This and the fairly easy to grasp rules. I play Khador, Mercenaries and Circle of Orboros.

I started with Privateer Press games as an alternative to Warhammer. I seldom play Warhammer now as a result. Unlike the GW games, the factions are more balanced and competitive--no more going to tournaments and having 16 out of 20 people playing the same army like I once experienced at a WH40K event. You aren't waiting 2 years for your Army book to get "updated" and then once it is released, half of your models are no longer usuable. You can start actually playing for much less money and time; you won't be sitting at the house for 2 months painting 50 goblins for your Orc Army before you play. It isn't perfect--there are no plastic models (yet) and there are more Warhammer players out there so it is easier to find an opponent for that game, but I hope more Warhammer players try these games and realize that there are other choices out there.

GAME: Unlock! The Nautilus' Traps
RANK: 4468

RATING: 8
Another enjoyable Unlock scenario.  I think I enjoy the second round of titles more than the first.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The Unlock! series is quickly becoming my least favourite of the series of escape room games. Like those that came before it, this one relies too heavily on the series' idiotic hidden number system, forcing you to scan every card in painstaking detail and reading into things that just aren't meant to be hidden numbers. The puzzles in this are convoluted and confusing, even when you use the hint system. There were a couple in this game in particular where the puzzle didn't make any sense even after viewing the solution. After this batch, I think I might be done with the Unlock! series as a whole.

RATING: 3
I found this to be the worst of the Unlock series by far. It requires knowledge of music (specifically piano) and older literary terms I was unfamiliar with although I’m fairly well read. 

The puzzles felt forced and unintuitive as well as sometimes nonsensical.

RATING: 8
Overall it was a good set of puzzles, but one definitely was not a well designed/calibrated puzzle.

RATING: 3
Having played all 5 before this one, I was wary of some of the negative reviews but decided to try it anyway. It was a mistake. This one is just bad. We only finished out of principle and ended up hinting our way to several solutions, something we never did in the past 5. Even then we thought  "Oh, ok?.." rather than "Ah!". Honestly, this one has me pausing before buying the next batch. Not sure if I'm over the series or not, but they're starting to feel samey.

RATING: 6
Some clever little puzzles to solve, but some had poor graphic design that made them extremely and needlessly difficult. Also, the app seemed to be loading the wrong graphic for one of the unlocked cards - it was only after we reopened and reloaded that page that it showed us the correct number. It was still fun but ended up being impossible for us to win (and it took us way too long to finish while dead).

RATING: 3
Penalizing you for flipping over a card whose number is clearly indicated is ridiculous and has never been done in previous Unlock games.  Unfortunately it sets a mood where you are afraid to turn over obvious card numbers from then on because you think you are going to get penalized again (you won't -- only the first scene has this problem).  Other than that, we enjoyed the game although we found it quite difficult and failed miserably.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS FOR THIS SPECIFIC GAME:[/b]

++ Some interesting puzzles (4 or 5), and still a fun challenge although we had some frustration (mostly my wife).
++ Again, really good theme in this one, with also a good sense of progression with an added tweak on the game formula to fit the theme better (sorry I cannot tell more here without being into spoiler territory).


:thumbsup: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS FOR THIS SPECIFIC GAME:[/b]

-- One thing that was frustrating in this game is being punished for obeying to the rules (we get it that it was a funny thing, but it could have been just one without the need to have a penalty for it).
-- A lot of the first Hints were very obvious, so we had to take the second one available, thus costing us 2 hints almost every times we check some.
-- Some puzzles were way less "thematic" than what the Unlock series have accustomed us to. It's not a bad thing by itself (as we love the more abstract puzzles of the EXIT series), but this lead us in some lost time.
-- One puzzle was poorly designed which lead to confusion and a lot of lost of time (this puzzle was also one of the less "thematic" one).
-- Another puzzle's hint was poorly phrased also leading to confusion and a lot of lost of time.

RATING: 5
Several of the puzzles seemed very unfair. Had a few fun moments solving some of the tricky ones but overall it left me a bit frustrated knowing there was no way I would get some of them.  
I didn't like getting penalized for investigating something. It made me think I needed to be more strategic about when I investigate a card number but after the first penalty it turned out I needed to investigate every single card number I saw!

RATING: 2
Really disappointing. The worst I've played in the series, and has put me off the "Unlock!" series in general.

Obscure, disappointing puzzles. Even when the solution to them were known, they were unsatisfying. The designer seemed more intent on tricking you by inconsistently applying the learned "rules" of the game than providing an interesting challenge that could be worked out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Components: Great artwork, but per usual with this series, the cards are too small. Many of the details aren't evident unless examining very close to my face, which makes it difficult for anyone else to see the same card.

Experience: I didn't enjoy this entry. Exploring a lost sea vessel is a cool theme, and I liked the use of oxygen, but otherwise I have too many complaints. The translation to English isn't the best quality; this was most evident on the very first card, which leaves the theme of the entire game very ambiguous (am I a diver, a scuba diver, or am I in a submarine?). The use of hidden numbers here drives me nuts, where there are mathematical expressions that result in a hidden number. One of the cards had a clue on it that was misleading about how to use the card. One of the cards had a 'Z' on it, which I misread as an 'N' and got an unexpected result. Some of the codes I couldn't solve without clues, and even when I knew the solution, I couldn't figure out how that solution was correct. One puzzle required that I know a word in English that to my knowledge I've never heard before. One of the puzzles required me to listen to sounds in the app, but the app had no sound. And finally, early on a card punished me for looking at it (not for incorrectly pairing two cards or failing a code, but rather just for looking at a free code), which made me want to be a lot more cautious with all my other free cards, which wasn't fun; it's like the game violated my trust in it. I think there was maybe only one puzzle (involving a map) where I felt clever for having solved it.

{Spoiler Free}

This game is kind of a disaster. To start, there are either translation issues or Verne-era language that I just didn't understand. The oxygen mechanic is fine, and the solving the machines in the app is fine...but the puzzles were a mess. I solved very few, if any on my own (though honestly towards the end I was just frustrated and wanted to be done). And even AFTER looking at all the hints and solutions, I almost never understood what was going on until after many more minutes of analyzing the cards. There are STILL two puzzles I don't understand. And the reason for this is that the app doesn't actually explain the solutions. Or give you useful hints! It goes something like this...

Hint 1: you need blah blah to solve the puzzle (well duh)
Hint 2: you need to use the one card to get the numbers from the other card (duh.........)
Solution: the answer is 1234 (???????????)

I wish I was kidding. All of the "Solutions" are like this. I had to reverse engineer them to figure them out. And even after I figured (most of) them out, I still felt cheated. There's maybe 1 or 2 decent puzzles in here out of....maybe 10?

Also on the off-chance anyone involved with this game reads this, no more gears puzzles please! They aren't interesting...

Really, cool, simple escape room type puzzle but not a flawless mechanic and there are some details that you are left to figure out with regard to how you interact with the support App that could stand to be clarified. I won't go into detail so as to avoid spoilers but there are points where you need to use the app to help you resolve clues (I'm not talking about hints) that we didn't realize until we started taking hints.

Enjoyable, even if flawed. I eventually pieced it all together, but not in the intended amount of time to make finding oxygen meaningful. I'm not so interested in solving these quickly, as I am in just solving them at all.

I see that many people found this one unintuitive. I actually thought it had the least frustrating leaps of faith of any Unlock I've played so far... except for the puzzle the translator ruined.

If you read this comment before playing The Nautilus' Traps, here is the thing you need to know, as unspoilery as possible:

One puzzle uses an incredibly obscure English word. If you find yourself thinking "I know what the solution would have to be, except _______ isn't a word", then go ahead and treat it as a word and you will be fine.

RATING: 5
This was the second Unlock! game I played and I did not like it.  There was one puzzle that I do not think is solvable with what you are given (card 37).  Also, there are two puzzles which I think are way too obtuse (cards 55 and 7).  Which is a shame, because I really enjoyed the rest of this Unlock.  But those made it basically unsolvable.

RATING: 7
The second Unlock I have played with my wife and children. We didn't even come close to solving either one of them. Yet again, I wanted to like it more than I did. It was easier than the first Unlock we played but still a couple of puzzles were super difficult and unintuitive. I am starting to see the flaws with this sort of game. The story aspect is light to nonexistent and every puzzle has to devolve down to a 4 digit code of some sort. Squeek and Sausage is up next.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (December 2017)
 
I´m currently loving the Unlock! Series of games. When they arrive I want to play them right away and that never happens, I have a game system that tells me which game to play next, but the Unlock! games can override it :D. After playing them, We began going to real escape rooms, we love them.

From the Unlock! Mystery Adventures, I prefer The Tonipal's Treasure over this one (but The Nautilus' Traps is better than The House on the Hill). For me, the issue is the difficulty of the games, even though I LOVE The House on the Hill´s theme, it is disappointingly easy. The Nautilus' Traps difficulty isn’t very high, but it was a fun adventure to play. The fun for me is to solve the puzzles without using any help, so I never ask for hints nor I let my partners to do so (gladly, we all are like this, to me it is very disappointing when a player want to give up in this kind of game.).

The art of the cards continues to be great and I, kind of, liked the theme.

Best with 3 players, with more players I feel it is too easy and all players don’t get to see all the puzzles.

In general, I have a bittersweet feeling about the game, like T.I.M.E Stories, once you played through it, you won’t play it again because you already know the answer so it has zero replay value. At least, in Space Cowboys´ games you don’t physically destroy the game, thus preserving the resale value. That’s the only reason I bought the whole series of games while I can’t buy The Exit series of games. It isn’t about the money though, I was raised in a third world country and I was always taught that you do not waste if you can avoid it so I loathe legacy style games that destroy or permanently modify the game. To me, it is immoral and unethical to create games that are disposable (even more when the designer can easily make them resettable), even if they create a great experience. Kudos to Space Cowboys for not doing this.

[o]
In Unlock! The Nautilus' Traps we were stuck in some parts due to the language, we played the American version of the game, but none of us is American so the obscure words hinder us most than native speakers (I guess), still, I really enjoyed the adventure. I don’t want to write much more to avoid spoilers.
[/o]

Bottom line, Unlock! The Nautilus' Traps is a good game, it has some interesting puzzles that wasn’t too easy or too hard. The theme is good. I cannot wait to play more Unlock! games.

Played it in 85 minutes with a lot of penalty's. But what a great scenario! I like the fact of the oxygen tanks as timers. The errors we made where stupid. Only the piano was a mind breaker. An after reading the solution here we think it is a little bit confusing. 
As a diver I loved the theme and already the first cards were great. The first penalty came too quickly in my opinion. But hey that didn't scared us. We are aware of the stupid mistakes we made and we are sure it would be able to get  out on time. Loved it!

We got stuck towards the end, and no additional glues would help us solve the puzzle. I also wish the app would show you how an answer was derived, rather than just give out the numerical code. The art was very nice! I liked the theming as well. In the end, it felt like a pick your own adventure game, rather than an escape room. Not bad. I'd play it again to see if I could finally solve it. May try the other Unlock stories as well.

Out of all Unlocks released in the US this is the worst Unlock episode we've played so far. So disappointed. I should actually give it a 1, not 2, but there are quite a few interesting ideas and I really liked the theme (as I liked Jules Verne's books when I was a kid). 

The biggest flaw of this episode is that in many, many cases you know how to solve the puzzle and yet cannot solve it due to a variety of factors. 

Problem 1: bad translation jobs here and there. One of the first puzzles has a word that neither of us knew. So we just lost a lot of time and hints trying to guess the last number. I'm sure it works better in other languages, but in English you know that the translator just used a dictionary to find this quite obscure word to hack the job.
EDIT: Yep, in French it was 's'éteint' = goes out. 

Problem 2: some cards/machines/puzzles look too alike and you can't help but think that these should work together, but they do not. Unfortunately, you only find out about it towards the end of the game. 

Problem 3: some puzzles cannot be solved (and of course, you are penalized for wrong answers) because one last card has not been revealed to you. But there is NOTHING to suggest that there is another card. E.g. the wire puzzle. Oh, you thought the answer should go like ABCD, well, think again, because here's another random card. 

Problem 4: some puzzles are very illogical. Generally, in the Unlock series, pieces fit together nicely with occasional leaps of faith. Here, we would often think, no, they couldn't have done that, it's just silly, but they actually did. In the sonar puzzle, for instance, why did they have to be columns? 

All in all, puzzle quality-wise the Exit series is superior. Which is a shame, because we really like the card system, the illustrations and some novel ideas of Unlock.

RATING: 5
A scenario with some nice twists -- e.g. finding oxygen canisters adds time -- but the problem with these is that only a single problematic puzzle ruins the whole experience. In this case there are more than one. Hidden objects are even more annoying than usual because of the unusually high time pressure.

One early puzzle involves what seems like it might just be a poor translation from the French, involving an uncommon word that makes no sense in context. The hint system is much improved in that it now does just give a solution if you push hard enough, but it still doesn't explain how to get there -- in the end we were able to reverse-engineer those that we couldn't get and the bit we got stuck on was [i]never[/i] what the hints were about.

OK, OK, if you hit your thumb with a hammer you have two options, blame yourself or blame the hammer. I'm not sure here whether the problem was us or the game, but I rather do think that the puzzles were hard for the wrong reasons, as evidenced by the fact that the hints almost always told us things we had already worked out. Judging by BGG comments we're not alone in this.

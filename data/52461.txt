Raising rating from 8 to 8.5 after replays. This game is one of the most unique games in my collection and everyone who I play it with loves it. At its core, it's a tableau-building engine builder worker placement with secret objectives. However, that description completely misses the soul of the game. The real beauty of this game is that every time you play, a crazy story of a family unfolds. One time, I had a family that became devoted to science after the death of a beloved mother, leading to the family's accumulation of honors for their achievement and her widower building an arch of love in her honor. Another time, my family seemed to be running a high-end brothel, based on our strange interest in marrying courtesans, strange birth events (won't spoil!), and impoverished aristocracy. The family tried to make up for it by buying titles, but no one was fooled. A friend's family was a news empire and was constantly blamed for all scandal-related birth events. Another friend had a family of obvious spies and secret society members, which seemed to constantly be accumulating great wealth from questionable sources. That's the beauty of this game. The family tree & storytelling is what give this game as a special place in my collection.

*Rating based on one play.

Love the theme, but the game feels like a missed opportunity.  It's mostly a worker placement game, and not a very interesting one at that.  It has numerous issues (listed below in the pros/cons) and doesn't do anything mechanically interesting, making it just a mediocre game.

+Unique theme
+Good artwork.  The variety of characters on the friends cards is excellent.
+You can choose either a male or female character to head your household.

=Numerous luck elements may turn of hard-core Euro gamers.

-Minimal scaling according to players (and none of the scaling changes the number of worker spaces available), which is a problem for a worker placement game.  Four player games will be much more crowded than two players.
-No means of competing for first player, which is generally a must in worker placement.
-Cards used for currency rather than tokens of some kind (and there aren't even enough!).
-Some vagaries in the rulebook.

The gameplay is solid and it is an absolute joy to play thematically. Like Agricola and Caverna, at the end of the game, the family line you have sired is just as great to talk about as the gameplay. Downside is the large space the game needs to be played comfortably and for more interaction, a larger player count is definitely preferred.

RATING: 5
It is 1729 in pre-revolution France, a time when the aristocracy has all the power and the means to rule the country. As a wealthy, well-educated aristocrat, you have travelled the world and had the fortune to enjoy your life to the fullest – but you see that history is about to change course and you know that in order to stay strong, your family must prepare well. You need to find new allies. You must absorb smaller families and use their potency to strengthen your kin. You have to arrange wise marriages, nurture strong connections at court, obtain titles, build mansions, and find the right spouses for your daughters and sons...

My impression is that the game would need additional playtesting. The actions are severely unbalanced and this is aggravated by the random distribution of free actions at specific phases. Neat idea but implementation could be much better, in my opinion.

A very good effort at a thematic euro that doesn't quite succeed. My rating would be higher if family traits could be passed down to succeeding generations...and if the card art wasn't so atrocious. It's also a tad on the heavy side.....heavy, that is, for a game that has sooo much luck in it!

Full review on game page.

Worker placement mechanic seems to only be there to force you to take pieces that you wouldn't otherwise, and is overly fiddly to accomplish that purpose.

The use of numbers is thematically sound, but the game still devolves to a whole bunch of numbers - which can be thought of us different currencies. If you play the game to win at all, it's a whole bunch of currency exchange optimization. That's really not what I bought this game for (which might not be fair to rate it on, but they do seem to be going for thematics, so I think it is fair).

I was hoping for something that evoked a story on its own. As it is, you have to do the heavy lifting yourself.

How much mileage can there be in playing amusing character cards and imagining back stories for them?  Not much for me.  Beyond that, Legacy is an altogether too straightforward game of action selection and card combos. What minimal interaction there is lies in taking a communal action before an opponent.  I don't mind that so much in a game as brief as Race for the Galaxy, but Legacy trudges on for three times a long, before fizzling out in an anti-climactic final round.

Production quality is decent and the artwork is quite nice, though it wasn't sensible to use blond and white for player colours when alternatives existed.

RATING: 6.5
Light προς medium weight worker placement eurogame με όμορφο και ιδιαίτερο θέμα, την δημιουργία του οικογενειακού σου δέντρου. Το θέμα περνάει πολύ όμορφα στο παιχνίδι και μπορείς εύκολα να δημιουργήσεις ιστορίες για τους γάμους και τα εγγόνια σου. :D

Επί της ουσίας ο κάθε παίκτης έχει 2-3 actions κάθε γύρα και μαζεύει κάρτες χαρακτήρων, κανονίζει γάμους, κάνει παιδιά ενώ παράλληλα μπορεί να αποκτήσει τίτλους ευγενείας, επαύλεις ή μπορεί να προσφέρει κοινωνικό έργο. Σκοπός φυσικά είναι να μαζέψεις πόντους φήμης.  

Οι παίκτες έχουν και ένα κρυφό objective από την αρχή του παιχνιδιού το οποίο σου δίνει πόντους στο τέλος και έτσι έχουν μια κατεύθυνση για την τακτική που θα πρέπει να ακολουθήσουν. Κυρίως για το τι εθνικότητας άτομα θα είναι καλό να προσθέσουν στην οικογένειά τους αλλά και τι επαγγέλματα θα είναι καλό αυτά να ακολουθούν. :)

Τα actions είναι λίγα και το gameplay είναι σφιχτό. Το πιο random στοιχείο στο παιχνίδι είναι οι γέννες. Εκτός από το τυχαίο φύλο του παιδιού, υπάρχει περίπτωση το παιδί να είναι χαρισματικό δίνοντας σου έτσι ένα μικρό ability ή χτύπα ξύλο να έχουμε επιπλοκές στη γέννα και να χάσουμε το παιδί ή την μητέρα. Αν σου τύχουν συνεχόμενες αναποδιές μένεις πίσω και δύσκολα νομίζω μπορείς να επανέλθεις στο παιχνίδι. :(

Τα γραφικά είναι πολύ όμορφα αλλά οι κάρτες είναι μικρού μεγέθους, μάλλον για να χωράει όλο το οικογενειακό δέντρο στο τραπέζι. θα ήθελα το παιχνίδι να έχει περισσότερα αξιώματα και δημόσια έργα, ώστε να έχει μια κάποια ποικιλία κάθε παρτίδα. Επίσης στην πρώτη μας παρτίδα είδαμε σχεδόν όλους τους χαρακτήρες. Θα μπορούσε να είχε καμιά εικοσαριά παραπάνω. :soblue:

Να σημειώσω επίσης πως η αλληλεπίδραση είναι σε πολύ χαμηλό βαθμό. Περιορίζεται μόνο στο ποιος θα προλάβει το κάθε action. Μας πήρε λίγο πάνω από μιάμιση ώρα για μια παρτίδα 3 παικτών. 

Το παιχνίδι δημιουργεί πολύ ωραίο narrative και σου αφήνει μια ευχάριστη αίσθηση στο τέλος αφού βλέπεις ολοκληρωμένο το γενεαλογικό σου δέντρο.  Προτείνετε για πιο casual παρέες.

We played this as a prototype, thanks to Richard (rahdo), who was an excellent and very patient explainer !

I liked a lot the feeling of development the game offers. During the game the players seem to have many tactical choices.

The only concerns I have about the gameplay are:

1)Lots of abilities have prerequisites that are hard to accomplish during early or mid-game. This means that usually you need to have planned a lot in order to earn bonuses for a card you just played.

2)It seems to me ( Ok, after just one play ) that giving birth to as many children as possible is a one-way road to victory in this game, especially in early game.

Anyway, overall I found the game a very pleasant experience. I would definitely like to play it again!

A favorite game of my wife and I.  It's original, thematic, and mechanically interesting.  It has lots of special card powers and synergies which is something I love.

I think an expansion would get this to the table a lot more often.  It needs more card variety for mansions, ventures, and especially patrons (end game scoring).

It's a bit of a multiplayer solitaire (although there is some competition for the friends and action spots) but for everyone it feels that they're building something.

Now here's a worker placement game with a unique theme. You begin with your family's patriarch/matriarch and slowly build up your family over generations. Make friends, marry off children, invest in the local economy or buy yourself a mansion. Legacy plays smooth and easy even for a work placement game. The theme is what really draws you in and there is more than enough strategy for hard core gamers to latch onto. Be warned however, this thing's footprint on your table will spread larger and larger (especially with 3-4 players) so be prepared for it.

After my first play I did not like this game at all. But after playing t a second time and learning the mechanics of it I find it to be very enjoyable. It's definitely not a party game, but if you're looking to have a quiet relaxing game, this is the one for you. It plays much better with the families expansion.
Edit: I recently played with the five families expansion. Adds a bit more depth to the game and overall makes it more enjoyable.

RATING: 6
A fun game due to its unusual theme, but it suffers from boring, interaction-free mechanics and some balancing issues. 

Maybe it is supposed to be a family game (no pun intended), but after a few rounds I got a little bored doing the same actions repeatedly, just to "produce" more children. The actions are simple but still require a fair bit of reading/thinking due to the 5 different friend cards that are available for many actions as well as the friend cards in your hand. Some actions feel useless for a great part of the game, while I felt there was a run-away leader problem during play, everything changed in the end due to private objective cards that were quite differently balanced. Also, player interaction felt forced.

I would rate a game like this lower usually, but the "Oh my god, now I have to marry my daughter to this ugly guy" and "Yay, the mother died, I can re-marry her now for extra bonuses" moments were great fun. Ehem.

The design was so-so, some colors did not make sense at all (a beige and a white player?) and there were too many decks of things, but the "friends" cards were illustrated greatly!

Firstly, the hidden goals are definetely not balanced which is unforgivable in a medium wieght 60-90 minutes game.

Secondly, the game is too random for being such long. I like random games when I play them 30-45 minutes, not 90.

Thirdly, this particular randomness (the sex of a child) drives me crazy. I hate it to my guts. Paying VP for choosing sex is also not a good solution. Everyone that I played with did not do it and they usually got what they want. Well... not me.

Fantástico!
Crear una familia en tres/cuatro generaciones, casándoles con astucia, dependiendo de la nacionalidad, el oficio o las habilidades especiales de ese nuero/a.
Una carta de objetivo para cada jugador que dirigirá los pasos de la partida... y el azar minimizado a base de acciones para conseguir más dinero, más acciones o más cartas... Y todo tratado con sutileza, buen humor, y con muchísima "clase".
Dos discos de acción, en siete rondas, y posibilidad de ganar tres o más discos adicionales, para poder ejecutar acciones muy simples: casar, tener hijos, adquirir titulos, mansiones o negocios, y pedir dinero o cartas. La combinacion de las cartas, las acciones y el orden hará que cada partida sea distinta y siempre con emcoción. 
Me encanta este juego. Tiene de todo lo que busco: familiar, "picante", poco azar, fácil de jugar, pocas reglas, muchísimas posibilidades de chistacos durante la partida y siempre me deja con sensación de querer más. 
Dale una oportunidad a una de esas joyas entre el fango.

Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy.  Struggled at beginning to work out what I was doing.  The friend cards never seemed the friends I wanted.  Did not like that only one player could use the coloured actions.  Loosing children or wives at child birth may not be everyone's idea of a good theme - especially when you can chose.  But it was useful to dispose of some of those unwanted spouses.  Surprisingly rallied round to equal second following my maximise breeding strategy.  I would play again now that I have a better understanding of objectives, but am not a fan of games which are very dependent on the luck of the cards you draw.

I have played the prototype. The game looks like an innovative euro, however I felt that it was too tiring to create a pool of abilities that the various characters offer. Other than this gameplay disadvantage, I think the game is an ok euro. I would consider buying the game if it were a bit easier to bring abilities into my family tree. I would not like the gameplay in general to be easier, so I would direct the game's difficulty to other aspects.

The debut game of dutch designer Michiel Hendriks is definitely worth playing!

Every player is the head of a noble french family in the 18th century, and must manage to solidify the family position in those turmoiling (for the nobility...) times.

With careful use of weddings with other nobles and various bourgeois, three generations of the family will be played among tragic complications at birth, testicular cuttings, an amusing gallery of portraits...

This game stays loyal to the motto of its publisher: boardgames that tell stories! Playing it is like living the decades long story of a big family, with the mechanics well supporting the narrative.

Good job, mr. Hendriks!

Initial tentative rating is 7.

Initial Impression: Wow! Talk about thematic. When explaining this game, everything makes thematic sense and is straightforward. This game has a nice amount of tension to go along with it's caricature artwork. There are only 18 actions (+ possibly bonus actions) to take in the entire game. As such, each action becomes invaluable. Overall, after the game we were able to step back and look at the family trees we had created, and recall the stories of the various characters involved. Overall, this is a wonderful game that can be taught to non-gamers but has the tension, card comboing, and economy of actions that will satisfy hard-core gamers.

2 player game. I beat Brian by 6 honor points. This works really well. I love worker placement games where each player can have workers that do different things, and this game has that. I also like how your strategy really comes down to your patron card. I expect Flo will enjoy this game immensely as the other game I used to have (Familienbande) that used the generation mechanic was a hit for her. Also, solo variant looks to be very entertaining as well.

I really enjoy this charming game...and my mother loves playing it as well.  Everything in the game is just so well-crafted, it's hard to not just sit back and take it all in after you finish playing.

As well, the addition of the stand-alone solo play rules are very well done.  Not just an afterthought... the boards are actually customized to facilitate solo play!

I would love a mini-expansion of additional friend/player/mission cards.  Would be willing to pay top dollar (hint hint)!

Now the published version is available I should update my rating. The developers at Portal did a great job polishing this further. Making a very good game into a great game. I learned to love the artwork as the drawings really bring out the table talk in the people I played it with. This adds to the theme even more as players create a compelling story for their family. The gameplay is so fluent and the game does not seem to get old because of the variety of friends and children. Even if there are less friends than in the prototype. Just the variation in when they come out and which ones you need for your children.

Card quality seemed a bit below par. But that could be because of the advanced copy I had for a few weeks. The ink seemed to rub off some cards and components. Sleeved my own copy straight away because of that.

The rulebook has improved so much since I first read it. It's now one of the best I've ever read. It puts so much emphasis on the theme when explaining the actions that remembering everything is very easy and intuitive. Such quality in the rulebook is certainly a first for Portal, so I suspect a lot of credit for this goes to Michiel.

All in all one of the most thematic and evocative worker placement games I ever played! Very highly recommended.

[q]Tentative rating after three playtests. I know the author but I still am objective. Really! Take these comments with or without a grain of salt.

Medium level euro packed with theme. You really feel that you are the head of the family looking for suitable partners for yourself, your children and your grandchildren. Gameplay is really fluent and there are many tough choices to be made. The number of roads to victory plus the fact they all seem balanced is a great accomplishment for this first time author. In my opinion there is still some tweaking to be done and the rules seem to need a rewrite. But that's no biggy while still in the testing fase. I see no reason why this game should not become an instant hit when it gets published.

Upgraded rating after the rules got updated.[/q]

RATING: 8.5
Maybe the most played game in my collection (except Love letter type of games).
The rules are very well designed, so it's extremely easy to understand how it plays.
The theme is great. You are a noble in the Renaissance Era. You're now in charge of creating your family tree. You want to create a legacy. A legacy that prevails to the challenges that come ahead. Nobility is in risk and now you have to have children and marry them to the most influential people you know (some might be nobles, some not).

Well, there are 3 ages in the game (a fourth comes in play for endgame scoring). In the first Age you marry someone and have children. Your children will play the 2nd Age, and they will have children. Your grandsons will play the 3rd Age... and you'll even have great grandsons! (4th age)

The theme is absolutely marvellous! In a worker placement mechanic, you'll chose some actions (as marrying your children, have children, make friends, etc) and as the game progresses you'll look to your family tree and you'll find that your family (originally french), has now some prussian, italian, spanish, american (etc) influences. You had to! Because some of theme give power to the family, other give money, other increases your income, so you'll have to think through your family needs, so it can keep growing the way it suits your goals.

The caveat of this game is the table space that is required to play the game. Even in a 2 player game you'll find yourself in need of room to put more cards.

Nonetheless, the game is a hit in my gaming group. I love it! It tells you a story as you kind of storytell your family events as your family tree grows.

Underrated game! I'd play it any time!

RATING: 5
I'm somewhat undecided in my score, but wanted to put one in anyway for future comparison. I thought the game was smart, but I felt like I didn't have enough direction. I also didn't like that I felt a bit trapped with only girl children, which made it tough on me financially throughout the game since male 'friends' cost more to marry. It's a neat idea, but I didn't think it felt well balanced. I'm sure if I played it a lot, many subtleties would come up, but it's just a bit directionless for me.

Really enjoyed playing 4 times, but feel like it will need an expansion to want to play it again. I love the family tree mechanic and the characters on the cards, but feel like the patron cards are too uneven. By the 3rd generation, I think the game drags and can feel overly long.

RATING: 7
One play. Action starved game, where you really want more marriages and other actions on your turn, but can't are forced to wait for them. Limited turns per generation force you to optimize your action selections. Great theme, making for an enjoyable gaming experience as you pair up the various marriage arrangements.

As a scholar of the eighteenth-century I love the theme, and the card art is fantastic. I love the abilities and combinations on each unique card, and think the Complications at Birth cards add an interesting bit of historical flavor. The relationship between your friends, wealth, and reputation and the actions you can take on the board are hilarious and totally thematic.

The scoring was one thing I wasn't fond of in the game, and was hard to keep track of. I also think that lucky draws/combos could so skew the scoring that someone's starting hand could conceivably win someone the game before they even start playing, since you have very little control over what comes out later on. I'll have to give this a couple more plays before I give a final verdict.

A neat game of managing your resources of money and friends in order to gain prestige to win the game!

Every player starts with a single matriarch/patriarch, gets them married, and starts having babies, with every subsequent generation doing the same!  The people you marry into your family and their children will all contribute to your family financially, to your family's legacy, or maybe help you to achieve those goals in some manner.

You can also have your family build mansions or attain fancy titles to advance your family name, but with some cost.

Overall, a really nice game of finding card combos and loopholes to advance our family better than the other players advance theirs.

What a fantastic game! There is so much that has been put into this game and it makes for excellent game play! This game is such that no two games would ever be the same! As a solo player, you can play as either two players or play the actual solo variant included in the rule book. Either option offers outstanding play time!! I have enjoyed this thoroughly! 
I love the artwork because it is so comical! I'd be scared to call some of those people relatives. :) The game designer did a fantastic job creating a game board that minimizes table space. After all, you'll need a lot of space to create a family. There are also plenty of people to sort through which can change each and every game. In the solo variant, a specific set of parents are predetermined. I have, on several occasions, switched these people to add variety and keep from having the parents standard each time. It can create a bit of variety and keeps things fresh. 
I HIGHLY recommend this game to everybody! I would also love to see this come to the app world, as it would make an excellent game for one player and several AI's!!

Building up an engine by building out your family tree is inventive and interesting.  The game works, but I did have a feeling that the luck might be in the wrong places (complications at birth, mission draws, card powers) for where the game is trying to drive you.  It also feels like everybody is trying to do the exact same thing with very little variation in how to play.  Need to play more to explore and am willing to do so.

RATING: 5
[b]Prototype Impression (+/- 2009)[/b] For a first design—at least, that's what I understood about the game—an impressive achievement. That above all else. The game is a snowball engine built around the 'construction' of a family tree in 18th century France; driving the engine is a worker placement mechanism with private non-blocking and public blocking actions. The players are managing six kinds of resources: cash and income, and fame and standing, and private and public friends. Total fame at the end determines the winner, and of course there are various ways in which to obtain it. Income and standing are added to cash and fame respectively at certain points, creating an interesting tradeoff between short and long term goals; public friends need to become private friends lest you are able to marry away your own offspring to them; they also function as a resource you can lose under certain circumstances. For example, purchasing a noble's title drives away a few of them, decreasing your options in the marriage department. The mechanics and subject fit together quite well in the sense that it is easy to understand why a particular action has a certain effect on various resources. A very nice touch.

What I am not so sure about is the rather long and slow start players must go through ere their engines are beginning to run more smoothly. There's a constant need for liquid assets at this stage, but you won't be able to get them all, let alone that the actions you want to take in order to secure them, are available. The game pushes you on rather relentlessly though, causing a noticable and perhaps annoying amount of friction in the process. There is a steep learning curve here which, once apexed, will undoubtedly make things proceed more smoothly; but at the same time I wonder to what extent. I'm not one for slightly different choices the results of which are magnified out over the course of the game with a good bit of chaos and screwage thrown in.

[b]Update[/b] The game has since been published, but I have not played the definitive version. I regret to say I have no real intention of doing so.

[b]Update 2[/b] While actually sitting down with a fresh copy, my overall impression was that Legacy is a much friendlier game than the Nobles original I had played so long ago. Instead of the game pushing you on it now offers you a choice; the public vs. private friends management seems to have lessened; and the final big VPs are not that influential anymore, instead offering nice diversions. All in all I think getting Nobles of Paris published has turned it into something smoother and more accessible: definitely a Good Thing. (Perhaps it is also me who has changed in the meantime; it can certainly not be ruled out.) 

The question remains, however, whether the game [i]now[/i] adds anything to the vast ocean of worker placements in publication. Back when Nobles of Paris was created, the worker placement core would definitely have been cause for appreciative glances and praise. But now it is just... derivative... in some way. A variation on a theme, so to speak, with few choices to make (because the number of action discs is so limited, the same problem which plagues Drum Roll). What then remains is the family tree concept, which remains a fun and in this case well-executed mechanism. Sadly everything is very nice and proper: no children born out of wedlock, for example. So there are no saucy tales to imagine as you breed your family... but still, the mechanism works well in Legacy, and gives you more knobs to turn than in the only other game I know using a family tree, Familienbande.

I found the ton of text on the Friend cards to be not particularly appealing, but I think it is also inevitable. The number of generations limits what can be done as a whole, adding a 4th generation would probably cause the game the spiral out of control, and the number of actions limits what can be done per generation, even if the number of action rounds is increased. You get special action abilities nearly by necessity to keep matters interesting: more actions would cause the tree to become impossibly big. Still, I'm not really a fan of such a mechanism: the different abilities turn the game into tactical comboing, and in this particular case the text is in a small font too. It strikes as rather dumb that the manual states that you should limit the size of the children deck so as to allow everyone clear access to the appropriate action space, and then uses a font on cards which is impossible to read from a distance, let alone upside down. 

Although it wasn't really my intent, it [i]was[/i] nice to play the game in the finished state. But Legacy is not a game I will rush out to purchase, and neither is it a game I plan on putting on the agenda myself. If it is on the table I will join in, though.

The theme in this game is very nice. You get to play the elder of the family and decide who gets to marry whom and who dies and who rises to fortune. In the end you tally the victory points your matchmaking over the generations has garnered and see which family is the most honorous.

I don't think honorous is a word, but I'm going to use it anyway.

The game feels too short when you lay down the components and set it up, but usually at the end of three generations you have reached your goals and are ready to end the game. So the lenght is great.

I would have preferred more realictic illustrations on the cards so some minus points there. Also, I would have liked more patron card variation (there are six of them and each player gets one, it's like a secret objective card) but these are my only complaints.

RATING: 6
Outside of the marriage / children mechanics, much of this game is simply turning currencies into other currencies in fairly straightforward ways, and "I got that [action / reward / friend] first" is the only major point of interaction. But the marriage piece of the game - where every potential spouse has an array of benefits and drawbacks, some of them dependent on who else is in your family - was engaging, and I expect I'd enjoy playing a few more times at least, even though most of the mechanics didn't grab me.

Also, it's the first game I've played in a while which gave me such a strong sense of narrative. (Entirely self-generated - the mechanics don't try to tie disparate events together - but still.) I mean, I found myself sad that the children cards didn't have names, and that's *utterly* irrelevant from a mechanical standpoint. I didn't just build a score, I built a family tree, with imagined quirks and foibles and tensions between generations, and that's a really neat thing for a boardgame to bring to the table.

This game has been a big hit with my group. The huge selection of friend cards really drive this game and keep it fresh, and there is something undeniably satisfying about looking over your family tree at the end of the game. I wish they had (i) included mansions/ventures with some diversity and (ii) that the child cards didn't all share art - they're too anonymous, and these are your FAMILY!

This is a good all around game. The theme of building your Dynasty across the generations really holds up better than I thought it would. The systems in play and how they interact are fun, such as nationality, and how honor and prestige interact. While the game lasts longer than the 1 hour stated on the box, it doesn't outwear its welcome, imo.

I'm a sucker for this type of game, though. Crusader Kings II, my own game The Glorious Fall, where you play a family moving through the ages. I like that as a backbone to a theme.

Will play the basic set a few more times before adding in the Five Families set I purchased.

A fun and solid little game. Don't play with 4 players, though... it makes the game way too long and adds very little to it.

In the game, you oversee four generations of your family, trying to make the most of opportunities presented by a pretty wide variety of cards and a handful of available actions.

Good combination cardplay and a little bit of worker placement. Some unique mechanics revolving around marrying, arranging future marriages, having children, etc.

The components aren't excellent, but they're OK. Everything's a little small and we do have some card backs which weren't color-matched very well. (I've contacted the publisher; hopefully they can offer replacements.)

RATING: 7
A truly bizarre game of marrying and reproducing. The rules are clear and easy to understand, but the gameplay is extremely complicated. The closest comparison I can make is to Race for the Galaxy, in that you're deciding which cards in your hand to play and which to spend to pay for them, as well as trying to put together card combos to generate extra actions, income, and/ or VP. "Race for the Nursery!" On the plus side, the symbols on the cards are mostly just symbols, with the actual effects spelled out in text.

You're juggling cards and money as currency to buy things, and "Prestige" and offspring as VP generators. There are a lot of moving parts, with several group actions to fight over and a number of personal actions that you can always take.

It's all very interesting, but I wonder how much of our scores were due to clever play and how much of them were due to having the right actions or cards available at the right times. Of course, there were several occasions when I was locked out of the best action for my goals, but I still won the game in a landslide. Also interesting was the fact that 3 of the 4 players blew well past the end of the scoring track, and the 4th only missed the end by a couple of points. Was it a very high-scoring game, or is the scoring track shorter than it should be?

Note that this game really needs to be played on a long, narrow table. Each player requires plenty of space to lay out his family tree, but everyone has to be close to the central card area to be able to read the small print on the cards. If the print were any smaller, the game would be nigh unplayable.

Its based on randomness with randomness in randomness, its random like a Monopoly.

Strategy is pointless in such environment and reaction to what is available on table is restricted by randomness of cards. AVOID!!!

I wouldn't play it with more than three players due to downtime but with three it's really enjoyable to build your family and gather "friends".

Players represent a French noble, in the 18th century, attempting to define a legacy by siring a prestigious family.  

Neat little engine building game, where you begin with a character and play through three generations (over nine rounds) of family growth.  Familiar worker placement/action taking mechanics are quickly picked up, as you get married, have children, marry them off .... and establish your legacy.

The meat of the game is in the large deck of "friends", who cycle through your hand.  They have various traits, such as a background, nationality, abilities that trigger for you if you marry them, and so on.  The key is to spot which friends work for your strategy, and which can be tossed aside(!) when you take the dubious actions such as open a trade shop, hire a fertility specialist, and so on.  The friends will grow your prestige and cash engines, which can be reinvested in further growth.

A very clean, fast playing (but not quick) game, that is very intuitive and easy to teach, but offers an hour or two of meaty engine building goodness.  Loved it.

Nice middle weight game about managing friends and family. Don't be fooled by the game manual, the game is actually fairly straightforward. The focus of the game is on the Friends cards and how they interact with each other as you are growing your family tree. Keep your focus as you do not have a lot of actions.
fun, but need to play a few more times to make sure I "get" it.

This is one of my favorite games (and my wife's as well). The theme is so strong and interwoven with the mechanics (mostly). There is a bit of a learning curve and some down time during turns, but I can get so engrossed in developing the backstory of my family that I don't mind sitting around waiting. My rating speaks for how much I love this game, but this game takes a lot of table space as you build your family tree.  This game really makes you agonize over how best to use your limited resources (i.e. friends/money), which can be frustrating.  

After a few more plays, the limited number of action tokens is brutal. I'm thinking about creating a house rule that somehow gives out more tokens. This might draw out the game too much and mess with the balance, but the game might have had length/balance problems already. Still, the theme is great!

I left for Essen 2013 with this as one of my Greatest Expectations. So much so that I even ordered the limited edition Wooden Box. More fool me. Boy was I woefully disappointed. This is a poor worker placement mixed with a card game, with the card element being driven largely by set collection. First the good bits: the artwork is wonderful and the gameplay is amusing, at least it is for half an hour when you marry and have kids and marry again and so on. And if this game lasted 45 minutes we'd all be happy. But it drags on for two and a half hours, and it eats the table space up as the dynasties expand. The game play is OK but the scoring is poor: the mission cards are way too swingy. Some are hard to achieve, some easy, some are based on random factors (if your prescribed set comes out on the cards available to you), and the accounting and upkeep is fiddly. When I criticise it I am told to lighten up and treat it as a family game. Wrong: this is far too fiddly and unintuitive in play to succeed as a family game and WAY too long. A major disappointment. Fortunately there were some other fine games at Essen to make up for this one.

This is one of the better action-selection games I have played in recent memory, and there have been many on the table.  While the mechanics of the game are relatively simple and easy to grasp, the integration with the theme and the overall tableau you create is delightful.  My only complaint is that it could use some sort of alternate win conditions other than prestige.  Despite the goal cards and missions, the game ultimately boils down to how much prestige you can squeeze out of the potential marriages you arrange from your hand.  While the aforementioned tools can provide a few swings in scoring, you basically want to collect shields, collect shields, collect shields.

Great game and as a bonus, it has some exquisite artwork.

Very interesting game.  It seemed light at first, but then I taught the game and was like, "Wow!  I'm explaining a lot of stuff here," but then it was time to play and the game play was really smooth, and, for the most part, intuitive; but! it was also tense and brain burny as the game pulls you in five different directions at once, and you only have a few discs a round to execute the ten actions you want to take.  In short, there are many many many choices to choose from and some are going to get left on the cutting room floor. 

There are numbers to crunch in this game, but all the math is dirt simple.  The crucial decisions feel more like choosing a path rather than comparing a lot of algebraic equations.  I'm not opposed to crunchy number games, but I prefer when the math is more in the background, and the theme and presentation of this game do a good job of masking the numbers.

The rulebook and the graphic design on this game are really excellent too.  After I play a game for the first time, I go back and re-read the rules because I usually manage to foul at least one thing up.  With this game, we played correctly right off the bat.

My greatest hope is that they make a companion game about building a mafia family.  It would be really awesome!

Anyway, this is a really solid game that's definitely worth it's weight in currency.  It's an aristocratic thoroughbred to be sure.

This is a medium weight worker placement style Eurogame set in 18th century France.  The goal of the game is to grow your family and build its legacy.  This is done by finding a suitable spouse from your circle of friends, having children, finding them spouses, and so on for 3 generations.  

In addition to marriage and procreation, players may invest in ventures, purchase mansions, acquire titles, and contribute to the community to gain income and prestige.

This game is actually highly thematic and it is quite fun to watch your family tree grow.  You might even catch yourself growing attached to family members and creating fun back stories for them.  I found myself making suboptimal moves sometimes to maintain the narrative of the family.  It is quite satisfying to look back at the completed family tree at the end of the game.

As typical of most Eurogames, there is not a lot of direct player conflict, but blocking actions and taking friend cards can directly affect your opponents' plans.   

There are a couple of possible drawbacks that I want to mention, the first being the listed playtime.  It definitely takes longer than 60 minutes unless you're talking about maybe the solo player variant.  I'd say your playtimes will be closer to 90-150 minutes depending on number of players and familiarity.  The good thing is that down time is mitigated because players take turn selecting and resolving their actions 1 at a time, rather than 1 player doing all of theirs at once.

The second issue is the table space required.  Players will need enough space to have 4 generations of family members laid out on the table, plus their own player board, mission card(s), patron card, and money pile.

These really aren't major issues, so don't let that keep you from trying this great game!

This rating and comment are based watching part of a demo before bailing as it couldn't hold my attention. It's a cute theme, and maybe it'd work as a light offering at the end of the day with a partner, but there's very little game play for more serious gamers. 

It needed to be developed in a way that offered a) better worker placement options and b) far, far richer card play. One suggestion was that traits could be passed down to future generations such that it would actually matter which parents you match up, and that sounds like a good (and thematic) place to start. The cards don't combo much at all such that the decisions are painlessly easy. 

I am further disinclined towards Portal games at this point.

[b]The theme:[/b] In Legacy, you build your Middle-Age family throughout 4 generations of marriages, childbirths, women dying at childbirths and re-marriaging of the fathers. It doesn't sound very interesting for guys, I guess, and it did not impress me much either. But while playing, I realized it was actually a hard-core euro game with very well connected mechanisms to the theme. I loved how at every childbirth, there might be a complication and you had to decide to either lose the mother or the child. Sometimes, it was really heart-breaking. 

[b]The components:[/b] The artwork on the cards is really fun (like, the only woman who can have 4 children is really, really ugly). The rest is just standard euro-y artwork, nothing exceptional but also nothing that would offend me or anything.

[b]The fun:[/b] Typical worker-placement game where the only interaction you have with other players is when you step on an action they wanted or vice versa. Other than that it is pretty solitaire so if you like these kinds of games, then sure, it is fun :)

[b]The gameplay:[/b] It truly is a worker-placement, optimization game. You have limited amount of actions and limited number of generations and then the game just ends and you need to count score. So every decision matters and every turn is important. I do like these kinds of games (with exceptions) and I did like this one. Not enough to buy it but I would very gladly play again.

Decent game, mostly enjoyed my single play so far.  Feel like the "stillborn" card can be really harmful if you get unlucky early in the game.  Also wasn't really a fan of the screwage in some of the mission bonuses, particularly since some missions had them while others did not.

It's a really fun game, tactical/strategic enough for me not to get bored (I like "Through the Ages" and such like) and light enough for me to have fun and a good laugh  with my friends/designer-husband (I am a very bad loser!). 

It keeps surprising me how my friends (all non-gamers) totally love to come over and (re)play the game, despite it being rather difficult for somebody who's never played anything except a few mainstream games. Some may think I am biased, Michiel being my husband and all, but he will know I am brutally honest when it comes to games (very difficult to please and picky, since it is mostly his hobby and not mine.)

Quite liked it, the mechanisms fitted the theme very well, it played out nicely. Lost of housekeeping and quite fiddly with teeny cubes and teeny text. But a lot to like here. I especially liked the use of friends, for marrying or for discarding as costs. Some downtime, little interaction, but overall, a nice solid euro.

I really like the family mechanisms and the unique characters, but there seems to be more mechanisms than necessary (too many card decks) and a feeble worker placement engine.

I think more of the game should have been focused around the friends, and less on titles, contributions, mansions, ventures, and missions. Competing over friends in order to make them marry into your family makes more sense thematically, and is mechanically more coherent.

A játékban családfőket alakítunk, akik 3-4 generáción keresztül egyengetik családjuk sorsát. Ez tulajdonképp nem más, mint családfaépítés, gyermekeinknek a megfelelő pár megtalálásával, majd újabb gyermekem nemzésével.

    A játék két fő mechanizmusból áll össze:
    1. munkáslehelyezéses akcióválasztás
    2. a barátkártyákból kártyakombózás

    Házasíthatunk, gyerekeket csinálhatunk, címeket szerezhetünk, kölcsönt vehetünk fel, vállalkozásba kezdhetünk, mindezt 3 generáción és kb 10 körön keresztül.

    Kicsit ambivalnes érzéseim vannak a játékkal kapcsolatban. A téma nagyon eltalált, és nagyon erős, a mechanizmussal se lenne alapjaiban baj, de sok dolog iszonyat kiegyensúlyozatlannak tűnt. Vannak akciók, amik nagyon erősek és vannak olyan, amik nagyon gyengék tudnak lenni, és ehhez képest viszont drágák. Különösen igaz ez a játék második felére, amikor bevételt növelni már nincs sok értelme, mégis kaphatsz random olyan akciót, amivel csak azt tudsz csinálni, míg más meg duplagyerekcsinálást kap. Tekintve, hogy kb. 25-30 akcióból áll a játék, ennek nagy súlya lehet. Nem kicsi benne a szerencse szerepe máshol se, de olyan sok helyen jön elő, hogy talán nagyjából kiegyensúlyozódik.

    Nem lenne ezekkel baj, ha egy 45-60 perces játékról beszélnénk, de egy 90 percesbe szerintem ez már nem fér annyira bele.

    Azért szívesen próbálgatnám még, mert az erős tematika, a kártyás kombózgatás miatt közel áll a szívemhez. Valahogy minden mozzanatában a last will jutott eszembe:
    A grafika hasonló, ott is kártyákkal kell kombózni, a tematika ott is rendhagyó és erős. Ráadásul ott is hasonló furcsaságok vannak, de nagyon nagy különbség, hogy az fele ennyi ideig tart.

    Az originhoz hasonlóan bajban vagyok a pontozással, mert egyfelől nagyon tetszik a tematika, meg kártyakombós mechanizmus, másfelől fáj a kiegyensúlyozatlanság, és a szerencse/játékidő tényező. Mindent figyelembe véve nálam egyelőre 6.9, de mindenképp adnék még neki esélyt.

    u.i.: sokan nehezen tolerálják benne szülési kompikációkat, amiben vagy a gyermek vagy az anya meghal. Kicsit morbidnak hangzik, de nem tudom miért kéne ennek tabunak lennie egy játékban, ha közben fél világokat írtunk ki a háborús játékainkban.

Legacy is an odd game. It clearly puts theme before mechanism, but it doesn't even try to use the various mechanisms it does combine to their fullest potential. The worker placement part falls rather flat because half of it takes place on your personal player board without interference, and the card combinations are typically rather weak and also depend on lucky draws.

Legacy is a long and sprawling game with little strategic direction, very little interaction, and heaps of randomness thrown in for thematic reasons (including my favourite pet peeve "oh, wrong card, sorry, you just lost your turn!"). I don't see enough interesting game in there to justify the length.

VERMÄCHTNIS ist eine Kreuzung aus WP und Kombi-King-Patience mit dem lieben Thema Heirat, Zwangsheirat und Kinder zeugen. Man baut sich eine Platz einnehmende und ausfächernde Kartenauslage in Form eines Familienstammbaums aus Kindern und Kindeskindern über drei Generationen hinweg mit diversen Zwischenwertungen und Geldausschüttungen. Dabei ist das Spiel, das seinen ganz eigenen Charme und Stil hat, mehr taktischer denn strategischer Natur und an Arbeitereinsätzen knapp gehalten. Was mir bei meiner Entjungferungspartie noch recht beliebig vorkam, entwickelte sich zu einem handlungseingeschränkten Mangel-Ding, die sich dennoch leichtfüssig und vergnüglich anfühlt ohne strategische Bandbreite zu bieten.

What a really fun thematic game!! I'm so glad I purchased this! I have played this game mostly solo with the Testament variant (which comes with the game). I found this game a ton of fun with a theme I've not seen in any of my other games. What I really like about this is it is not a beat your high score (although you can do that as well if you wish). You have 3 generations to fulfill 9 hints about your unknown family ties. If you can complete all 9, then you win. If you don't win, then you can still try to beat your score next time. I have won by the skin of my teeth. Check out the Rodney Smith videos on Youtube for this Testament variant (it is an excellent video to learn it).

The theme and the art are cool.  The mechanic of marrying off family members and having children is interesting.  There are two big problems with this game, though.  The first is miscarriages.  Obviously, this isn't fun thematically and it isn't fun mechanically either; you only get two actions per round and when this happens you basically lose an action.  The biggest problem is that the whole third round is boring.  At that point, your children no longer grow up and you can't get the benefits from marrying them off, which is the best part of the game.  This game needs to be re-balanced; there are too few moves in the first two rounds and no worth while moves in the third, and longest, round.

Clever, well integrated theme. But once the novelty of "role playing" the various characters has worn thin then the actual game turns out be quite uninspiring and a bit dull.

Light action selection game with lots of cards, and requiring a large amount of space.  For the most part, I found it to be unoriginal and uninspired.  It has aspects of an engine-builder, but it wasn't enough to really engage since the trade off of VPs or money is only 3 rounds.  There's only 2 rounds of payoff even if you manage a small bump on round 1, which isn't an incentive compared to later cards that offer more VP anyway.  One of many odd design choices IMO.  Also, VPs or money is a well worn trade-off in hundreds of games.  The novelty seems to lean on the forced marriage theme, where you try to fulfill bonuses through "friends" you've drafted from a limited selection on the display.  There's just not enough meat to really pull me in, and the "complications" draw is a strange mechanic IMO.  Not only do you "get" to choose to kill either a baby or a mother, it's simply added randomness from a mechanics viewpoint.  I suppose it was an attempt to do something to bring in the theme of generational marriage.  This is not a terrible game by any means, just far down my list of preferred choices.

Opinion: nice them for a good game, make your family grow over 3 generations marrying your family members or arranging them for the future. With so few actions available you have quite some things to take into account. The actions on the main board can be played only by one player, while the ones on your personal board can be done more than once. Keep in mind your goal card for the end of the game while you try to score some points during the game.
Probably more than one game is needed to get the real feel of the game, as, probably, you will only see one option to score points (having children) but you can score lot of points with a small family if you combine well the friend cards you are going to use for them.

A great idea. The game has a big replayability value.

I would have added more secondary missions, titles and contributions cards, it would increase replayability. Especially for that big price you are asking for, for a game that does not have figurines and is very small (could fit in a smaller box). 

Like Agricola, you are just missing that last one or two move to complete your strategy. Nicely done!

Drawings are nice (if these are going to be in the official release) and the gameplay is simply fluid. :)

Thumbs up!

The only downside is its ridiculous high price for a card game... sheesh!

Nothing new mechanically, and it doesn't really function as a worker placement game, as half of the actions are on the individual player boards. But the theme is well implemented. You have children, they grow and get married, they have children and so on across three generations. The problem is that you don't do a lot more than that. There are other actions, of course, but they seem accessory.

Also, it is one of those games that don't feel too luck-driven as a whole but have small amounts of randomness in almost everything. Thus, luck definitely plays a role in the outcome, but it is hard to pinpoint when and where it is decisive. There are, for example, birth complications that one gets by random draw and cause the death of the child or the mother, harming the player for no other reason than being thematically appropriate.

However, it is not a bad game, maybe just not for me. I detest games that have many different cards with special power text, and here they also have different costs in different currencies, a profession icon, a nationality icon, and conditional benefits based on those icons. As a result, the person cards really slow down the pace as you choose which ones to take, to keep, to add to your family or to discard as currency.

Love this game.  Really just a card combo game, with a restrictive tableau mechanic, but it is thematic, and relaatively easy worker placement.  I like it a whole lot.  Time to get the expansion.

(07/16/2014) Comment based on 2 plays.

This is an interesting worker-placement, card drafting, geneology game, where players try to gain the most honor by developing and nurturing the most prestigious and wealthy family, during the time of the French aristocracy prior to the French Revolution.

There are three generations, with a total of nine turns interspersed. The first generation gets only two turns, the second three, and the third gets four turns. Each turn, each player has a minimum of two "action" pawns/workers, that they can place on their own player tableau, or on the main board, which then locks out the other players from that action. Additional action pawns can be acquired either randomly at the beginning of the second and third generations, or by marrying an influential friend.

The game centers around marrying well, having children, and trying to get them to marry well, have children, and so forth. Along the way, players can acquire titles, make public contributions, build mansions, start ventures, or begin missions, all which affect prestige, income, or the amount of friends a family has. More importantly, players can try to have additional children (marrying automatically qualifies a couple for one offspring), arrange marriages for their still young children, marry off their adult children, ask for money from friends, or socialize to increase the network of friends.

As players get more notoriety, they may lose friends due to jealously and envy. Prestige and income are similar to the VP and income generators in St. Petersburg, where prestige adds to a family's honor, or VP track. Income will bring in money, which is initially tight. However, it is the player's hidden hand of "friends" that makes or breaks the game for them. Each has a cost/dowry to marry, a nationality, a profession, adjustment to prestige or income, additional friends, and a one-time benefit when they marry into the family. By carefully arranging marriages with influential friends allows the family to grow, in terms of prestige, income, but most importantly children. The nationalities and professions can be considered additional differentiators for the purposes of satisfying patrons (secret objectives) and missions.

However, having children was a risky proposition, and it is possible that the couple may have "complications", resulting in the loss of the child or the mother. A player has to make this agonizing decision, as losing the child means a loss of a precious action. There is a large element of randomness in this regard, but there are some avenues to mitigate this in the game. The other element of randomness is the friends that show up at the main board. For example, you may have a bunch of daughters you wish to marry off, but the main board may have nothing but female friends--very frustrating.

All in all, it is a simple, delightful game that conveys the feeling of growing a family dynasty, and plays relatively fast, except for the first several games (clocking in at over two hours). The rules seem convoluted and dense, when the game can be quickly explained. It is the various small text on the cards and the numerous interactions that will provoke the worst case of AP and agonizing decisions. The cards are of good quality, and the components are decent. The game doesn't take up much volume in the oversized box, but does have a huge footprint on the table, as the cards get splayed out. We're concerned about the replayability, as it seems there's not too much depth, and some of the patron cards (e.g., Madame Pompadour) seem too powerful. Still, it is a solid "8".

(01/03/2015) 9 plays. Friends have commented that this is a thematically rich game, where the game mechanisms/actions are integrated meaningfully with the theme. Every action dealing with the dispensing of friends is agonizing, as well as the extremely tight economics of very little money. Asking friends for money makes sense--push too far, and you lose a friendship as well as honor. Getting titles, selecting the gender of babies, or starting a venture, all result in the consequence of losing friends. It's all about friends management.  With more plays in, we're beginning to see the multi-layer intricacies of friends, with regards to their nationality, occupation, benefit(s), and dowry cost, all having both tactical (limited benefit during the current generation) and strategic implications (satisfying the patron). It's a tough nut to crack, with so many variables to consider, but absolutely delightful to solve and immensely satisfying if it results in a win. Even if it doesn't, one can look at their tableau and see the family tree growth and take pride in their accomplishment. I'm raising this to a "9". This is bordering on being a great game.

(04/06/2015) 15 plays. I think I can articulate as to why I have been hesitant to raise this to a perfect "10", because it isn't perfect--there are a number of sharp edges to the game that lead to unsatisfactory plays. One group member vehemently refuses to play anymore, after a poor 4th game, where he produced nothing but daughters for Gen II and had to beg for money to get them married off. The claim is that he knew at that point that he had lost, and that he would sit through the next 2 hours watching someone else win. That may be true of other games, however, such as Stephan Feld's various "point salad" games like Notre Dame, where one cannot catch up with a runaway leader no matter how good your later plays are. I have had some poor games where "Complications" came up SIX times devastating my game and making my game that much more difficult to satisfy Madame Pompadour. Also, in a recent game, I was dealt complications in Gen I while using the Fertility Doctor, so I only ended up with two Gen II children. It happened again when a Gen III daughter grew up and attempted to have a child in an arranged marriage, so that couple ended up childless. Still, I managed to close within one VP in that game, but in the middle of the game seemed hopeless. There's also the issue of being dealt the head of the family card that has the light blue wooden disk for the Fertility Doctor action, but the player is in 3rd or 4th position; they will most likely be blocked out of that space in Gen I, meaning the disc is literally useless. Others have complained that the orange disc for Ventures is a disadvantage, since it is so expensive in terms of friends, that they don't want to bother with it.

Well, it has some rough spots dealing some unsuspecting player an unsatisfactory game, gameplay may ride on a knife-edge of randomness that some may not find appealing. But, perhaps that is life and this game is a rather accurate simulation of it--the emotions that are triggered may be too close to home. In some you'll end up with a rich and powerful aristocratic dynasty whose family name survives through the ages (well, at least up to the French Revolution), while in others you'll end up as has-been family that is forgotten in the dust bin of history--that's life lived on a grand scale. And the scale is epic, with a theme so rich and vivid that one is compelled to visit it again and again--what other game allows you to relive your "life" in so many variations? I think it is a great game, even if it is not a "10", but more of an acquired taste. It is still a solid "9".

The best thing to do with this game is sit next to people who are playing it and listen to the ridiculous sentences which it inspires. Actually, I quite enjoyed playing it. I tend to like drafting games, and there's certainly such an aspect in this game. Drawing the disks is interesting because you're good at a different thing each time, although this can become unbalanced if someone ends up drawing a bad disk ever time.  (2 plays)

RATING: 6
Great idea for a game, but the implementation is quite lacklustre. The action selection elements in particular feel underdone. To achieve anything in the game, you need lots of children, so spending as many actions as possible on that seems compulsory. And with so few actions each round, that doesn't leave many actions for much else, and the other options are all fairly dreary anyway.

Personally I like the pre-revolutionary setting too, it warms the cockles of my proletarian heart to imagine everybody bundled into a tumbril and guillotined just after the game ends.

Nice art for the characters, and some more fun to be had if you want to role play it a bit and make up stories about the various families as you go. A good effort but not really successful for me.

Awesome game! I need to find this again. Played it so much with some friends for a month when traveling. 
The central mechanism is drawing cards (partners), which marry and have children and award bonuses depending on their nationality and attributes. After about 10 plays, I started to see some of the limitations. My only issue was that it could do with more player interaction. Perhaps if the cards' effects affected other players. And it could do with more patron cards too.

RATING: 7
Genealogically-themed worker placer/set collector where you are trying to construct a family tree with spouses that will give you bonus points based on their characteristics.  The available spouses will often score points based on their occupation or nationality, and combos can be built in cases where you have multiples of one type of person, for example.

A relatively heavy game, where a number of actions are available to you and you only have 2 actions available per turn (plus bonus actions you may have won) so it can be a bit of a brain-burner trying to decide which 2 things are going to score you the most points.  The game is very long (for what it is, in my opinion) already and this makes the added AP a bit frustrating, but not unbearable.

I did enjoy the game - it has fun artwork and it can be exciting to build up a big-scoring combo of points, but I think it needs to be a bit shorter and with more player interaction.

1) takes up too much table space

3) every game is the same, just get lots of family members, play the best of whatever you draw

Interesting theme badly executed, not enough mitigation of the randomness of the card draw, and even if there was it would still be a 1 dimensional game.

Great game! Really fun theme with beautiful artwork. We need more original themes like this on board gaming!

Very simple worker placement with a big eye on long term planning. You can go heavy into getting lots of money that opens up many options for you or you can go for the "old school" prestige route and build up family honor (points) over the course of the game. 

Make sure you have a lot of table space! Scales well with 2 or 4 players (I haven't played with three)

It's good. 

Building a family tree over three generations, you have to decide when and to whom your kids marry, when they will have further kids, and what friends you want. You can also spend your scarce actions on progressing your family, building mansions and business ventures, and seeking titles and/or doing public good to generate money and advance your prestige. 

Underneath it there are some euro staples like action pawns and juggling different types of resources, but there is a lot of fresh stuff too. I like in particular how the theme's driven a number of the mechanisms and decisions you're presented with. The designer has thought hard about why certain actions and decisions would have had the results they do in the game back in pre-revolutionary French society, unlike a large number of identikit Euros that feel like the same bag of mechanics have been given a shake and a few pulled out and given an arbitrary coat of paint.

There's usually something available that will advance your cause, and because of this and the limited number of actions there very little of the blocking that clogs up a number of worker placement games and can turn them into frustrating experiences.

There's not a lot of interaction and given the size of the box larger player and central boards would have been appreciated (the various point tracks are way too small and fiddly), but overall a fun and original euro.

I love the concept and the building of generations.  The game loads you with choices, and feels highly thematic.  And it's really quite fun to play.

This is a fun, family building worker placement card game. There's a decent amount of variety and no single path to victory. The cards and effects are all very thematic. It's a pretty simple game, really, but there are a lot of interesting decisions. Would very much like to see an expansion with some more patrons, missions, titles, contributions, and stating cards. Maybe some kind of variance in ventures, too.

Let's get the labeling corrected first! This is not an age 8+ game that plays in 60 minutes as the box claims. It is a 12+ game that plays in 120 minutes. If you were looking for a game to play with your 8-year-old, this is not it. Too much information to track!

I want to say that this is an enjoyable worker-placement game with a lot of personality. However, I think it is more accurate to say that this is a mid-weight worker placement game that provides a foundation for your game group to bring out their personalities. 

The different combinations and options mechanically are pretty limited and not that exciting. However, the basis of the game is building a family tree. You have a hand of friends that you marry off to your sons and daughters and they have sons and daughters that you marry off to more friends. The friends are amusing and the artwork comical enough, but to really make the game sing, you need players who enjoy telling stories about their families and filling in the gaps that the game doesn't tell you. If you have THAT kind of game group (fortunately, I do!), then this game can be a hoot. 

I do think this is crowd dependent and if your group values mechanics more than anything, don't bother with this one. I also think replayability could be an issue since there isn't enough variety to continue to delight. This game should be easily expandable, however.

Disappointing. It tries to be a narrative game but it is nonetheless a mess that takes up a huge space on the table, with few actions to do and a high randomness: in the goals, the friend cards, the new-born children, and the action pawns. Nice artwork but unreasonable box for so few contents.

Your goal is to be a matchmaker between couples. Then they have children and you help them find mates. The mates are cards in your hand that you play. You also build up your income and victory point generation based on the couples or other cards that you can buy. Some couples gain bonuses by matching characteristics of other couples already in the family. There are also cards which give bonus points at the end for meeting certain conditions. At first just based on the theme I wasn't sure if I would like the game. Overall it offers some interesting strategy and I really enjoyed the game.

A sprawling experience-focused Euro game. Worth playing occasionally as it’s fun to see your family tree grow but there’s not much to discover on repeat plays. The payout to be earned in terms of tactical or strategic challenges is not enough to justify the game length and rules overhead when looking beyond the well-integrated theme. A few too many options feign depth while only adding chrome. I wouldn’t mind playing Legacy again but my positive opinion directly after the game changed quickly to a more neutral stance when thinking about the game.

The theme is good for table-talk, but the gameplay is extremely boring.

The interactions between the cards aren't interesting enough to make this work as a combo-builder game. As a worker placement game this fails completely due to the low number of public action spaces. As a game rather than a solitaire experience this fails completely since I couldn't care less about what the other players were doing, and if I had cared would have needed to read lots of tiny print across a large table to figure out what their setup was like.

Both the playtime and the amount of table space required is pretty ridiculous for something this content-free.

Solitaire possible.

There are two solo variants included with the game.

The official Standard solo game is better with this variant by kittenhoarder:
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1156204/solo-variant-closer-2-player-game

---

  Interesting and unusual theme. 

 Each character and "friend" has unique artwork (although the "child" cards don't).

 The game uses a lot of table space, even for solo play.

 The solo game variants are in need of clarification. (Luckily, the game designer has answered most of the questions in the BGG forums for the game.) Also, IMHO the standard solo variant isn't much fun (but Kittenhoarder's solitaire variant, found on Boardgamegeek, makes it better), and the Testament solo variant needs more Hint cards for replayability.

Plenty of pros, but lots of cons as well. First, the theme is there, but that means the "complication" cards which involve the choice of killing a mother or her unborn child feel real icky.

An interesting game with a tight limit on actions. The driving mechanism is the friends cards and working them out to mesh together well along with a little bit of luck with births is the way to victory. 
Someone with thought processes that can draw all these threads together will enjoy this game whereas others may find the mechanisms messy and frustrating.
Overall this game is worth giving a try but I offer no guarantees that it will reach the gaming table too frequently.
A quick moan about the amount of boxed air I got with this game. This game could easily fit into a bookcase sized box (if not smaller) and yet it comes in a box the same size as the large KOSMOS box. As such this will be one of the early ones to go to make space for newcomers.

A pretty novel game in which you marry off people and have kids and gradually build a family tree. It's got a lot of neat ideas and is very well produced. I especially like that the player boards have a flipside that presents the available actions in a more thematic way. Unfortunately, there's very little player interaction, so it's really a case of just seeing if what you built does better than what the others built. Nevertheless, there's fun in forming a narrative about your family.

While [b][thing=52461][/thing][/b] is full of whimsical theme, I don't find the decision making all that engrossing.  It certainly doesn't help that you get bonus action disks of a colour that defines its action - so it's only a question of when you'll play it.  The only real tension in the game is whether or not your opponent(s) will take a public action space before you get to it.  So while [b][thing=52461][/thing][/b] is a game that I might use it as a gateway, it doesn't have enough depth for me.

Worker placement card game set in the french renaissance - Build a family tree over 9 turns by marrying you family to gain prestige and money. Have children for the next generation and continue your tree over 4 generations.

Original theme and gameplay. 
Marrying your friends to your family members and letting them have children to score points, and gain money, is not something that I saw before in a game.

Downside is, that it's a pretty solitaire game. Building your family tree is something you do on your own. There is only some small competition about certain special actions. 

I don't really like the game material. This could have been done better. I'm missing a marker to indicate the different generations for example. Score markers are important and its too easy to push one of those markers from the board, which ruins your whole game. 
Cards are very small a bit hard to read. The board is really minimal. Legacy is a card game, so why does it need to be in such a big box?

Minus: 3 (interaction) - 4 - 5 - 8

First efforts by new designers tend to ignore some of the boundaries between casual and the more strategic games. Whether these boundaries constitute well-established wisdom or hidebound pigeonholing is very much a subjective matter, but it seems safe to say that few designers would be bold enough to pair a long and demanding worker placement game with random events that severely punish some players.

The theme and lovingly detailed characters make for a very enjoyable first play, and I'm sure that you could a couple more plays out of it by treating it as an adventure game, i.e. roll with the punches and try to see the story unfolding from the fickle fortunes bestowed upon your descendants. What I'm not sure about after just a single play is whether the strategic options are strong enough to hold out over the inherent elements of blind luck in the long run.

Sorry Michiel for taking it a full year to be played, but last Weekend it finally found it´s way on the table. Made some mistakes I noticed after re-reading, but I enjoyed the "normal" Solo Mission quite some. I really had lots of fun, however, I was missing anything I could not really specify what it might be... Maybe I should play it multiplayer. Or maybe it´s to be seen in a future expansion.

Going onward to the "Testament" Solo Version, which looks very(!) promising. Might adjust rating afterwards.

So far, it´s a very solid 8 plus x. Will recommend this one definitely!

Edit 2014-10-29:
Had a solo game with the "Testament" Variant yesterday, and had a blast! (though several questions came up) I lost very closely due to one hint card not fulfilled (which I could have solved one action phase later - that´s life!), but scored 65 points which I consider not too bad for the first run. Can´t wait to play it again! :-)

As for expansion idea / wishes / hopes:
Would really love to see more variety and mechanics in following expansions. Ventures and mansions should be more variable, so I hope the mansion bonus cards which have been released as promo bonus (I did not receive them last year at Portal Booth :-(  ) will be included (and expanded variety-wise) to accomodate different play styles.

Change in selection for special action tokens in Beginning of Gen 2 and 3 is needed as well (though the german rules have been changed to accomodate this), and I would love to see an element like "first pass, second pass - first player, second player next round" (small game board). Then, more of everything. :-)

Great theme, wonderful mix of worker placement and combination building. Two player friendly as well, takes up a fair bit of room though, which explains why the cards are as small as they are. Very favourable impression from first play through however, with another couple of games I think we will start to grasp all of the tactical options available to us. Looking forward to playing it again.

Wen mit wem und wann? Meinen schmucken Sohn mit der Farmerstochter oder wird es doch der preußische Oberst für meine Tochter? Das sind die großen Fragen in Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy. 
Hier führe ich meine Familie mittels eines einfachen Workerplacement-Mechanismus über 4 Generationen hin zu Rum und Ansehen. Dabei überzeugen sowohl die schlanken, eingänglichen Regeln als auch die überraschend hohe Spieltiefe. Diese kommt durch die Liebe zum Detail auf, die man in diesem Spiel spüren kann. Es wurde versucht, möglichst viel davon in ein schlankes Spiel zu packen, was dem Autor meiner Meinung nach gelungen ist. Verheirate ich meine Kinder mit sehr "attraktiven" Kandidaten, muss ich schon mal tief in die Tasche greifen, damit sich diese auch erbarmen. Oder gebe ich lieber meinen Sohn in die Hände einer Bauerstochter? Deren Vater wird sich bestimmt erkenntlich zeigen..

RATING: 7
Nice dynasty building theme (both setting and mechanics matching it) but the amount of cards and table space makes things rather fiddly. 

The solo modes are generally overly long for what they are although perhaps that is just some of my AP as I was trying to figure out how to solve the puzzle in front of me.  Interested to play this with others - rate it as a 7 for solo play.  The testament variant ends up really cumbersome due to the amount of table space and constant shifting of the family tree.  I found the basis solo game to be tighter, but lacked some of the challenge that playing with others will bring.

Pretty good effort this game. Building card combo's in a new way via your marriages and your family build up, some worker placement, some resource management, hand management, some planning. Quite a nice puzzling game. On the downside: some of the central board actions are much more useful, so more popular, than others. And the game is rather solitary. And it took two hours to play, which is a bit long for the depth it offers, but we should be able to cut that down in future plays.

An excellent game in which players build family trees. There is a fair bit of randomness, particularly when playing with "miscarriages," but this randomness can be controlled to some extent, so it does not bother me. My favorite part of this game is trying to satisfy my goal cards and trying to get the most points out of each family member. It isn't easy!

The disembodied heads on the children cards are a bit disturbing.

Great, unique theme, but seems like a lot of luck for the complexity and fiddliness involved. Setting it up is a pain, breaking it down is a pain, and dealing with the finicky family tree tableau is thematic, but also a pain. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This one sits at an odd intersection of light and harsh gameplay. It feels like a light sort of game, as you see loads of cards and you're trying to find combos that work together while keeping an eye on your endgame scoring goal but you're limited to a paltry 2 actions per round over 9 rounds. You get a few extra bonus actions, but you're still pretty short on time. 

Fortunately, I like it when my games are oppressive in some way, and I'd rather have that tension than a wide open romp. The theme is pretty neat, and at the end of the game you can look at your family tree (not unlike enjoying your farm at the end of Agricola) and feel like something was accomplished, win or lose. 

It feels a little bit like Race for the Galaxy to me in that you're going to see a lot of cards but you have to be choosy about what you keep because you won't be able to play them all. My wife and I are pretty fond of this as a 2-player game; I don't see additional players adding anything except more downtime and more table space.

This game totally surprised me.  The artwork of the cards is fantastic and the whole thing just gushes with theme.  I have so much fun playing it, and it doesn't feel mechanical.  I AM fashioning my family tree, attempting to bring the most noble people into my family, snubbing friends (if necessary) in order to climb the social ladder.  Our conversations about our actions only establish the theme more: "I really need more friends," or "Well, I only married her for the money," or "Where am I going to find a nice Frenchman for my daughter."

If I had a complaint, it is only that I wish there was a little MORE of what's already in the box, a few more patron cards, and more possibilities for titles & contributions (for a bit more variety), more money cards (these almost always run a bit short), and more friends (there is already a great mix, but one can never have too many friends).  Actually, for your money I think you get quite a lot of stuff, but a good game always calls for a little more.  An expansion, if there were to be one, should definitely include the above, and maybe 1 or 2 more action possibilities, although building your family keeps you busy as it is.  I wouldn't mind some variety in the mansions and ventures so that they could give you slightly different possibilities.  

But as it is, it's a great game that I just appreciate more and more each time I play.  That's why I'm upping my rating from an 8 to a 9.

Shades of Last Will, another worker-placement hybrid. And like Last Will, I feel a bit like the complexity overshadows the theme. There's just so much to keep track of that the characters kind of melt away. But maybe as it becomes more familiar, the theme will shine through.

I really enjoy this one.  We often find that our families start taking on certain themes as we play (lots of craftsmen, lost of one particular nationality, etc.) due to the goals we are trying to achieve, which adds a nice little layer of storytelling to the game.  It plays a little differently than other worker placement games I own, and I'm happy to have it in my collection.

Unfortunately, the game doesn't come with one of the necessary components: a huge honking table.  Also unfortunately, the cards used for currency in the game STINK.  There just aren't enough, and they get messy as the game progresses.  I use the coins from Tuscany as a replacement.

What a deceptively unwieldy game! Despite components consisting mostly of cards, the building of one's family tree can consume more table space than a game of Solitaire! I can't imagine playing a 4-player game of Legacy: The Testament Of Duke De Crecy on anything smaller than a Snooker table. I like the idea of the game, and although I hate to say it, this may have been better executed as a video game due to the unlimited virtual space and easier organization a computer can provide.

The 'Testament' solo variant is an interesting reversal of the standard L:tToDdC gameplay, but very confusing. There are too few hint cards though. More should have been created to improve play variety.

I loved the theme for this game, but after one play, I've gotta say that I was disappointed in the fiddliness of it. It takes up a lot of table space with all the cards. I was also sorta sad at the price I paid for the game, considering the quality of the cards and the lack of many pieces.

At about the halfway point of the game, the only actions I took were marry/arrange marriage. With both tokens. There might be a smarter way to play. One of the patron cards seems really unbalanced: 1 pt. per marriage, when marriage is the central action that everyone is taking.

I know the games will be different because the characters will vary, but I still have doubts: at certain point, it might become repetitive and the novelty factor will fade out.

The rules are quite easy to learn, but it takes some time to explain it. Overall, the game is much more thinky than it seems.

Our games last well over the advertised 1 hour. The setup is also a bit lenghty (just a bit).

Simpaticissima idea di fondo, il tutto è anche abbastanza ambientato con idee carine e carte altrettanto simpatiche (i vari personaggi/amici che incontriamo). In sostanza dobbiamo riuscire a far diventare la nostra famiglia la più prolifica e nobile di tutte.
Al lato pratico però la partita diventa una noiosa ripetizione di azioni, il gioco ha un'interazione minima e quel poco di interazione, la scelta delle azioni in comune, è comunque dettata più dall'ordine di gioco che dalla possibilità di scegliere strategie vincenti. Poi c'è la pesca delle carte e quindi l'incidenza del fattore c.

Different than other set-collection Euros. Sure, there are victory points and the theme could be seen as dull and esoteric but the game play is engaging and light-hearted. Legacy is your basic set collection with a few twists of luck and strategy thrown in, and fun artwork to boot. It's cute and plays quickly. My only issue would be the size of the game; there's simply not enough room to grow my family tree. And box size! The game definitely violates rules of using every inch of the box. Tiny cards with tiny components? The box shouldn't be taking any more room than say Biblios or Diamonds. But, overall, Legacy is a fun, fast game.

RATING: 7
A big deck of card effects combined with missions to be fulfilled, and playing mostly sandbox stuff, hits a lot of good notes for me. The gameplay seems much slower than its projected 60 min timeframe because there's so many effect options you want to consider, both in your hand and in the draft on the table. I like the combo of worker placement spots that are competed for and those that aren't, meaning there are always decent alternatives if turn order stuffs you up, which is my usual worker placement issue in a limited action game. There are pathways to explore vis a vis cranking out kids vs consolidation (mansions, titles, etc), but I'm wary that the game's going to feel a bit same-y purely because so much of it is sandbox-y. Building a family tree isn't all that exciting so it gets downers for theme, but it feels like there's more to explore so I'm happy to try it again to see if it rises some in the tension stakes.

Very good game.  Theme appeals to gamers and non-gamers alike.  Easy to learn and fun to play.  I usually play it with 2 players, but it surprisingly played well with 4. The one 4 player game that I played took 2 hours, which was decent considering there were 2 new players in the game.

EDIT: Played another 2 hour 4 player game.  Great fun.  I like the extra tension and blocking of actions.

Legacy is a worker-placement card game in which you're trying to grow your family's size, income, and prestige over multiple generations.  You collect friend cards, and can either "spend" them like commodities to get various benefits, or marry the good ones to add some useful card text to your family.  The game feels very well-balanced between acquiring wealth, making lots of friends, and producing a lot of offspring--and various goal cards give players a goal and keep them on their own paths.  The footprint for this game is a little nuts, as there are cards everywhere, but overall I thought this was a very fun game.

A fun theme that is pretty widely underrepresented. The artwork is fantastic and the components are pretty good. I'm not sure how much replay is in this game and not just from a technical standpoint. I felt as if there should have been more titles or have different ventures or something to mix it up a bit. Solid game, but one that will fade into my collection.

Side Note: I'm missing 2 of the blue players pieces and even though I contacted Portal, the pieces got lost in the mail. I don't really want to trouble them again for just 2 pieces since I'm sure it was expensive enough to ship them before.

RATING: 6
Multiplayer solitaire with a bunch of weird, not entirely successful ideas. 

Things that work: there are just an ass-ton of cards, and in games driven by cards that's always a good thing. It's pretty thematic. It plays fairly quickly once everybody is on board.

Things that don't work so well: offspring deck is weirdly random for no real reason that I can tell (other than theme). The way people cards are picked up from the board is executed very poorly, giving disjointed levels of rewards based on getting the second-to-last card; also, these cards are the only thing that refills during the round, for pretty much no reason that I can fathom. That way you go through the whole deck at least once in a game, kind of eliminating the point of having so many different ones to begin with (variety). Randomly distributed colored tokens that are passed out each generation that are restricted to one type of action by color... why??? The way that the families are distributed on the table can have no real rhyme or reason, and can (and will) end up looking like a confusing clusterfuck. Arranged marriages just seem mostly pointless.

The game seems good but the marketing work with it of Portal Games was better. A Eurogame become a thematic game but not enough. The solo variant is too easy to win, not challenge, also has incomplete or unfinished rules for it. The game goes losing rating after each play. Low replayability. Get away from the Duke.

Build a family tree. Marry off your children to lovely foreigners. Make donations and gain fabulous titles. The theme of legacy was really great. It’s good to see something new, and the art really complements the theme, even if the mechanics are rather abstract. The game seems well-balanced, as our three-player match ended in a three-way tie! I tend to favor games with many actions, and there are overall very in Legacy. Typcially a player has two actions per round, though he can earn bonus actions that are tied to specific areas on the board. With so few actions, I feel that any one single action can have an effect on the outcome, and with the degree of randomness here, that turns me off. Regardless, this is firmly a “don’t-need-to-own-but-happy-to-play-again” game for me.

Excellent family game, on both senses of the word. At core, this is a simple mixture of worker placement with a tableau card game, where you lay down cards and look for the best combos. 

But it is the theme that really pulls this one off. It is very immersive, as you really see a family tree beginning to take shape. Soon you will be exchanging jokes about the potential and actual spouses you manage to get to your offspring, how you shake your friends for money or how you award titles to your family members. Highly recommended!

Tight game that focuses on building a family tree. It's at it's heart a really tight worker placement game where you have very little time and very few workers with which to complete your tasks. It can be a little random as having children is very important to this game and there is a set of cards randomly in the baby deck that kills the child or mother. Getting one of those early can mean a huge disadvantage for that player, but overall there seem to be ways to make up the points. The thing I find most appealing to this game is the execution of it's theme. I really get into the spirit of things and the idea of having a family tree game in the first place is unique and interesting.

Enjoyed myself playing it, but couldn't help feeling like it was strangely limited in the choices you could make.  A single complicated birth in the first or second generation can be absolutely devastating, which can make it somewhat frustrating for first timers.  Make sure you shuffle the bejeezus out of the child deck, as well, or you'll find yourself out of the game early.
I found myself comparing this game to Saint Petersberg (although the tiny cards and the engine building premise may have been part of that)...and unfortunately I think it suffers in comparison.  
I'd give it a tentative recommendation, but only if you can get it on the cheap.

I had high hopes for this game and got disappointed. The idea sounded cool, the artwork looked funny and reviews called it an 'expert' game. 
In my opinion it's not an expert game, after you have read the unnecessarily complex rulebook, you have no longer a lot to do. In fact I got bored. The box is extremely oversized btw.

There's a lot to like in Legacy. The game is filled from head to toe with beautiful art, and it's always fun to watch your family grow throughout the game. You can never really rely on the same strategy from game to game, so by the end of the last round you'll always have built something totally unique.
That being said, the winner is usually the player lucky enough to have the better friend cards available on their turn or have less birth complication cards drawn. Also, I am not a big fan of the random action tokens each round, so we house-ruled that in my group.
Overall, Legacy is a fun romp through genetics, and even though I never feel especially in control of my family's success, I always feel like I've accomplished something by the time it's all done.

Played with four, and it was way too long. This is a classic example of a game with complexity without having a lot of depth. There's a lot of text on the cards, so choices matter, but there's too many variables for those choices to become meaningful. I'd like it better if it were lighter, but there's too much going on for that. I also find the theme uninteresting, for some reason.

06-09-2014. Rated after 1 play. Legacy is a game in which you try go build a successful family with many titles/wealth and children. You start the game with a start character, that gives you a base income and status. You then try to expand your wealth, family and children by taking actions using a WP mechanism, and try to collect sets of icons in your family in order to score VPs. 

It is possible in the game that your family members suffer miscarriage in which you sacrifice the mother or kid. This could be a problem, which it is not for me. Given child/mother mortality in the past it adds a lot of thematic flavor. One potential downside is that female start character is that they may die losing you many starting resources.

I like it. Easy to play with a very nicely executed theme. The only downside is that female starting characters seems risky, although you could always sacrifice your newborn I think.

Óriási vágyakozással vártam, hogy megkaparintsam a játékot. Előzetesen ugyanis rengeteg jóságot olvastam róla. A magasra tett lécet egyáltalán nem verte le! Nagyon jó kis játék ez, ami valahol a gémer és a családi határára pozícionálható. Érdekes, hogy effektív egymásnak keresztbe tevés nagyon kevés van benne, mint ahogy az interakciót is minimálisnak érzem. Mindezek ellenére fantasztikus jó építgetnie az embernek a saját kis családfáját. Tényleg, szinte másodlagos, hogy végül ki gyűjti a legtöbb csillagot, ami a győztes kilétét határozza meg. A rengeteg lap közel végtelen kombinációs lehetőséget biztosít, nagyon jó kis story-k születhetnek mindamellett. Csak ajánlani tudom, de azért kénytelen vagyok a negatívumait is feljegyezni: sajnos nem  prémium minőségű (műanyag) kártyákat rejt a doboz, ez hosszú távon lehet gondot okoz majd (?). Gyakorlatilag ez az egész egy kártyajáték, ami miatt különösen érthetetlen, hogy miért kellett belecsomagolni mindezt egy ilyen óriási dobozba. Ráadásul az árát is szépen megkérik, de a hangulat miatt azt mondom, minden forintját megérte!

One of the most entertaining games of this style I've played. Point engines over a finite number of rounds are typically not for me, but the presentation of Legacy goes a long way to amend the core game of numbers and optimal choices. Building a family legacy is realized very well, and you get a sense of being this old head of the family that makes the calls as to who gets what or who - in the interest of the family of course.

Ultimately however, it's still a numbers game, and sometimes the plays that help you win cut in front of  the juicier plays. This is especially the case on the last round, which is also the time you exert the most control in the game. To appeal to me more, there should be a limited set of goals with a low threshold to win and inter-family scheming, even intra-family fighting.

RATING: 6
A novel theme, fast play time and mostly easy rules make this an attractive entry to the worker placement card valuation genre. Because of the asymmetrical starting positions and wonderful wealth of different character traits it's quite fun to evaluate your own position and chose your own path. A lot of the game is about looking for opportunities to match nationalities or professions to the friends cards. It's a low interaction game for a worker placement. I'd like to say that everything flows smoothly and by the end you can admire your own little bunch of nobles, but you also feel a certain amount of exhaustion. There's just so much to take in. You'll be trying to build up your income and prestige - one is often at the expense of the other. Look out for certain friends. Try and fulfil your mission cards and patron goal. Yet there's not that many actions in the game. Intriguing.

There are a number of elements I'm still somewhat uncertain about in the rules - a few gaps I don't quite get. I rather like it - reminds me of Last Will by Czech Games Edition, but I enjoy this one a little more.

A game that pretends to be much more than it is.  Marry and have kids, rinse and repeat.  dull dull dull.  And seriously - the complications a birth cards are ridiculous.  I really do get that back in the day babies and mothers died regularly in childbirth.  But when the rest of the game is very lighthearted, lets not pretend this is supposed to be some sort of historical simulation.  As my wife and I went through a miscarriage, and know several people who are still devastated at the loss of a child - what an awful thing to put in a game of this type (again, not a historical game by any means).  Not only that - its so damn random that I can't imagine why its even in the game.  Overall, a swingy, dull game.  At the end all of our points were nearly equal - generally a bad sign for me.  I mean really - we all did just as well as each other?  I find it hard to believe.  No fun.

RATING: 7
A worker placement game with interesting and quirky theme and art. Plays best with a group that gets into character and that appreciates the flavor of the cards. On later turns the expanding family tree (card tableau) of each player can start to feel unwieldy and fiddly. On a related note, unless you play the game many times and know the cards by sight, reading opponents' cards from across the table can become a chore, which is unfortunate, since much of the strategy and depth of the game require a good eye on what your opponents are up to.

I don't like the complication cards, as they just randomly hose people. Later on it's a small hit, but early on it can be extremely disadvantageous to get hit by one, particularly if you have a female head of household. 

There are a fair number of things you can do to improve your position, including playing marriages, claiming titles, doing charity, going on missions, having children, starting business ventures, and getting a mansion. I just don't find the options particularly compelling, and the overall game flow feels a little wonky. Plus the young image of the children of your line getting paired with the much older images of your friends is kind of creepy.

This is another in the long line of games that I would never have tried if not for my excellent game group, GSG.  I love the mechanics of growing a family, the constraints on actions so you feel like you never have enough to get everything done.  There is no shortage of laughs when you see some of the marriages, arranged or otherwise as well as watching the misfortune that sometimes befalls your friends.  It's so different from anything else that it deserves a place in almost any collection.  My only minor complaint is I would have liked to see more yellow cards so that the same ones were not in every game, but that's a small gripe amidst so much goodness.  A solid 8 with room to improve.

Played once with 3P. For starters, I really like the theme of the game and how it was implemented in the ever-growing family tree. Legacy is a worker placement game, but even then, the player interaction is less than usual due to the fact that half of the actions that can be taken are on each player's individual boards.

Overall, Legacy is surprisingly quite a light and serviceable Euro, with some luck involved in card draws.

RATING: 9
Incredibly fun, you can't actually abstain from making funny comments or add stories to the marriages or children you get.
The second middle of the game makes you a bit frustrated because of the so many things you want to do, but have no ways in doing them. I ended up with a huge amount of money and no way of spending it. Anyway, it got integrated in the family story, so it didn't matter in the end as the theme prevailed over mechanics.
You need a lot of table space for the trees though.
Definitely a keeper!

RATING: 6
This game has a really unique and interesting theme that is well integrated with the mechanisms of the game.  Building the family tree while trying to optimize the rewards and bonuses is an engaging puzzle.  However, the game is just too long (even with only 3 player) for me to really enjoy it and want to play it more.  I also felt that player interaction was fairly low and that the game became too repetitious by the time Generation III was half over (maybe less rounds would be better?).  I would recommend trying this game before buying it, if possible, just to make sure it's a good fit for you.  It's just a card game, but it's priced as if it were a board game with lots of bits.  The strategic elements are definitely there, so it's not necessarily fair to compare cost versus components.  On last thing to consider is that this game requires A LOT of table space.  It utilizes the mini Euro-sized cards to help with this, but it's still quite sprawling and the smaller cards reduces the font size thereby making them harder to ready, especially from across the table.

Love this game.  The art is fun, the stories you can come up with for your family are fun, the little missions and secret goals are enjoyable.  I consider this a gem that has been missed by too many.  Only minor issue is that it can take up a lot of space.

Régóta szerettem volna ez a játékot kipróbálni, mert a témája nagyon tetszett és hasonlított az egyik kedvenc, de csak kizárólag négy személlyel élvezhető In the Shadows of the Emperor játékra. Ebben a játékban célunk családunk tagjainak jó házasítása. Nagyon jól működik a családfa kialakítása, hogy lányainkhoz, fiainkhoz megfelelő párt találjunk ismerőseink köréből. A nők hozomány hoznak, a jó parti férfiakért viszont fizetnünk kell általában, bár ezek mértékét különböző tulajdonságaik felülírhatják. A kérők szerzése és a családfa szerintem nagyon jól működik, viszont a többi már kevésbé. Két akciónk van alapesetben, amelyből saját táblánk 4 különböző akcióját bármikor, bármennyiszer aktiválhatjuk, a középső közös táblán levő akcióhelyeket viszont egy körben csak egy valaki foglalhatja le. Ezzel csak annyi gond van, hogy van szerintünk kevésbé jó akció és vannak sokkal jobbak. Ezt még jobban rontja, hogy vannak színes akciókorongok is, amikből a három nagyon kör elején véletlenszerűen kap minden játékos egyet. Ugye világos, hogy nem mindegy, hogy valaki milyen erősségű külön akciókorongot kap a győzelem szempontjából. Nem tetszett, hogy vannak olyan beházasuló alakok, akik negatívan befolyásolják a játékostársakat, kár volt ezt a negatív interakciót berakni a játékba. Nem tetszett, hogy a logikus, a korban gyakran előforduló halálozások a születéseknél véletlenszerűen sújtják a játékosokat. Nem mindegy, hogy valakinek egy bónusz képességű gyereke születik, vagy a születésnél meghal az anya vagy a születendő baba. Ezt valahogy kompenzálni kellene. Szóval valahogy nem áll össze, mintha keveset tesztelték volna a játékot és mintha mindent a tematikának rendeltek volna alá, ami egy komoly euró játéknál nem tűnik jó ötletnek. Kár ezért a játékért, mert igazán jó is lehetett volna.

Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy would appear to be a stodgy, boring game about nobles in 18th century France. Despite it's cover, the game is actually quite excellent with a quirky charm and engaging game play. It's essentially like building a family tree and you'll have a hilarious time marrying your children and grand-children off to exotic foreigners while competing to be the "most noble of them all" by throwing parties and buying mansions. There can be some somber moments (the birth complications seem a bit out of place) and it does hog a lot of table space, but overall, it's a fantastic game that will leave you with some good stories to tell.

I love this game. It was my #1 until Scythe came along. I love the theme of building a noble family legacy and arranging marriages, but the best part is seeing your whole family tree and what you built over the course of three generations. So satisfying! Game doesn't get enough love in my opinion and I hope there's more support for it (more friends, please!) in the future.
My only con with it is balancing issues with certain friends, hence why I'd like to see more friends. The expansion is also underwhelming.

A worker placement game with some original mechanics and strong theme, yes please.  I was quite taken with this game after just one play.  The theme is that each of the players starts out as an 18th century French dignitary and is trying to create the most wealthy and well-respected family line.  You do this by marrying prominent figures, having children, arranging marriages for them with prominent figures, and so on for 4 generations.

All of this is done with worker placement and except for bonus disks that can only be used for certain actions most of the time players only get 2 actions per turn.  This makes the game very tight and there is a decent amount of competition for valuable spaces.  Each player also has hidden goals which is a mechanic I'm usually a huge fan of.

Fair warning, this game has some themes that may bother some people.  Aside from the idea of arranging marriages with your family which may bother some people there is the even more sensitive "complication at birth" cards.  When you have a child in this game you draw from a face-down deck and drawing one of the "complication at birth" cards will require you to have either the child or mother die.  This is both historically accurate and mechanically relevant.

I mention that it is mechanically relevant because the designer has suggested if you enjoy the game but this is too sensitive of subject matter for you, you can simply remove the cards from the game.  However, without these cards the game is diluted a bit.  One of the primary goals of the game is having children (in fact if in any generation you don't have at least one child you outright lose) so without the chance that you will draw these cards there is no tension in the choice to take the "have a child" action spaces or which choice to make with the card (having either the mother or child survive).  There are also several cards that mitigate this risk and those cards usefulness is negated as well by removing these cards.  I completely understand that this is sensitive subject matter for many people but if it does bother you I think the game is better off skipped entirely than playing a watered-down version of the game.

I've lost some of the enthusiasm I had for this game originally.  Everything I said above is still true and I still like to play the game but with the one caveat that I'm struggling a little bit with just two actions a round.  This does still create tension and competition for valuable action spaces but I find myself more and more just focusing on one particular strategy with no real room to spread out.  I am a lover of the more Feld-ian euros with lots of options and paths to victory whereas I am finding this game is more and more about just the biggest family and less about the missions and titles/contributions which are your other victory point avenues.  That's not a huge deal but it has lessened my excitement for once one of my favorite games.

Also a definite factor in my loss of enthusiasm is the two people I play games with most both don't really care for this game so without the opportunities to play it as often it's not something worth keeping any longer.

Legacy: The Testament of Duke the Crecy is a action selection euro game in which the theme plays a bigger role- and is way better integrated than in most other games of the same genre. 

In the game, players are building a family tree, starting with either a patriarch or a matriarch (giving some different starting bonuses), from which they expanding the family through 4 generations. Points are scored by meeting certain criteria, decided by different objective cards or simply by managing to get influential characters wedded into one's family.

"Legacy" is a medium light game, and much of the fun comes from imagining the story of how one's family is expanding and why different persons chooses to marry- and start families with one another. Mechanically, on the other hand, this game does nothing that a wide array of games hasn't already done before, in better ways. Furthermore, it is a game in which luck plays a huge role, meaning that it may be difficult to plan out and follow one particular strategy throughout the game.

Still, it is a fairly decent euro that is easy to teach, beautiful to look at, and that plays fairly quick.

[Portal Games 2013 edition] {French revolution; worker placement, card drafting, set collection; optimal 2p}  Legacy is a solid Euro game.  I forgot why I decided to buy it. Actually, I nearly forgot I own this game.

Compared to other Euro games, the theme of this game doesn't feel so paste on.  This is a plus and I quite enjoy playing this game.

The worker placement bit is fast-paced because there are only limited choices, with few turns.  The variance is the additional action token which needs slightly more thoughts.  The mission and patron cards are essential and are nice additions to the game to add strategic direction.

It is also easy to teach this game as most action are intuitive and there are not many fiddly exceptions or restrictions; all the variances are at the cards.  So, one can start the game in around 15 minutes, but it takes some time to read or explain all cards.

The illustration of the cards are little busy.  I am fine with the card size subject to limited table size.

In all, this game is quite enjoyable with 2-3 players. 4 players is long and boring.  Rate 7 for 1-3 players. Rate 6 for 4 players.

Prototype played at Spiel 2009.

What sounded interesting in advance (the theme and the idea of creating a family line) proved even more interesting in practise. Over time, you're aiming to increase your prestige through various techniques, the most intriguing being the hereditary line - having babies (generally random boys or girls) then marrying them off to a member of your social circle (represented by character-specific cards). Balancing the various currencies in the game, and investing in mansions and titles, all seem to hang together very well and to create plenty of opportunities and dilemmas.

Delighted to see it'll be released at Essen 2013. I'll certainly be picking up a copy. Not even the dramatic artwork change is going to stop me.

Did enjoy this though the amount of info on each card is a tad bit overwhelming and will take a few plays to get used to the cards. Lost the importance of the overall objective card as well the scoring each round on children and reputation. One of those games that really limit your options with only 2 actions each round with so much more that you could do though that certainly helps with the lack of downtime. A must buy.

Original worker placement game with a family tree building theme. Players attempt to develop their family tree through three generations by taking actions such as marrying, having children and increasing their income. The marriages in particular are key to success as the spouses brought into the family bring with them benefits such as victory points, an increase in income or extra actions that can be taken. Striking the right balance with the people married into the family with the benefits they bring is key to the game because their occupations and nationalities are often used for end of game scoring and these can sometimes be at odds with a particular immediate benefit you wish to bring. I particularly enjoy the theme of this game and the graphic design, which is very well done. I do however feel that it's let down by one mechanism whereby players receive a random action that they can perform each generation. This is arbitrary and clumsy and often effects the outcome of the game as some actions are far more useful than others, particularly late in the game. I'd have preferred the action to be used at the player's discretion and really that's all that keeps this game from becoming a classic in my opinion. I really do enjoy playing it though despite its (slight) misgivings.

Ej, de szeretem az ilyen játékokat! Pedig hosszú, ami egy könnyed, a szerencsével is erősen kokettáló játék esetében veszélyes. Mégis a kerettörténet, a beleélési faktor annyira erős, hogy elbírja a túlzott játékidőt és a talán kicsit kiszámítható játékstratégiát. Tehát, aki nem szokta átélni a játékok által teremtett álomvilágot, kerettörténetet, az le se üljön a játék mellé.
Remek szórakozás házasságokat elrendezni, nézegetni, melyik karakter mit tud, milyen tulajdonságai vannak, hogy lenne érdemes felépíteni a családfám. Aztán meg csinálni a dolgunk: házasodni, szülni, rangokat, címeket venni, barátokat gyűjteni és "felhasználni", stb... És azért ilyenkor jó döntési szituációk vannak, amik nem csak mókásak, hanem átgondolást is igényelnek, rövidebb, hosszabb tervezgetéseket.
Az interakció azért hiányzik a játékból, kizárólag a közös táblán lévő 5 hely mihamarabbi elfoglalásánál van némi küzdelem, de nagyjából előre kiszámolható, kilogikázható, hogy várhatóan mi marad nekem. Remélem a megjelent kiegészítő ezen fog dobni (csak ne nyújtsa meg nagyon a már így is hosszú játékidőt).
Nekem nagyon bejött ez a játék, remek, mókás darab, kellemes döntési mechanizmusokkal, eszement jó hangulattal.

OK, so you're building a family tree. But I don't see where that legacy comes in. We're not all building a different legacy for the same guy, are we? That didn't make sense for me.
This game has a nice combination of mechanisms that work together well. The worker placement bit, where you can get one-of dedicated workers to perform certain actions is pretty cool. The family tree building is a fun thing in and of itself. The way in which you can use friends to get resources, friends or money or use them to marry your offspring is also pretty cool. I enjoyed playing this! I was, however also a bit frustrated at times. For one of my bonuses, I needed something that meant I needed boys in the 4th generation to marry them to women, since only women seem to give you friends. To make sure I could maximize this bonus, I made 13 new children in the third act. Luck however made it so that I only got one boy - and 3 'complications'! That was quite annoying. It didn't kill the game for me though.
So if you're looking for a game that has a good amount of strategy and tactics with a good dose of luck, why not give this a try?

I'm compelled to play this game. It's just so much fun! If I would (and could) be completely objective I'm not sure I would be in love with the game play itself. It has some luck in both card drawing and which extra action disc you get, but who cares, it's so much fun planning your family tree. Don't get me wrong though, there's tons of stuff to think about, game play is not all luck.

I printed names for the children from the files section (made some modifications). Adds flavor that is right up my alley.

Frustrated with my computer as I had just typed quite a long comment into this box, when my mouse button decided to react veryyyyyyy sensitive and opened a subsite I didn't want opened, since I had not saved.

In short:

+ With each new clan member a story unfolds (so that's up to 4 stories unfolding of course)
+ Caricatural illustration style enhances table talk
+ creates a new genre: the Party Euro (almost as many laughs as Telestrations gives you but you have to stay focussed nevertheless)
+ Mechanics that work and are embedded nicely from a thematic point of view
+ great with the right crowd

- depends more on the right crowd(I am sure it suffers more from playing with the wrong crowd than other games
- Playing time estimate is a joke. 9 rounds, 4 players = 72   regular actions. Which is roughly 50 seconds per action. With special actions and inbetween scoring (after every generation) not included. I'm not a drive-by-gamer. It took us 2 1/2 hours, rules explanation not included. I guess there'll be quite a few play time estimate defenders who feel the urge to jump to the defense of the game. "Woah? 2 1/2 hours? What did you do? I can see no one playing the game for longer than 2 minutes... blablabla". Take comfort in knowing that The Flash is your father but please spare me.  
-----------------
Not sure I like the Patron cards, because they dictate a strategy right from the start. A stratgy you need to get the fitting cards for (an element which happens to be random and as such rather tactical) But for the time being the game was so much fun I can view beyond this weakness.

Another surprise hit. Previews made this look like a fairly average game with a unique theme, but the gameplay is really good. It's nothing new - you've got so many actions for the entire game, and you're trying to maximize your points with those actions. But the huge array of unique card abilities keep the game interesting.

On the downside, the venture action seems useless because it costs so much to use. One point and two cards are a big deal in this game, all for just a few dollars over the course of the game. The "complications at birth" cards also seem random and to not have much of an affect on the game, so I would probably remove those from the deck.

Those issues aside, this is a fun game with a unique family tree mechanic.

That said, the gameplay is not particularly deep -- which is a shame.

RATING: 6.5
Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy is a game about building your family legacy. Your goal in the game is to build out your family by marrying, having children and arranging marriages for your future generations. Each family has a secret agenda of goals of what they want to achieve for their family... like having artists in the last generation or somesuch.

The game is a worker placement game where you have two workers and occasionally special worker tokens that are limited in what they can do, and if you even get to place them. The main actions of the game are marrying (which will automatically produce children), having children, hitting friends up for money, or socializing to get more friends. There's also ways to get titles and accomplishments, build mansions and do stuff that gets you "honor". Honor will generate VP's throughout the game.

Every friend you marry into the family will give or require a dowry, depending on how advantageous the match will be. Additionally, they have special abilities or scoring potentials. A lot of the game is centered around picking the right marriages and making sure that all your families' special abilities interact well.

The game is tends to be pretty tight in terms of actions. You have a personal player board where you can't be blocked, and there's a public board where you can. Every round you get a special worker piece that's color coded to one of the public actions... but if someone else takes that action before you can use your colored piece, you might never get to use it. You can get some of those colored pieces through marriage powers, but again, it's tricky to place them at times.

There's a bit of luck in the game, as you can be screwed out of an extra action early in the game just by turn order. Additionally, there's another bit of randomness as you often will get a complicated birth, which means you're losing a family member, either the yet to be child or a mother. It can only happen to you once a round, but in our game it happened to me every round and to other players less often. On the other hand, there's always surprise twin births, which another player got three times. Given the tightness of actions and the importance of having children in the game, the random swings of birth luck can really sting here.

The game is fun, especially as you try to plan out your dynasty and see how the interactions between different family members will trigger special abilities and bonuses. I'm a little worried that the birthing randomness might be an issue but I'd like to give it a few more plays to see... it's something that could always be houseruled out if it is a problem.

I like games where you're building a tableau and getting cards to work with other cards, so this appeals on that level. It's not really a light game, but it's probably on the lighter side for that type of tableau building game.

7/10/15 - Dropped rating from a 7 to a 4. To be honest this game was enjoyable the first time I played it but it never hit the table again. It was great coming up with stories as you build your family tree but one thing that soured me completely on this game were some decisions made by the publisher. 

I can't believe that the card backs were changed between the first and second printing. Not only this, but the expansion has card backs that are different to both editions! Sure, maybe the additional information of knowing whether you're drawing a card from the base/expansion is marginal at best, but it's not a satisfactory solution to this mistake. It really is poor form.

Expansions:

a unique game about building your family tree, arranging weddings, having kids... don't let the theme stop you, its actually a good medium-weight action selection/resource management game with some funny characters & situations and a lot of interesting choices to be made.

[+] fast paced, unique theme, artwork/names/effects can be quite funny, tight resource management (actions/gold/friends/descendants)
[-] why the giant box? takes a lot of table space and can be quite messy (cards everywhere); whish there were "more" cards with more drastic changes (family heads/titles/contributions/missions/advisors...); the random extra action you get at the start of a generation is a strange mechanism, why?

gone in MathTrade Essen 14

UP: I have tried both Solo variants; with the standard rules, it's not bad, you have more control than multi player game but also more constraints (can only take actions associated with faec up friend cards), so your options can be VERY limited...
With the "reverse" genealogy rules, it's actually an interesting puzzle the first time BUT replayability is poor; once you know the 15 cards (9 of which come up in a game), you can prepare for them and the "Family tree" ends up looking the same every game... I tried satrting with random charcater+parents, it works, but the 15 cards are still the same...
my most valued feature in a solo game is replayability, so I can't recommend getting this one for the solo play.

No real interesting choices to make and takes up a huge amount of table space.  Awesome theme though

RATING: 7
Good example of Euro mechanics with a strongly implemented theme.  The action selection and points system are straight out of the Euro playbook, but there's a lot of theme in the massive deck of possible spouses, and the special traits that your descendants may have.  It's a nice combination, and the game mostly manages to pull it off.  It unfortunately suffers some balance issues, and it sometimes feels a little same-y, but it's quite fun for several plays.  There's an awful lot of charm in the box, from the letter that greets you upon opening the box to the wonderful portraits on the cards.

Oh, and don't bother with the solitaire version.  It's not especially fun, and doesn't hang together as well as the multiplayer game.

Another in a long list of mid-weight games that are neither interesting nor exciting; what's supposed to pull me in? Very little game here, and for a similar thematic experience I much prefer Familenbande, which has an infinitely more interesting victory condition and is much simpler and to the point.

Game is very good, but.... Imagine fresh euro design, good theme with medium light weight, card combos driven marriage fest MIXED with randomness and interaction on Catan level. Yes, I exaggerate a bit, but this game is a lost opportunity. Unless you like stealing cards and not doing things you wanted to do because lady luck said "Not now, man, try again later". I don't understand the hype. Sorry.

EDIT: After throwing out all the lucky cards, game is fine now. Anyhow, it's very light. I wish it was heavier... 5->6

EDIT2: after few more plays, there is much more randomness than it seemed to be. Sold. 6 -> 5

Interesting game, extremely fluid and well-paced, and highly thematic too. Moreover, it is fun to play, since the players are engaged in what the history of their families are shaping up to be.

Great game that at first reminded a bit of Race for the Galaxy, seeing the combinations of cards that you need to acquire to score victory points. But, here is also a simple, yet effective worker-placement system driving the turns. The theme however makes Legacy far more intuitive than the esoteric iconography of RftG. 
Also, the idea of raising an aristocratic family over several generations is a simple concept but im finding it exceedingly entertaining! It just fits.

The idea of building a family tree full of nobility had me seeing visions of Crusader Kings II style politics and deceits, noble houses trying to seize power through marriage and maintain it with heirs to your throne and others. Alas, what this actually turned out to be was more of a tableau building set collection game. The family tree is sort of a gimmick, a way to organize your path to the victory points based on goals handed out throughout the game, such as score two points for every Frenchman you marry into your house.

It's cute and well executed, but ultimately fell a little flat for me. Maybe if it was developed as a straight card game that played a little faster it might have scratched an itch, but as full sized board game with an exciting write-up on the back, it simply didn't provide the experience it promised.

Or it might just be that games like Race for the Galaxy and Deus have set the bar far too high for these style games.

Michiel designed the game, Ignacy created the hype and I bought it! But after a couple of plays no regret what so ever!!! Original setting, great artwork (as always at Portal), nice gameplay, perfect duration and very accesible. Another reason why I love Portal Games!!!

Fun art, theme, and overall character.  Unfortunately, the seemingly interesting ideas become lackluster after about 2/3rds of the game. By 2/3rds of the way in, the game as overstayed its welcome.

At the peak of French Aristocracy, there are signs that our lives of privilege could be threatened. To protect our position in society, it is obvious that we need to have more children, amass titles and mansions, and arrange betrothals to the most successful and influential families.  After watching the White Queen series, my wife and I thoroughly enjoy playing this game and love the humor. This game is more thinky than I expected, mostly from optimizing the benefits of marrying the friends.

UPDATE: After a few plays. It is disappointing that they use token and cube colors that are so similar. Beige and white, blue and the light blue also disk matches the color of the light blue player board actions. Seems like an obvious production mistake.

I tried it at Essen 2013 and I liked it alot and I even bought it before I tried it. Which afterwards felt very good :)

I think it has loads of potentials. 

The main thing that could be improved I think in a potential expansion is to have more interaction between the players perhaps being able to infiltrate the other players family tree etc.

This game presents an intriguing puzzle - you grab character cards and try to fit them into your family tree. Overal, the game feels a bit weird though: it is a serious worker placement, with combo cards, with cartoony art, with cards that kill your children. Or your wife. 
Bizar, but intriguing.

Great great game

At first you don't see that this could be good, but after a few turns this grows and is so much fun.

Every game is a story in itself, with great gameplay and lot's of table talk.

Also the solo game is a lot of fun, it's a puzzle game

Game designer Michiel Hendriks taught us the game at SPIEL '13, he did a good job of illustrating how tightly the themed is weaved into the game. We enjoyed it, and I'm a fan of the artwork, and graphic design. My criticism is the high amount of text on each Friend card, which slows the game down until everyone is comfortable with the game. That said, this is an alright worker placement game with a few twists, but it hasn't left me wanting to play it again.

RATING: 5
Rating on this game keeps dropping as I don't like the mechanics as much as I like the theme.

The worker placement in the game is barely competitive and seems like it could have been streamlined out.

The hand management and card combinations that are the bulk of the game play is not varied enough and the limitations of your generation size makes the combos feel under powered.

However, we still have a good time playing this and making up stories about our families.

Gran descubrimiento que no entiendo como no esta publicado en España. Adoptamos el papel de un noble frances en el siglo 18 y tenemos que gestionar nuestra familia durante 3 generaciones para llevarla al maximo prestigio.
Elegante, de mecanicas bien coordinadas, divertido de jugar. Es un juego que siempre te deja con ganas de volver a jugarle

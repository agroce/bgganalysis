AVOID.  One play on Spain/Portugal map that used to be available online.  I didn't have a good copy of the rules and we aborted the game in mid-play; my impression is that gameplay hinges too heavily on luck which corresponds to the modern review highlights below.

The June 2015 Opinionated Gamers review is an excellent modern look/viewpoint on this game.  The verdicts from this review (and others) are that it was good in its day (1970s/1980s) but feels very old school nowadays.  
There is a disconnect between the slow and strategic planning and building aspects of the game, and the luck heavy dice driven races.  Playing with lots of players (up to 6) can give many options for partnering for the races, but just adds to the slow pace.  The game is just way too long.  Stefan Dorra’s Linie 1/Streetcar from the mid-nineties is a much better implementation of the concept/ideas, but even that game hasn't aged that well.

RATING: N/A
Very interesting mechanics.  The first part is building your rails, and the second part is racing (optional) & expanding your rails (if you come in 1st/2nd in the race).  If you participate in a race, you're allowed to use other players' rail system if you think it's worth it (since you have to pay them royalty).

A bit too much on the luck driven side.  But I like it a lot more than Ticket to Ride.

The basic track laying idea, for the game's age, is quite ok, despite a strong starting player advantage even with the same-die variant. Also, the train race idea is exciting, but takes way too long for the amount of luck involved and has a runaway leader problem. There is a good game in there waiting to be redeveloped, but as is, it shows its age.

RATING: 7
There is just something magical about railroad games for me. I love building things. This game really focuses on route building and if you use a 2,3,3,4,4,5 die it cuts back on some of the luck. But I've never felt a need to do this I love the racing part of the game.

This is one of the first games, that showed me that there is a world of board games beyond monopoly. The essential Creon-Railway-Game - you just build your tracks and then race with others between two cities to see, who has the fastest track. Very nice - and one of my oldest games in ragged boxes, that I still bring on the table regularly.

There are games that you come across which have a storied past but once you try them you realize they just aren't in your wheelhouse. Such was the case for me and Damfross.

This is not to say I didn't appreciate what it had to offer. You've got an interesting element of crayon rails (my first time with that genre), and balancing your bank account to maximize your points for the win.

But what really didn't work for me was the racing part of the game - it felt superfluous and often a foregone conclusion once you saw what the two cities were. Looking ahead at how many races were to be run, I grew weary of the game quickly and was ready for something snappier.

There's something not quite right about this game -- The race concept is really cool in theory. You think there will be intertwined track with people teaming up to see who can put together a better route. But what actually happens (at least in our games) is that each player specializes in a certain sector of the board, so the choice of who races and what path to take are almost always a no-brainer. It costs too much to cross other people's tracks, and most maps have too many mountains to make trying to expand your network into new areas cost-effective.

Yet we still play it occasionally and have some mindless fun.

If the game wasn't quite as long as it is it would actually be a pleasant dice roller. As it stands it just takes too long for the amount of luck from the dice rolls. You could just shorten it by playing to a lower amount of money or fewer deliveries but in that case the luck simply shifts to who connected the destinations that come up.

Which, to sum it up, means you have too much luck in the building phase (fixed by using the a single roll for all players), too much luck in the connection runs, both, or too long a game. With a little development, I'm sure something could be made of it, though.

I like the track-building phase, but the racing phase is a bit too long and more than a little odd.  Get the Laurin edition for the gorgeous maps.  Many players, myself included, use "averaging dice" (2,3,3,4,4,5) for the train movement.  Pretty solid for such an old game (originated in the 1970s as Railway Rivals).

Impression after one played game: Wow. Never thought i would like a game that works on the "rolling high numbers on a dice" principle (i do not like "Auf Achse" at all.) This game seems to have a lot of potential for strategy - especially in the first phase. A good railway system should be able to beat lucky dice-rollers most of the time.

Critics:
 - potential Leader runaway problem (best railway system   most income by winning races)
 - big luck can beat superior strategy (I won but i did not have the "best" system)

Forget the critics! It still was a blast to play. Might also be good as a gateway game (a rather long one, that is)

Played once and we didn't really get the intitial route rules into our brains. It would have helped tremendously if we'd understood what we were doing since it was so expensive to make new routes once the racing started. Would love to play again an I suspect my rating would go way up, especially in the route making phase, which could be really tense.

This game with its basic rules has far too much luck for its length. Still, I enjoy drawing railroads on the map enough to play it again. The team building option in the operation round also is a neat feature. But it needs some tweaks to reduce luck. In the track building phase every player either should get the same amount of building points or weighted dice (2,3,3,4,4,5) should be used. In the operation phase the variant rule that every city is only once either start or destination is a must.

First impression (4 players) : I had to test this because it's a SdJ-winner. It has similarities with Linie 1 as in both you build up tracks and later race using them. Here building tracks is more liberal as you simply draw onto the map according to available build points you have. Later you race between cities and there it helps to have straight connections and between as many cities as possible. Other players gain money if you have to use their track in the race. 

I'm not sure what there is wrong with these "build track then race" games as I usually like building games and racing games but have disliked both of these combination of these mechanics (Linie 1 and Dampfross). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Entertaining family game where players build their railway networks drawing them on the board and race on them for prices, which can be either saved or used for extending the network. 

The game is very luck dependant, but being very long too (almost too much so, in fact) bad throws can't happen in every single move, and the the best planned net normally wins. Nevertheless, the game has a very clear fault: extending the network using price points leads to a rather serious runaway problem if the amount of usable points isn't restricted, in which case the problem is still there but not as dire.

Dampfross might not have aged in the most graceful of the ways, but taking care of this issue it still works well.

On the first glace, this game seems too random for a planning game, but it is not. Easy rules and a lot of player interaction, yet "Dampfross" is a (light) brainer. All in all, it's a pretty good game - but there certainly are a couple of similar, however better railway games, e.g. Steam. The race of the netwok owners is a neat idea, yet the roll-and-move mechanism as the climax of a planning game is quite odd.

TWEAKS: The game needs to speed up. Use 2d6 instead of just 1 for constuction point determination.

A game that is very easy to understand, but I have fun playing again and again. There is a lot of dice-rolling, but except for the very beginning, where high rolls can unbalance things a bit, I have found that it evens itself out very nicely over the course of the game. The building of the tracks is interesting because you have to weigh the cheapest route against the shortest route, and what citys you need to connect, and which can be overlooked. The racing part is interesting, because it lets you build from what you did before. Players who only go the cheapest route will normally lose more races and therefore the game.

This game combines a crayon rail with a roll-and-move racing game, and doesn't do either particularly well.  Players are forced to start in certain places: bad news for later players, who find all the good routes out taken by the time their turns come around.  Terrain penalties are too harsh.  As for the racing part, well, what can I say?  It's roll-and-move where some players are forced to sit out and watch; sometimes an entire race is trivial because only one player participates.  As the late game approaches, choosing cities with dice becomes cumbersome, as you have to keep re-rolling until you get one that wasn't already taken.

Found the build phase too constrained, which causes the networks to have minimal overlap. The cost of adding to the network during the race phase to the potential payout is prohibitive. 
The race phase mechanics tedious at best as the game progresses trying to work out a viable "race" takes many many die rolls.

When I played it, it was a decent railroad game, but Age of Steam or even Railroad Tycoon scratches the same sort of itch, only better.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

An interesting diversion from the Mayfair Crayon Rails games.  This never seems to be as satisfying as the crayon rails games, with the large random element in racing.  But it&#039;s quicker and tends not to stall out as much.

The game of railbuilding and racing.  The racing element is bit random and long, recommend a couple fixes:
-  Roll multiple colored dice and treat the red die as the first rolled, white and second, blue is third, etc.  Ignore any dice that aren't need to complete the route.  This cuts race time in half.
-  Use averaging dice (2,3,3,4,4,5 OR treat 1 as a 3 and 6 as a 4.)  This greatly reduces the luck element without eliminating it.

A crayon rail game that is not a Winsome game.  It is an economic/racing game.  Everyone builds track then races.  The game is based on the economics of building track and paying other players to use their track.  Very interesting and fun.

Strategy = Although connecting to cities gets you money during the building phase, it is not always the best choice.  Try to build track to general areas.  Try to build track that goes to each numbered city area.  Then connect to the other players track and use their track to go to the cities.  The exception to this is with cities that have multiple numbers.  Always try to connect to those directly.

I have really mixed feelings regarding this game.  I am an avid train-gamer and particularly enjoy the Mayfair Empire Builder games.  That said, I really enjoyed the first phase of this game where players are working to build and expand their routes.  This was relatively quick and interesting.  Then the second phase of the game hits.  Talk about a let-down.  It took a really long time to play out and there were often many who could not reasonably participate.  Sure it was interesting enough, but boy was it long.  And to be honest, at that point it was all roll and move, so it was based solely on the luck of the dice.  I would very much like to play some of the other maps (we played Eastern US) but I find that unlikely to happen unless I can come up with a more satisfying method to handle the end-game races.

Drawing lines on the board is fun. So is the building and connecting thing. The race part I like less and actually would recommend to keep that part shorter by capping overall points goal.

I'm giving this a hopeful five.  I felt that there was stuff here that I could really enjoy, but I'm going to have to rejigger the whole thing to get it.

The track building phase of the game is quick and fun, but the second half of the game is so random that it ruins whatever semblance of a game that there is.  

Stretch out a nice network and hope that it will randomly connect to whatever races are rolled up.

I think that there is a fun game here, but out of the box it is a big let down.  I would be interested in making pairs of chits from 1-12 scrambling them on the board and putting them in each city so that you know which cities are going to need deliveries at the beginning of the game.

This should fix my issues with it, otherwise, to the trade pile.

I Remembered this as a really fun game from a long time ago, until I recently revisited it.  Don't think it is that fun anymore. Mechanics are kind of clunky?

I found this more enjoyable than the pick-up-and-deliver train games.  I enjoy the drawing of the track more than the picking and delivering.  

The race element and teaming up was interesting. 

Use some other system than the dice to determine the races (dominos, cards, etc.) so that you don't have to keep rerolling..

Not my cup of tea, especially since I had to endure two hours of dice rolling during the races when I was so far out of the running that it didn't matter.  You need at least four or five to make the races meaningful, but that translates into a two-three hour game whose resolution isn't interesting for all involved, which is a major problem.  There are other smaller issues with the luck of where the first races are held and the dice rolls during the bulding phase.  Interesting concept, but takes far too long for a game with these flaws.

Interesting and fun game, there is a bit of luck, but over time it is mitigated. A bit long for what it does, but it is a good family game. Despite the fairly simplistic game, it might be a bit much for non-gamers. Not quite sure who this appeals to. I'm surprised it won the Spiel - it is REALLY long for Spiel winner.

My first German board game (both played and owned).  I almost always play the Germany board with the international routes.  The luck in the roll seems to be more in city selection than in the race itself.  Early wins allow players to extend their network, making the rich get richer.  Despite quite a few plays (before I began logging games), I still find it an interesting exercise.  As far as the components go, dry erase markers work so much more nicely than the colored pencils.

My second play, we played the Ireland map with three players.  Since the rules were being interpreted by someone who spoke German, we couldn't verify that we were playing correctly, as it seemed that we just didn't have enough track laid to even bother racing, so someone would win by default.

This old jewel of a game was actually once "Spiel des Jahres", with good reason. This is an awesome game! The fun comes from it being split two-ways: First you plan and build, then you let the trains roll and beat the other railroads. It's really entertaining.

Surpringingly fun game for such a simple idea: Players take turns to draw lines between cities on a hex map, and when all cities are connected, decide at random start city and goal city and then have a race. If you have to use another player's tracks to reach the goal, you have to pay him victory points. First to a set number of points wins.
Simple yet really interesting.

One of the easiest train games. First you build your tracks then you chose to participate in a race on a random track. The player with the best "overall" track placement has better chances in the race but still: bad luck can throw you out of the game.

found this on my parents attic. It looks kind of bland, but then again, it was SdJ, and I will definetly try it someday. Need to buy some new markers first.

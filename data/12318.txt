Word game equivalent to 6 nimmt!.  Plays great with 2-4(haven't tried more), very portable, accessible (newbies are familiar with word games), has some card-draw luck, but also has some real strategy.  If you like word games, this is a must-have.  If you like 6 nimmt!, you'll like this (unless you hate word games).  Great overall purchase (cheap), but oddly this is nearly impossible to find.

Interesting word game. Now own the American version. Of course the box is bigger than the European version but it comes with a thirty-second timer. The American version also leaves out the rules about reversing the turn order in the second round.

6 Nimmt with words.  I have to appreciate the mechanic, but word games aren't for me, and I felt that the pressure of having to come up with a word while everyone else at the table is staring at you with a smirk on their face because they see a word for your letter that's so obvious why can't you see it what are you stupid or someting... is a bit much for me.

A very nice addition to the "card-based word games" family.  Think Boggle (...kinda...) mixed with 6 Nimmt.

i loved the idea.  category 5/6 nimmt with words, etc.  the lack of rearrangement walls people in pretty quickly.  even though that can perhaps be remedied with a variant, i don't really feel like there's enough fun in the game to warrant the effort.  i love the tiny, plastic container and even the size/shape of the cards but the stock is uncoated and very flimsy.

Only one play, but disastrous! I'm fairly good at word games (expect a couple of 7 letter words per game in Scrabble) but couldn't get this at all.  Those laying later in the round are completely at the mercy of those going earlier.  (We played with 5.) So a bad set of cards (I had J, Z etc) at the start is practically unrecoverable. I partly blame the cards being upside-down! Probably much better with fewer players.

A lot of the same ideas as 6 Nimmt!, but much more of an actual game underneath the simple blind card selection surface because of the importance that order can have on your ability to use letters. Simple concept, and fast playing with enough here to be decent once in a while.

The strange order of resolution should probably be fixed though, people stuck with crap letters like Z end up doubly screwed because the game adheres to alphabetical order for order of resolution. Common letters should definitely play later in the order.

This started out as a pretty popular filler with my gaming buddies and me, and has cooled off some.  But do make sure you read what happens if you can't make a word.

RATING: 4
(2-6 players) Word game version of 6 Nimmt but not as good.  Not sure how much real control you have in this one since player order is determined alphabetically.  I play my B to get to go first before a T?  Doesn't make much sense.  Would make more sense if the player order was based on the statistical occurrence of the particular letter, e.g. someone picking Z should get precedence over someone picking E since E is more prevalent in words.  So it's fairly random and there's not much point in planning what you'll play in the current round, just pick a card and hope for the best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A surprisngly clever variant on crossword games, harder than you'd think. Probably better with more players, but good fun and a real test of your vocabulary. The card stock is a little thin. If you like 6 Nimmt, you should like this.

Um jogo de montar palavras. Coloca-se 4 letras formando 1 coluna com 4 linha. Cada rodada os jogadores colocam 1 cartas (letra) fechada na mesa e viram simultaneamente, então por ordem alfabética cada jogador encaixa sua letra em umas das linhas e diz que palavra aquelas letras fazem parte. O detalhe do jogo é a ampulheta de 30 segundos que mede o tempo que cada jogador tem para usar sua cartas. Caso não consiga ele ganha algumas cartas. Quem terminar sem cartas vence. Divertido.

Fun word game, remniscent of 6 Nimmt.  We immediately played with variants.  1. letter go in order of frequency rather than alphabet which can give clumps of vowels/consonants but seemd fairer for those wit hthe harder letters.  2.  Words don't have to start with the letters, just have to be able to be made using them.  Excellent filler.

RATING: 7
First off, the cards have a great look to them.  I do wish it had the letters facing in different directions so that some players don't have to look at the game upside down.  That is my only complaint, as this is a great word game.  Interesting bidding and hand management.  I can see the comparisons to 6 Nimmt, but there is more to this.  You really have to come up with words on the fly and that can be tough.  Great game.

RATING: 5
A synthesis of the folk game Ghost and 6 nimmt.  Works well enough, but I'd rather play either 6 nimmt or a different word game such as Pick Two, Parlay, BuyWord, etc.  I get the feeling that Typo needs one more element, idea, or rule to make it thoroughly enjoyable.  Perhaps it's the order of play that's the problem.  What if the play were ordered by letter frequency instead of the rather arbitrary "alphabetical" order?  Tougher letters like X,Q,Z would play first, and the easier letters would be made tougher by being at the end of the sequence.  Vowels would possibly need to be sprinkled throughout the sequence to avoid clustering them all at the end.

I've played this once, and found it interesting, but it's hard to rate.  It's an interesting twist on the word game, but it seems like being able to guess what letters the other players are going to play is actually a lot more important than building words, which I find strange.  I've never played with a dictionary nearby, which would probably help.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Just another word game in a sea of word games. Typo combines a traditional card game goal of "empty your hand" with vocabulary playing a role as you play your letter cards onto the table. The cards themselves have numbers (point values?) listed on them, but they are not mentioned anywhere in the rules.  You win by simply emptying your hand. This is confusing at best and probably a mistake in either production or rules writing.

The game play consists of a single strategy: hold the easy cards (S's, vowels, etc.) as long as possible. Ultimately, there are three possibilities:  1. You have a card you can play, and play it. 2. You don't have a card you can play and so you got unlucky. 3. You have a card you can play, but you don't realize it and are punished for your lack of vocabulary. More than perhaps any other word game, Typo distills everything I dislike about word games in to one ugly package. There's not even any "well, I only saw a word worth fewer points" here. You simply get unlucky, fail at trivia (word knowledge), or win. This game is just not for me at all.

Not a bad little word game, cards are of bad quality and too tall for normal sleeves which is a real double whammy. 

Feels a little too restrictive, if you could add on to words at the front WITHOUT that having to be the front letter it might give a little more wiggle room. As is good language skills and a good memory for words are required to play well. 

Definitely looks and feels like the 'word' version of 6 nimmit.

I had a bad experience when I played this game.  The people I played with rejected a valid word because none of them knew it and I couldn't convince them it was a real word.

6 nimmt with words. If a word can't be formed starting with the letters in your tableau, you have to take the longest row. Nice alternative to anagram games. Most unique feature is order of play set by "blind bidding": closest letter to "A" places his new letter first, second-closest second, etc. Best with 4, "ok" with 2.

An easy to learn card game that combines 2 classics, Scrabble and 6 Nimmt!.  What's not to like?  The rough type-set appearance in the cards is a nice added touch.  My younger son prefers adding an 'UpWords' twist/variant of substituting letters by stacking.

Letters are selected to play from your hand and placed face down. Then all players simultaneously reveal them. They can be added at the beginning or end, but must form the start of a word.

RATING: 6
Interesting game, but pretty hard. There is strategy involved in choosing which order to play your cards in. Luck of the draw is definitely a big factor. I am concerned that game length could be an issue if the players are fairly balanced. This is because players are penalized by taking on new cards, but can only end the game by getting rid of cards in hand.

They can't possibly have playtested this. Our experience was that as the end of the game approaches, everyone is left with all the letters they can never play, so they just end up swapping them for some other letters they can never play, while all of the vowels slowly drain out of the set of cards in play. It starts out nicely enough, but the end drags. By the time we reached the last few cards, we were helping each other play just so we could end the damned game already.

I can envision a set of six cards that would make a two-player game of this unwinnable and infinite. I don't know offhand which cards those are, but basically, any six cards that never appear paired in any legal English words. Q/X/J/Z/K/V would probably do it. Put any four of those cards on the table. Give the other two to the two players. Commence play.

RATING: 6
Typo is a word-building card game that is very similar to 6 Nimmt!  There are a number of incomplete words in the center of the board, and each player simultaneously chooses a letter card from their hand to add to one of the words to continue it.  If you can't continue a legal word with your letter play, you take the largest word and replace it with your letter.  Cards are resolved in alphabetical order, which encourages players to use their late-alphabet cards right away, so games often devolve into trying to spell words that start with obscure letters.

Initial impression: The 6 Nimmt style play differs here as you consider not only possible vowels and consonants that may be played but also the order they will be played and what word fragments may be made. Your letter placements are more freeform as well. Your choices are limited by the letters held, but tapping your vocabulary may get you off the hook. There is alittle player targeting as in 6 Nimmt, at least the penalities aren't as severe in TYPO, but does subtract some of the fun. Rating may rise with less than 6 players.

RATING: 5.4
12/23/06: $9.98, pre-tax.  Played 2-player.  Ran a bit long for what it is.  Not sure there's all that much you can do in a 2-player game, so I'll reserve final judgment until I play with more players.  I like the idea, but the restrictive nature of word building (must begin with beginning letter, rather than simply have the substring of letters in the sequence on the table) makes for too many situations where there is no way to play any card in your hand effectively.  4/8/08: played with six players.  Have to have people who enjoy word games, but there is still a good bit of luck and much bluffing about words (like in Scrabble).  But since the challenger suffers no penalty, words are more often contested.  Also, there are cases where you allow an invalid word to keep another player from going out and winning.  Some problems, but still not horrible.

As far as word games go, this one can be fun. However, I dislike it at times because (at least with 2 players) the entire deck is not used, so sometimes the set of letters in play (eg: all vowels or all consonants, or just plain bad letters) can lead to a slow and painful game end.

Described to me as "6 Nimmt! with letters." Only being able to use the letters as the beginning of a word is kind of a downer - if you could use it as an ending as well that would be pretty neat.

Fun light word game. I feel like rows close off very fast, though, which can make it a little too tight. Maybe a different distribution of cards would've helped that, or maybe my vocabulary just isn't adequate.

RATING: 6
A word game for those who might be afraid of word games.  As the game board (cards) change with some fluidity and one needs only form the start of a word, the game is a bit easier to approach than other word games.  But still some thought required to think of appropriate words - so might not be the wrap-up game of a session.

Light filler.  I always describe this one as a cross between 6 Nimmt & Scrabble - the blind playing of cards ala 6 Nimmt combined with a word game.  Fun for what it is, but definately weighted in favor of those with large vocabularies.

Good portable Scrabble alternative. There's less emphasis on a player's vocabulary than in Scrabble and more on their ability to predict/guess the order of play and when a row will be replaced. Card management is the trick.

A word based 6 Nimmt! Players are trying to be the first to rid their hand of alphabet cards. Each turn, player choose a card and turn over simultaneously. Player place the cards along exposed row of alphabets to form words. Failure to do so will result in taking half the longest row of cards to their hand. The game has a little bit of second guessing and plays fast enough as a decent filler.

The University games edition adds a much needed timer as the game can bog down with people trying all permutations of a letter. The game does get static and dull after awhile. Some variants are needed to open up the game and let it breathe.

It's pretty good for a word game.  The person who knows how to spell should be the winner, but this isn't always the case.  The card game has a bit of tactics in choosing which card to play at what time, since the cards are played in alphabetical order.  It could be a good family game, and it appears to be faster than Scrabble.

Hunh.  Well, this is like a cute wordgame version of 6 Nimmt!  Sometimes there is just nothing you can do, but that is when you try to play later in the turn hoping that people will eat a big pile for you. Strangely, this is something of a brain burner for me.

It seems like it would be way too chaotic for more than three players.

[Cwali 2004 edition] {word; word identification, simultaneous action; optimal 3-4p} Typo is a word game with double-guessing. It is a good game to improve vocabulary of a player. I sometimes will allow players to build words with either prefix or suffix so that we can learn more words and make the game a little bit easier. 

However, I think Typo is only suitable for word-game lovers or school teaching. Players, who are not very up to word games, may find it boring and repetitive. Player interaction comes from the mild competition of word space in the 4 rows with the simultaneous act (could I say Typo a word-variable of 6 Nimmt!?) 

I don't like the card size of Typo. I can't find suitable card sleeves and the extra space carries no additional information, which is just a waste.

My rating is based on the original Cwali edition, not the new mass-market University Games version with a different letter distribution.  Typo combines the word-building fun of Scrabble with bidding.  Easy to bring along so you can strike up a game pretty quick.  Can play solitaire variant up to 6 people, so this is a flexible & fun game.  Not a brain-burner like Scrabble can be with some people.  People who don't normally like word games like this one because of the bidding, interaction, and they can pick up a lot of word suggestions just by listening to what everyone else plays.  I like this better than :s::c::r::a::b::b::l::e: which used to be my favorite word game.  I rate this highly for it's playability, scales well from 2 to 6 players, easy to travel with, and has an enjoyable solitaire variant.  Nice to see this was recognized by SdJ in 2005!

My favorite two-player word game. It takes on a new dimension when the rule is changed a little with two players. Instead of simultaneously selecting a card to play, allow each player to take turn to select a card. The amount of strategy required to delay using a letter, and countering each other's move to throw the opponent's intended word off-track makes it a very exciting and satisfying game. A great card game that is extremely portable.

I like it - played it with my kids, 10 and 7 and they had fun working with words and spelling.

With a 7 year old, it can be a little like Carcassone, where they choose a letter and you work together to place it.

A cross between 6 Nimmt and Palabra which are two of my favorite card games. Each player simultaneous shows a letter from their hand. They have to play that letter to one of the 4 rows on the table. Either the front or the back.They then have to make a word starting with those letters. Play goes in alphabetically order. Ties are resolved by who has the timer. The timer is 30 seconds and is always a welcome addition in this type of game.

RATING: 5
It's 6 Nimmt! with a vocabulary lesson!  I like the way this one works out.  You can plan words based on what you have in your hand, but it's a good idea to announce a different word from the one you're planning for as long as possible, so you don't give your opponents any ideas.  The dictionary rule (he who has the dictionary is the start player) is a bit weird, though.  When we have ties, we draw from the deck, and whoever's closest to the appropriate letter (A or Z, depending on the round) goes first.  It's a much better game with 2 than it is with more, since the chaos that makes 6 Nimmt! such a fun game is just a detriment to a word game.

Played a few times (in French). This word game is based on an interesting idea, but in my experience very few letters have ever been added before the words, which rather ruins the idea. Also, the scoring may be a bit unfair (though it does not matter that much in such a game). As for the letter repartition, I am not quite convinced it works well for every language - but it is not too bad, at least in French.

I'm not a Scrabble person.  I'm terrible at it and have no desire to ever play the game again.  But Typo was surprisingly fun despite how similar the two games are and how bad I am at this sort of thing.  I shouldn't say fun, because I don't actually like games like this, but it was good, and I could see why this game would be the perfect travel game for some.  This is a really good game if you're just looking for something different to round out the games you own.  Highly recommended.

A good twist on the usual word game that plays fairly quickly and can handle a wide number of players (though it's probably at its best with few). The quality of the cards is not very good, however.

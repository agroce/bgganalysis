This game is the archtype of the sort I love (cool board/pieces, diplomacy, asymetrical situations, variable advances).  The much maligned rules really aren't that bad as long as everyone is clear on them up front and realizes you have to account for certain unique game mechanics in your strategy.  Where it gets messy is when you invlove non-plyer major nations.  The combat system leaves room for a smaller force to pull off an upset without being too random.

RATING: 6
I find the rules to be awkward and unpolished.    Interesting in that it blends tactical- and operational-level strategy, but in doing so, appears to treat both too casually for my tastes.  Such an approach sacrifices a great deal with respect to the themes and rules under which both stages of gameplay operate, and leaves the player with somewhat of a mixed (if not disappointing) experience. Fun at first, but ultimately bogs down under its own weight.

Just by looking at it, you must fall in love with it. Great edition of eagle games. The resulotion of the battles is not perfect but thrilling. Russia is also a bit to easy to play and you need a poor sucker for turkey. England is also untouchable. Europe is Hell.

Play the rules as you see them. Dont expect any kind of answers on the offical rules from the website. The contradictions and ambiguities abound! A new rule edition is due late 03&#039;. That said, there are some great game concepts,that need some offical word to manage properly. Rating could improve dramatically with more playtesting.

This game is fairly brilliant.  Lots of player interaction while playing multi-player.  Political actions and the tension of going to war can be hectic.  Battle mechanisms are fun.  Acutally had other players gather around the battleboard awaiting the outcome of some big battles.  Great fun!  Be prepared to set up and leave it up someplace, cause you won't finish it in an evening.  TONS of great bits, beautiful map.  Worth the price!

Para mí es un juego "especial", porque le tengo mucho cariño. Durante el 2007 (creo que fue en ese año) hicimos una liga que duró prácticamente todo el año y los habituales eramos Lipe, PGB, Anuca, Sergio, Trull, Pedro y yo. 

El juego gana cuando se elimina el factor Sergio, que ralentiza demasiado. Es un wargame Napoleónico, con diplomacia, complemente desiquilibrado, y donde está representada toda europa con las potencias España, Inglaterra, Francia, Prusia, Austria, Turquía y Rusia. Como digo, está intencionadamente desiquilibrado, lo que obliga a los jugadores a tener que llegar a pactos para sobrevivir. Las batallas son bastante vistosas, por la cantidad de figurillas. Utilizan una plantilla con flancos y zona central. 

Por motivos personales significa mucho para mí, pero independientemente de eso, creo que es un buen juego. Eso sí, formato extra-grande. Tipo eagle games.

Admite hasta 7 jugadores y es recomendable para esa cifra, aunque a partir de cinco se puede jugar bien. Eso sí, es largo (aunque no demasiado para ser un wargame). Tipicamente, se suele pactar la hora de finalización, y en ese momento, se evaluan las condiciones de victoria de cada potencia.

Why, oh why, did we keep getting sucked in by the pretty oversized Eagle Game boxes....

It's like finding a colorfully-dyed Easter egg from LAST year: looks great on the outside - but you're curious so you break it open to see what it's like - maybe this one won't be rotten like the last - and instantly regret doing so.

I just keep coming back to this, and liking it better, despite its limitations.  Kinda wish it used counters instead of minis; actually all the components need to be redone from scratch. Of course, we only use the rules I developed (and continue developing).  What would you like to know about this game?

I really love the production quality and ideas behind this game, but unfortunately must concur with the sentiment that it didn't receive proper playtesting.  That being said, I've found a lot of wargames do require some level of interpretation... it seems intrinsic to the genre.  I also think that the historical scenarios are probably better played with just two people.  Interested to play with "Charge The Guns" annotated and clarified rules.

RATING: 6
I once played this game all the time.  NiE combines successfully fierce battles with thoughtful grand stratagy.  Do not be haunty when approching this: if you have more than 4 players and less than 4-6 hours then play the Basic Rules Set.  It will be more fun for everyone.  It may not be as elegant as many of the euro/wargames that I have, but the theme compensates.
update: I'm working on a new set of rules that modify the existing fast play rules.  Things are looking good and this game may be moving up)

Asked for this for my birthday one year.  We only managed to do 3 playthroughs and finished none of them.  Game is complex, but epic as can be.  I love fighting out battles on the little miniboard, and I like the strict system for player interaction.  Board and pieces are outstandingly cool.  Overall, I would love to play this game more often if it was possible to finish a game or get people interested in it.

RATING: 5.5
This game certainly looks the part but ultimately fails to deliver.  There are a number of unique game devices in the game but they never really gel properly.  For example the diplomatic rules are quite clever regarding declarations of war and armistice etc. but they can (and do) simply knock players out of the game.  And it simply isn't as fun with only two players.  Combat is also poorly worked out and quickly degenerates into a huge slugfest between massive armies.
Traded after 4 plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very good game!
There can be some down-time though, if you are not part of a conflict, as combat is handled as a small-scale tabletop. The rules are not clear on a lot of issues and you will need to check the FAQ to get it right.
 Apart from that the game has some very interesting political features, exciting battles and lots of optional rules + eventcards. The game is challenging even with 2 players and the different scenarios calls for different strategie. Highly recommended!!!

Played with 3 the first time through the standard game and everyone enjoyed themselves. The combat system is pretty straight forward and second hand after awhile. The cards used in the advanced rules along with the different unit types look to spice up the next playing.

Old-style conquest game with a very long playing time, so that it is rarely played.  Problems with vague rules arent too bad when using the FAQ. A couple neat ideas:  The separate tactical battles are simple yet varied (but far too long for a multiplayer game); and the political action points rules are fun, including the allies rules which allow non-player countries to be in the game and join a side (but joining is too luck-dependent).

Eagle games continues to make games around their garishly colored plastic pieces, huge maps (a good thing), and futsy battle system. This game adds more player negotiating, which is great, but doesn't seem to warrent the massiveness of the game itself.

This game inspired me to make board games. it is amazing; the battle part of it is the best thing about the game aside from the graphics and design. 
It is too large and takes a long time to finish but those minor issues do not bother me.

RATING: 8
Great game that combines grand strategy with 19th Century tactical combat resolution, but you have to devote many hours to complete it.  Uses plastic miniatures representing infantry, guards infantry, light and heavy cavalries, artillery, and generals.

RATING: 3
Game looks visually appealing but really is just 'Risk' with more bits. Game play is about as inspiring as Risk. Worse than 'Risk' is the excessive downtime (biggest annoyance is the moving of pieces from the mapboard to the tactical board and back again for every battle).

The mapboard & minis are wonderful stuff. The standard game works well enough, but the rules beyond that get a bit bogged down (and the expert game is far too long to be considered). In the end, there are better Napoleonic games to invest one's time into. Sold

RATING: 7
A very fun game with a great feal for the era and type of warfare this game portrays.  I would love to rate it higher but the game has a few drawbacks.  First the map is beautiful and large but the countries are still too small to fit all the pieces in.  The set up takes very long.  There are two sets of rules, simple and advanced and optional rules too.  The biggest dissapointment of this game though is the political diplomacy, it is extremely luck based but has equally extreme results.  The battle works well and is very accurate to the times, a little tweaking with the political system and this could be a 9.

I love this game. The best of the Eagle Games products. Everything is so right about this game. The tactical battles are brilliant. The pieces are fantastic. The board is beautiful and functional. All of the major nations have their own unqiue set of strategic and tacical challenges. There are ten different scenarios provided with varied setups and victory conditions. The political system is fun and very interactive. I really felt like I was in charge of an important nation when I played this game. My only complaint is that the rules need to be revised, as there are a few loopholes and inconsistancies.

Great plastic pieces and a great combat system (clear out a row to win a battle - genius!). But unless you can gather a lot of people together to get the diplomacy going the wars are going to come down to numbers. One battle you actually stay and fight in can lose you the whole campaign. And if you do get enough people with the time to play to get the diplomacy going (say 5 or 6) why are you playing this and not EiA or Civilisation or Dune etc. etc.

Jury still out.  Not happy with published rules for game.  Tried one playing with my son and was disappointed.  Time too valuable to put into dodgy rules... they must be tight.  Not sure if Alan's version is, but he seems to be committed to evolving this game to playability... for that he gets high marks... and it will be his rules I try the next time.  Best thing about this game for me is that I got it on $$ refunded when I took back the even more tragically failed "Civilization The Boardgame".  Eagle games needs to learn that pretty bits won't keep them around for the long haul... its got to be playability.

03/13/05 I played the Charge the Guns variant once (well actually only one turn - which took four hours!!!). It reminded me of Axis & Allies, which I don't care for much. It looked nice though. 
10/04/09 Played a four-player game using the basic rules. It was better that way. But not enough to raise my rating a whole point. I knew something was fishy when I noticed the scenarios have a start date, but no end date or victory conditions. Apparently you're supposed to play unitl either everyone gets tired or the group decides there's no point going on. Bah! As the owner told me, NiE isn't a game, its a game kit. Thanks to Glenn Drover for designing 2/3 of a game. 
Hopefully it'll be at least another 4.5 years before I see this overgrown turkey again.

Excellent mechanics and good simulation of period. The PAP system is very effective and interesting, a game winner if you know what you're doing with them. However its complex to start with as rules are all over the place and not very clear.

The pieces and the artwork are excellent.  The 1/72 scale minis should appeal to those who like that sort of thing.  The combat is especially fun as larger battles are conducted off the European map on a tactical battleboard that affords more options than simple dice rolling.  Naval rules are a little too simple for my taste, and some rules were a little awkward, but all in all a very satisfying game.

With some house rules to clarify a few ambiguous points in the origional ruleset, this is an outstanding game. It is particularly well-suited for expansion with historical house rules, additional figures/custom units, and so forth. Sadly it is not a quick-playing game.

Well, I blame this game for delaying my discovery of Eurogaming by more than a year. Yeah, that's a pretty terrible accusation to lay at anyone's feet, but Eagle Games, I'm pointing the finger. 

Me and my buddy had been playing a bit of Netrunner, and the occasional other two player game, and we figured we'd go halves in a board game. There seemed to be a few about these days. I went to the local game shop to check it out, and there was all sorts of crazy looking games there. The game shop guy mentioned a car racing game, and something called El Grande, but I wasn't so sure. Frankly, these looked like light timewasters - me and my friend wanted to get our teeth into something. This big box Napoleon in Europe grabbed my eye. I went home and did some net research (obviously in the wrong places) and found some people raving about this one. To cut to the chase, me and my friend bought it, read the rules, and felt concerned. We then played it a couple of times, and our concern deepened into dispair that we'd wasted our money on a game with nice looking army men, but flimsy rules and ill-thought-out mechanics. "Wait," I said, "there'll be rules support on the net." Well, there was and there wasn't. There was an FAQ, but it was full on comments like "Well, some people like to interpret this rule this way and others like this - you should experiment and see what you like best!" Great, so now you want me to write and playtest my own rules? Tell you what, why don't I make my own board and pieces and just keep my money next time?

Anyway, me and my friend were pretty pissed, and it was a long while before I invested in any more games.... Thankfully I'm cured now, but Eagle really put the crap-expensive game fear into me. Now I don't buy anything without checking it out very carefully on the geek.

The rules are not perfectly written, and they do cause some confusion. The official errata does help, but still some rulings are unclear. If your game group can live with a rules discussion now and then, this is a great game. I would have rated the game 10, if the rules were more clear.

RATING: 9
The other Eagle game I have. Since the other is tACW & I being a fan of the A&A games I compare to them. NiE does not suffer from a lack of choices to march with the armies, as I think ACW does. The multi-national diplomacy makes armies move & battle all over the board. The plastic pieces of all colors make the game look good. This game is more complex than ACW & the A&A-games. The political overtures make it that plus make it longer to play than any of the others, unless you play the shorter scenarios. But what would a game about the Napoleonic era be without politics? Glenn Drover has made a good job giving the players the complex Napoleonic battles in a way that is not very complex for the player. I like his tactical battles better than the A&A "battles" but they take longer time to resolve and not so well portrait a multi-battle situation like Jena-Auerstadt and Ligny-Quatre Bras(-Waterloo). All said: This is a game that I will never turn down, it is a very fine game of the Napoleonic wars. The game has long set-up & playing time but so have all wargames. I have played and own several, but few as good as this one.

Dropping rating again (from 8 to 7 to now 6).  Tactical combat system is great, and rules are straightforward, but, as written, there are serious rules loopholes in the diplomatic & political action point system.  Truly suffers in comparison to Age of Napoleon.  If I want a multiplayer Eagle Game, I'd be more apt to go with Attack! than this, or Age of Mythology, which is excellent with three.  AoN convinces me Napoleonic games are better off as a two player.  Sold.

Fun game set in the Napoleonic period that can be a free for all or played historically. It is not meant to be a heavy wargame on the life of Napoleon, but a great themed game that gives many hours of enjoyment destroying each other on a cool battle board. The minis are nice too! One thing though is use the expansion rules on BGG as it improves the game. It is a long game though.

Great game. The tactical battles give significance to the formation of your armies. Cannons blast at long range. Infantry take the brunt of the action. Cavalry charge at the critical point, pursue a defeated force and screen a quick retreat. Leaders rally troop and give charge bonuses. The multiplayer diplomacy makes this game good for 5-7 players. The scenarios make this game good for 2 to 4 players. The scenarios have a great historical flavor.

2 plays. Eagle's best effort so far. Out of the box rules are still a typical Eagle Games hash of organization, lack of clarity, and vague focus -but can be more easily fixed with good house rules than their other games. It has quality bits and board; which was Eagle Games' only strong suit until recent times.

This game was poorly put together. I'd be surprised if more than one session of playtesting went into this.
The historical games are weak at best and the ahistorical multi-player campaigns are, in the games I've played, 4 guys sitting in their home capital waiting for someone to move. The moment someone moves away from their capital another nations advances toward it resulting in a chain reaction of marching and counter marching with no nation ever leaving their home territory. Turns and turns go by with each nations army growing to a ridiculous size. Eventually, 2 nations ally which leads to the other 2 nation alling. Finally, the lines are drawn the the 4 nations are allowed to meet in a battle that, by sheer numbers, would rival the second world war. The game is decided then by this one battle that lasts for hours. If I wanted to just play war with plastic soldiers I would do that. 

This game falls flat on it's face and I can't believe it was actually published as it is out of the box.

I hate to rate this one at a 6, but I have to.  I am a huge fan of the Napoleonic era and this is the grand-daddy of epic games for that time period.  The rules play a little a-historical though.  The differing difficulty levels are great and the battle resolution rules for the intermediate rules and better is fantastic (similar to Columbia Game's Napoleon battle system).  If you are going to play this game you owe it to yourself to download the variant rules called Charge the Guns.  It takes a little longer to play and you have to lay out more cash to get enough components to play it, but it is much better and does justice to this game's great components and beautiful map board.

Components nice.  Board nice.  Card nice.  The only problem I had with the game is it didnt fit what I was looking for.  I wanted a Napoleonic game playable in an afternoon, and this wasn't it.  Takes a long time just to get setup.  Next issue is that the spaces, despite the massive board, are not big enough for some of the large armies you will be setting up.  I think Age of Napoleon, Phalanx games is better but wish it had the number of cards in this game.

Rated again lower.  I just don't ever play this one.  Too big and too buggy.  Go for Age of Napoleon, but even it isn't all that.

CTG NIE has provided me with some of my greatest gaming memories. I've played Alan Richbourgs CTG variant over 15 times playing via the internet 9 times. I know of no other game that offeres the level of political diplomacy and interaction in addition to a healthy level of military action as CTG NIE. It's beautiful, and the replayability is off the charts. With various combat game mechanics you can adjust your battles tactical abstraction levels to your whim. 

Simply put I can think of no greater game experience currently in existance than a 7 player campaign game of CTG NIE played in the Empire style.

I guess I'm a little biased on this one since it was the first boardgame I bought in college.  I don't think you'll find better visual components in any Napoleonic game, and the plastic miniatures are a good draw for getting non-wargamers or non-boardgamers into a light strategic game.  I even got my dad to play once (he won).  The tactical battles are somewhat abstract, but still capture the flavor of the era.  Its true that the rules need help and some intense play testing wouldn't hurt, but i've seen worse ways to spend a long evening.

A very good strategy games that captures the Napoleon times very well. Some small &quot;what happens if&quot; in the rules, mostly concerning the end of a war, but with a few plays and/or simple house rules no major issues is left.

Long and very difficult to learn from the rules.  Once you finally get through the rules, and teach them to other people, the game itself makes you wonder why you bothered.  Some players have too much to do, and some players don't have enough.  Too many battles have overwhelming odds and leave no way to salvage a victory, even with clever tactics.  Victory conditions are both too random and too difficult to achieve.  Look and feel of the game is very cool, but the game itself is just not fun, which I find very regrettable.  Would love to try the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/26435]"Charge the Guns" variant[/url] that you can find here on the Geek, but I can't handle throwing more money and effort at this game.  If you're looking for multiplayer Napoleonic grand strategy, my recommendation would be to stay away from this one and try [gameid=3409] instead.

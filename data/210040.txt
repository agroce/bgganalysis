This is a beautifully designed and put together game which is a real treat if like me you sit right in the crossover of the venn diagram that combines Decemberists fans and board game fans. Carson Ellis' artwork is stunning, and the thematic link to the Decemberists' Hazards of Love (and the Crane Wife, if you own the expansion) is handled with subtlety to create a game that will intrigue gamers and non gamers alike. It sets up quickly and is explained relatively easily (though the stockpile rule takes a few rounds to get your head around). 

Other commenters have said it is basically a re-skin of Casino in its basic form (though I've not played it) and while that might be true, the fields and luminaries (tarot cards which when revealed introduce new rules of varying impact) and enough wrinkles that I never felt like I had no strategic decisions in a turn. Even the act of 'sowing' (which is usually your default if you can't do anything else) has strategic elements to it as you try to stop other players from getting favourable plays from your cards.

The game plays well with absolute beginners and as long as you've read the rules you can teach it pretty quickly. The games I've played so far point to a deeper strategy that I'm excited to explore further. 

It's not chess - it's a medium weight parlour game that gives a real 'one more turn' vibe. The design is an added bonus that pulls it all together into a game that is a joy to play.

Looks more daunting than it is. Keith Baker and co did an excellent job in creating a game that feels storied and mystical. Played once and got absolutely trounced by the hands I was dealt, but I wasn't upset by it. It's a game where luck is involved, certainly, but there are also many opportunities to exert agency, and block opponents from scoring. Very much enjoyed playing, and feel further playing would give me more of a feel for a strategy. Also really enjoyed the number of variants provided!

When you try to explain this game to new players, it seems complex to explain, but after playing a full round, you get a better understanding of the flow and concept. It is fun and has a lot of twists and turns to make this interesting and fun to play hand after hand.

I really enjoy Illimat so far. It has a lot of mechanics from a handful of other games that are put together in a unique way. As a result, it feels fun and new but also familiar at the same time. It has a nice mix of strategy and flying by the seat of your pants that makes it thoughtful but fast moving and light at the same time. I would have to say that the scoring is probably my favorite part. Games can swing quickly one way or the other with each round and it keeps you on your toes.

The only reason I give it 9 stars instead of 10 is that I found myself feeling that the Luminaries got a little repetitive after a handful of games. They have fun effects but start to feel a little stale. Even having a few more Luminaries would likely solve this issue. I suspect that purchasing the Crane Wife expansion will make a big difference in this respect and am looking forward to doing so. However, this is a review of the base game so I felt I had to be honest. Edit: After reading other reviews I realized I had entirely forgotten about the other variants you can try. That could also make a difference.

Overall, I love the art style, lore and all the Decemberists references. It is a very unique, fun game that anyone can learn quite a bit faster than you would think when you first see all these unusual items in the box. :)

I wanted to hate it. “Hipster trash!” as I found out it was out of Portland OR. I was incorrect, I do enjoy this game. I have a hard time saying this because I was vocally against my wife backing their Kickstarter, my pride takes a backseat. I love this game, my wife was right (as she is most of the time). Simply brilliant!

This is truly a modern classic. Inspired by the Italian and American cards games such as Scopa and Hearts, Illimat is a new spin on something very old. Compact and designed to look out of time, Illimat is a fast paced and beautifully crafted game that should be on everyone's shelf!

My wife & I backed Illimat on kickstarter and received our copy of this excellent board game yesterday. If you've played Hearts, Bridge, Casino, or Gin, then Illimat will seem familiar. The underlying game mechanics are loosely based on a Nineteenth Century trick-taking card game that doesn't see much play anymore. Why not just play dust off the rules to that older card game and play it? 'Glad you asked...

Special "Luminary Cards," whose revelation triggers special rules of play, are the critical change in Illimat. Luminary Cards add a sufficient randomizer to play that can afford new players opportunities to score early victories, or provide additional complexity to keep experienced players interested. When I think of really well-designed light to medium weight Eurogames, they do the same thing in balancing luck and skill to avoid discouraging new players and to prevent boring replays. This kind of balance is quite a trick to pull off.

The artifactuality of Illimat is impressive as well.
Carson Elllis illustrated the aforementioned Luminary Cards; they're the size of Tarot cards and their gorgeous graphic design feels akin to Tarot cards as well. Aside from all of the cards presenting pretty pictures, their linen finish on durable card stock can be appreciated for handling and longevity. The okus tokens are adorable, metal components cast to last, as well. Using the tokens stirs a bit of nostalgia for earlier board games. Clever components like the cloth board and game box lid allow for compact storage as well as portability.

All in all, I'm recommending Illimat to everyone.

(DISCLAIMER: I am a Kickstarter backer.)
The rules are easy to pick up. and the changing rules make the game very replayable. The early form of the game is evocative of a esoteric, time-lost boardgame, and I look forward to the final product.

I enjoyed playing a prototype version on the 2017 JoCo Cruise.  Use cards in your hand to "harvest" cards from one of four fields on the board, "sow" cards to add cards to a field, and "stockpile" a card to add the card's values together to "harvest" as the new value.  Acquire points for clearing fields and collecting cards.  Special "Luminary" cards become active, thus changing the game rules, when a field is cleared the first time.  When you play face cards, the rules for each field can change based on the suit, allowing a player to manipulate which cards others can collect.  Interesting twist on a trick-taking game, which I usually don't care for.

While it does have great production values, this is not really a great strategy game and its a bit convoluted for just a light fluff game.

RATING: 7
The fake-tradition fell a bit flat for me (Tarot-style cards including pictures of playing cards and a guy with an electric torch), but the game has some nice moving parts, and a neat dilemma over whether to "stockpile" a set of cards and admit you have the card that can capture them, or keep them more precariously loose and stay quiet. Signalling aside there can be a little too much luck, but it evens out over a full game. Has definitely made me want to check out its traditional inspirations, Scopone and Casino.

The more I play this game, the more it reveals its brilliance. While it initially seems like a pretty simple "poker deck" game, the combination of Luminaries, seasonal changes, and the Stockpile action, takes this game to a whole other level. The anti-bluffing mechanic tends to be off-putting to most gamers at first, but realizing that structuring your turns in such a way that minimizing potential damage when you do finally reveal information to other players is another one of those "Aha!" moments in just how deep this seemingly minimalist game can get.

On the aesthetic side, the game is also absolutely gorgeous. This is one of those games that will draw in passerby by its table presence alone. (Baker seems to have knack, as Gloom has a similar effect) Also, kudos for incorporating the game box as an element of the game.

I'm a huge Decemberists fan and am so happy that they were an impetus behind this game. I backed it on Kickstarter and after over a year it's finally here, and worth every minute of the wait. It's easy to learn, fun, interesting, and absolutely beautiful. Jenn, Keith, and their staff at Twogether Studios have done an amazing job and I encourage everyone to try it.

A pretty good little game, beautifully designed. The rules were a little ambiguous -- there were instances where we had questions that we just couldn't find answers to. Also, while it technically does work with two -- and sometimes it works just fine with two -- we found that it could also swing wildly out of balance, with one player pulling away rapidly and leaving the other just sitting there waiting for it to be over. Not a fun place to be in any game. I expect adding even one more player would do a lot to mitigate that effect.

I am heavily bias for this game, as I do love The Decemberists, and did get the "Captain Illimat" (Wyrmwood board costing $600+).

Regardless, this game (currently I play with a deck of playing cards and proxy cutouts for the "Luminary cards") is very enjoyable to play. It is not too complicated at all with easy setup and with assortment of Luminary cards that change how you need to play it does not run as stale as Casino (which is where the rules clearly stem off from).

The promised finished game looks beautiful and I cannot wait to get my copy of both the base game and the wyrmwood boardgame.

It has an elegant charm to it. Most of the game's flavor comes from the Decemberists' albums. The base game takes from their rock opera tale "The Hazards of Love", the expansion "Crane Wife" takes an album as a namesake along with related Okus.

In addition to the game itself there will be rankings/missions that players will be able to take part in to improve rank. This is to solidify the lore that The Illimat had before conception of any of its physical essence.

That said, does Illimat do anything truly different? No, not really, the bulk of its rules is just Casino, literally copied. It does add new new mechanics and drowns it with unique thematic drama. A repaint, yes. But a repainting by masterful artists.

I also like that the game can be highly customizable with fan-made Luminaries and variant rules (I have already made some myself).

Illimat is a beautiful game that succeeds at its goal of being like a parlour game that someone might find in their attic. But at the same time, the card game itself is complex and fun to play, and inviting to players of all ages.

I only got this game recently and so had no way of knowing whether I liked it because it was new or because it was good. I've played it through a few times now and can safely say: It's good!

At first I thought there was an imbalance where one player could run away with the game early on, but big swings are achievable in any round and the 'harmonic convergence' mechanic always provides an out for a losing player and something for the winner to watch out for. Tops game.

The design is beautiful too.

I didn't really engage with this game, though that may have been because I sat in for another player after they tapped out one round in. I'm also super wary of products pushed based on the creator's strength in other areas (and that might have predisposed me to be unfavorable in my judgment).

Received my copy of this a few days ago.  Beautifully produced, and exceptionally fun to play.  Have played several times as a family, and with friends.  Took a couple of runs to really get our heads around some of the finer points, but it's very easy to grasp the fundamentals.  The changes in play introduced by the luminaries and the seasons (why's it always Winter when I want to harvest?) keep the game fluid.

A beautiful game. It lacks something that makes it great. We enjoy playing it once in a while but it is not something we will pull out often. maybe a good gateway game.

Also have the Crane Wife expansion.

This is one of the most gorgeous games I've seen. The gameplay and art really nail the goal of having a game that feels both classic and modern, very well done. The Okus tokens, Luminaries, and books of variants and lore give it that "secret society" feel they were going for. The Decemberists and Twogether Studios nailed it on this one. Fun, unique, and easy to learn/teach.

Edit: Upped to a 9 because I love the game, artwork, and excellent book added to the game.

The design achieves its goal reasonably well, which is to emulate an old parlour game with arcane conventions, and it gets plus points for its stylish graphics. The game play itself is pleasant enough but quite luck-based. I imagine card counting would improve your score, but you are limited in the extent to which you can do so at the point in the game when it would make a useful difference. Our rounds were prone to over-analysis, although I'm unconvinced of the value of this, so the whole thing took considerably longer than the stated playing time.

RATING: 8
A game with more depth than I was expecting, Illimat holds up to a fairly straightforward game with some nice complexity. The fact that it's influenced by the flavor of the Decemberists music doesn't hurt either.

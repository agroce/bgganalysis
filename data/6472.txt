Played again this week and I enjoyed it more - still very long (6 of us took 5 hours to play a game and we weren't being particularly slow).
Also its brutal, stressful and high conflict.  And thats the good bit.

RATING: 8
Recreates the feel of the book superbly, taking Diplomacy into a modern gaming age by adding some very slick "german" mechanisms. Some Houses are harder to play than others and repeated playings may end up with balance being an issue but this is no different to Diplomacy.

RATING: 8
Great game which captures the essence of the books perfectly. The game is not just about building up a large army and crushing people (though that is possible also), but it is mostly about intrigue, alliances, and breaking them.

The game itself has little luck.

Listen to people who say that if you haven't read the books, don't bother with the game. If theme is important to you (it is to me), then you want to like and know the theme of a game. I'm not into high fantasy so I should have known better.

The mechanics of the game are fairly simple though some don't feel quite right (particularly the bidding portion). It's sort of Risk with elements of Dune and Wallenstein. When all meshed to together, it feels weaker than the individual parts. 

If you aren't into diplomacy then forget about this game. Some positions (houses) are just stronger than others and the only way for the weaker houses to combat that is to gang up or at least have a truce or two going. And the game is unfortunately really l o n g.

2010-04-14 (rating 9):

On of my favorite games. I fell in love with it on the first game.

Game with very deep, multilevel players interaction. You have to constantly make pacts with your enemies. Those are however usually very temporary pacts. And it seems in the end it is not possible to win without back-stabbing.

The game is however quite long. Especially due to players secret talks.


I hope to be able to test expansions one day too.

RATING: 3
The essential problem with this game is that it's at best mediocre in a field were there a lot of very good or even excellent games.  It simply isn't as good as exciting or as deep as Wallenstein/Shogun, Struggle of Empires, Byzantium, Perikles, Empires of the Ancient World, Antike and several others you can mention.  All those games are similar in that they are comabt games which give you lots of possible actions.  Ok, it may be more demanding and involved than Vinci, but then Vinci is very quick to play and this one drags in at about 3 and half hours.  In fact I'd probably rather do the hoovering than play this, and, alas, I'm told that the expansion makes the game worse not better...that's one to avoid then!!

RATING: 9
The game got a different feel everytime and the way orders are handled offers a unique strategy experience. The only chance element in the game is through the cards pulled at each round, and this is made in a way so it does not limit the strategy. The bidding on political influence, handling of supply for the army and gain of power tokens, offers a variety of different approaches to the game. Each area has a strategic value, so it is up to the player to focus on the way he wants to go. Then finally the uncertain diplomacy between players gives you the feeling of never being completely safe, even in alliances.

Awesome book series, awesome game.  It helps if players have read the books but it's not exactly necessary.  Very well balanced game that keeps the powerful in check and does an okay job of keeping the weak in the game.  Intense player vs player action starts almost from the beginning, including lots of informal agreements and alliances across the table.  If one player gets too powerful too quickly then the other players can quickly team up to even things out.  I have only ever played with 4 people, but would love to get a game of 5 (includes Greyjoys) or 6 (Greyjoys & Martells).  Starks are probably the easiest starting house while the Tyrells prove to be the most challenging.  Epic 4-5 hour game where plans are constantly being laid and adjusted.

Wow, where is the fun is this one?  We couldn't even get through an entire game we were so bored.  It sounded so good in theory, but the gameplay was slow and uninvolving.  The whole supply issue seemed to throttle any build up of forces, and the battles were analytical, lacking any zest, probably due to the lack of randomness.  Meanwhile, the Westerone cards were too random--we turned up 4 supply cards in a row and were halfway through the game before a Mustering card came up--far too late in the game.  The Wildings attacks were rare and pathetic, not nearly so much trouble as a lone gnat flying by.  Our group agreed we give it another try in a couple of months, but we were pretty disenchanted on this first go-round.

I played it once with a friend of mine who loves the books, and while I enjoyed it, I don't really feel a need to play it again. It felt in a lot of ways like any other world conquest game, with a slightly different board. Maybe I need to have read the books to get a real appreciation for the game.

RATING: 7.5
Love the mechanism (Diplomacy done right!), assuming the standard fix is made; not so much the constraints of the board or the damn time it takes (and whoever wrote the estimate of time on the side of the box is on twitch pills or something).  Enthusiasm in my group at the time flagged when red won two games more or less accidentally by oozing onto the required towns, a problem that would go away with more play, itself an impossible solution because the game takes too long.  I can't say the expansions grabbed me at all, with the exception of the ports.

Great components, rules, tokens, maps and all.

If it was a eurogame, with building and conquest ideas, its fantastic. But its not.

After 1 game, I can't wait to get rid of it. The game may be fantastic for some, but its not for me.

It's not a real-kinda-wargame, but an area occupation system that merge with bluffing with a token. 

When your borders are defined, what is there to bluff? Tokens choosen is as clear as daylight. 

Whole game ended up with constant border fights that leads to nowhere.

One of my favourite all time book series is turned into a game of bluffs, pushing your luck and warfare.

unsure whether this is really good or an exercise in extended stalemate. I guess it really depends on the company.

RATING: 6
Played this for the first time with 5 players - too sleepy, not sure what was going on. Played this a second time as House Stark. Won the game (although we only played 9 rounds since we had to leave) with more supplies in a tie with 5 cities in competition with the yellow player. The problem with my position is that I felt super isolated from everyone else. The only front that made sense for me to expand into is the black one, since the empty area between me and yellow seemed  too far with little incentive to go there with a city at the furthest point. And I still felt like it didn't make sense for me to battle until the seventh round, which left me on my own for most of the game. The other issue we had was that the luck of the event cards meant we had all our supply actions first (one 3 army, three 2 armies for the whole game) with musters coming up in the latter middle part of the game, which meant conflict was pretty dry in the first half of the game. This game has similar mechanics to Shogun, but Shogun feels way more balanced.

RATING: 8.5
A really solid offering in the empire building, conquest type game department. I've only played with 5 players and I'm not sure how balanced the game would be with less. I love the tension in choosing actions for your armies. The card driven battles are simple but very effective and the uniqness of each factions cards is a nice touch. The auctions for turn order and the other abilities adds another nice layer of decisions to the game. An all around great game that is limited only  by the fact that it seems to work best with only 5 players and that it's an old school type conquest game and so probably has limited appeal among more conventional eurogamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
25 Jan 07:  Great game of strategy, diplomacy, and cunning, with enough randomness thrown in to ensure no two games will be the same!  Only drawback is that ships can be too powerful--but this is solved with the Ports rule from the ACoK expansion!  With that expansion, this game becomes a 9 for me!

Sehr sch√∂n, zu sechst spiele ich am liebsten, und es ver√§ndert die gesamte Balance des Spiels.
[b]Neue Hauskarten[/b]
In beiden Erweiterungen gibt es neue Hauskarten. Wir spielen am liebsten mit den Karten aus der 1. Erweiterung, die generell nicht so stark schwanken, wie die aus dem Grundspiel und die aus der 2. Erweiterung.

Diese Regeloption ist auch leicht ohne Kauf einer Erweiterungsbox einzuf√ºhren.
[b]H√§fen[/b]
D√§mpfen stark das Problem, das man praktisch keine neuen Schiffe mehr bauen kann, wenn man die Herrschaft √ºber die eigene K√ºstenregion verloren hat. Au√üerdem sind sie einfach ein sch√∂nes Element.
[b]Festungen[/b]
Sind nett, aber kein Mu√ü.

Diese Option mag ich sehr, sie hilft, eine generelle Linie vorzugeben und erleichtert so die Wahl, welche Befehle ich nun diese Runde legen will.

Wichtig eher f√ºr die 4-Spieler-Variante
[b]Wildling-Karten[/b]
Keine Meinung
[b]Anf√ºhrer[/b]
Unschl√ºssig - ein sehr nettes Spielelement und vor allem in Verbindung mit Geiselnahme - Verhandlungen zur Freilassung - Hinrichtung sehr sch√∂n zur Spielwelt passend, f√ºr viele andere aber nur viel Aufwand ohne gro√üen Nutzen (vgl. die Diskussion Ameritrash/Eurogames).

RATING: 9
A very good game in the Diplomacy tradition but without the written orders. I like the simultaneous order token and it meshes well with the rest of the gameplay. Best when played with only fragile alliances and lots of backstabbing. Base game has some balance issues, but conquest on a map type of games almost always has. I also like the card based combat system which brings another bluffing element into the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
Very minimal luck in this game.  Combat is number of units/support with a card thrown in (the card is your choice from your set, but can only be used once until all cards are used).  This made it so your tactical and political decisions really decided the game; however, the whole game had an ebb and flow characteristic that made it a little stale and too long.

The theme might be better for those who have read the books.  As I haven't, it was not really all that evident.

The game play itself didn't do much for me.  Yes, there are a lot of different mechanics in the game, but it came across as a "make one mistake, and you're pooched" game.  It feels bit like chess, and I don't enjoy chess...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Diplomacy with added bells in the form of the leaders from Dune and whistles in the form of random events and some added complexity. A genuine flavour of the George R.R. Martin novels is sadly lacking.  The limited number of turns was initially appealing (a multi-player wargame that will definitely finish in three hours!), but ultimately unsatisfying as it encourages very Kingmakerly tactics.  

FFG did a good, pre plastic miniatures with everything, job of the production.  The artwork is functional though uninspired.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Kind of a bloated version of Diplomacy that is very unbalanced. Playing as Highgarden is a guaranteed defeat, while most games seem to end in a Baratheon victory, regardless of the player.

  Issue orders to troops through tokens on their locations and hope that you aren't going to get attacked from all sides, the combat cards work well and give the battles more dynamics and can give some wonderful surprise victories.

  I like the way you must balance supply and army size, the number of barrels you control dictates the sizes of your various forces which works well, or would if the board was more balanced.

  I haven't yet played 2nd edition so not sure how much that is improved, but there is certainly room for improvement here. Mechanics work very well, but the board is unbalanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Initial impressions: Epic game. Love the hidden orders mechanic. Good battle system. The game is full of tension negotiations and back-stabbing! Some balancing (and number of players) problems are solved in the expansions. Better wait for the second edition.   All in all a very promising game.

RATING: 6
Enjoyed 2 plays of this; must play more. Really needs the full five players.
...
Played again at LoB, and I lost badly, so maybe I'm just feeling bitter :) ... but the random nature of supply and muster really strikes me as a problem with this. When and if they turn up is a huge game-changer, and that sours the game a little for me.

Have now played second edition, see my comments by that game entry. Would much rather play 2nd than 1st edition, so traded this one away.

60‚Ç¨ is too much for a playtest version. The game is broken without at least one of the expansions. Ships are too strong, levies are left at the whims of fate, takes too long to complete and the rules are a mess. As usual FFG lacks both in the rules and the playtest departments.

You can fix some of those aspects in the game by paying 40‚Ç¨ to buy the Clash of Kings expansion. Sorry guys but for 100 euros i can buy at least 2 games or a big box set like runewars which is a gazillion times better.

As a diplomacy clone, it pales before the likes of Dune, Wallenstein and Shogun. 

In a few words: a game for fanboys of Martin, not gamers.

The game engine is interesting, but the diplomacy is almost so important in the game as the good tactical movements.
IMHO the single biggest problem is not the balance, but the the long game time. I can't see any reason why to play it for 10 rounds with these dynamics of the gameplay.

So overall the theme is good, and atmosphere is great, but ten years ago it was a bigger hit.

Cons. After few plays, players start to dig in and mass their armies. In gets predictable from the same reason. Not good with less then 5 players.

Excellent, excellent, excellent.  Probably more appealing to fans of the books, but the unintiated can appreciate this title as well.  Light wargame, heavy strategy, fixed end game, and hidden orders.  Play can be quite long, especially with new players.  Quality again from Fantasy Flight.

Provisional after two plays. Got some rules wrong after the first game. Played Lannister both times. Second game played with expansion. It took 4.5 hours. Though it has an interesting blend of mechanisms - what a waste of my time. Will be awile before I play this again (if ever).

And I love the books!

RATING: 10
This is one of my favorites and the best multi-player war game I've played.

I give it a '10', but it does honestly require some tweaking to get there.  It can be a little long sometimes, but you can easily reduce the number of turns played.  It's also possible for some houses to really get screwed on the first turn if you don't start with the right opening moves -- but if everyone understands those dynamics it's not an issue.

There's a slight chance that the Westeros cards don't provide crucial events (like mustering new troops) for several turns in a row.  The uncertainty of what will happen next is vital to the game, but it can go too far.  The solution is to modify the Westeros decks.  For instance, we set up the first deck with 1 Mustering, 1 Supply, 1 Nothing Happens, and 1 Reshuffle-Redraw -- but if Nothings Happens comes up we borrow from the ACOK expansion and allow the holder of the Iron Throne to choose between Muster, Supply, and Nothing Happens.  The other three decks are constructed similarly.  This all but eliminates the problem and adds another incentive to hold the special tokens.

Finally, it doesn't support 4 very well right out of the box.  But it can easily be turned into a fantastic four player game.  The first step is to eliminate Pyke -- pretend it doesn't exist -- to prevent the Lannisters from easily gaining too much power.  We also typically give the Tyrell's a second starting ship to allow him to be more competitive in the southern seas.

So yeah, I've only talked about what's bad and how to fix it.  And it is unfortunate that it requires this extra work.  But it's worth it because it turns into one of the best games of its kind.

I'll have to be brief about what's good.  The core is everyone simultaneously placing placing secret actions.  It's crucial that you anticipate what everyone else will do so that you move, defend, raid, and support in the right places.  But you're not just guessing because the game thrives with negotiations between players -- forming alliances and back-stabbing.

There's no luck in combat, but there's plenty of uncertainty.  You can never be sure who will support who during the battle, and you can never be sure how many bonuses from their cards each player will commit to win.

And finally you a good political system working on the side.  Players that can gather more political power gain an obvious advantage when bidding that political power to take hold of special abilities that can swing the balance of military power on the map.  It all really works together well.

I had a bit of a problem learning the rules, I recommend before playing this game you have 2 seperate people read the rules and try a couple turns of playing as they can be quite complex. Once we figured out all the rules (about on turn 7) things went a lot faster and were much more fun. I am giving it a 6 until I play it next and will see if it is worthy of a higher or lower rating.

This one is wonderfully balanced and quite exiting game. The only negative aspect is the length. It seems to take 4-6(!) hours for our gaming group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game has been compared to Diplomacy.  While the 2 games share some concepts, the play of the two is very different.  Diplomacy feels like posturing, backroom deals, and betrayal.  aGoT feels like wickedness, deceit, and dishonesty.  The game captures the distrust and jockeying of the major houses in Westeros.  Players must work with each other to gain (or contain) advantage.  But all the while it happens, everyone knows that it will not end well.  aGoT is unlikely to end friendships, but it is also unlikely to foster close bonds with your fellow players.  Recommended for game groups with tight ties and thick skin.  There will be conflict.  It will feel personal.  

But in the end, it's just a game.  And the game aspects work quite well.  Turns are fluid and players stay engaged throughout each turn.  Downtime is not very high because everyone is watching what unfolds.  Like the series (book and show) - it is an engaging experience.

This is a great game.  It is simple, elegant, and driven primarily by strategy, diplomacy, and number-crunching.  The only random element is the decks of event cards, and they affect everyone more or less equally.  The simultaneous orders is a brilliant game mechanic, and the areas of influence are exceptionally balanced, especially in a 5-player game.

Since writing this comment, 2nd Edition has completely replaced the original.  2nd Ed. is equal or superior in every category, so I'll never play this one again.  Trade, anyone?  I have both expansions!

Now this is a game I could get into. Going to hover it at 7 for now... but I feel that the rules aren't all too complicated, it seems to make good use of a theme (though I'm not entirely sure having not read the books) and seems to be a decent mechanic for a strategy game.

The game we played seemed somewhat short, however. I don't know if that's a result of the number of players we had (6) or if it's a result of new players not knowing how to stop powerhouses.

Definitely want to give it another try.

This game has a horrible rulebook, and is overall rather badly balanced; at least for a first play. I suspect that experienced players might learn how to make the most of each character, and find that the balance works out better in the long run, but I at least don't want to become an experienced player in a game which makes me feel as negative as this one does.

My rating has dropped from an eight.  I'm less enamored by this game each time I play.  For a fairly long game the board just seems so static.  Players on the southern end rarely have contact with those from Northern end of the board so interaction always seems to be with immediate neibours only.

I much prefer the newest expansion A Storm Of Swords with four players.  A much more elegant design which borrows a few mechanics from Euros making the game interesting and giving it a good amount of flux.

Unequal footing at game startup is neat but could really cause problems with unexperienced players.

The orders mechanic was pretty neat though.

Nos, a j√°t√©k nem okozott katarzist, de nem rossz. Olvastam kritikak√©nt, hogy megl√°tszik rajta, hogy 2003-as, akkor tal√°n nagyobbat √ºt√∂tt, de ma m√°r t√∫lhaladott√° v√°lt. √ân legink√°bb az eredetis√©get hi√°nyolom bel≈ële, egy√©bk√©nt j√≥l √∂ssze van rakva. A mechanizmus alapjait szerintem a Diplomacy-ban kell keresn√ºnk, csak itt van olyan parancs is, amivel hatalompontokat lehet szerezni (ami sok mindenre j√≥). De egy√©bk√©nt a t√°mad√°s, t√°mogat√°s, sz√°ll√≠t√°s, visszavonul√°s el√©gg√© hasonl√≥, mint a b≈ë 40 √©vvel kor√°bbi ≈ës√©ben... A j√°t√©kban el√©g hamar el≈ë√°llhat olyan helyzet, amikor valakinek nincs es√©lye a gy≈ëzelemre, mert a sok v√°r jelenti a gy≈ëzelem felt√©telt √©s az √∫jabb seregeknek is el≈ëfelt√©tele. Ahhoz hogy gy≈ëzzek, v√°r kellene, amit el kellene foglalni, de am√≠g nincs v√°ram, seregem se lesz t√∂bb... ciki. Ami m√©g h√°tr√°ny, hogy kicsit monotonn√° v√°lhat a j√°t√©k. De a hossza kellemes meglepet√©s, azzal riogattak n√©h√°nyan, hogy nagyon elny√∫lhat, nek√ºnk a 4 f≈ës 2 √©s f√©l √≥ra volt. M√©g egyszer mondom, nem rossz, n√©ha sz√≠vesen le√ºl√∂k vele j√°tszani, f≈ëleg hogy a sorozat tetszett, de nem √°t√ºt≈ë.
Akinek ez tetszett, az a Senjit is pr√≥b√°lja ki felt√©tlen√ºl (b√°r ott nem csak harccal lehet nyerni), meg persze a Diplomacyt.
Hallottam olyat is, hogy a Riskhez hasonl√≠tott√°k, de szerintem ennyi er≈ëvel a Shogunhoz is lehetne hasonl√≠tani, √©s az kev√©sb√© lenne degrad√°l√≥.
Egy fontos dolgot elfelejtett√ºnk a j√°t√©kunk sor√°n: egy√°ltal√°n nem t√°rgyaltunk egym√°ssal, pedig ez nincs tiltva, √©s sz√≠nt vitt volna a j√°t√©kba.

One of the few area control games I like. It is balanced, it provides control and strategy is not chaotic. Which is quite an achievement for a game that relies on diplomacy so much. It is one of the good ones. If you like area control games it is a must. Very much like the different combat cards and probably it's one of the few games that have 1 to 1 force comparison combat that I like. However I would deny another play because I think it takes up a lot of time. Ports addition are a must. You can pretend they exist and save yourself the cost of the expansion.

This is not the game for the euro gamer (which I am): has many random effects triggered by the cards, lots of direct player interaction, but also a good share of strategy needed to "ride the wave".
Anyway, the game probably deserves a 7.5 if you are into the whole Song of Ice and Fire setting (otherwise it is probably more a 6.5): who wouldn't like to play Diplomacy in the Seven Kingdoms?
Best played with 5 players. Has balancing issues with 3-4. It probably needs the first expansion's rule about ports to give Lannister any chance, as sea dominance is a fundament to victory and Greyjoy doesn't let any red ship floating after turn one...

A new take on Diplomacy.  However, unlike Diplomacy combats are not totally predictable as the antagonists play cards (representing characters from the books) to help determine the outcome of the battle.

The game also has a slight problem due to the start positions of some of the pieces (someone has probably come up with a work around).

Whatever, the game boils down to Diplomacy with chrome.

I just had to own the game that was based on my #1 fantasy series of all time. 

Little did I know it would consist of...houses bickering against each other, alliances falling as easily as they rose, blood shed everywhere, and friendships put into question?  

Enough said.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A Game of Thrones probably appeals more to gamers who enjoy making/breaking alliances with neighboring players, such as is the case in Diplomacy, Risk and/or Imperial.  Personally, I find alliances to be sort of limiting.  Maybe it was magnified by us not being able to muster any additional units until Round FIVE!  This game would be more appealing if the first deck was separated into even distributions of Supply/Muster so that the game doesn't stall.    

Anyway, I controlled House of Lannister.  I enjoyed that the Five Houses have variable powers in terms of House Cards.  I also liked the bidding for control of the Throne, Sword and Raven.  The simultaneous action selection of orders was probably my favorite feature.

[b]Storm of Swords[/b]
I really enjoyed playing with the Storm of Swords expansion.  Perhaps it was better playtested!  Anyway, I like the alternate map for 4 players, the new Westeros deck, the inclusion of leaders, the tactic cards, and the ally decks.  Once again I was House of Lannister, but in this version I didn't feel like my faction was inherently screwed by my starting board position.

[b]Clash of Kings[/b]
Played the base map again as a 6-player game with the Clash of Kings expansion.  We used the 6-player map and the Ports, but we didn't use the siege engines/fortifications, special order tokens, or the COK House cards.  This session was a little more enjoyable than my first attempt at AGAT, for we were able to muster up some troops to actually do things, but this time around we were unable to supply until round 7!  Although I would play AGAT with 5 or 6 players again, I still believe that the game would be better if the deck was separated into even distributions of supply/muster.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
After first play this game seems like a very challenging battle of wits and diplomacy.  This is not your typical dicefest wargame and if you think you can succeed without making alliances think again.  Plus, having read the novels first I can say that the game captures several of the themes perfectly.

First I was sceptic if FFG was able to pull this off. But now after eight games I have to admit that this is a wonderful 'Diplomacy-light' variant. Don't be fooled: Even without dice this has a significant luck element introduced by the cards - but this is OK for me. The whole mechanisms work like a charm.

A game disconnected from its source material, where you will most probably never see the power constellations and rivalries that take place in the books.

All in all, a rather static affair that can go on for hours.

Beautiful game.  I really enjoy the bidding, ordering, and strategy that is involved in this game.  I've only played it twice thus far, both times with four players...and both times the red player has been victorious by turn six.  I'm sure the addition of the fifth player (black) would greatly alter the red player's advantage.  I look forward to playing with a full complement soon.  Still debating if I need to put it on my wish list.

This game has a lot of rules to just shuffle two wooden blocks around a board. When you finally get some reinforcements you might have been playing for two hours already.

This was great when we first started playing it, but we noticed that if you have less than five people, the balance of the game gets thrown completely out of whack.

Also, most of our games end before the 10 turn limit because someone was able to do something sneaky through boat transport, or to take advantage of the geography in a way that nobody would notice.

One of our games even ended in 15 minutes!!

This one hasn't hit the table in a while, but I think it might return if we happen to snag exactly five people at some point.

As a fan of the books, of course I couldn't pass this one by. The main downside on this game is the difficulty of negotiating alliances in an 'open' environment where everyone can hear what you are saying. And from my limited experience, players have to have an ally (or get left totally alone) to get strong enough to win. There is a lot of scope for doing sneaky and despicable (excuse me, crafty and tactically sound) things in the game, which keeps the tension pretty high.

Good game. I do enjoy the mechanics. The thing that keeps me from rating this game higher is the level of direct conflict. It is all about direct conflict. Also, if a person does poorly early in the game they may end up being a non-factor the rest of the game. On the other hand, if I am in the right mood, the conflict is great. There are also a lot of decisions to make. Typically you have 2 or 3 enemies around you and you must choose where to put your forces and where to forge alliances.

When played as a pure wargame, I like it very much.  When played with a political angle, I'm not sure it would go over well with some people.  I have been thinking about "hidden alias" cards that are scored based on how well your secret "partner" has done at a particular point in the game.  There were more than enough hidden agends going on in the Fire & Ice series.

Just doesn't work in my group, who strongly dislikes direct, multiplayer conflicts.  The game itself is a nice melange of concepts lifted from other games which really seems to work together very well.  In a different group I might give this an 8.

After 3 plays, I have to lower my rating on this one from a 6 to a 4.  Navies are just too powerful in this game.  The fact that navies can support several adjacent armies at once, but cannot be counter-attacked by armies (nor can armies support fleets in sea battles) makes thematic sense but is very unbalanced.  Once a power (usually Greyjoy and Baratheon) has fleets in each space of their respective ocean they can daisy chain armies from one side of the continent to the other, making it impossible for non-naval powers to defend more than one coastal territory.  I am amazed at the popularity of this game despite the balance problems between the players.

A game I liked once out, but that after some plays showed to be unbalanced about Lannister position and naval rules. The expansion is extremely well made, but then the issue is the steep price increase. Could FFG produce directly an improved version and avoid treat customers in GW style with many expansions and add on to existing products?

Un magn√≠fico juego tem√°tico y de diplomacia. Recrea estupendamente las vivencias acaecidas en las tierras de Poniente que relatan los libros. Por si mismo merece un 8.

La segunda edici√≥n depura el reglamento, a√±ade conceptos de expansiones posteriores. Esto relega este y lo obsolescenta. Posiblemente no vuelva a ver mesa al disponer el grupo de varias copias de la segunda edici√≥n. Le dejaremos un 6 por los viejos tiempos, ya que sigue siendo un buen juego.

Some great mechanics that I haden't seen before, but had a couple of bad experiences where muster cards didn't show up until rounds 7 & 10.  Totally kills the game.

My first beloved (true love ;) ) game. Here you have to plan, calculate, talk, negotiate, recalculate... to finally be simply betrayed. During this game you really have to suggest people to play with this betrayal in mind - GoT should be played mainly outside the board game, then it is worth every price and every minute spent on playing. We are using 15 envelopes with letters inside (one envelope for each possible conversation, for example Lannister - Baratheon or Stark - Baratheon) and each envelope has two house shields on them. Feeling of the game with this solution is great, after the game you can read what was really going on, and check the promises made (very often you have to promise everybody, everything they want and guarantee that you are lying to everybody else, beside this one person... :] ).

After one play, a bad sign when the guy teaching you lets you know that the gross imbalance between the houses is an accepted flaw in the game.  A little too random for me, almost makes me miss twilight imperium with its huge, lumbering military build-ups.  Going to try it once more with a different group and see how it goes. *Second Play* Better than the first, but still too long, only made longer when people analyze their position to the n-th degree...

The more I play this game (with the Clash of Kings expansion) the more I want to play. The level of intrigue and diplomacy make this one of the best "war" games I have ever played. The game has minimal luck - and usually extremely managable at that. It is all about out-thinking your opponent, something which I am determined to one day finally achieve.

I like the way there are a finite number of 'opening' moves with each house, but the game always runs a different course each time you play. There is a delicate balance between the houses in play, but - as a game of skill - new players will get slaughtered by experienced groups.
If you haven't played this yet, you must get a group together and try it! (more than once, so you can give it the chance it deserves.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A 7 for the mechanics, but the long play time means it won't see the table as often.

I want to love this game, but I find I really dislike absolute number crunching - I'd much rather roll a die, rather than calculate all the numbers required to attack or defend.  I've also learned that I dislike long, 3+ hour multiplayer diplomacy games.  Give me a 2 hour multiplayer conflict game, sure.  Give me a 3+ hour 1v1 wargame, sure.  Give me a 3+ hour 6-player diplomacy game?  I might pick something else.

I want to like it, but once you hit turn 5 or so, there's a lot to analyze, made worse by the fact that everything is 100% deterministic.  Frequently, the game takes 4 hours and someone wins due to someone else not paying attention, or everyone just calls it quits.

IMPORTANT BALANCE SUGGESTIONS:  Do yourself a favor and use these:

You can make the Ports (one of the main issues, just look at the Expansion rules) yourself out of cardboard.  Very easy.  

And Pyke should not exist in a four player game.  Don't play this game with three players.

Finally the last balance change for a great AGOT experience:

You should also play with the "Subdeck" variant, as random Westeros cards are a pain.  The Subdeck variant is as follows:  Put two of each "Event" card (for Decks 1 and 2) in a subdeck.  Subdeck 1 has four event cards (two of each type) and the Last Days of Summer.  Subdeck 2 has the other remaining 5 cards.  (Two of each type, and Winter is Coming.)  Put Subdeck 1 on top.  Things are still slightly random, but each event WILL occur twice before a third comes up.

Lannister could also use an extra footman in the 5 player game, on Lannisport.

Played it once at a friends place. We were going to play the second edition with 6 players. Unfortunately the guy who owned the second edition couldn't make it, so we played this first edition with 5 people instead.

I wasn't sure whether this would be something for me, but I was VERY pleasantly surprised by it. The gameplay was amazingly intense - we were pretty much exhausted afterwards, even though the game ended already in round 7 after less than 2¬Ω hours of play. So many decisions. I played Lannister who's a at very vulnerable starting position and pretty soon everybody was at war with everybody. I managed to forge an alliance with Greyjoy to avoid getting myself in real trouble but after I had to go all in to prevent Baratheon from winning, Stark had the game for the taking and won.

A great gaming experience. Now I'm looking very much forward to trying the second edition.

Played once. Three players. 

This is not a three player game. Want to try again with more, please.

---EDIT---
Played again with 5, using the suggested altered setup. 

On the plus side, I learned that it takes a lot for me to like a long (for me, 2.5+hours) game. This game didn't have a lot for me. 

In all fairness, though, I think my problem was that everyone was unfamiliar with the rules. Maybe things would go more smoothly with at least one experienced GoT-er in the mix? Willing to give it another try under those conditions....

It is also possible (and increasingly likely in my experience) that one or more players can be put out of contention early, without actually being eliminated, forcing them to sit around bored for 2 hours...so far, this has happened to someone in every game I have played. I won't likely be playing again.

I don't play many war games, and I don't like run-away leaders and elimination games.  AGOT has a lot of limiting factors that keep people in the game and keep army sizes close, which I thought would improve the game.  But when I played the game, instead of improving it, I felt like it made the game go nowhere.  Armies seemed sluggish.  There was little movement on the board.

I thought having such an important thing as mustering your armies be completely random was lame, and I don't see why resource allotment was even needed as an event.  It really makes little sense why an army can still be taking advantage of resources a few turns to possibly many turns AFTER it has lost them simply because an event hasn't yet randomly occured.  Now, here's the kicker--the random event cards have a reshuffle event in them, so these very important parts of the game really are COMPLETELY RANDOM.

I think this game has potential, but my play of it was just BORING, and the completely random events seem to do nothing to me but remove a big chunk of skill.

Didn't much care for this one.  It's like a war game without the war.  A big part of my problem is the inability to buy more troops except for at the whim of the cards.

RATING: 8
A Game of Thrones is a wonderful game, skillfully carved to recreate the same atmosphere and feeling a reader can find in Martin‚Äôs Song of Ice and Fire: actually it has only one weakness, yet this weakness is more than enough to strip the game any fun, delight and wish to play it often.

I‚Äôm not talking about the wooden bits (plastic miniatures would have been a better choice), its endless duration or the endless downtime running between performing an action and the next one: no, what I‚Äôm referring to is that awful ¬´Risiko syndrome¬ª affecting as much A Game of Thrones as many other strategy games.

Indeed, should a player fall behind the others (and in a crowded five or - with the expansion - six player game it‚Äôs more than likely) he‚Äôs out of the run for the next of the game, no matter how hard he struggles to recover: he‚Äôs already lost and he quickly realizes he‚Äôs no longer any chance to win. 
This turns the game into a boring and frustrating waste of time for that unlucky player or two, usually the same ones who agreed on playing the game even though they ain‚Äôt too fond of the genre or familiar with its setting.

Nonetheless, the game itself is solid, carefully developed and deeply soaked in theme, which is the stuff of any good game. (December 2011)

[b]Update[/b] - After having played the second edition as well (in January 2013), I found the latter slightly better and more enjoyable than this first edition.

My multi-player epic, Diplomacy-like battle game of choice. Back stabbing is right out there, and explicit, so no hard feelings or pouting allowed. Make sure to play with the newest set of Westeros cards, lest you end up playing half the game with the starting units, as we once did. (Not fun.)

RATING: 6
Great game that takes the secret moves of Diplomacy and mixes them up with a bidding mechanic. I really appreciate the way all of the mechanics are tied together - almost evry part of the game affects almost every other part of the game. You need a wholistic strategy to win this one.

It's LOOOOONG though - expect three or four hours, the first few turns fly by but turns 7, 8, 9 and 10 are a drag.

Also, don't even try and play with less than the full complement of players - any change to the setup makes the game horrendously unbalanced. It loses points for FFG trying to sell us expansions just to play with fewer people.

Great game, under one condition, you need skilled players, otherwise the play deteriorates.  Balance issues mar the game as well.

Knocked down to seven because of balance problems with five players and stale gameplay that pivots on the mistakes of others in blocking the win.

PROS: The overall mechanics are solid and the components are gorgeous (the wooden pawns are pretty bland though). CONS: Fleet rules need fixing [the Clash of Kings expansion addresses this].

I like this game, but you must play it with good players who A) know the rules and B) play to win, not just to fill a seat. This game breaks down very quickly if players are not willing to be aggressive.

AGoT is based on the first book of George R. R. Martin's novel series. Knowledge of the series isn't necessary to play, but makes the game more enjoyable.

I reccomend A Game of Thrones, with the caveats above.

Looks like a fantastic strategy game for 4+ players.  I'd love to give it a shot.  It's on the way from FFG!

After the first couple of plays I'm intrigued by this game.  At first glance it seems simple, but then the strategy of order placement and learning to anticipate opponent's moves starts to come into play.  I see the card-based mustering as a bit of a weakness, especially with the "Winter is Coming" cards shuffling the used cards back into the Westros decks.  I'd like to play this more.

Three plays, three games where we didn't see a mustering card for the vast majority of the game.  Totally broken, there is no way that a conflict game like this should be able to stick the players with only the starting units for over HALF THE GAME.  We basically sat there calling each other nasty names for over an hour because we could not do much more than that.  I cannot see why people like this game, much less rate it so highly.  Off to the trade pile. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Two tries, two fails.  Slow.  Unbelievably slow.  Several of the players were just staring at each in disbelief about how bored we were while the remaining couple of players were somehow still engrossed in taking twenty to thirty minutes per turn.  I would have felt bad leaving the game during the middle, so I stuck it out.  There are decent ideas in the design of the game, but they were not put together in a way to encourage fun or balance.  Without being able to add troops until a random card that seems to never want to come up just draws things out further and further.

Fuedal mayhem... the houses of old... and squabling amongst the duchies.  

I really want to like game as its theme etc warms my heart.  There is something about its balance that I haven't been quite able to grasp.  The components are nice the board is lovely and the theme sucks you in.  The mechanics are simple and easy to learn.  How to bleeding win is another matter though.  Do not!! get behind on unit growth everything...EVERYTHING in this game is based on having lots of units and the being able to expend those units and still protects your resources from invasions.  

I will play this game but there is something tragically diabolic about how tedious it becomes as far as tactics etc.

Weaker houses absolutely need to form alliances with specific goals of territory and elimination of more powerful houses.(the ones with better consolidate power...(the thronesword and raven special powers are always held by the highest bidder so he who controls that and maintains that will be best at winning.

RATING: 6
Based on only one play.  Very similar to Wallenstein in the orders mechanic and development of the game (a good thing IMO).  I give it an advantage over Wallenstein in the nice supply mechanic that frustratingly limits units in each area where in Wallenstein you can stack units until the cows come home.  I also like the support and raid orders.  On the down side, the randomness of the supply and muster cards can lead to some unnecessary stagnation.  I also prefer the luck element in the battle tower compared to the perfect information in AGOT battle system.  Lastly, your starting position in AGOT can be disadvantaged whereas in Wallenstein, starting positions are relatively equal.
Have played four more times, including the new second edition rules.  Second edition fixes the mustering problem.  However, I believe supply should be tallied every round.  Most of the board is a military stalemate thanks to very limited casualties in battles.  Navies are ridiculously overpowered.  The fleet chaining is necessary due to the stalemate on land, but fleets supporting in land battles is a joke.  Also, Greyjoy seems overpowered, winning four of five games I have been in (with different players).

Played a six-player with both expansions.  Seems like fun, but just getting my head wrapped around the mechanics on the first play was hard enough.  Didn't help that it was over by turn 3.  Could be good, but it'll be hard to ever figure that out with the frequency it hits the table (which is to say, not often).

UPDATE 2/13/11: Upped to 8 after a truly epic game (5 player, 6.5 hours).  Nice balance between the houses.  Intrigue at the meta-game level.  Thoroughly enjoyable.

I've only played this once and that time I couldn't get past the combination of Diplomacy and Risk.  I think if I played it again I might do better looking at it as its own game.  With that said, the gaming group I played with had no interest in alliances (at least none that lasted more than a turn or two) and I think without alliances the game doesn't work.  So, in a different environment, I might want to play it again but with the same group of people, I'd have to pass.

I don't care for the mustering rules as it takes control away from the players. Nor do I care for the rule that allows players to view the hands of other players... it just takes up more time and reduces the risk of battle. Everything else seems fine, but just a couple of bad design decisions bring the score down.

Es un juego basado en la saga de "ciudad y hielo". Cinco familias se disputan el trono del continente de westeros.
La partida dura 10 turnos y gana quien mas ciudades/fortalezas controle (si alguien llega a controlar 7 se acaba inmediatamente). Los turnos tienen tres fases: westeros (suceden determinados eventos), planificaci√≥n (cada jugador asigna ordenes a sus tropas) y acci√≥n (se ejecutan las √≥rdenes). 
Me recuerda lejanamente al diplomacia. Interesante la mec√°nica de asignaci√≥n de √≥rdenes a las tropas. No hay muchas unidades durante la partida.
Luce con cinco jugadores, aunque se critica (y yo lo he vivido) que puede quedar alg√∫na fuera de la partida pronto.
Recomendable.

This game has some really neat mechanics going for it, but somehow they just don't mesh as tightly as I'd like, and I can't say the first expansion did much to improve that.

Only played 3 times, but my group did not enjoy this each time. I almost think we must have been doing something wrong but couldn't figure out what. The play seemed imbalanced depending on which kingdom you start with, and the game seemed to end extremely quickly. None of us have a desire to play this again, yet it wasn't the worst game I've ever played. May enjoy more if I got to play with an experienced group. Disappointing because I love the books.

Played only twice, just scratched the surface but I like it. Seems there is a lot of brain-burning, and less "diplomacy" than I thought. On the negative side, it is difficult to find a gaming group willing to play it (at least for me) and it is quite a long game (my 2 games lasted 4 hrs each). I want to play more!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not much to say. It has some nice bits, an interesting hidden action mechanic, but lacks terribly if the players do not interact with some negotiation to balance out the gameplay. This is due to some players having a better position/power than others at the beginning. It seems as if certain players are advantaged to simply avoid negotiating. I never read the books, so I don't get into the theme as much as others who like it better.

Sold at BGG.CON flee market for $7 (missing some wooden pieces from publisher).

There really is a lot to like in this game (especially if you know and love the books), but it's sadly too flawed to earn a better grade from me.  Maybe the expansion does fix it but, as it stands, the sea battles are completely broken; as Highgarden, I can cripple Stark from round one, making a 3-player game utterly unworkable.

AGoT is a conflict game and most of the genre premises apply. However, the game has a few flaws - your starting house is very important and determines your chances of success, ship rules are terrible, the map is unbalanced, and the Westeros cards feel way too random. A bit bland without expansions. One of the interesting things is the low-unit-density and the difficulty to destroy the enemy's troops.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It took several games for me to feel the love...but it's there. The theme comes through.

The big downside is that the game is not well balanced for Lannister. He's surrounded on 3 sides and gets squeezed.

Play time is variable. In one group, we get this done b/w 1.5 hours to 2.75 hours. It doesn't have to be the big marathon that some purport it to be.

Lots of interesting game mechanics. You've got unit placement and combat similar to diplomacy, but then to make it more interesting, they threw in an auction, a simple economy, random events, and power cards.
I've only played once but I can see a few glaring flaws related to the unit generation being tied to event cards. Nothing that a few rule modifications wouldn't fix.

The game looks excellent, plays a bit slow. Everyone waits to be able to bid on areas of influence. In our last game it happened only once (turn 5). If you take the raven and the throne, you are way ahead of the rest. You can only lose if the other players team up against you.

I think the combat system is awful.  Some of the positions are obviously more powerful than others.  The rule that when you eliminate someone, the game ends nearly ruins the chance certain starting positions have.  An unbalanced game that apparently needed an expansion to fix everything wrong with it.  I think people are enamored with the books, and thus the grossly inflated rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice mechanics, I especially like the handling of naval forces and support, which gives you a lot of tactical options. However, it is easy to loose the game in the first two rounds. Even more problematic is that in order to keep the game accessible you can only take a limited number of military actions each round, independently of the total size of your force. That means that it is almost impossible to fight on more than one front at once, even if you are stronger than the combined opposition. Therefore, diplomatic skills in avoiding alliances against you is in the end more important than battle tactics.

So close ... an interesting, valiant attempt but ultimately flawed by the undue amount of randomness in the Westros cards and the end-of-the-world kingmaking problem.

[10/10/05]

Being  a great DIPLOMACY afficionado, I was eager to have a go at AGOT - essentially a rules & map variant of the aforementioned classic.

While I appreciate the sheer elegance, strategic depth and psychological finesse of DIPLOMACY, I am happy to also play a negotiation game which does not rival the game in these respects.

AGOT is not a "purist" Diplomacy variant. That is to say, it adds a good dose of luck. I personally find the means of conflict resolution really interesting. Instead of the deterministic manner of resolution, the cards etc add a nice sort of uncertainty. Both systems work very nicely and I happen to like them both. Here, in AGOT one is to no little degree the "maker of one's own luck". 

However, the luck factor is simply out of control in regards to the Westeros cards. In our game the first auction occurred IIRC in the 8th round. This can entirely screw players - as do other cards not appearing. I believe the game should have allowed for more control and/or predictability.

As a student of Diplomacy variants, I am also wary of the balance of the various powers. I suppose the designer sought to make all powers equal. I fear he's missed the mark.

Further, fleets are given a too dominant role. Certainly, the port rule from the Clash of Kings expansions is a mandatory fix. Evidence of the game lacking in polish and balance out of the box.

I personally would have also included "ocean" spaces, i.e. sea spaces connecting the the sea spaces already present. Three big ones roughly one each for the three maritime sides of the board would have been nice and made the action more fluid and navies less able to seal off whole areas. Furthermore, that would edge powers presently far away from each other, closer together. This would encourage greater interaction (and paranoia). The geopolitics of AGOT would thus be more interesting (if not anywhere to the extent of DIPLOMACY).

Bottom line: A fine game, but not without its issues. Certainly could have done with some more analysis by Diplomacy variant design experts. But then playtesting and polish isn't the forte of Petersen. See Twilight Imperium and it's evolution.

No classic and nowhere close to the grandeur of Diplomacy. But then, hey, few games - if any - measure up to that momentous standard. 

A good game for those "afraid" of Diplomacy. Arguably also shorter. And suits five players.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Rating based on two 5 players games with both expansions but I was highly impressed. This could be a 10 with more plays.

Excellent heavy multiplayer game that plays in about 5-6 hours. It's essentially Diplomacy on steriods but I'd choose this over Diplomacy.

A couple of notes from experienced players: I'm told the expansions are required to make this playable. I'm also told by fans of the books that the theme works quite well but familiarity with the books is not required.

This is seriously what games are made of.  One of my favorite mechanics in any game is traitors/secret identity/lies/betrayal/etc.  This game matches that with one of my favorite books/themes of all times.  Every aspect of the theme ties into the game perfectly.  Even though many of my friends have not read the books I find that they love the game and can easily get sucked into the theme of the game.  I cannot wait to play this each and every time I can.

RATING: 2
An extremely long game that doesn't go anywhere (at least it does a really good job of mimicking the source material in that respect). You never seem to roam very far from your fixed starting positions (which are definitely unbalanced) due to the pointless and stupid supply limits. The battles are very dry since they can be perfectly calculated as soon as the orders are revealed. Poor game. 

A lifetime of playing games, and I still think of this as the worst gaming experience of my life.

Some nice ideas in this game. Had 2 plays of  this game. One was quite fun, the other was really odd,.. the game ended, because one player who didn't seem to have any chance to win the game ceased to attack the leading one just because he didn't saw any point to play on and on without hope to win. Game ended after 1 1/2h while most of the other players weren't involved in the game. This game dropped my rating considerably.

I bought this to replace antiussentiments cheese filled version (don't play 6 hour games and serve cheese and crackers) .... A good game but waaaaay too long for my liking. I've never read the books (and I'm not about to) so the theme is "meh" as far as I am concerned. 

*Edit* - I've read the books now and I'm interested in getting this back to the table.

*Edit* - Just ordered the second edition. Always thought the game needed ports, but didn't want to invest in the expansions (I hate the fact that you need expansions to make FF games work ... I'm looking at you TI3). Oddly I'm happier to buy a second complete copy of the game than buy an expansion.

RATING: 4
Faithful adaption of book to boardgame. Three plays with 5 players. The mechanics of the king's council (Iron Throne, sword and crow) are clever. Some factions start almost surrounded so there can be a tendency to turtle. Making some form of alliance would seem to be vital in order to expand your territories but there are no rules governing alliances. The winner is essentially decided by who picks on who which I think is this game's biggest problem. This game has no catch-up mechanic but it is left to the players to self-balance the occupied castles and to collectively reign in the leader whilst quietly positioning themselves for the win. 

Rated 5 with the Clash of Kings expansion which includes such things as ports which are necessary to fix this under-playtested game. Two plays with 6 players.

RATING: 4
A game where a player can be locked out of actions is not a fun game. Having been opposed by one player from the start of the game I was hugely limited in my ability to do anything at the bottom of the map. Once in a bad position--which happened from the onset--there was nothing that could be done and it was very unsatisfying.

I would play this game again, but it was very unbalanced. I owned the game, but sold it. I found out later about the fixes to make the balance better. I think that this game has a lot of potential and is probably better with the expansions. I would play this game again if someone brought it over. I think it is a fun game, but not my favorite. I also don't like the fact that you really need 5 players. That is hard for me. Sometimes I have 3, sometimes I have 6, sometimes we have 4 or 5. this game really does require th full 5 players and that makes it a game that will not get played at my house.

RATING: 8
GoT is one of my favourite area control/Risk-like games.  Playing actions face-down promotes bluffing, table-talk, and the ability to predict players' actions.  The three influence tracks add variety, and the asymmetry of each player's starting position makes for interesting gameplay.

The combat mechanic of army strength + a card from your hand means that you can lose, despite having a larger force if your card is poor.  Planning when to use your high-value cards and when to use lower-value ones is very important.  Tracking what cards your opponents have used allows you to plan when to attack with the highest probability of success.

The political intrigue of A Song of Ice and Fire is well-realized in this game.  Overall this is a very well-designed game with only a few slight problems:

1- Without harbours (a feature in one of the expansions, later added to the second edition) it is VERY easy for a single boat to cripple an entire player's navy and prevent them from ever rebuilding it.  Baratheon and Greyjoy players frequently park single ships in most sea areas, allowing them to hold the entire coastline uncontested.

2- Infrequent/irregular opportunites to build forces can stagnate the combat element of the game.

This is essentially a more complicated variant of Diplomacy.  We generally didn't allow private conversations, so I guess it's more akin to Gunboat Diplomacy.  
For fans of the books there is a lot of theme here.  Unfortunately the game is a bit too long and it's hard for me to get this on the table.  Also, without the first expansion the possibility of being cut off from the sea is very annoying.  
Other than that, it's a great game with uneven starting positions and lots of things to consider besides the actual combat.

Essentially a jazzed up fantasy Diplomacy for five people. Our experiences with the four player game have been poor; five players are preferable but we find Tyrell to be a lame duck. Most enjoyable aspect is the diplomacy and backstabbing. The game can drag if you get a muster and an auction in one turn, and the final turn tends to see a lot of 'grab what you can and damn the consequences' silliness, but these are minor demerits. More serious, for me at any rate, is the predictability of the game; by this I do not refer to predictable strategies (the only prediction I will make is that alliances will dissolve), but to the unfortunate fact that our games always look rather similar as we enter the last few turns.

Some interesting mechanisms. I like the "bid for influence / reevaluate supply only when an event card comes up for it" aspect, which adds tension to the game.  Seems to be influenced by Diplomacy in some ways -simultaneous orders (but unlike Diplomacy, not simultaneous order resolution); support orders; convoys (though ships don't have to be ordered to convoy, they just have to be there); and the fact that you're never bound by agreements you make. But it's by no means a Diplomacy clone.

I'm learning that I really like games that are like Diplomacy but that aren't... well... Diplomacy! Gimme a multiplayer game with dudes on a map, area control, etc. and I'm generally happy. So, I was pre-disposed to liking A Game of Thrones, along with Senji, Shogun, and oddly enough Dominant Species. They all have their strengths, and I'll play any of them.

With A Game of Thrones, I'm most intrigued by a very deterministic system for combat. That, more than any of the other titles I mentioned, feels closest to Diplomacy. But I also really enjoy the auctioning off of combat strength, turn order, and order flexibility. Very cool system, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of fluff. My only knock is that the randomness of the event cards can sometimes throw you for a loop, and it's odd to claim a region and have to wait a couple of turns to actually reap its benefits. Still, the decks may make each game unique.

And lastly, wooden bits? No combat dice? Steamlined set of rules? Who'd a thunk that this was a Fantasy Flight game!

One of my favorite games. I played it BEFORE I had even heard of the books, and liked it so much, I bought the books.  Good balance of diplomacy (temporary alliances), skill (troop placement and orders), resource management (house cards and influence), and randomness (random events).

Many knock it here on The Geek, I feel it is filled with tension and there is a high level of possible wronking.  GoT has very brilliant mechanics involved the best is the secret order placement.  You just never know what your so called "friend" has placed.  

Is it worth my 9 rating...? Yes! For the game play experiences and subtle tension filled mechanics.  Great game!  I must confess, GoT does have a few faults.. Great game anyway.

RATING: 7.3
Great game if you have at least 4 players.  Light game.  Best if played with people who know or have read the books.  This game is like a combination of diplomacy and risk.  A really, really fun game for introducing players to boardgames.  Since I'm addicted to George R.R. Martin's series, this game is tops.  Really.

RATING: 8
A great, basically revised version of Diplomacy, with alot more rule conventions and fun thrown in, so that it doesn't rely on just long talks with other players followed by short bouts of back-stabbing. That said, I have a very difficult time getting four - five other players together to play, which is needed for the game to really shine, so I traded it away.

I am a fan of the books but must say that, at the end of the day, the game didn¬¥t convince me. Components are nice, the war game mechanics are clever but unfortunately the game is reduced to a whining party like "Why do you go after me, don¬¥t you see, that he is a lot stronger!!" and so on. Nevertheless, I am still ready to give it another chance, but it relies on the expansions...

Love it. Want the second edition. Actually manage to win a fair number of our games. And now that I actually know the books and HBO series, I'm sure it'd be all the more enjoyable. Oddly enough, this was my first introduction into the Game of Thrones universe.

As for the mechanics, the forced alliances (well, forced in that if you don't make them, you are screwed) are fun as inevitably someone will have to turn on the other or lose. The secret bids and wildling attacks add additional layers. I just love this game.

Played one game. Only one person had played the game previously, many years ago. I expected to like it more but to be fair, we had time constraints and were all learning the game as well. Turns were slow and we caught ourselves many times forgetting rules or figuring them out. I played House Tyrell and was UTTERLY DESTROYED. Now that the game is over, I think I can see the scope and numerous possibilities but I do not think I would buy this game. Too difficult and too long. It may have been because we were all new but negociations were few. This was an all out war.

RATING: 7
Played once. I made a few egregious errors and was out of the game early. I like the combat system and the way the orders work. The bidding for different favors eluded me as to its importance. I'm still not sure I have a feel for how much that is worth. All the comments indicate there is some great balance and fun diplomacy packed in there...but so far I have to take folks at their word on that. I'm looking forward to playing again.

An interesting game with no dice.

There's bluffing, guessing, and random draws.

I would have liked to play this a little more, but sometimes it's hard to get 3 players availible at the same time.  

I like how it was all unknown, and you're trying to guess what everyones doing, until revealed.

Very interesting game.

I enjoyed the first half of the game, then it dragged on.  It's a great game, very strategic, but I don't particularly enjoy the bidding mechanic, and this game highly revolves around it, unlike say, Shogun, where advantages will help you, but not give a huge advantage.

I'd play this game again simply because it is so strategic, but the full game is long and repetitive enough to deter me.

*Homemade Version

Broken Game. The randomness of the event deck can make some game a total pain. My last game had 9 supply and no muster in a row. I have tried many variants to fix it, but it still boils down to the same thing.

I wont mind if it is a short game. but when it last for 4 hours and so much hinges on the luck of the event, I dont see this ever tabling again.

Condenmed. Fundamental flaws in the way randomness is forced in the design.

The other mechanics are very cool though. loved it the first time i played. but hated it the next 3 times. such a pity.

rating of 2 is following BGG's guideline of "will never play this game".

Mechanics wise, ignoring the problems about, i rate it 8. but the problem killed the game for me.

RATING: 2
Oh, dear, what a mess!  Did anyone actually playtest this game?  It desperately wants to be a euro-wargame, but totally drops the ball with horribly uneven factions, overpowered ships, and the total randomness of the Westeros cards that make any longer term planning impossible.  I've heard that many of the problems are corrected in the first expansion, but I don't think you should have to buy an expansion to fix a game.  Dreadful.

After playing this for a couple of years now, most of my excitement has really waned on Game of Thrones...the system is probably a little too limiting for a game of its scope and frankly I'd rather play Warrior Knights in its place.  Still, it's got some good things going on and it works together really well but I just don't feel moved to play it much anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Yet to play with more opponents.  Hard to judge after just a three player session.  Clearly not a three player game.  From my experiences with multiplayer war/euro hybrids, I don't think I'm going to like this one a ton.

October 2010:  I'm enjoying Shogun and The End of the Triumvirate more now, so maybe I'll like this one when I finally play it with five.

RATING: 9
I love this game.  It isn't the most balanced, but it has just the right amount of strategy to make it a blast to play with 4 or 5 players.  I like the amount of player interaction required, I love the Westeros card mechanic, I like laying down orders for my units, and I like bidding for influence.  I really can't find a whole lot to complain about here, other than it takes a long time to explain even though the rules make a lot of sense. Currently my favorite strategy/wargame.

I'd like to play this with the full contingent of five, and then rate it, but even playing with four, I got a great sense of the game.  I really enjoyed this.  A great job of melding the mechanics and the story.  Of course, nothing can quite match the novels, because a) they're really focused on the individual characters, and the game doesn't and b) the three books thus far are far and away the best the genre has to offer.  This game is still outstanding though.

A very good mix of an diplomacy, war and auction!Unlike many war games it is not scripted and players who have almost been wiped out have good chance to recover. :)  

I have played the game only with Tyrell and Greyjoy switch (the official optional rule) and Westeros Card Pack fix (by BloodyJack in the article 'Game of Thrones, A :: Fix of Westeros Card Issues')

I also have Clash of Kings and Storm of Swords expansions. With the expansions I would rate the game 9.

Fun combat game with no luck involved in the combat system.  Curiously though, you can only muster new pieces or change turn order through luck (the draw of a card allowing those events).  Didn't hamper my enjoyment of the game ... at least not the first time.  Would definitely play again.

Update: Very curious to try the game again not that I'm a Game of Thrones Fanboy (having since read the books and watched the series).

Diplomacy on steroids, but you can finish in one sitting, and is still great fun even without the private negotations, which make Diplomacy too tedious for me. Bumping down from a 10 to a 9 (update: 8.5, not seeing any more table time). The simulatenous card selection mechanic is getting a little tired. I like the 1st expansion, but haven't tried the second, and have no intention to. This game doesn't need any more "stuff".

[b]General initial comment:[/b]
Need to play again ASAP. Note that the Greyjoy should start at the the lowest position on the initial King's Court track contrary to their House Start Card (and contrary also to the Tyrell's card, these two should be switched--Errata). The ports from ACoK expansion are mandatory. The siege engines/fortifications seem like a good idea for experienced players (have not tried this ... also, am not an experienced player). The alternate rules for the Westeros deck seem very playable, but have not tried them.
[b]Comments on Game Play:[/b]
TBA.
[b]Comparison to Diplomacy:[/b]
I think, that after 1 play, this game has eliminated any desire for me to actually [i]organize[/i] (note, not play) a game of Dilomacy. This game is shorter, has more challenging decisions, doesn't require as much space, has a more impressive (though ignorable) thematic experience, and seems easier to talk people into.
[b]Final notes:[/b]
Suffers from the same whiny little bi*ch complaints that Diplomacy suffers from, so choose players with some care.

All 6 player games will be logged under ACoK

The mechanics are interesting, but relying on "everyone gang up on the guy with the strongest start position!" for game balance is kinda sloppy.

RATING: 6
A Game of Thrones (AGoT) is one of those games which would be a better game if it were played more often. Other games which fall into this category are: Die Macher, Silverton, Fury of Dracula, and Arkham Horror. If some GRAB members could set aside a night for these games once a week we'd enjoy them more. Too many rules, tactics and strategies are forgotten between games. This game improves with each play. Focusing on one enemy at a time seems the best course of action. Do not be fearfully of player elimination. House Stark, which I have played twice, is powerful, but needs to gain supplies as quickly as possible.

You need the right type of people.  I played today for the first time and really enjoyed it.  But the number of people that I could play this with and have fun is very low.  Basically people that are going to take the backstabbing in good nature and realize that it is just a game (just like Diplomacy), and also those that aren't going to play kingmaker.  If you have people that fall into the first two categories, run away from this game.  They are going to suck the fun and excitement out of the game.  The game could also suffer from AP, but after a few plays it should be fairly straight forward and it should only take a couple of hours at the most.

Math trade April 2008.  Played once prior and enjoyed it.  

Many complain about the limitation and luck of the cards or the importance of boat travel.  There are variants posted to minimize their affects.

Modified boat movement rules is a must.

May try to pick up the expansions someday.  Waiting for a good deal/trade though.

Just did not "get" this game. Plus, the theme seemed ridiculous, like a badly-written soap-opera fantasy. The text all suffered from a superfluous preponderance of the letter "y" ("Yronwood", "Redwyne Straights", etc.), the hallmark of lazy writers who *think* they're writing in old English style but who actually just haven't studied the language enough.

Yes, this, on top of the soap-opera art on the character cards, interfered with our perception of the game. So sue me!

My first game of this was more or less a disaster.  I played with four (not the ideal number) one of whom was slow, clearly didn't get it, and ended up throwing the game to someone else.  I'd definitely like to try it again, but I kind of think it is not exactly my type of game.  I'm interested in the expansion, in which the cards are more important, but since I'm not interested in any other elements of the expansion, I probably won't get it.

Brilliant game, highly recommended. The card system the game uses for combat means it won't be a game you'll lose because of poor dice rolling. Simple but effective.

We've also found that the game is a good mix between strategy and politics. You'll need allies to win, but at some stage you'll need to break that alliance.

Overall it's a good game, and integration to the story is quite good. But the main gripe for me (and quite fatal) is the event card. Especially Mustering. I think I wouldn't have a problem if the events just some kind of outside force affecting your government. But not to be able to recruit people (even when you are rich) and need to wait the stupid event is just downright ridiculous.

Components: Nice wooden pawns, colorful artwork on the cards and board, and a great box insert.

Experience: Way, way, WAY too long. I don't care for this type of aggressive territory-control game. I think there are many useful mechanisms woven into the game play, but the overall progression of the game was a struggle not with my opponents, but to stay interested.

RATING: 7.5
Update: I think I get worse at this game every time I play. Starting to get annoyed with the combat cards - it's too important that you know exactly what cards an opponent has available in a combat. It bogs down the game, and really kills the surprise involved in playing the cards. I'd prefer some situation where there's more randomness rather than the same decks, or getting rid of any cards with special abilities.

Original comment: A fun game. A great deal of chaos arises from the Westeros cards, and the timing of Supply, Muster, and the Clash of Kings can make planning and strategy difficult, and has perhaps too strong an influence on the outcome. You also have to be really careful about players being allowed to run free for a couple of turns without challenge - if one player is left alone for even a short while, it's very likely they will win. Since all players cannot readily challenge all players if they're already in a struggle elsewhere, alliances are important.

Downside: this game can really get bogged down by slow players. With good players, it's a 3-4 hour game. With slow players, it can go on...and on... and on...

Well hrmm.  I&#039;m not sure that the rating is a good objective measurement of the game&#039;s quality.  The system works well.  The combat seemed pretty sensible.   We certainly spent time afterwards discussing the game.  But BGG ratings are subjective.  Direct conflict games aren&#039;t my cup of tea.  If they were, this game would rate higher.  As it is, I&#039;ll play if others were really excited about it, but I can&#039;t see it ever being my first choice.

I enjoyed it very much the 4 times I played. The mechanics and theme blend very well together. Sadly, a friend sold it, because it takes 4 hours to play :(

The more I play Game of Thrones the more I'm coming around to it. All negotiations need to be made at the table, though.  Too many sidebars and the game drags down like you wouldn't believe.  Place your markers and get on with it!  Everyone is going to backstab everyone else at some point, so be prepared.

Love the simultaneous action planning and how it all resolves.  Not crazy about combat but it gets the job done, although it is easy to over analyze what card to play.

Fun game good mechanics for turns the wildlings attack seem quite inconsequential. SHould play a game with 5 players.

Most of my plays are with the second edition. Both editions are fun, but very long. Don't play with thin-skinned people, or with those who are afraid to attack.

Un buen juego, lo tiene todo, las mec√°nicas est√°n muy bien, es un juego muy vistoso, y no es muy largo de jugar ... sin embargo tiene algo que no s√© explicar ... no me termina de gustar, aunque siempre estoy dispuesto a probarlo de nuevo.

Just got it for half price! I love the books and multi-player wargames are my favorite, so I expect this to be a big hit. Will rate upon playing!

*update 4/24/2010* - just played our first game - wow! This game rocks, with great tension and balance while being very easy to play mechanically. The only thing that will make it better will be when we incorporate the battle card variant from "Clash of Kings" into the battle resolution, in order to add an element of uncertainty to the outcomes of battles.

War game with armies, heroes, fights, deals and traitors. Usually takes quite a long time to play and even to learn.

RATING: 6
Takes forever to play, especially with all the bargaining and alliance proposing/breaking that goes on. Units are scarce, so most turns a player won't be doing much of anything interesting. 

Still, can be fun when you're in the mood for a long, treacherous strategy game.

A solid light wargame that to me is somewhat reminiscent of Diplomacy, except without the secrecy in negotiation.

I think this is my favorite war game. I love the limitedness of the troops because of supply. I also love the politics. Soooo good.

Perhaps my all time favorite game.  Diplomacy is a close second, and they're similiar games.  
Play count not accurate, because I forgot to log a lot of them.

RATING: 5
The deterministic (wannabe) Wargame.
Almost no randomness in battle resolution, but way too much chaos in the action phase (Westeros deck).
Somehow unbalanced and not completely satisfying.

I'd rather play Wallenstein instead.

A favourite of our group (I'm looking at you Dave).  Gets a play every time we get together and the backstabbing is rampant.  This rating probably wouldn't be the same with a different group who might be more interested in just winning as opposed to trying to screw whoever is in the lead.
My only beef (keeping it from a 10) is the randomness of the events that might prevent seeing a single muster action for the whole game.

I have a very short list of games that come close to AGOT with regard to replayability. The card driven games Path of Glory and Barbarossa to Berlin and the boardgame Age of Renaissance. Age gets a 10 and the other two a 9. Why at first the game appears to be inbalanced but as with Age there is an experience requirement for players to see through this, when this happens usually a "whoa" is the result as really all houses can play the game of thrones... and win. There's a learning curve and there is the fact that you simply have to negotiate and that you have to give in every now and then (or at least appear to give in...).

RATING: 8
Very clever multiplayer fantasy conquest game.  Can take a few hours, but has a clear endpoint.  Also, the order token mechanic is far superior to the written order mechanics from the games that inspired it.  Great flavor, too, especially if you're a fan of the books.

RATING: 5
I thought it was a decent blend of [i]Kingmaker[/i] and [i]Diplomacy[/i], but it just didn't fly over well with the people I played with, so I ended up trading it. Not without issues (ports mainly), and it is a little dry, though the expansions help. I would play again, though, from time to time. The complaints about "luck" in this game from the euro crowd are absurd and should be ignored IMO.

Update: Wow, what the hell is up with the prices on this thing? Seriously people, it just ain't worth it. Besides, with the TV show out now I'd be shocked if FFG didn't reprint the game. Sell now, get three or four games for the money, then buy the reprint and laugh.

[EDIT: Oh, look, they reprinted it [i]with[/i] the expansions. You weren't a sucker, were you? I hope not.]

My only play with this game, I started off on my first turn with some real bad moves that left me behind and unable to compete - a position that I soon realized that I would never be able to recover from.

Had this game rated a 6 but have bumped it down as I have little desire to play it any longer.

Thought it was interesting, but this game is basically diplomacy with window dressing.  I like bidding part, but there's not much to the tactics...it's all diplomacy.  Like the boardgame Diplomacy, you can't really defend everywhere and attack.  You have to rely on deals w/other players, and hope they don't backstab you.  Further, if you stretch yourself thin, hoping for a muster...and it doesn't show up...you are done in.  Lastly, like diplomacy, you can sometimes be all but eliminated...hanging on by a thread, but unable to really make a comeback.  In my first 6er play, Lannister was eliminated in the first few turns (a common occurence from what I've read).  I finished off his last unit at his request (when I should have attacked elsewhere)...so that he could get in a game at another table.  So if these elements sound like positives, you are going to love this game.  If they bother you, you may want to look for a different game.

RATING: 7
Players represent one of the royal houses from a novel, and navigate their forces through several turns trying to conquer valuable areas of the game board.  A dressed up variant of Diplomacy, with written orders replaced by nice "order chits" that are dropped on your forces during your turn.  Lots of good stuff in here, all easy to digest yet still gives you plenty to think about.  Only played one game, can see the potential, but got hammered by two opponents at once - that ended any chance I had in the game.  Need to play again.

RATING: 5
Enh.  Just a little too much going on for me to enjoy it.  Not enough like Wallenstein like I was expecting-- there's a big difference between assigned orders and programmed orders.  I'm glad I tried it, I'd play it again if asked (with the right crowd), but I probably won't request it again any time soon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good solution to the old writing orders problem of diplomacy. Otherwise not the game it could be due to the fully transparant goal. I think a system that makes it less clear who is going to win could make this a great game.... 
Just an idea:
Perhaps it is just a matter of giving the strategy cards a point value. Each time someone plays a card against you, you keep that card. Add the cards you have left at the end of the game and add them to the cards you earned and than add the other points. The points in the cards should be about 20 percent of the total.

There's lots of neat Euro bells and whistles here: diceless combat, blind auctions, card management and more. It was good attempt to update moldy old wargames. But these epic "empires" lack strategy: the game plays you into reactive and tactical responses. Long-term strategy is not feasible due to the lame "Westernos" cards. And at the end of the day it boils down to a zero-sum game of bickering over who wins, so the game hinges on alliances... yet there is no structure whatsoever to govern the alliances! Playing this has made me appreciate the qualities of AH's Dune.

Another fun game that takes way too long. One of my friends, who was essentially eliminated after the first hour, suffered an excruciatingly slow death over the next three hours before the game ended.

Very engaging and fun.  So many options on each turn.  I did not battle very much during the game and yet I felt like I was in a life and death struggle the whole game.

RATING: 6
I've played this a handful of times.  Can't say I'm honestly a fan of either the game or books it's based off of, but it manages to be a decent experience despite this.  It's all about positioning and deal-making, while planning for what might come out of the event decks.  You have to balance building up your reserves of the game's currency with denying it to your enemies.  Castles are vital spawn points, but you won't get very far without a supply base that will support a large army.  There are a lot of limitations on what you can do, since there are only so many order tokens you can place.  
Because of this, it kind of feels like it takes a lot longer than it should.  But, planning all your orders is tricky, and resolving them in turn order (which fluctuates) isn't quick either.  Even though it's simple, it's also time-consuming.  

My big complaints are the combat and the rich-get-richer problem.  If your neighbors decide to make an alliance and carve up your territory, you pretty much have no chance to stop them.  Maybe if you're lucky, you can secure an alliance with someone else nearby, but if you're back in a corner, that may be too little, too late.  And the other players might well be too busy with their own problems to 'help' you, even opportunistically.  
The combat system of fixed values with secretly committed leaders sounds good, and it can be.  But, if people are being cagey about getting into combat, then it can be very boring.  If you and your opponent are the only ones fighting, and you both have full hands, then you know exactly what he could play.  Now, there's still some bluff here.  You'll get into situations where your only chance to win is to play your highest-power leader.  But, your opponent knows this, so he just has to play his highest to stop you.  But, you could fake him out by playing a low one and losing purposefully, but he knows that, and can destroy your troops if you do..  
I've decided after playing several games like this that I hate deterministic combat.  Won't go into specifically why, but in this game If your opponent is better-positioned &/or has more forces, he can steamroll you and there's nothing you can do about it.  Worse, you can't even cost him anything for stealing your territory, since there's no attrition.  That's what really hurts my enjoyment of the game.

Innovative game system with simultaneous-planning and auction mechanisms.  Good simple supply rules and  closed-fist, quicker/more-interactive auctions (blind bidding).  Not sure about the balance of the game; e.g., green and esp. white rarely do well.   Ships seem incredibly powerful, with the ability to support all the territories around them every turn, i.e, almost a whole coastline, since sea zones are huge.  And, as in most free-for-all multiplayer wargames, the game outcome seems mostly determined by what alliances are made rather than individual strategy.

RATING: 8
A game of political infighting and skullduggery that reflects the tone of the books.  Heavily based on Diplomacy but with a political overlay and combat system that means you are constantly vying for influence at court to give you success on the battlefield.  As with all such games, it is never possible to do everything that you want so some hard choices have to be met, often forcing you into making deals with neighbours and enemies, none of which are likely to stand the test of time so you need to be constantly on the look out for the inevitable back stab.  Great fun, but bad for the nerves :o)

Enjoyed my first game. A Game of Thrones can be an elimination game, which for some could suck. A game can last a couple of hours (3-5 hours). Some people compare it to Wallenstein. Need to play it more often to see if the starting positions are balanced or not.

Battles has very little random. Cards are more random in this game with a touch of chaos.


I would want another play to get a better understanding of the rules and stuff.

RATING: 5
Based on one play:
While I enjoyed elements of the game, I didn't think that AGOT really ever gelled for me. Once one player got ahead, he stayed there. The randomness of the Muster card meant that we couldn't rely on new troops, and we ended up largely deadlocked, waiting for the victory condition to be invoked.

Here's a suggestion: If you want to play a five or six player game based on a book that's much better, play DUNE. Dune has many of the same mechanics, but a come-from-behind victory is very possible in Dune, and seemed not possible in our game of AGOT.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Update ~ with several more plays under my belt I'm upgrading my rating. The muster cards do tend to restrict aggression or at least restrict your options. I am getting a better feel for the way this game plays and I like it even more now.

I have only played this once and I really enjoyed the unique play and the excellent components. Unfortunately the weak link in this game seemed to be the fact that without recruitment cards appearing your forces dwindled to a non-effective level. That's exactly what happened in our session.. not enough of the right cards came up for any real military action. And if you've read the Game of Thrones books you'll see why this disappointed us. The card situation created a similar feeling to what I used to get playing MTG when I never seemed to draw enough mana to fight. We'll play again and see if this was a fluke.

The tracks are an elegant way to simulate power and the game seems sufficiently balanced.  Some of the rules in the second edition I've heard seem to really iron out the wrinkles, such as the ports.  So I'd like to get that second edition.

All the poor elements of Diplomacy: unbalance starting positions, beat on the weakest, player elimination, hurt feelings, endless retorts to what is the best move, and poor play by one player having a compounded detrimental effect on the outcome. On top of that they add tons of chrome which ruins the simplicity of the Dip system. The action allocation system is fiddly, and the event card system pretty much makes long term planning irrelevant. All of which is okay in a short, light game but unacceptable in 3  hour one. Throne is similar to Wallenstein, a game which plays in 1.5 - 2 hrs, is much more fun to play, and costs about the same. I would rate this lower except there is a level of 'smarts' needed to play throne well, which doesn't exist in the nonsense I rate lower. Just not worth the time to play.

After one play: I lost a 4-player game as Lannister.  While Lannister has perhaps the best starting position due to his proximity to several cities and strongholds, he needs to move quickly for the win or, as I discovered, succumb to pressure from too many fronts.  The secret order mechanic reminds me of [gameid=3307], although this is far more conquest-oriented (which makes Wallenstein, in my view, the better game).  This is badly in need of player screens.  It's a pain picking through tokens looking for the desired order.  Sold.   0-1

2017-06-19 : We played this a couple of times as a 5-player game when it first got released. The problem we had with it back then was that as a 5-player game it took too long and with less players the map wasn't balanced, so it gathered dust on the shelf for over a decade. But just today I discovered a fan-made 4-player map in the files section together with a fix for the port problem and I feel like giving this another try.

Love the hidden order / movement mechanic.  Love the different phases of the game.  Love all the checks and balances.  Love the balance between strategy and the social aspect of the game.

I have a love of all things related to the George R.R. Martin book series 'A Song of Ice and Fire', and so I naturally decided to buy this and try it.  I fell in love after the first game and played it many times.  In fact, this is the board game that made me interested in board games as a hobby.  

In game of thrones you have map with various regions which you will try to control, often through conflict with your knights and footmen. In each of these regions, there will be a number of icons which give the controlling player a benefit. The ocean is also segregated like the regions and people will fight naval combat to control these areas since the naval units can assist coastal land battles and increase the mobility of land units.

The most interesting part of the game is when it comes to placing orders for your units (move/attack, get power, support adj regions, defense, raids: destroy power/support commands). All players place orders (card board tokens) face down simultaneously which hides your selected order from your opponents. After everyone has laid all of their orders they are all revealed simultaneously and executed in player order (which will change throughout the game). It's very fun trying to anticipate what opponents will do. Throughout the game you will get power tokens which will allow you to bid on area of influence (player order, combat superiority, and special orders) as well as you can leave these power tokens behind in regions to maintain control without having units there.

Combat is fun in that there is no dice-rolling randomness (I'm scowling at you Risk and WotR). You compare combat values of your units (footman is a value of 1, knights are 2, boats are 1) and your opponents units. These values can be altered by any supporting units in adjacent regions (which could be yours, your opponents, or another players altogether... negotiating and backstabbing makes things interesting) and then each person selects one of their combat cards from their hand of cards which adds combat value and typically a special ability. Losing combat doesn't always mean you will lose units either which is part of the strategy... maybe trying to get opponents to use all of his good cards and then strike decisively.

The game has a set number of rounds. You win by controlling the most regions with city/town icons. If you attain a specific number you can automatically win right there and then. This usually happens in my experience.

Simply a fantastic game based on a fantastic series of books called 'A Song of Ice and Fire' by George R.R. Martin. You in no way need to read any of the books to get enjoyment out of the game.

There are a few gripes about the game, the first is that it's never certain when you're actually going to be able to make new units since at the beginning of every round except the first you resolve 3 random card actions that affect everyone. In the first set of cards there could be: make new units, adj army sizes/capacity based on supply, and bidding on the 3 area of influence. I personally don't mind this but it has agitated others.

The second is that the game truly shines with the maximum number of players: 5. If you have less than that I would recommend getting the Storm of Swords expansion and play that with 4 players, or to play another game entirely. Five players only for the base game is a legitimate complaint.

There are 2 expansions to the game, one that allows a 4 player game on a different board with a lot of new game mechanisms (some are compatible with the base game, some are only for the new board), and another that allows up to 6 players on the original board slightly altered with a map overlay. There are also numerous options in both expansions that are optional.

RATING: 8
I have only played this twice so far, but my group has enjoyed it both times very much.  Our only problem has been the lack of satisfaction in the combat system.  Only rarely does a huge combat do so much as kill a single troop, it gets frustrating just displacing your enemies around and never really accomplishing much.  Aside from that, very slick.  I think we have a new house rule where every character has an additional sword on their card.

RATING: 8
Only play it with wargamers! Rating went down a little after repeated play, as the balancing problem with Lannister never seems really solved, even with the new rules. But as an improvement on "Diplomacy" roots this game works very well, and the transition of book to game has been handled wonderfully, with beautiful graphics that capture the mood of the (great!) books. This could become (after some tweaking) to Martin's "A Game Of Thrones" what Avalon Hill's "Dune" did to the "Dune" books. It certainly made me read the books and I never looked back. Perhaps one of Fantasy Flight's finest games.

RATING: 10
Game of Thrones takes the simultaneous turn order and lack of randomness found in the territory acquisition classic "Diplomacy" and makes it more enjoyable in some key ways: (1) the game is far shorter (2) it plays well with smaller groups (3) it adds half a dozen simple mechanics (supply, action, card drawing which affects the environment and can add a "barbarian invasion".  This is my favorite territory acquisition game.  In this game fortune favors the bold: "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die."

RATING: N/A
I don't like the way the diplomacy is weaved into gameplay in this game. It tends to induce more serious accusations between the players when all are playing competitively and urging to reach maximal outcomes from the negotiations. Some randomness in the battles would change the game for the better. I prefer Battlestar Galactica's type of interaction between players.

I've played this a couple times, and I have not been impressed.  The game has nice mechanics, but it all feels very anticlimatic in the end.  Needing 5 players hurts the game overall.  There is definatly a political aspect of the game, but that tailors off later, so early agreements mater more then later ones.  It also means that it is hard to change your mind later, since regrouping forces is faily time consuming, and impractical.

I initally found bgg because I did a search on my (at that time) favorite game "Junta".  I spent time scanning through the games and found one based on my favorite fantasy series - and not only that, it was rated VERY high!  Checked out all the info and put it on my wish list and got it for Christmas - only played it once so far, but I love it!  I can't wait to play it again - it is my new favorite game!

It is a 'balance' game - you need to expand, but you only have so many units to defend your territory and may go for turns without receiving reinforcements.  You are surrounded by enemies, all of which will gladly make an agreement and then betray you the following turn.  You have to worry about gaining supply, power, and cities/strongholds.  Very strategic game.

RATING: 6
This could have been Diplomacy with chrome. The bits were nice, the game was tied to a well fleshed-out storyline and setting, and the artwork was of sufficient standard. But alas, the chrome overwhelmed the diplomacy. Why Diplomacy worked was because the 'clean' game system focused players on fully exploiting the negotiation mechanism. But in AGOT, it was all about the chrome, and worse, the rules created by the chrome was fiddly and unintuitive and added to game imbalance and starting position problems. In Diplomacy, the only real difference between players was in the starting positions but the 'clean' system made sure that that was the only imbalance. Not so in AGOT! I understand that the game was built in some way to resemble the situation in the novels. In that case, then only those who read the novels will understand why the game rules are such and be willing to accept them. For the rest, the game rules will cut no ice. I wouldn't completely write this game off. This game is all about the theme, which can be quite appealing. I would leave the option open of another game only if there was really nothing else better to play (very rare occurance).

Wargame with a touch of political influences and a clever order token mechanics. A great wargame to be played when you are up to a noisy (negotiating alliances usually) game.

Played 3 times now and still wanting more to learn each house's strength and weaknesses.

I love the books, but the game has a tendency to stalemate and Lannister is often the first to go.  The naval rules are also poorly implemented.  I've heard the expansions fix these problems, but haven't had time to try them.  Still had fun, in part due to my love of the books.  (Seems standard now to use the 'ports' rule from Clash of Kings.)

RATING: 8.2
A wargame that gets some more economics and intrigue into the mix than usual, for very good results. Beware your chronic-backstabbing-disorder friends! It's a bit on the long side, but this kind of games always are. Expansions add good things and some bad things, so they aren't that necessary for maximum enjoyment.

It's fine. I'd play on occasion. The placement tokens are a little hard to deal with but with experience i think that decreases. No misplaced orders so far so that's good. The combat is pretty good and better than starcraft. I need to play starcraft again and compare. Right now starcraft is rated higher, but with only 1 play of that, i don't really remember why i liked it as much as i did. Outside of objective-based TI3, Antike is my favorite wargame.

A very well designed game. It probably deserves higher but I am hesitant to give a higher mark because I don't like the "Diplomacy" factor (how this game can get people pissed off at each other), how someone who is clearly losing can just hand the win to another person, and how that means that people who play best are not necessarily the ones that win. I'm also not a fan of the identical set up every time. Played with some expansion parts and I still can't rate higher.

My group kills this game. We negotiate before choosing orders and then negotiate again when orders are revealed. Every move has to be discussed and/or justified to somebody. [i]Why aren't you attacking HIM?[/i]

My two plays of this were 9 and 7 hours with the second not even complete; we had to call it as a player had to leave. Then at game end there‚Äôs frequently bad feelings and bickering over what everyone else should do and accusations of who was throwing the game to whom.

I may change this number after a few more games, but as far as first impressions, this game really stands up. Big fun and full of complex choices. Some luck, but not too much. I think there is a problem in that if one or two players aren't up to snuff (serious about the game) they'll get wiped out early. Also, it is easy for a player to give up and help another player win and I'm not a huge fan of kingmaker games, which is why I'm not giving it a 10. Otherwise, this is totally fun.

SOLID strategy Game that is now out of Print. It invokes a mental headache every time it is played. Bidding for turn order (Risk 2010), Impending Invasion (Knights and Cities), army management and deployment. Just a fantastic game. Need 4 or 5 to make it work well.

RATING: 9
I am still very new to this game, but it continues to grow on me the more I play it.

I love the hidden ordering system, and the tightness of the map and the battle system.  There is a chess-like tension associated with trying to assess what the other players are going to do, and where their strengths and weaknesses are.  The scarcity of troops further adds to the tension, as it becomes difficult to defend one's territory as one continues to expand.

Personally, I like the uncertainty that the Westeros card deck brings, not really knowing when the muster or the supply cards will come, though I respect the complaints about this. 

AGOT is a fabulous game that really shines with 5, or with 6 using the ACOK expansion.

After finally completing a play, I'm totally hooked on this.  Every moment of the game is tense and exciting, and it's overall a great experience.

I love this game, it never feels like it plays as long as it does (can take 4 hours). I really like the bidding mechanism for turn order and other roles, I'm surprised this hasn't been used in a lot of other games. A modern day version of Diplomacy I think.

Edit.

I sometimes am frustrated that I can't get an army onto the board, especially playing certain houses. Have lopped 2.5 points off!

Played 1.5 times. First time playing, 4 of us, all newbies. Think I got all the rules right, but sadly Lannister was the only player who remembered that 7 barrels was one of the victory conditions -- and promptly announces on Round 6 that he had one, just as we were starting to get into it. Our first game was mostly getting used to the board, and so not too much conflict, and all of us spread thin, almost no diplomacy. With another game, I expect this will rise to a 9. Just getting a handle on what to do took us a bit. Very nice melding of mechanics. //ust be really missing something. This time 4 players, all newbies, but we got all the rules right this time -- and the whole game felt quite static. No one really engaged in much combat, and we just sort of hummed and hawed over a few areas. What am I missing here? Also, we didn't muster until Turn 4, so we were spread REALLY thin! [con]

Excellent components, lots of strategy and nice mechanics.  What prevents it from rating any higher is a nagging feeling that  not all starting position are equally balanced and the kingmaking possibilities.  Will still play it although a word to the wise to not let a player rule the seas (especially not red or black).  Movement and retreat are greatly aided by a strong sea power; if this is uncontested for too long, the game will end sooner.  Also, try to keep strong diplomatic ties with a neighbor as you will sometimes need to fight useless battles just to reset your battle hand.  Especially handy if you're down to that last "0" strength battle card and everyone knows it...

Does a great job of capturing the feel of the books.  Those unfamiliar with the series can still greatly enjoy the game, but fans will get an extra kick out of all the minor characters on the house cards and so forth.  (The [thing=19400]Storm of Swords[/thing] expansion does an even better job of reinforcing the theme.)  It doesn't hurt that it's a fantastic game system with negotiation, action, and very little luck (other than, of course, the random selection of houses before play).

My only two criticisms: 1) the Ports from the [thing=10873]Clash of Kings[/thing] expansion are necessary and should have been included (note that they are included in the second edition); and 2) holy crap, it's hard to play Lannister. We've adopted the errata which suggests switching Greyjoy's and Tyrell's spots on the King's Court track, which helps out early on, and there are some other expansion elements that help, but it's still extremely difficult.

Rating is for the base game with the Ports. I also prefer to use the alternate House Cards from ACOK, and the alternate Westeros cards and the Wildling deck from ASOS. But all of that is negotiable: at a minimum, I will insist upon using the Ports, as will most experienced players.

The game is a Diplomacy with no secret meetings, but still takes a long time as the orders and combat cards lead to a lot of AP. Each side has to keep others in check; I dislike the bash-the-leader diplomatic aspect, where it's best to be 2nd or 3rd towards the end.

The deterministic wargame. Well, not really, but there is very little randomness to the battles. The chaos factor comes from the Westeros deck, which determines key things like generating new troops, adjusting troop limits, and the all-popular Clash of Kings blind bid. Plays quickly for a wargame. Not too bad. *** UPDATE: After a couple of more plays, I no longer like the Westeros deck all that much... Still not a bad game at all, but no longer one of choice.

Multiplayer conflict games are a far cry from my favourite genre, but as far as those things go A Game of Thrones is certainly one of the better implementations. The luck factor is comparatively low, turtling overall is not a promising strategy but defense is still a powerful concept, and there are ways and means for other players to keep leaders in check.

The hidden orders work particulary well and the combat system isn't too annoying, either.

"Le Tr√¥ne de Fer" est l'un des premiers jeux modernes auxquels j'ai jou√© et que j'ai achet√©. Je connaissais le "Munchkin" et quelques autres choses depuis quelques ann√©es, mais pas de r√©el jeu de plateau avec une profondeur strat√©gique. Et puis un jour, un pote qui m'avait, justement, fait d√©couvrir "Munchkin", me propose de participer aux "RLB" (Rencontre Ludiques de Bretagne) en 2009 et l√†, c'est la plong√©e dans cet univers merveilleux. Plong√©e tardive peut-√™tre, alors que beaucoup de choses ont √©t√© faites et que j'ai du retard sur ce qui peut se faire dans cet univers du jeu de soci√©t√©, mais plong√©e en profondeur malgr√© tout, avec deux journ√©es intensives lors desquelles j'ai pu en partie voir ce qui existait et combler certaines lacunes ludiques. Je ne vais pas faire la liste, mais ce fut l'occasion de d√©couvrir des choses comme "Diplomacy" ou "Les Colons de Catane".

Et en soir√©e, donc, "Le Tr√¥ne de Fer", lors d'une partie √† cinq joueurs. Ayant jou√© plus t√¥t dans la journ√©e √† "Diplomacy", le m√©canisme d'alliances, trahisons et programmation m'√©tait donc plus ou moins connu et l'assimilation des r√®gles a √©t√© rapide. D√©couverte prolong√©e d'un achat assez rapide, ainsi que de celui d'autres jeux, avant une pause assez longue par manque de camarades de jeux apr√®s un d√©m√©nagement, et une reprise de plus grosse envergure vers la rentr√©e scolaire 2011.

Voil√† pour ma vie. Ce jeu tient donc, vous l'aurez compris, une place un peu particuli√®re dans ma carri√®re de joueur. De plus, j'ai d√©couvert l'univers de George R. R. Martin avec le jeu de plateau, ne connaissant ni les livres ni la s√©rie t√©l√©vis√©e, que je n'ai regard√© que tardivement et sans r√©el int√©r√™t, par ailleurs. En derni√®re ann√©e de licence d'histoire, j'ai ressorti ce jeu qui prenait la poussi√®re, trouvant enfin des joueurs pour m'accompagner dans mes p√©rip√©ties ludiques. Et vu que c'√©tait un peu le seul jeu de cette cat√©gorie que je poss√©dais, on en a encha√Æn√© pas mal de parties. Et ils ont accroch√©, en gros. Chaque partie n'avait pas la m√™me saveur, certes, et la configuration optimale reste sans h√©siter celle √† cinq joueurs (on a essay√© toutes les autres), voire √† six lorsque l'extension l'a permise, mais dans tous les cas, on passait √† chaque fois un bon moment, avec son lot d'alliances foireuses, de d√©ceptions, de fourberies, de trahisons spectaculaires et de retournement de situations.

Car ce qui fait tout le piment du jeu, c'est justement la composante psychologique et humaine de la chose, le doute et l'analyse des autres joueurs, la confiance, la facult√© de trahir au bon moment qui permet de faire gagner la partie, mais peut aussi se retourner contre vous et causer la ruine. Bien s√ªr, et c'est pour √ßa qu'il n'obtient pas la note maximale, le jeu n'est pas exempt de d√©fauts. Certaines parties voient s'instaurer une forme de stabilit√© voire d'ennui, o√π personne ne fait rien de peur des effets n√©fastes, d'autres au contraire, par un tirage al√©atoire et dans un "mauvais ordre" des cartes rendent la position intenable pour un joueur (mais une variante permet de limiter ce ph√©nom√®ne). Enfin, pour moi, le c√¥t√© al√©atoire est aussi ce qui permet de mettre un peu de sel dans le jeu, j'aime ne pas ma√Ætriser absolument tout mais devoir composer avec ce qu'on m'impose, et je n'ai jamais eu l'impression que √ßa ruinait ma partie.

Le d√©faut de l'immobilisme, lui, se traduit par les joueurs pr√©sents autour de la table et la question du tempo, on reste parfois dans l'attentisme quelques tours, √† jauger ses adversaires, puis on tente un coup, on se dit qu'on s'emmerde et que comme √ßa on ne gagnera jamais, donc autant y aller. Parfois √ßa paye, d'autres fois il fallait le faire plus t√¥t, ou plus tard, et √ßa ne marche pas. Mais c'est l√† toute la subtilit√© du jeu, ce qui fait tout son int√©r√™t, au-del√† de toutes les m√©caniques qui le compose (ench√®res, cartes √† jouer lors de batailles...), qu'il ne faut tout de m√™me pas n√©gliger sans quoi la meilleure strat√©gie du monde aura du mal √† atteindre son but.

Alors oui, il y a la question de l'√©quilibre des positions de d√©part, des cartes des diff√©rentes maisons, de tout ce que vous voulez. Mais ce jeu est-il fait pour √™tre absolument √©quilibr√© ? Je pense le contraire. On commence √† un endroit, on en sait les caract√©ristiques, les avantages, les difficult√©s, chaque joueur en fera ce qu'il voudra, essaiera de d√©passer ce d√©s√©quilibre de d√©part √† sa fa√ßon et √©laborera de nouvelles strat√©gies, de nouvelles alliances, afin de composer avec ce d√©s√©quilibre. Parce que les jeux super bien √©quilibr√©s, c'est tr√®s bien, mais lutter contre le d√©s√©quilibre d'un jeu fait aussi partie du jeu, quand cela est possible. Et je pense que dans "Le Tr√¥ne de Fer", √ßa l'est, et que la fa√ßon de le faire pour essayer de gagner, en sachant s'adapter tant √† un d√©s√©quilibre qu'au hasard, la compl√©mentarit√© √† trouver pour s'√©quilibrer et prendre le pouvoir, est l'une des forces de ce jeu.

Un tr√®s bel objet ludique, √† sortir avec pr√©caution toutefois, qui ne conviendra pas √† tous, long et qui n'est pas d√©nu√© de d√©fauts ou de critiques potentielles, mais qui garde une place particuli√®re dans ma ludoth√®que. D'une part par forme de nostalgie, mais surtout (la nostalgie c'est plus tellement mon truc) parce que c'est, tout simplement, un tr√®s bon jeu.

Great game! It has some problems in balancing the game, and in randomless a strategic game it's a thing that costs the 9. Though the effort to put together a game profound and strategica, but also not complicated and not too much long is a really good thing, so the 8.

Beautiful and strategic, plus I love the theme, so it's guaranteed to score high with me. I'm also a big fan of the plan-your-actions-via-token-and-reveal-one-by-one mechanic (similar to Shogun's, though a bit more constrained to military action) and the varying strengths and weaknesses of the different houses. Quite interested in trying out the 2nd Edition, and seeing if I like the changes they've made.

2nd play.  I think I actually understood what I was doing this game.  There was a lot more diplomacy and bargaining going on.  Just over 5 hours total - yet, it kept my interest the entire time!  That is high praise coming from me.  The final turn, with all players having a decent shot at the win, might be my favorite gaming moment so far.  Very very tense and strategical.

Now played it three times - and love it. I've rated it a 9 - except for a question I still have about its balance, it would be a 10. A bit long to play - but so far, it's my kind of game. Now how will it stand up under repeated playings? Is it truly balanced once everyone knows how to play their side? Will the new variant rule - switch Tyrell and Greyjoy on the Raven track completely settle the questions regarding balance? Only time will tell. But for now, this is my game of choice.

Fantastic game of diplomacy and warfare.

EDIT:  One of my favorite games of all time.  Really creates some tense battle situations...the map starts out looking like there's room for everyone, but two turns in, everyone is in each other's face and knives and blades are drawn.

Look, I respect Diplomacy, but there is no reason to play that in a world where this game exists.  Reason being, there's an actual game here that can exist independently of the player's bitching and dealing with each other.  Dip is a game pushed solely along by the players with a bare bones rules structure.  This is a game where you have that player interaction, but an actual set of meaty rules. 

Also, you can actually get things done on your own in this game, which is nice.

Faithful rendering of the battles in the books, and one of the best times that five or six like-minded players are going to have.

Three games so far. I like the ordermechanic in the game. The element of diplomacy, forming alliances and stabbing your neighbour in the back is what makes the game interesting in my opinion. The game can go back and forth several times during a session and you rarely know who will win until the last turn. It is very hard to recover from an early stab though and the different houses starting positions on the map are asymetrical, thus some are harder to play than others. I like it, others don't.

Superficially, this game looks like one well designed war game, assuming you apply the 5 player errata (Swap Tyrell and Greyjoy on the King's Court track).  The rich get richer but get more enemies.

Initially, boats appear to be very strong, although they do not directly allow you to control a city region.  I believe if the game didn't have an inherent timer of 10 rounds, then boats would be far too strong.  That said, don't neglect boats, but also, remember your goals.

My first FFG game and also the one that lead me to BGG.  My initial interest was the theme and the high quality CCG that I enjoyed, and when I saw so many glowing reviews here I bought it.  A great game when you have a full table, but also one that can last waaaay too long.  Suffers greatly if players have analysis paralysis.

I don't know how balanced it is, but it sure is fun.  After 6 plays now, I think dicelss combat is too dry. I do like the sword and fort mechanic for managing loss risk but I think I'd like a set of House Cards that have more powers rather than straight values and then have a set of modifiers and then dice.   It'll add more drama to the combat resolution.

When teaching the game, the biggest thing to emphasis is Sea Support and Sea Movement.  These two things tend to sting new players and can ruin their experience.

The Port rule is good.

[i]"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground."[/i] --Cersei Lannister describing how this game feels to play.

[b][i]Game of Thrones[/i][/b] is not a relaxing game. You will agonize over order placement while hoping you outthought your bitter rival only to be stabbed in the back by your staunchest supporter. There's little hidden information, so the game feels very cerebral. For example, suppose I'm ahead in a battle: I'm guaranteed a victory if I play (and thereby "spend") my good card. But my opponent knows this and will likely not play his good card meaning I could still win if I play a bad card. But what if he suspects I might try to save my good card and then uses his good card on the off-chance that I play loosely thereby stealing a win... you get the idea. This game is a blast to play.

[b]First Edition vs Second Edition[/b]
The 2nd edition incorporated the best parts of the expansions from the 1st edition and is, to my eyes, clearly superior.

 This is a "diplomacy" wargame (strong diplomacy component, but it is won only by   conquering other player's cittys). Very goog game and even better if you have read the book ("Game of Thrones"). It's really that, "in the game of thrones you win or you die" ;)

In spite of the fact that I am a huge GRRM and FFG fan, I just don't like this game very much.  I like Diplomacy, a game which clearly influenced aGoT.  However, the additional Euro-chrome elements don't really help the game.  There are auctions, events, varying turn order, etc., but does it out Diplomacy Diplomacy?  No.  Does it add more control?  No.  I'd rather play the simpler of the two.  Also, the bits holder is completely useless: you have to work really hard to get the power tokens in the holders, and it's just as tough to get them out.  Ziplocks for me, thank you very much.

Good game, must have 5.  Extremely trim, very little fat.  No need to play Diplomacy if you own this.

Good game.  It helps to have some knowledge of the books to appreciate the theme.  The downside for me is the diplomacy, which can drag and not work well with people that aren't into negotiating.  The other downside is that you need to get the expansions it seems to balance the game out or at least give you an option for playing with 4 or 6 players.  I am not sure if the game would get played enough to warrant purchasing the base game along with the two expansions for me.

Not a bad game. Multiplayer war game. Asymmetry based on starting positions. I like games based on orders to a region, reminded me a bit of SC:the board game. That said, I think there are much better games that I would rather play in this variety. SC for one. Struggle of empires is also substantially better. Both of which are relatively simple games rules wise. If you get into more traditional style war games there are other ones I would rather play that provide a better experience as well. Still not bad, I would just rather play something else.

Good game. Solid system. Interesting options. What nags me is that the different starting positions in the game makes it very hard to play depending on where you end up. Lannisters for instance seem to have a very hard time winning, what with starting smack in the middle of enemies and going off on a three/four front war from round two and onwards...

... then again a) that is the case in many games and b) who would ever want the Lannisters to win anyway?

There is a good game in there somewhere, but the balance is outta whack. We played 5 rounds and gave up because we did not have a single Muster card turn up. We could all see how much fun the game could be if we had troops, but alas we did not. I doubt this will darken our table again.

This is an interesting game but it does take a while to set up and play. I loved the books that this game is based on and that helps a little. The alliances that were formed in the game were a bit annoying to me but I don't see any way around that happening as it goes with the theme somewhat. All in all a lot of ways to go and if you aren't careful you could cripple yourself pretty easily. There was one out of the three tokens ...sword, raven, and ?sceptre that determined how many of your troops you could attack and defend with. I got to the bottom of that chart and the effects were devestating. I highly recommend not being at the bottom of whichever chart that is.

RATING: 10
Well I always believe in using the full scale in rating systems, rather than holding out for a mythical 'perfect' game...

I just really adore the combination of the order placement system and the track/bidding mechanism. Great deep strategy and drama, fun both face-to-face and PBEM (see Yahoo group). Plus the tactical complexity is surprisingly rich - I spent upwards of an hour mulling over some positions in a PBEM game, only to finally realize there was precisely one sound defensive scheme that would handle all permutations of threats - a satisfying insight.

Sure it's imperfect, but the only thing that actually intrudes on my fun (and only slightly) is the inability to challenge at sea once you're pushed off it, but the ports in the expansion fixes this fine. Even without that I'm happy playing it - you just have to know the stakes at sea are high going into it.

Plus it's based on a great book series (basically crack for gamer types.) I heartily encourage you to take a chance on this one - buy the book and the game together for a great gift package. :)

I have heard that the game has some balance issues, but it wasn‚Äôt apparent on our first game. After playing it a few times I can definitely see them. The first games we got some rules wrong, but through repeated plays I think we have straightened all out.

The game itself is really good. I like the bluffing aspect with putting out the orders in the game and I think it is the main tactical decision in the game. There is also some resource management, but it is hard to plan for that.

I can see now where StarCraft has got their inspiration from and I personally like this more as the game play flows more. This feels more pure, but StarCraft has an interesting combined arms aspect. I can also see that this game got some inspiration from games like diplomacy although it plays more like Britannia. I expect this to stand a lot of plays and I will probably upgrade the rating with time.

One of the better Fantasy Flight Games (I own TI and WoW as well). This one gets a lot of points for an innovative (to me at least) combat system which often adds a great deal of strategy and opponent-guessing despite being basically a simple matter of addition. As well, the bidding for the various positions available in the game makes for some of the most nerve-wracking and fun moments I've ever had playing a game.

The standardized setup that results in few, if any, options for opening moves, the unbalanced nature of the factions, and the inevitable King-Making (not necessarily a bad thing, I enjoy a social or revenge element to winning a game) count against it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A solid game, maybe just a tad too long for what it offers, but entertaining and engaging throughout. I would have appreciated a slightly larger board -- the pieces and order tokens have a tendency to cover vital icons, making it difficult to rapidly appraise the importance of some areas (which can be critical in the case of strongholds -- in each of the games I've played, someone has backed into a sudden death victory just because we lost track of which spaces contained strongholds).

Played this twice now - but don't feel I have a very good base to judge the game. I'm interested in playing again, however (especially since I've read the books now). I think perhaps this game is best enjoyed with a group of good 'political' players who (perhaps) have already read the Martin book.

Update - played again Con of the North '07 and know a few more things. 1. I liked playing without the expansion and want to play a basics game again soon. 2. It *definitely* helps to play with non-rookies. 3. This goes up a notch or two in my book. CotN was a good game...

Played twice. Once with 5, once with 6. The 6 player game didn't end because we ran out of time but it was probably set to run to about 4 hours. There was a lot of chat afterwards which is encoraging, shows the game had an impact. This kind of "fighting" game is not really my thing but once in a while it's fun to play something other than a euro. If I'm to play a combat game and we have 4 hours then I'm as willing to play this as Runewars, Cyclades or Rex.

I know I should give a better rating having I played this game only once. 
I had good review by my friends but when I played it I wasn't impressed even if I like the Diplomacy stile of the combat resolutions. I give it a "6.5"

*** UPDATE ***
Ok I've played again. Now things looked different. I was quite happy of the game we had! I gave it an "8" I definitely want to play again!

My wife has a copy she's never played....bought purely because she likes the books and I know she'd hate the intrigue and deception, so there's no way I'm going to put strain on our marriage by playing this with her. I wish she'd sold it while it had value. I did pull it out to play with the right group of friends and we really enjoyed it, being too naive to recognise its apparent imbalances and flaws. There are a couple of copies of the Second Edition floating around our play groups and I'd be keen to give it a go.

This is a flawed masterpiece. Absolutely brilliant mechanics and theme integration, but a fundamentally imbalanced map/faction distribution puts a big dent on the replayability. 

The Clash of Kings expansion alleviates this somewhat, with the new cards and reworked tracks, but it's still not an optimal solution.

As a huge fan of the books, AGoT is simply a dream come true for me. The elegance of the army movement and combat, combined with the excellent order placement and the bidding for the seats of power put this as my favorite multiplayer boardgame. I would play AGoT over any other game given the choice, and will probably move the rating up to a 10 after a few more plays. Now all I need is some more people to play with so I can actually get this one out more than once every 6 months!

RATING: 6
A decent area control game. I like the auctions for control of the three tracks and the combat system is quite clever, incorporating a similar mechanic to LOTR: The Confrontation where cards are played and added to the combat strength of each army.

After two games I do think it has a few issues regarding the variable powers of each house, both in terms of map position and combat card powers. The aforementioned auctions are clever but they require the use of power tokens which are harder to come by for some houses than others and can therefore cause unbalances. This may all be trying to make the game follow the books in some way (I haven't read them) but in terms of gameplay I think it can make it slightly unbalanced.
The drawing of event cards each turn can also make the game swing wildly different ways depending on what comes out and when.

Overall I do like it but I feel that if I was going to play this kind of area control game I'd be more likely to play Struggle of Empires as I don't think it has the same sort of imbalance issues and also scales better for different numbers of players.

It is basically diplomacy with oomph. Combat has a poker-bluff element. There is an auction element adding to the excitement.  Great blend of strategy and tactics.  Everything you want in a game. No dice.  Every game is slightly different because of the events cards drawn at the start of each turn.  These cards determine whether there is a build phase, supply phase or an auction phase.  While this is a strength of the game it is also a weakness.  There are times when a build phase does not occur for many turns. This can get frustrating. However I highly recommend this game.

I like the combat mechanic, but the other mechanics of the game (raids, influence, production) don't strike me as being as well-designed. There's no real diplomacy or deal-making in this game, either. Couple that with the fact that the engine of the game is entirely random (Oh, no mustering ever Too bad, jerks!)
That the game is broken out of the box is then icing on the cake.

RATING: 9
This game is so amazingly fun.  The rules are simple, yet it has enormous depth.  I also love the constant banter due to diplomacy.  All this is packed into a 3 hour game.  AGoT is almost perfect, the only flaw is that sometimes a player (usually Lanister) will get screwed at the start and not have fun the rest of the game.

Played it with the expansions that are included in the 2nd version.

A classic.  Almost every move is a brain burner.  I play this almost exclusively by email now which lets the game really shine.  Very little luck, but skill alone is often not enough to win.  Lots of opportunities for rewarding predictions of opponents' behavior (orders, battles, and bidding).  The Clash of Kings expansion is a must for the Ports rules, though.

Fantasy themes are not really my cup of tea. I prefer games that try to be representative of real life / historical themes.

You are very vulnerable if you are in the centre. You can get boxed in if you are on the periphery. 

All my actions seemed to be effectively countered by my opponents which made my games very static - it was probably bad play on my part.

RATING: 4
Only played 4 player, feel rating might go up for a 5 player game. Tactics felt a little overly determined by start position, and unpredictability of Westeros cards puts a limit on how much planning you can do.

---

Playing again with 5 players and the expansion, the ability to see the next 3 Westeros cards helped the game an awful lot for me. Our group was a little argumentative though, might just be the players, felt slow and unpleasant. Westeros cards still too unpredictable even if you can see them, so no increase in rating for GoT

Need some adjustments to fix the "broken" rules. I like games in which we can't do everything we want so we have to make difficult choice. In this game, however, it's possible that no one can do nothing because of the cards drawn, so every body just stays in his camp's corner. Ten rounds of doing nothing and advancing nowhere is long......

Similar in feel with Diplomacy, but without the written orders. There are several significant and innovative game mechanisms here: 1) Players use command tokens to secretly commit orders to their pieces. The players all reveal orders simultaneously and resolve orders per turn order; 2) Turn order, combat strength, and number of additional 'special' orders are determined by three hierarchy tracks, where the order (or ranking) is literally 'bought' by blindly bidding political power tokens, which are accumulated during the game like income; 3) Combat is simple: total up combat strength of both sides, based on the number and types of units involved. But there is a twist: each player has a set of seven combat cards which can modify their strength or sabotage the other side, dramatically altering the nature of the battle. Once used, the card is set aside until all seven cards are used, or refreshed by some other action. There's lots going on, but it's deep with strategy, tactics, politics, intrigue, and theme. It definitely needs five to play, or six with the expansion, and will take 3-4 hours, with about 45-60 minutes to explain the rules. It's a brain burner, with complex mechanisms, so if one is not familiar with Diplomacy, it will be a rare event if it hits the table.

Update (05/29/11): A rare event that four others wanted to play this after seeing the cable show and/or reading the book. I have done neither, but still enjoyed the game immensely. Plenty of politics and strategic maneuvering abound, makes this game one hell of an immersive adventure. Unfortunately, with several newbies, this 5-player game took 6.5 hours. Perhaps with practice, we can get this down to a more manageable period. Still, a great game, and although with a seemingly overwhelming number of simple mechanics, everything work perfectly and seamlessly. I was surprised to see that FFG put out a 2nd edition. Based on some cursory looks, the graphics have taken a more medieval, middle-earth look, less colorful, and more dreary, more intense re-imaging.

RATING: 8
Rating after first play. 

Played AGoT for the 1st time yesterday, with the 6 player extension "Clash of Kings".

At first everything is a bit confusing and you really don't know what you're supposed to be doing. Formed an alliance with 3 other players, more out of their own initiative than mine, but in the end it almost paid off.

Speaking of the end, only by turns 7-8 did I get into the game and started enjoying it. Game flow is uncomplicated and surprisingly elegant. The haphazard alliances and politics work and you can break them at any time and stab anyone on the back. 

The game has, however, a strong gang-on-the-leader tendency, which in itself suits the theme and gameplay. Bold "Risk-type" wave-conquering is possible but not advisable, especially at the end, where a consolidated realm will prove more efficient against predatory conquerors than joining the merry-go-round of you take this and I take that.

Good game. Too bad my regular gaming group doesn't like war games, otherwise I'd play this much more often.

RATING: 6
Not sure what I think of this one. It's a good social game because it's essentially all about guessing what's going to happen next (and something has to happen fast) and talking out strategies (and bluffing) in between turns, but it is very 'scripted' in some ways in terms of whom is likely to attack whom and the 'unbalance' that's built in seems to appeal to those who have read the books (which I haven't). As such I can take it or leave it as a game, but it's good for group bonding.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed it, but I'm generally afeared of war games 'cos of my lack of experience in them. Not that this is a chits and maps kind of game, of course, but it's about deploying forces and takin' over territories. I did win the single game I played, and that's cool, but I think I owe it partly to the reticence of the more experienced players in the game to whomp on me.

RATING: 3
Rated low because "Clearly broken" applies to A Game of Thrones given the well-known problems with Lannister. The publisher may have fixed them with the expansions but that solution leaves a bad taste in my mouth...having to buy an expansion to make the core game work.

It is a shame because the core game has a lot of good things about it. Not quite the same level of negotiation as Diplomacy -- I think having some sort of note-passing system while you're playing would be key to give the game the requisite amount of back-stabbing -- but something kind of close to it.

RATING: 6.2
I was positively surprised by this one. I knew the mechanics and am a fan of the AGoT franchise but I heard a lot of negative stuff regarding the events (timing of supply/rally). That randomness works for me in this game. The ports (which are added in the 2nd edition, I hear) are missing dearly. I will look into the second edition.

Would need more players - 5 or 6 with the first expansion, and 3  hours .  Some balance issues, but people love it anyway, and FAQ and first expansion address these, apparently.  2nd expansion gives a balanced (but different) 4 player game.

Sounds like the ideal wargame if players could be found.

A wonderful game based on one of my favorite novels!  How can you go wrong?  Needing 5-6 willing players and a decent chunk of time holds this back.  Playing with Song of Ice and Fire fans makes it all the better since you can "talk shop" while playing.  I would never turn down a game of this provided there were 5 players.

RATING: 5.5
I have only played this first edition once (also being my first play of the game itself) and it didn't sit all that well with me. I'm not entirely sure why to be honest.

What I do know is that I've played the second edition a few times since then and my rating for it has improved drastically. While I'm confident that I would now enjoy the first edition more that first game I had, I'm also sure that the second edition is an improvement in game play with it's adjustments.

For now I leave this rated at 5.5 although it is probably more deserving of a 6.5 - 7.5 (2nd ED currently an 8).

The best book series ever! So of course I had to get the game, I had loaned my books to everyone i knew and they were addicted to the story so i thought i could use this game to bring them into board gaming too. Too complex for that purpose :-p. My gaming group also dislikes it because they tend to turtle a lot and find the game play slow.

RATING: 7
An interesting attempt at Euro-ising Diplomacy, that somehow doesn't quite seem to be all there. The starting position for Greyjoy/Lannister is much weaker than that of the others (a point acknowledged in the FAQ) so they need to ally from the start, otherwise expect whichever of Baratheon/Stark/Tyrell is least interfered with to win. The victory condition of 7 cities is quite a low bar and the game is entirely dependent on the players to attack the leader otherwise the game will end at mid term, just as it's getting interesting.
The bottom line is that this isn't fun enough to be a 3.5 hour game, there are small map Diplomacy variants that offer much more tension.

The mechanics are very interesting, especially combat/maneuver (order tokens and house cards). The game is great in that it creates complex gameplay through a very clear and not overwhelming set of rules. 

Despite all that it is just not my cup of tea:
- There are no catch up mechanisms besides "bash the leader".
- If you're in a bad position because you made a wrong decision early on, your game is over and you basically just watch the others play until the end.
- The theme could be just anything and is rather boring (I didn't read the books).
- Asymmetric balance of player factions.
- You do not interact with everyone. The map will never get you into conflict with half of the other players.
- I found waiting during the other players' turns boring and too long. Especially since half of the players' actions didn't affect me (because of the map).

I understand the game's appeal but would rather play Small World (shorter and more forgiving), Civilization (more epic, more things to do) or El Grande (more balanced).

Good fun, but difficult for newbies to immediately compete with experienced players. If everyone doesn't know what they're doing from the start, Baratheon and Greyjoy can dominate quite easily in 5 player. The same is true of Lannister in 4 player. Players need to stand together firmly against these powers from the start.

Un juego excelente, para jugones veteranos. Combina los mejores elementos de Diplomacia (intriga, faroleo y traiciones) y de los juegos de gestion de recursos (recursos escasos y turnos limitados). Subastas y ordenes simultaneas. Pu√±aladas traperas casi continuas y cambiacapas cada dos por tres. Ademas es sorprendentemente rapido: unas dos horas de partida. Solo para fans de los libros de GRR Martin. Las dos facciones que tienen islas (Greyjoy y Baratheon) tienen las mejores posiciones iniciales de salida... aunque por lo demas el juego esta muy afinado. Solo le falta que se pudiera jugar con la casa Targaryen...

Borrowed it from a friend for a month. Balance issues turned me off of buying it.  Haven't looked into how the expansions fix it yet.

Personal quibbles:  'Kingmaking' in any game is frustrating & the abilty to be eliminated early and having to sit and play solitaire doesn't suit well for the gamers I am currently with.

Good Game - At its best with a full game of 5 players.  I prefer the 3 player over the 4 player game.  Looking forward to Storm of Swords expansion for the 4 player game.

RATING: 7
This game could be phenomenal (key word: could).  As it is now, the asymmetrical make up of the kingdoms and board, which could be very clever, ends up highly limiting a player.  If you're Lannister - then it's try to expand without making enemies, Tyrell - take over the south and pray for enough musters to send an army northward, Greyjoy - take to the seas while pushing inland, and so on.  I don't like the bottlenecking you are forced to do based on your geography and initial track positions.  Everything else is top notch.  The components are great, the command mechanic is great, the different influence tracks are great, the battles with cards and supports are great...you name it.  I so want this game to be more than it is, but I guess I'll have to settle for giving it a go every once in a good while...A shame.

Neat Diplomacy-esque alliance / orders system going on in this game.

I'd have to give it another go to fully assess how well it works.  In a 5-player game, each player seemed to be able to get precariously close to victory conditions within a few turns, which made any mistake potentially game-ending.

I would bet that this is a great game with experienced players.

I can't think in this game without thinking in Diplomacy. It just diplomacy with randomness, not dice randomness, but card randomness. Combat cards are boring, ships system is boring, even the auctions for the throne aren't exciting at all. Good try at improving a better game, but unsuccesful. Yet another incomplete game that force you to buy his expansion to enjoy it. The same with TI3, but the complete version of TI3 is absolutely amazing, while the improved one of aGoT is just a regular game.

A very solid effort and would probably rate this higher if the game offered "built in" better balance for smaller groups.  Basically unplayable with less than 4 people, and not very balanced with 4.  No "runaway" victories, but some houses are obviously underpowered.  (Note this is true in the books as well, but doesn't provide a satisying game experience.)  If you can get 6 people to play the game should be even more fun, but that's something we've yet to acheive.

RATING: 9
Nasty, brutish, and short.  It's a very tactical game, but you do need an overall plan or very good luck to win.  Each player has a very different starting position, which adds to the replayability.  The only possible knock I'd give the game is that it's very difficult for new players to really compete for the win

Great game but not without a few problems. The greatness lies in the well-balanced structure of the game, the tension of deploying orders when there are so many variables to consider, the role of informal diplomacy and often tacit alliances, and the shifts in power which can create key opportunities to win the game. The issues marring the game include the asymmetry of the starting positions, the luck of the Westeros cards (combined, these two factors can cause a player to be left out of the running in the early part of the game), the length of the game (when all 10 rounds are played), and the fact that the balance of the game is impaired with 5 players.

Ice and Fire is my favorite book series.  So when I heard about this game I knew I wanted it.  It's basically described as Diplomacy light and it is, but the extra elements (Iron Throne, Supply routes, Wildlings, etc..) are the reasons why I prefer this one to Diplomacy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Wow, a wargame with little luck and German-style components... what more could you ask for?  The non-random battles are resolved quickly which is a plus, since in most dice-fest games (A&A and AoM for example) the battles tend to drag on and on.  I like the way that army sizes are limited depending on the amount of supply you have; this prevents players from creating an impossibly large army that sweeps across the continent nuking the weaker players, making the game more balanced.  The supply also makes the game less "fiddly", as you no longer have to wonder if your 15 tanks can take out the 30 infantry, etc.  The only problem I see is the balance between the different houses. House Tyrell (sp?) IMO is very underpowered for example.  It's a fun game even if you've never read the books, but I did read the first one since picking up the game.  Rating is a 9 after playing a 5-player game; a 4-player game receives an 8.

Personally I'm not sure if I *truly* enjoy it (if that's the type of the game for me).  I HAVE TO play more.

EDIT: After some time I've realized that I'm not the fan of such games.  So it goes for sale.
Maybe, maaybe, if I had a group willing to play it on a regular basis, I would've gotten into it and really enjoyed it, but I do not have such a group and therefore I wouldn't play it too often so I have no regret about getting rid of it.

RATING: 4
Very interesting and intriguing game of Diplomacy where going into the next room with an opponent to 'discuss' plans and possible alliances is part of the game.

Quite an involved system that I think the CoK exp improves upon and also adds a 6th player. I liked the silent auction that uses your power influence tokens while winning determined where you would be situated on the 'power' track. The combat with cards was good too but I think the event system could use tweaking, especially concerning Mustering although this could lengthen the game.

The game can be cut-throat brutal and almost eliminate someone due to the mustering being left up to the events so be warned not for 'softies'.

7.5 => 4 I've realized that this 1st edition was very unbalanced in many regards, like mustering, ports, Lannister House, maps for 4 or 5 players, etc to the point where you NEEDED the expansions, hence my rating drop here for just the base game (typical old FFG, initially I did not notice some of this due to playing with CoK in my first play). Also, a player could easily be put out of the game early on, either completely eliminated (which is actually preferable sadly) or to the point where they will never catch up as system had nothing built in for it, and either way, this is just not fun for that/those person(s) especially in such a long game

This was also the very first "out of room" negotiation game I ever played way back then, and was a big reason why I liked it as much as I anticipated. Since then I have played Dune & Virgin Queen, and besides the theme both of these games seemed better mechanically (again especially if you are talking about AGOT with no exps) With both expansions this might be an 8 or more for me, but that would also likely assume things not fixed by the expansions are tweaked.

RATING: 8
   Game of Thrones is really an excellent game reminiscent of Diplomacy in many ways.  I've only had a chance to play the game once [multiple times now], but man oh man, what a game it was!  I was tense right up to the bitter end.  On the very last turn I was rejoicing when I knew I had it won, and then crushed and bitter when I realized that my brother was actually going to win, and then jubilant when an unexpected move by my sister actually caused me to win by a tiebreaker!!  

   Not many games have this level of tight gameplay, fierce warring, and relatively short time commitment (given what type of game it is) while still leaving everyone happy and in the game at the end.

Excellent game, there's always a lot you want to do but you can never manage it thanks to raids and army restrictions. There is a good deal of luck involved with the card draws. Musters surely don't come up enough especially when you've lost a few men. The game moves quickly and is relatively short for a Civ style game.

Excelent and very entertaining diplomacy/war game. I would rate 10, but the top fun you can have is with 5 players. 3-4 players is a little boring and a bit unbalanced. But, the 5 player game is flawless.

RATING: 7
First edition game.  Like diplomacy on steroids.  The usual diplomacy hidden orders and alliances and backstabbing but also many more complications like bidding for certain advantages and different types of resources and hands of cards for the fights themselves.  Reasonably fun but I'm not a big fan of diplomacy type games.  If you like backstabbing and crushing your neighbors then this may be for you!

I admit that when I first heard about this game I thought, "How good can a crossover product possibly be?  Someone is just trying to cash in on the name."  I love the books, but didn't have much hope for the game.

Well, I was wrong.  Very wrong. This game is fantastic.

I compare it to Diplomacy with less negotiation and more wargame-like options.  

It's a shame that it hasn't hit my gaming table in 2006 yet.  The problem is that my wife and my friend's wife don't really like it.  They like Diplomacy, but this one turns them off.  (My wife is a huge fan of the books too, so it's not a theme problem.)  I'm hoping to break this one out before the New Year.

Fantasy wargame set in George R. R. Martin's world of Westeros. Players represent noble houses battling for hegemony of the continent following the death of the king. The game's components are absolutely beautiful. Gameplay is basically "advanced Diplomacy", including simultaneous revealing of units' orders (one of these is the ability to "support" your own or other players' units in adjacent areas), but adding several other clever game mechanisms such as supply, mustering, random events and an abstract (but influential) "power ranking" sub-game. One play-balance issue has been corrected with minimal errata, and other potential issues are being discussed by the game's fans. Looks very promising.

Es un buen juego, muy estrategico y sin dados. Cosas como que tengas que usar una carta de personaje en las batallas y esta se gaste hasta que todas se usen, da lugar a situaciones absurdas tal y como perder una batalla a prposito para utilizar tu ultimo personaje y recuperarlos todos de nuevo. Las posiciones iniciales tambien deberian estar m√°s equilibradas. Pese a todo el juego esta bien pero el hecho de que sea relativamente largo y no apto para jugadores ocasionales hace que lo juegue muy poco actualmente.

I like everything about that game - except playing it (and explaining the rules). It's a eurofied Diplomacy, with a shorter playing time and more complex rules. The clash of kings is perhaps the best use of the auction mechanic I've seen, and the invasions are a great addition.

Now, it's possible that I just didn't get lucky with the cards (my last two games were marked by no mustering before, I think, the 6th and 7th turns), and it's also possible that playing with beginners that just wanted to attack me more than to win made me like this game a whole lot less. Because, well, that's happened. On paper, it looks like the best game ever, but in the facts... well... not so much. I'll give it more tries, for sure, though!

The ultimate wargame! 4 hours of pure tension, backstabbing, and plotting to kill your enemies and when to stab your alliance in the back! We play where we pass notes in a bucket to each other so we dont know who's writing who. Not knowing who's in an alliance till toward the end makes it crazy! My top game!

Love it. Lots of strategy, the right amount of randomness without making you feel like you've been ripped off, and great opportunity for diplomacy and backstabbing. I would rate it a 10 if it scaled well, but the game really wants you to have five players as the three and four player variants aren't quite balanced.

RATING: 5
I appreciate this game for what it is, but based upon my personal preferences it has to rate a "5".  If you like this type of diplomacy/wargame, you will probably rate A Game of Thrones a "10".  I just don't like long games that can have a huge kingmaker or bash the leader problem.  I don't like playing a game for 4+ hours only to be screwed-over by someone in 5th place.  There's just too many other games I'd rather play.

Enjoyed my first game despite getting absolutely wrecked.  There is a lot going on, and just like I tend to do in Risk I completely overextended.  

Although I liked the game and would definitely play it again, I dislike the order tokens.  While the mechanic is neat, I found it difficult to keep my orders hidden while I was finding and deploying my orders because of the size of the tokens

RATING: 7
Now I have played it four times.  It is a good game, but it is not quite balanced among the five players.  In particular, the Tyrell house has little chance of winning a 5 player game unless either Lannister or Barnatheon playes poorly.  This is largely due to the limited number of "excellent" orders he may give in a turn.

Also, the sword that house Greyjoy has to Lannister's throat seems a bit too sharp.  

This game frequently devolves into a three-way contest among Baratheon, Stark, and Greyjoy.

Revision - down to a 7 as I realized that I have actually chosen not to play this gamein favor of other long games recently.

RATING: 6

RATING: 6
A 'Wallenstein' wannabe that does not live up to all of its hype.

Fixed and, from what I've seen, unbalanced starting positions, virtually no randomness in battle, too much randomness in the event cards, and, basically, too much "chrome" for what the game is trying to do.

Even with a 10 turn limit, the game can literally take days to play!  Diplomatic deals alone can eat up three or more  hours of game time.  Each of our games so far has run well over 5 hours and only because of a couple of mistakes made by one of the players... otherwise we'd still be playing!

To have a win 'fall into your lap' because of another's inept play is only a hollow victory at best... too many problems coupled with a high price tag only rate this game a 5.

I really try to find some good in almost every game I play, but this one left a bad taste in my mouth... I might have rated it even lower, but the physical appearance and components make up for the difference.

After only two plays, I strongly doubt that I will ever play this one again.

Addendum:
I managed to play this with 3 players.  With virtually no diplomacy to eat up the clock, the game played in about 100 minutes.  I doubt that I'll ever play this with more players ever again.

Great game based on one of the best new low-fantasy book series by George R.R. Martin, this one seems to divide opinions; Some love and some hate. This game is best when playing with open-minded people, who understand that its hard to build own empire just on your own, and after allying its viable option to backstab your former companion to achieve victory. Good random events keep game fresh, diplomacy adds too, and combat system fits in finely, after people learn it. Game tends to last too long with new players.

Was mostly a learning experience for all but one of the players. The experienced player hadn't taught the game before. The game didn't go smoothly because of this but I think everyone had a good time. 

I was Baratheon -- seemed like I had as lots of good opportunities to be on a path toward victory but lack of knowledge hurt me, I think. I believe I made good use of sea movement though. Greyjoy had a premature victory when  Highgarden left his capital open to attack and didn't realize that doing so allowed an instant win.

As far as games based on novels go, you can't beat this game.  It takes it's inspiration from a lot of other classic board games (DIPLOMACY comes to mind, along with KINGMAKER & WAR OF THE ROSES) & rolls out a very cunning, strategic game which mimics the novels very well (excluding all the rape, torture & other atrocities visited upon the subjects of the Seven Kingdoms).  It is one of the few in-depth strategic games my wife will play & she won the last game playing House Greyjoy!  How the hell did that happen?

Game of Thrones is my first diplomatic wargame. I love the books and series, so the theme has some additional value for me. But it is also a very good game. I like the fact that secrecy and bluffing play a major part in playing out your strategy. Units are sparse, so making alliances is a necessity to have a chance to win. The base game is best with 5 players, and unbalanced with less. The Storm of Swords expansion makes it a more flexible game, because it becomes very playable with 4 players, and adds some great aspects to the game, such as leaders and executions. This game is high on interaction, and I immensely enjoy revealing the command tokens, and figuring out who has been outbluffing or outmaneuvering whom.

Diplomacy grows up, falls in love with German games and they have a kid.  It has a lot of moving parts and process, but I like games which make you build a plan and try to carry it out.  The diceless combat system (built around house cards), also won me over, probably because I was able to get inside the other players' decision loops and win the battles when it counted, which was at least as satisfying as coming up with the plans for marching my troops all over the continent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The inspiration by Diplomacy is visible in the basic orders move/defend(hold)/support. To make it more playable the main deterrent to many players, negotiation, has been dimmed down. The game length is thus reduced. To further increase the appeal, a popular fantasy theme was crafted on. To make it work without negotiations, the increased number of units and hand management of battle cards puts more control into each player's hand instead of control solely as a function of his negotiation skills. The end result is a game more akin to usual multiplayer conflict games than Diplomacy. If you like these, you have a good one at hand that is not so much a free-for-all bash the leader fest as many other games in this genre. Purportedly, the balance of the asymmetric player powers is off.

I really enjoyed this game a lot and look forward to playing more of it. Excellent theme (love the books!), well-designed components, and fun combat mechanics (reminds me of LOTR: The Confrontation). There are some balance issues, but these can be resolved through alliances, which works thematically. The only downside of this game is that it really needs five players to play well.

AP can set in (at least it did for me) once the kingdoms are of fairly substantial size, and the game can be brutal in its semielimination of players, but it's an admirably clean game that incorporates some diplomacy with a very good combat mechanism.

I think my lack of familiarity with the books hampers my enjoyment of the game.  This seems to be a fairly simple multiplayer wargame with quite a bit of randomness in the card draws.  The fact that mustering comes out only in the cards is a little annoying, as it could potentially really slow the game down.  I would enjoy playing this game if it was quick, but if it dragged out with negotiations and alliances I am sure I would sour on it.  I like how you are limited in your army size as well as in your actions, which forces you to get creative.  Even though I like Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation, I'm not sure I like the method that is used for combat resolution.  Ultimately if I want to play a game like this I think I would prefer to play Wallenstein/Shogun.

After first play I¬¥ll have to say that this is an excellent game! The mechanics work well together to make a challenging and everchanging game! However, an introdutory game with 5 players, where only one player,(me) has read the rules, can be a very taxing experience for everybody, especially the one player who read the rules... (again, me!) I¬¥m surprised that everything still went as well as it did, with only few, minor, mistakes made, rules wise. And after the game, I thought of a whole lot of options that didn¬¥t occur to me during the game, and some moves that I really should have made... Hope to play more soon, and might adjust rating upwards after...

Not the game I was expecting. The game is more wargame than diplomatic manuevering to be King. Going into the game I was wondering how bad the Mustering/Supply thing could be. Well it turns out, its pretty bad.

Some parts of the game are really cool but I think the basics of the game are too simple to allow too much variety in the long run. So I don't think there will be much replayability.

BGG warned us, but since we had the game, we played it. The mechanisms are beautiful, but wasted on a castle-grabbing victory condition. This leads either to deadlock or free for all, dpending on the player interaction. If players had more ways of winning, it different strategies would appear (rather than perfect gambits) and it would get more interesting. We had a 7 turn stand off in the south while the wacked it out in the north, cause nobody had the strength to break the deadlock and nobody was willing to do a dirty deal. So, heed the Geek

Very unique and well balanced game.  I like the blend of strategy, combat, and a small bit of luck (with the drawing of event cards) that all combines together and works very well.

Overall, a very compelling and unique war/strategy game that is a joy to play, especially for fans for the book series.

Given my love of Diplomacy, and card-based war games, as well as my fanatical admiration for GRRM's novels, my love for this game was inevitable.  Although I really enjoy this game, I feel that the initiative system just doesn't give it the same intellectual-"umph" that Diplomacy has.

RATING: 7
Very intense. There's almost no downtime and still it lasts for 3 hours. It doesn't feel like that long while you're playing, though. Having played mostly 4-player games so far, it seems to me that Lannister may have too strong a position in the start in that setting. It went to win the first two and nearly went there in the third one also, even though the others were trying some kingmaking against it. The opportunity for heavy kingmaking seems to be a problem, but the fundamental problem of the game arises from the overpowered fleets. All the mechanisms work well.

RATING: 8
Nice blend of Dune, Diplomacy, Wallenstein, but with a cool twist where you need to balance which spaces you control in order to be able to build troops, have big enough armies to accomodate them, and have power tokens to win bids for the power roles.  Very nicely evokes the theme, but fun even for people who haven't read the books!  Nice game!

RATING: 6
Impressions after first game: Diplomacy derivative with auctions for special abilities, card-dictated sequencing of upkeep and other game events, and various small strands of tinsel, but largely without the action cards and accumulated perks that make a monstrosity like TI3. Reasonable adherence to theme given the type of game it is. Would play again.

There wasn't much in the way of overt deals or alliances, more like stretches of unarticulated d√©tente punctuated at the first show of weakness. This may not have been a bad thing, though you lose part of the Diplomacy legacy: negotiation isn't quite the same thing when the rules don't order you to get down to it.

Playing time had better go down upon repeated play: I'm not terribly keen on having a six-hour game decided (in part or in full) by one of the players out of contention making a doubtful attack because he "just wants to win a last fight", no matter how legitimate a decision this is.

Loosly based on my favorite books of all time.  Unfortunately produced after only the first book had been released and as GRRM made more book the game became more and more off.

I usually enjoy this game a lot.
However it seems to me like it has some serious balancing issues (Lannister is too weak), which becomes more and more a problem for me. Also the game is heavily influenced by how the event cards come out. While this adds to the re-playability (every game is different) in some extreme cases a game can be practically ruined by the way the event cards come up (e.g. no mustering or clash of kings for the first 5 rounds)

I really want to like this game more than I do. It's got everything I like--area control, card-based combat, negotiation and backstabbing, and friggin Westeros, man, friggin Westeros!!

But it lacks something that similar games I love (Dune, Shogun/Wallenstein, even Mare Nostrum) have: strategical control.  The Westeros cards have too heavy a hand in how each game progresses, and they're determined randomly, without any ability to plan for them in advance. Now, normally I don't mind the tension that this kind of randomness invites. But in this case it makes the game seem oddly pointless.... I think because I expect a certain amount of strategery from a multi-player war game like this, and so having to constantly press the reset button because of the stupid Westeros cards just sucks: shuffle the deck, bid for power, bid again, wildlings attack, no mustering, no mustering, no mustering, shuffle the deck...ahhhhh! That sucks.

Add to this the potential for (and usually the requirement of) player elimination and AGoT falls awfully short of its predecessors and its betters.

The order mechanics are well-designed and fun, but I've never had a game that wasn't decided by random kingmaking in turn 10. It seems that as long as the other players have half their wits about them, noone ever gets a solid lead in cities and the game spends three hours going nowhere.

A game where something always seems to be threatening to happen but rarely does. A 4 hour game of hot air. When aggression does happen, it is usually unrewarded.

After playing quite a bunch of games and reading the books, I must say this one keeps growing on me. My opinion of it has varied a lot: I started loving it, then I didn't wanted to get close to it, then I rekindled my interest.

Though I did had my doubts, I've come to realize the game's mechanisms work like charm. There is not a single one which could be argued its unnecessary: all help balancing the game in some way or another. 

I like how the only source of "luck" the game has are the event decks. Events force players to rethink their strategies, adapting them when necessary. I've found most players who dislike the game gamble against the event decks, creating strategies which depend of a certain event popping up at a certain time. Wrong: strategies must be carried keeping in mind map distribution, assuming events will hamper you in the worst way possible, while simultaneously being prepared to exploit beneficial events as much as possible the moment they pop up. Events add a dose of chaos and uncertainty, forcing players to adapt their plans. Gambling against the event decks should only be done in the most desperate situations.

I should also mention the game can easily be played "wrong": players need to take risks. If its a single player, its tolerable: excessively defensive strategies are predictable and can be easily outmanoeuvred. If all players are too cautious, the game's pace shatters into pieces, being brought almost to a halt, to the point the game itself becomes unbearably boring. Excessively defensive strategies not only aren't a winning strategies, they can break the game too. Remember I mentioned there was a time I thought I despised the game? It was because of this.

If you want a game which rewards both long term thinking as well as adaptation, all surrounded by an atmosphere of temporary alliances and backstabs, Game of Thrones is for you. Being familiar with the books or the TV series is a huge plus, but not required.

Mmmh ... rather mixed feelings towards this long wargame without dice, but with still a lot of randomness. As such, I don't mind randomness, but strategic planning is difficult when important actions like supply and mustering are determined by the appearance of cards. The hidden placement of the orders is OK (and reminds a bit of Morgenland). Don't like the possible player elimination. ***** First play took 6,5 hours, which is too long. While it was fun in the first rounds, game play got tedious and dragged on to the end of the ten rounds. Difficult to reach the automatic victory condition and although the positions on the board changed, the overall impression was a static game: most players got bogged down when reaching 4 or 5 regions. The diplomacy/negotiation element was rarely used.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The game is _entirely_ based on negotiations. The person who wins is the person who makes allies entire game and betraying them all in crucial moment. If so.. why so good rank?

The game has marvelous mechanism of gathering power and using it when voting for offices, which has privileges fitting extremly well to negotiation nature of the game. I'm amazed with that, and can't tell why. Maybe when you play with right people, the above drawback has no matter?...

I think what really bugs me with the game is how the cards can affect it so much. Our game stagnated pretty bad when the muster action didn't come out until the 5th or 6th round.

The base game has some major imbalances that really ruin what's meant to be a long, involved game.  The expansion and heavy "diplomacy" ameliorate the imbalances, revealing some interesting mechanics.  Limited resources exacerbate typical multiplayer wargame imbalances (e.g., fighting on multiple fronts), while chance and arbitrary player control knock the game down a few more notches.

Excellent.  For veteran geeks, it combines the best elements of Diplomacy (warfare mechanic and intrugue) and Puerto Rico (scarce resources and limited turns).  Also surprisingly quick: two hours a game for our group.  For fans of the books, you get a chance to march around Westeros with your favorite (or least favorite) faction.  I understand George RR Martin had a lot of input into the game, and it shows.  The two island kingdoms (Greyjoy and Baratheon) have the best starting position, but otherwise the game is finely tuned.  Now if only you could play House Targaryen...

I played with a couple of expansion material, so our game was very brain burning and it last 5h for a 5 player game.  Some concepts are interesting, like the fact that you have really few units and that you rarely lose units. You you must try to push units and make sure they cannot get supplied. The supply system is nice. Still there are a few stupid things like the fact that you must change the map according to the number of players. The fact that you need some expansion material to correct some bugs in the game(for examples the port).

Base game can leave a bit to be desired if the muster card does not come up...but fortunately that was not my fate in my first game.  We had at least 4 musters come up and at one point I had all but 3 of my troops on the board.  However, I took a gamble and sailed North to take a castle region and my large force was wiped out in the last turn.  I appreciated the opportunity to play as I've had an unused copy of GoT and CoK sitting around and now I know how to play thanks to GRAB GameDay.  Definitely have to give this one another shot.

Tense and fun light wargame which uses simulataneous action chit placement to give it something of the feel of Diplomacy.  The bidding for influence charts shows a debt to Eurogames as well as the game's most obvious strain of forebears.  I also happen to be a fan of the books so the theme works very well for me.  Very nice incorporation of theme and mechanics into an excellent game.  It does seem a bit hard for those who start poorly to recover, however.

A friend of mine brought to our club for viewing and -- playing, how pleasure it was!  A good cross breed between military historical game and Euro-game.  Fantastic mapboard, multiplayers, simple rules, and several beers and, off you and your friends go!  Adventure lies ahead and battles ensue in a yet-to-believe world awaiting for your explore. Suprisingly, it has no gamey strategy or tactics.  

Its basic game "engine" is very solid and has many similarities to war boardgame.  Different houses have their own agendas and ambitions in different stages of the war as their positions or spheres of control shifting and changing on the map.  

I particularly like the initial planning operations for each area with a force where a token has to be placed.  The operation tokens are revealed simultaneously once everyone has made their decisions, you therefore never know what your opponents are up to.  Your plan to attack may, for example, be foiled by a defence order taken by the defender with naval ‚Äúbombardment‚Äù support from neighbouring sea fleets.  Very tense game throughout with this innovative hidden order system, which still shines today more than 10 years after its original release.  

Overall, a marvelous design and a very good game with colourful maps and components, and a lot of possible strategic options throughout the entire 10 years (turns) of the game.  It doesn't get a perfect score of 10 just becuase it is a fantasy game, of which no benchmark you can measure against for its simulation value.  Otherwise, it depicted very well the "true" picture and general "history" of the novel and the land of Westeros.

Add some theme to [GameID=483], finally! [GameID=483] is of course the [i]Dry Martini[/i] of Gamers Games, and I never cared for dry martinis.

one of my favourite area control games because of the simultaneous blind orders given as well as the easy but important use of economics.  Even better are the 3 main titles which must be bid on during the "Game of Thrones" event.  I knew nothing of the books when I played this but I went out quickly to find them right after playing the game.

I think that this is a very good game, but where it failed my wife and I was the 3 decks of cards. the chaos there led to some very badly timed moments that tarnished the bright outlook we had for the game. By the end things evened out a bit, but the chaos left a bad taste in my mouth.

GoT is a lot of fun, with some great mechanics too; the supply system, bidding system, and hidden orders all work together neatly.  The fact that it's nearly completely luckless sealed the deal for me.  It makes the soft-diplomacy really stand out.

RATING: 8
Now that I have played a serious game with another 3 players I can say that this game is very involving and kept us on the edge of our seats for a good 3-3.5 hours. My previous rating (8) hasn't change because I think the diplomatic element is not important enough : There are discussions around the table but a player can pretty much play a good game on his own, even if he sticks only to basic diplomatic deals. I would much prefer some elements of "Diplomacy" to be included here, ie you CANNOT win the game if you don't cooperate at some point...
But all in all a good game with high entertainement value. Will hit the table again.

Good strategy game, complex fight and diplomacy rules, nice settings and artwork but with always the same startturns and not so much playerinfluence as it seems. And you need will need exact five players to play or its unbalanced. Nevertheless i love this game that transport so well the atmosphere of the books and the series. Its like playing your own version of the story of the books from George Martin.

RATING: 7
You take on the role of one of the great Houses of Westeros.  You can build armies and fleets but are limited by supply.  The combat is card based.  Success is less about Risk-like constant attack and more about maneuver and knowing when to strike for the win.  

There is a heavy dose of diplomacy as well.  

This version suffers from no ports.  You need the expansion for this to work.

A dressed-up Weurogame that is still just Diplomacy in the end.  Until you reach that end, however, it's a lot of fun.  I enjoy the tactics of the combat cards and have not been as frustrated by the Westeros cards as others have expressed.  Played as a multi-player wargame with the ports expansion it is a '9'.  The base game gets a '1' rating for being broken without the Ports rule in the Clash of Kings expansion.

Good idea, poor execution.  The game seems a rush-job, unfinished and untested - riddled with flaws.  Bad components (Order chips should have been cards), unbalanced (Lanister starting position is clearly the worst), wrong focus (boats are way too powerfull) etc.  And it's way too long: We played 8 rounds in 5 hours of mostly waiting.

RATING: 9
I like this game a lot. It's set in a great universe and has good depth in the tactics you can adopt... but you do need the full complement of players and about 4-6 hours which can be tricky. Would recommend using a timer to keep turns to a reasonable length. The expansions also address some minor game balance issues. If you must play with fewer people then strongly consider blocking off some of the board as per other BGG users' recommendations, otherwise one of you will likely coast to victory without working very hard for it and the rest will feel slightly aggrieved. Best to give Lannister to an experienced player.

"Westeros cards" are simply a BAD idea.
Unbalanced starting positions. I dislike the possible coalition against someome (the weakest, the leader, the unlucky...) Elimination game. 
It has no appeal based on theme for persons that haven't read the books.
Long.
Considering how it is based on diplomacy and that it can fall apart due to ships (too useful) and reinforcements (too rare if wrong cards are drawn), I wonder if it is "broken" or close to that. But I won't play it any more, so I'm (luckily) not going to discover it...

I really like the mechanics here. Easy to learn, but has a deep strategy to it along with the diplomacy aspect. 

I love the theme, but the game would work just as well with a different one. Can't wait for 2nd edition!

RATING: 2
Just don't get how this game can rate so high.  Twice played, twice saw a player or players slowly wither away during the game, having no meaningful contribution except to hang on and hope not to finish dead last.

Sure, alliances and deals can improve one's lot if forced to start in a bad area (Lannister is the worst, Stark isn't that great either IMHO).  But these things won't help them win the game as far as I can tell.  others will dispute this, but the game simply is not balanced if you play it with 5 players.

Not at all fun for the players who must struggle to keep from being wiped out, and watch while several players dominate and cruise to victory.  OH!  then there is a the kingmaker aspect to all of this, where a last place player can help someone else win or lose.  saw it happen, halped it happen.

Nope, this game doesn't do it for me.

This game is excellent.  Great strategy and treachery combined.  Main thing is to understand the rules prior to playing.  This is one of those games that must be played more than once to truely understand its value.  So, for those that only play it once and decide they don't like it and rate it low I'd suggest giving it another shot after you understand the rules and the game.

I've not read the books nor watched the films/series, so the theme does nothing for me.

I love this game.  I only really have two issues with it.

1) It really doesn't scale down very well.  You need the full complement of players for it to play at its best, and things start feeling broken or tilted when experienced players play a smaller game of it.

2) It's really improved by the Clash of Kings expansion.  I suppose that's actually a good thing, but if you are budgeting to get this game you really need to consider the extra expenditure required for picking up the extra stuff.

I really wanted to like this game, however the game play left me flat. 

There seemed to be wild swings in fortune based not at all on strategy, but on luck. I was hoping for a more balanced combat system like diplomacy, however I found that it was very hard to support your own units, since wasting those order meant that you were either not expanding or you were not earning enough power. 
I also found that other than in the most obvious places having another power support you was not going to happen either.  

Sea power (or the movement it provides) is way too strong. 

This game draws on a lot of elements from other games, but I feel they just jumble this game up a bit. The nice balanced combat of diplomcay is ruined by the house cards. The bidding for the 3 power tracks turned into bidding for the raven as the other 2 are far less powerful. 

Also the Map does not feel as balanced as some other games. There are not enough citys on the map. So every turn there is someone who can win. so all alliances shift to stop them, next turn someone else is in that position. Repeat until turn ten when the game ends itself. 

There are many better ways to spend 3-5 hours of your time and money. 

For the cost of this game and the expansion you can go on ebay and buy a copies of AH Dune and Diplomacy. (and have some cash left over) Both of those games do what this one tries to do but much much better. 

Update: 

I tried it again and it still sucks. This time i think it is the perfect information that ruins this game for me. Again the diplomacy was predictable at best and non-existent usually, so battles cam down to players looking at the board and calculating where they could win after the orders were revealed. The playing of the leader cards was a forgone conclusion. Where is the fucking drama of the books? where is the risk? 

this game is just boring.

RATING: 9
If the game is half as good as the books, it will be awesome. I've got the expansion and I am working on my game group to try this one. Ive got a couple of the guys to read "A Game of Thrones" so the interest in playing is starting to rise. I'd give it a 7 just from reading the rules.

UPDATE: Finally got 5 in the group to play this and it was a huge hit. Took some time to learn the game, but after a few turns the strategies started popping up. we called it at Turn 6 due to time, but everyone wants another go at this one - as well as the 4 that didnt get to play!

Lots of Theme in this. Only a couple of us had read the books, but certain things happened in the game that mirrored events in the book and the rallying cry of the Starks was shouted repeatedly! This game has been asked to be played over the past 3 weeks since we first played it. We had two sets going one night and both games went the full 10 turns. 

The rules to this one are a nice blend of mechanics from games like Diplomacy (Giving orders - but it is handled MUCH simpler here), Cosmic Encounter (Each house has certain abilities through the cards they start with AND the combat system is VERY similar to Cosmic Encounter - add up the tokens, call for allies, play a card, high total wins), and Axis and Allies (Different units with different strengths and abilities).

I really like the Westeros cards and the way they drive the flow of the game between mustering, supply, bidding for the 3 areas of control/power and the Wildling attacks. A Game of Thrones lives up to the novels brilliantly, blending intrigue, combat, diplomacy and resource management in a tight, well executed game that will leave you wanting to play again immediately.

This one is on the verge of being a 10.

Played with 5 players. Easy to learn... uneasy to win. The chance in turning the Westeros cards can save or ruin your positions. The optional rule (found in "A Clash of Kings") with 3 "open" cards is certainly a must if you want to build a real strategy. "A Clash of Kings" expansion brings you several other optional rules and allow a 6th player to take part in the challenge.

Excellent meshing of seemingly disparate elements into a coherent whole.  The secret giving and simultaneous revealing of orders is very well-handled.  The value of the track positions up for bid is high enough to make the accumulation and expenditure of power a critical game element.  

The diplomatic aspect of the game is perhaps unavoidable, and could add to or detract from your experience.  I'm not feeling especially diplomatic as I rate this.

Rating is for original, unexpanded game.

I love the huge roll diplomacy plays. I also really dug the initial imbalance that has different houses needing to take different tacks on their road to victory. 

It kills me that I don't get to play this as much as I want to.

RATING: 4
Played this once. Not a fun experience. I felt as though there was nothing I could do to defend myself or win any battles. Every battle I initiated or defended against was foiled in some way. I don't know if this was due to an imbalance among the various Houses and the cards they have or maybe I didn't understand the rules fully. I could not turn the game around when it was obvious I had no chance of winning. Had to stay in the game to act as a buffer for the other three players. Any game that does that is broken in my opinion. Surprisingly, with that said, I will give this game another try just to make sure that my initial experience was not a fluke.

The best weuro (if the therm makes sense) out there that perfectly mixes a lot of mechanichs into a challenging and tense game. You can secretly assign orders to your units, there is diplomacy, area control of some provinces, card driven resolution battles, bluffing, even some blind auctions (fortunately not more than 2-3 for the whole game).

RATING: 8.5
The most aggravating fun game I have ever played.  I think I've played this four of five times and have yet to win.  One thing I like is the fact that it's possible to come back from way behind and still win, just not me.

Update:  Bumped the rating to 8.5.  I think I found this game's sweet spot.  Played a five-player game and it was amazing.  It was engaging, tense, exciting.  Downside:  I've never seen someone walk out in the middle of a game before.

Played once as Lannister and won(!!!).  There's a lot of stuff I like about this game (hidden orders, uncertainty in the cards), but it does seem to go on too long.  I'm sure more frequent play would speed it up.

This is a fantastic game.  Having read most of the novels, the ability of the game to capture the same tensions and strategic implications was remarkable. As a dudes on a map game, it works quite well and rewards skillful (and experienced) play.  Lots of tough choices throughout the game and a great sense of narrative and progression.  Ample opportunity for negotiation and collusion makes otherwise very mechanical gameplay really shine.

I could play this once every two years or so.  It suffers from typical symptoms of Fantasy-Flight-itis: it has some interesting mechanics, and the first few turns are fun, but then it sloooooooows dooooooooooown, the tension falls, and it becomes grindingly dull.  At least it ends faster than Twilight Imperium.

You don't need knowledge of the theme to play the game.

The diplomacy-like gameplay makes it quite different int the crowd of multi-player conflict games. However, being neither a fantasy game (no fantasy feeling at all) nor a historical war game, I found its theme totally unattractive, at least to me. Moreover, the military planning wasn't quite interesting bcoz of the random supply and muster rules. That said, I'd give it another try bcoz I think it may has potential to please me more. But my friend seems won't give it another chance.

Having played only one 4 player game (already working on a 2 player version with jas0), I would have to say that this is one of the best games I have ever played. Intrigue and war. Cool.

Rife with intrigue, they can be a little darker than most would expect from the fantasy genre, but a good read.

Mechanic that gives very little room for luck and lot's of value to negotiation skills and timing... The downtime is too long and one or too AP-players can ruin it for all... Also I kinda dislike the idea, that one player can ruin the game from another player if that one doesn't care to win.

Like someone has come up with a wild variant of Diplomacy, it plays best with 5 where the theme of the G.R.R.Martin's story comes through strongest.

Interestingly, the game, like the series, loses impact the more that is added. Yes, Martin should have wrapped this series up years ago, he started in 1996 FFS!!!

RATING: 5
Hard game to judge. I like the mechanics and theme, but like Dipolomacy there's little in-game reason to ally with someone over someone else, so there's a lot of arguing and conjoling (where I'd prefer something like trading and bribing). Also, it didn't help that our game ended in a kingmaking situation, and that I was out of contention after the fourth round and left with little to do. Want to play again, but I'm liking these 'he who plays the personality game better' less and less.

Great strategy game. It can be quite intense, lot of lies and deceit, broken contracts.

RATING: 7.5
Depite being more than 4 hours long there's not a dull moment in this game. Probably because it's the kinda game where you know you're gonna get stabbed in the back eventually, just not when (or where). This is probably the closest I can get to Diplomacy, which I'm really not interested in.

NL: Wie van de 4 of 5 spelers volgt de koning op? Je gaat er om knokken. Maar helemaal in je eentje redt je het niet, dus zul je al dan niet betrouwbare pacts met een deel van je medespelers moeten sluiten.

Spel met diverse variabelen en voor-/nadelen die wisselen per speler.

RATING: 9
Excellent and well designed war game. Quick learning curve and fairly balanced. Nice theme and plays quickly for this type of game!
Variants to use next game:
Setup
Consider giving Lannister (Red) King's Landing with a weak force (1 soldier). Add 1 ship to Green (Tyrell). Add 1 soldier to white (Stark)


Use ports, max 1 sea support, houseruled forts, seige engines.

Base Game Map
Throne can pass on first action
Sword can be used for +1 on anyone after a battle.
Raven can see future, switch commands, and see someone's secret cards.

Start with 4 battle cards each (1 mulligan). Card are public information but you can always choose to hide ONE.

Gain a new card every time a card is used. At the end of your turn, you may discard and gain a new one.

A Castle means you can only lose units caused by swords and it still cancels out a sword.

A nice game based on a nice theme. My strongest complaint against it is that players starting position and possible expansion are unequal. It's not reasnobale to require players to know the game in advance (or after a couple of plays) so that they'll know who has a better position and requires a unite front from almost the beginning of the game.

RATING: 8
He manifestado en muchos sitios mi predilecci√≥n por este juego. Para m√≠, es la joya de mi colecci√≥n. Su mezcla estrat√©gica al m√°s puro estilo del Risk, el alto nivel de interacci√≥n de alianzas y vendettas entre los jugadores que puede llegar a dar de s√≠ y la poca influencia que puede ejercer la suerte hace, a mi parecer, que Juego de Tronos sea el juego de los juegos. El juego tiene bastantes aspectos a tener en cuenta sin hacerlo excesivamente pesado o sesudo. Obliga a llegar a acuerdos o dialogar con otros jugadores si se quiere avanzar en el objetivo. Adem√°s ofrece momentos de tensi√≥n y risas cuando, por ejemplo, surgen los choques de reyes para pujar por las mejores posiciones en las 3 areas de influencia, o cuando los Salvajes atacan. Pero claro, no todo el monte es or√©gano. Alguna casa est√° bastante descompensada respecto a las dem√°s (como por ejemplo, la casa negra y amarilla) en cuanto a la brutalidad de sus cartas y/o ventaja en la salida inicial. De hecho, la isla desde donde sale el jugador negro (s√≥lo en partidas de 5 jugadores), es un aut√©ntico fort√≠n muy dificil de conquistar a no ser que el jugador negro haga el cafre. Pero a√∫n a sabiendas de esto, el juego sigue siendo de lo mejorcito a lo que he jugado nunca. Ya se ver√° si alg√∫n d√≠a se publica en castellano alguna de las 2 expansiones que el juego tiene en el mercado norteamericano, que entre otras cosas incluye modificaciones en el tablero, 1 nuevo jugador, y a√±ade nuevas reglas y elementos como las caravanas, las fortificaciones y las armas de asedio.

Sometimes I find myself wanting to play Game of Thrones more than I end up enjoying it. The setting and the negotiations are excellent, but the game can fall flat and at least for one power it usually does. Biggest problem is the random mustering that may never come or an early mistake that puts you in an position where your influence over the game is limited. In a shorter game it wouldn't be as big an issue, but in a game this long it can be a problem. I still like the game for when there's six players up for the challenge. Also the first expansion is a must.

Nice cross between Diplomacy-style wheeling/dealing and Euro-esque order placement.  Trying to outguess an opponent's moves is key... certainly adds the pressure!  High replayability due to the randomness of the cards (some games may not have many Musters, some may have more, etc).  Some balance issues between the factions, and naturally, since it's a war game (lite), there's possible player elimination.

OK game that is much improved with the Clash of Kings expansion.  Rating of 5 includes playing with Clash of Kings, otherwise, I'd rate the base game a 4.

I have patiently waited for AGOT to get back in stock... in the meantime I stumbled across the book at a used book store, and my oh my, one of the best fantasy books of all time.  I really was now anticipating this game and finally got it.
Clear and conscise rules, great map, great components.  Game play was fantastic!  I would have rated this a 10, but for the lack of ports, which can severly cripple certain players.  I played all my games with the first expansion, fixing the port problem.  The order system, with the ranking of the houses on the three tracks is brilliant, and very engaging.  Combat cards add a nice element of suspense (we play were you can't look at discards or discuss hands, unless you play a combat card that lets you do so)  GRR Martin can be proud of the quality and fun factor for AGOT

While not terribly exciting, the game is good. The meeples, shiples (ships), and kneeples (knights), are nice, but not terribly interesting. I'd actually prefer more detailed plastic minis. The rest of the components, especially the cards, are very well done.

Played once.  My first game of this took approximately five hours to play (including rules), and I don't know if it was the sub-par rules explanation, the extraordinarily slow play, the fact that we had six players, or the constant references to events in the books that went right over my head (I've never read the books), but this was just about the slowest and least interesting five hours of my recent gaming life.  While the basic mechanics of the game seem OK (take over territories to get resources to allow you to build armies to take over more territories), there's enough randomness (e.g., the ability to build armies on any given turn is completely luck-dependent), chaos (each player chooses a card from their hand to support their troops in battle; these cards are unique to each player and have so many special abilities that attempting to predict victory in a battle is nearly impossible), kingmaking (deals between players are encouraged, and ties for some game elements are broken by one person based solely on their whim, not a rule), and unfair start positioning (black's ability to build a strong navy quickly and then control an entire portion of the coast seems unbalanced) to make the game not at all worth the four or five hours it took to play.  

The game has a tremendous volume of rules to go along with it, and while I'm fine with lots of rules, having a player aid or some sort of rules summary would have drastically aided gameplay.  Even after an eternity of rules explanation I and others at my table were still confused about what certain items did and where things could be played, and the winner of our game was decided not by strategy but by a player misremembering a few minor rules (and thus planning their final turn incorrectly).  It was not the type of ending you want after five hours.  

I also found the theme to be entirely uninteresting (probably because I've never read the books), and wonder how much of people's enjoyment of this game is based on the fact that they enjoyed the books rather then that they enjoy the mechanics (as games like Wallenstein, Shogun, Age of Steam, and El Grande have this game beat by far in terms of balanced gameplay).

This came is too much at the mercy of the event cards. If mustering doesn't show up till 6 or 7 rounds through the game it gets very boring while you essentially wait for more troops.

RATING: 8
Use your armies to expand your lands, armies and power to control most victory areas in Westeros.

Plays: A couple.
Type: Thematic Wargame = a theme-driven game where you move military forces on a map to destroy other military forces and/or conquer territory. Area movement style. Strategic scale.
Complexity: Medium.
# of players: 5.
Playing time: 300 mins.
Player interaction: Conflict and Diplomacy.
Randomness: Low ‚Äì card draw, but cards have board effects that you can prepare for.

Replayability: Very high. The assymetrical starting positions just beg for repeated plays to explore the strategies of the different houses. Every game will be different depending on the diplomatic balance. There is also depth to explore.
Fun: I‚Äôm a big fan of multi-player wargames in general and of simultaneous order selection in particular, and this is a home run for me. So much fun with diplomacy and backstabbing, and the perfect theme to go with such a game. Even more fun now that more people know the backstory from the TV-series.
Memorability: Very high. You‚Äôll definitely remember the alliances made and broken and the shifting fortunes of war. The theme shines here as well, making it sound like you‚Äôre part of the novels (or the TV-series) when you regale your friends with the tale of your latest victory.

Thematic integration: Very high.
Components: Very good. The map of Westeros is gorgeous and the pieces and chits are of good quality with good art.

Who will like this: Gamers that want a multi-player wargame need look no further. The theme is icing on the cake for those that like it, but you don‚Äôt need to to enjoy the game.

One of the great multiplayer wargames with simple rules. Just the kind of game i like. War, good theme, influence and management of (few in here) resources. Playable in 2 to 4 hours, if you consider it a wargame and don't spend your time negotiating alliances. 2008: Just finished reading the books published to date. Great adaptation of the theme!
4 or 5 players.

The best multi-player negotiation & conquest game I've seen yet.

RATING: 9
Intense, complex, and full of conflict-based player interaction. Having played this game several more times, I still absolutely love it, but I feel that, like Diplomacy, your starting House determines a lot of your overall success in the game (Lannister for example pretty much gets the shaft, while Stark can usually dominate the north and then sweep down near the end of the game for the win.) These issues are essentially fixed in the Clash of Kings expansion, making it a must, even if only playing a five-player game.

This is yet another game rated highly by the teenagers in the gaming club. Although it's a bit rough explaining all the rules, etc, once they understand how everything works, the game chugs along quickly, and we can usually finish in two or three hours. Some kids are intimidated by the high degree of conflict, but there are enough kids in the club overall that it's not an issue.

Nearly a 9, but it's long and you can be really messed up by a inopportune series of cards. My first game I felt I was poised to take control of it in the middle of the game, but none of the "Clash of Kings" cards came up to give me the chance to exert that control, so I was mired in last place. But a great semi-wargame in the tradition of Borderlands and Dune.

Before selling it and after playing many games we would try ( with my friends ) the 9 players version but we don't had the money to buy the expansion and the time to play it so we didn't make it. Maybe in the future.

It was extremely similar to Chaos in the Old Word. Problem is, Chaos is Waaaaay more fun and an overall better game. 
It wasn't as long as I thought it would be and once we got it going the mechanics were like clockwork. Played 4 players, Baratheon was not as close to the other players on the board, away from most of the conflict and ended up winning due to this. I felt sorry for the Greyjoys player who was caught inbetween Lannister and Stark and wasn't able to do much be involved with keeping the three of them at bay of each other while Baratheon ran the board. I was trying to be aggressive towards Baratheon, but kept getting torched. Would like to play again, but not sure how I would play differently.

At the time of these original comments it is ranked #69.  69? Really?  There are far better games not even in the Top 100.  Too long to play.  Too unbalanced to strategize.  Too much kingmaking or one-mistep-and-and-your out to enjoy.  I need to read the books . . . maybe then I would enjoy it more. . .

Having said all that . . . this is Diplomacy on steriods and a must get, if you have read (and enjoy) the books and enjoy Diplomacy!

RATING: 4
A definite disappointment after all these high reviews!  I'm a Diplomacy addict but interested in all strategy games that experiment with different diceless combat systems.  But how fiddly!  Everyone seems to think this is some kind of improvement over Diplomacy!  How can that be?  You can't have any long-term strategy or planning due to some random Westros card which will ruin all your plans and punish you for planning at all.  Not to mention that four experienced boardgamers had quite a time getting a handle on the rules, which are just too finicky.  Two of us felt:  why should we care?  But a nice try all the same; I'm just shocked that veteran strategy/boardgamers prefer this to Diplomacy or AH's Dune!UPDATE:  Lowered to a 5.5 until I play again.  Too many worthier games out there that don't gall me.UPDATE 2:  It's now a 4.  Only without another good strategy game within hailing distance would I pull this one out.  I am truly, truly, truly and deeply mystified at this game's popularity, especially among my own friends.  Two games in and I'm totally bewildered.

7.5 based on one 4-player game. Some very interesting mechanics, especially the order placement, supply rules and influence rules. It seems that the random availability of mustering and supply adjustment may make it very difficult for some houses, although players can gang up to check the leader. At first, all the mechanics of supply and movement seem to distract players from forming their strategy, but this will probably go away with more plays. It took us almost 3 hours just to get halfway through our first game. There didn't appear to be much diplomacy or trading of provinces, either. 
Looking forward to playing this again.

Great theme, great strategy game.  Big plus the way turns go, there's hardly any downtime.  Very immersive for 5 players.  I can't find anything wrong to say about the system.  It gets a bit skewed with 4 and worse with 3 players because then certain houses get a starting advantage, but since I look at it as something to play with 5 anyway, I don't really care.  Anyway, I would still play it with 4 or 3 just because I so love the game, and damned the skewdness ;-).

An interesting twist on Diplomacy. The order tokens are the core design feature, trading off the set in stone quality of orders (since tokens don't reveal the target of attacks/supports) for a much quicker planning phase. Most the others parts, however, feel very FFG: modularity for the sake of it that adds little actual gameplay value compared to how much it makes the game longer and fiddlier. Combat cards are swingy and worth at least half an army by themselves (and were probably only implemented in order to shoehorn book characters into the box), the differing supply/gold of each regions mostly provides us with accounting, random events cards do random things, etc. Plus I don't trust FFG to have put a lot of care in the factions' balance. Amongst those additions I quite like, however, the election phase; possibly because blind bidding is very low on the rules department but very high on the players involvement one. Which is not enough to make me overlook all the ameritrash stuff, but is nice since it gives far apart players a layer of interaction.

If you want to play A Game of Thrones, please note that the base game becomes pretty much broken once a player establishes naval domination on a part of the map; ask people for the harbour rules of the first expansion. (By the way if you're wondering, the rulebook is as messy as usual for FFG.)

RATING: 8
This game is hotness, and currently my favorite game. It takes what I love from Diplomacy and turns it into possibly an even more interesting game. Although the negotiation and backstabbing is a bit watered down from Diplomacy, it is replaced by a ton of other cool stuff. I love the book series too, which only makes it better, but you certainly wouldn't have to like the series. It's strange though, I'm not tempted by the expansions, I like the game exactly as it is. My only complaint is that it seems that the same two houses always win...

UPDATE: This was my only 10, but my friends and I are starting to realize more and more how unlikely it is for Lannister to win, or Baratheon/Greyjoy to lose, and although I love it to pieces, it's really a shame that the balance is off, and I can no longer justify the 10. Perhaps I'll look into some of the suggested variants.

This game has a lot going for it but ultimately fails. The first problem is I don't have a good group for Diplomacy-type games. Ok, not the game's fault, but the second problem is it feels like the map really restricts your options. There's not a lot of space to maneuver in, and the power of naval units is (unthematically) over-emphasized, causing portions of the board to stagnate too early.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's as though someone took Diplomacy, bred it with a Eurogame, and it gave birth to this title which plays extremely well with less people.  The only possible problem is that the random event cards can sometimes make playing tricky since you can only build armies as a result of them, but that can also be a benefit since they affect all players equally and make each game a little bit different.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Based on George Martin's novels, players simultaneously put action tokens on their units to 1)move/attack, 2) support, 3) earn money, 4) raid, 5) defend better.  Attacks are modified from a player's set of cards, in which one has to manage since a card played can only be replenished when the deck is reshuffled, after all cards have been played.  I have only played a 4 player game, but the game seems to be designed for exactly 5 players. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While not the strongest of Fantasy Flight's more epic scale games, Game of Thrones is an extremely fun game. It suffers somewhat from pacing and the mechanics intertwining with the theme have areas that in retrospect could be stronger. More lavish components such as post 2005 FFG games may also have helped. However, you're still left with a game that very thematically uses diplomacy and simultaneous action selection--one of the best and most underused mechanics in large scale games. I wouldn't always be in the mood to play this game over other war/conquest games but I often would. A strong entry all around.

Again, the everything is negotiable (with minor limits) makes for a really interesting game. And the fact that one can stab anyone in the back at anytime makes it fun. Just don't play with your significant other if you wish to remain together.

Good theme, especially if you like the books.  I do like this game, quite a little bit.  The time and weight of the game seems to be of an appropriate mix.  A little disappointed about the winning factor.  That is, the second that the last city (7 I think?, or 5) is taken, game over.  No chance for the other factions to take it back.  Still very enjoyable though.

It combines the tension and the theme of a wargame with the fun of a German game. Recommended.

UPDATE: due to his long playing time and the fact that it doesn't scale well (not so nice with fewer players) I play this game very rarely, so I have decreased my rating.

RATING: 4
Far too long and far too fiddly. Downtime between turns is an absolute killer. This game has been superseded by Runewars in every possible way. The thematic constraints also don't do any favours to this design (eg. needs 6 players, same map board every time, etc.).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Hard to be impartial, as I love the book series, but this is still a great game: management of a realm, lots of intrigue, bidding, interactive turns, random events but no randomizer in battles, and a game where diplomacy and skill tell, rather than the rolls of random dice. Even with the ports problem, I still give this game the highest rating. I consider this one of the best "War over a Realm" games out there, far better than Warrior Kings or Bloody Royale and their ilk.

Never have so many fists slammed into a gaming table.  I don't know what is going on with this in my group.  The games I have played were marred by one player becoming disinterested while the other players waged war over every little thing.  The game did not break as a result of this play, but...

Played once, years ago in 2005, having never read the story Game Of Thrones is based on. Enjoyed it enough that, when the TV series came out and all my friends were talking about it, I seized the opportunity to capitalize on their interest and play it again, although I purchased the 2nd Edition, not the 1st.

RATING: 7
After playing the game for the second time, the support option seems to be too powerful. Also the game tends to freeze at round six where everybody is watching that no one gets 7 cities. Once you are down to less than 3 cities it is impossible to recover.

RATING: 4
I love the book series and I love the show.  I did not like this game.  I am not big on games that promote you to lie, or team up and turn on each other at the last minute.  Some areas were better to start in than others, combat was handled strangely with neighboring areas, and I remember the card plays also being strange to me.  Strange in a bad way.  I would play again with the right group, but ultimately not a game for me.

Wow.  Gets my wargame ya-yas out in less than 2.  The randomness of mustering forces you to call your shots very carefully.  It's Diplomacy without the end-game, which works out great.

Still, it's a Fantasy Flight game, and as a result I'm sure that I missed a rule somewhere.

A low luck, high politics game. Another Fantasy Flight Production where fighting and winning don't necessarily go hand in hand. Mechanics are simple but deep, and there's always a way to move things to your advantage. Unfortunately, the houses seem pretty unbalanced - Baratheon starts off in a great position and can easily keep it, while Greyjoy and/or Lannister tend to get shafted.

RATING: 2
I'm really not a fan of this game. First, your ability to build and increase your army size is completely dependent on random card draws. Without knowing when you can get more armies, you have no idea how valuable your few starting armies are. This uncertainty almost inevitably leads to stagnation in the game as nobody wants to take the risk of attacking and everyone just ends up defending their areas until the random supply or mustering comes along. The need to constantly negotiate and plot with and against the other players just isn't fun for me. I prefer to be able to strengthen my own position without having to con other players into helping me out. While I enjoy the hidden orders mechanic, the rest of the negatives keep me away from this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impression: Most of the elements in the game I liked. But torches are bugging me because the too easily create a stale mate type of a situations. It may not be a long time but even a round or two twice in a row when you can't do too much feels annoying.  Length is somewhat of a issue for me. It still takes at least 3 hours with my gaming speed to play through. 
Game might not be balanced because of very asymmetric starting position but it felt ok. Experienced players probably balance this a bit with negotiations and deals. In general the players should be on a same level because it seems very easy to make crucial mistakes that give too much power to someone (else).

RATING: 8
A rules-light wargame that focuses on supply and limited the other guy's access to resources. The card play allows for adding an interesting factor to the gameplay. The movement and action is quick and furious. Really captures Martin's world within the limited scope of a fairly simple board game, which says a lot about the brilliance of the design.

NOTE: this is not a standard wargame, but more of Euro take on it. Fun for both EuroSnoots (like me) and wargamers (like I used to be).

Apprezzatissimo gioco fantasy di battaglie e conquiste. Distribuzione random degli eserciti con specifici e differenti poteri. Il tabellone risulter√† presto intasato e cominceranno le battaglie. Il pericolo √® che chi si trova a nord non potr√† interagire con chi ha le truppe a sud o peggio ancora che due eserciti si contrastino molto lasciando via libera a chi gioca un solitario avendo a disposizione un territorio pi√π ampio.

In a way similar to Diplomacy, but a different theme. Alliances are required to win the game, but can ruin it at the same time.

The game has a fairly steep learning curve: You HAVE to know the house cards, otherwise you can only win by negotiation. It's a long game, and I was told it's unbalanced if not played with full players.

UPDATE: I have to revise my former rating as I came to realise that the game failed because of specific dynamics in our individual group. I hope to get it played soon. I already see it rising really high in case the next play is going to be a success.

RATING: 4.5
A bit too long for what is otherwise a good game. Nice mechanics but a steep learning curve. Some AP, but a good Waro to play every now and then.

Edit: Mar 2010:

I think Starcraft is just outright better. Play that instead. The only reason to play AGOT over SC is the book theme. But theme does not matter to me, and I have not read the books.

What do I not like:

* The mustering (Troop production) is random. The last game I played there were only 2 mustering cards all game, both of which were early on (about turn 2/3 and 4/5). I got a slight territory lead in the mid game and things were looking good (5 Castles, playing as Green), but had lost a couple of units so was spread thin.

Things went downhill from there, with my territories getting eroded and without sufficient units or any way of getting more units, I don't know what else I could have done beyond praying for a mustering card. 

On the last turn I made a few desperate gambles that had a low chance of success. They failed which should have left me at 2 points, except I made a foolish blunder, leaving me at one point.    

* King-making towards the end. AKA Diplomacy. The player who wins is the one who got picked on the least.
* It's a War-game (I just don't get excited about killing things).
* Players can be out of contention early (though this may be a problem with the players rather than a problem with the game).

Nice game, mostly like diplomacy (which I dont like), but this game plays well. Only played it twice up to now though. No dice to resolve the combat, which is always a good sign. The only bit I didnt like was the imbalance in the 5 players. Some positions are just better than others.  I also didnt like the randomness of the cards coming out - came up with a house rule for this, which then appeared in the expansion set. :)

Mostly I think this game is pretty amazing. So why a 7? Because Lannister is, IMO, unfun to get stuck with. I get that it's an asymmetrical game. I do! I've played many many asymmetrical games but...damn. Getting stuck with Lannister means you only get to win if someone else's poor play allows it. If nobody's willing to step up and protect you, there is no stopping Greyjoy or Stark from coming through and having your lunch. This leads to the game opening being "solved", at least in our local group, in that Stark must agree to harass Greyjoy (possibly at their own expense) so that Lannister can team up with someone else to beat on Baratheon.

None of this makes any sense if you haven't played it. We play with the expansion and pretty much everything turned on, and if it's a 4p game or a 5p sans Greyjoy, it's all good. It might not be Lannister's problem, truth be told. It might just be that having Greyjoy and Lannister on the same map just sucks. It also feels utterly unlike the books.

Looking forward to the new edition of this.

RATING: 7
The pace feels about right for what it was. I was thinking all the way through, hmmm:
- movement, units and support rules from Diplomacy
- add resources to supply centres a la Borderlands (& Mare Nostrum & Wallenstein)
- steal the pre-ordering of defined functions from Wallenstein (& crowns=wheat)
- pinch the combat cards from LotR: Confrontation

et voila, some pretty good heritage.

I was expecting more real alliance Diplomacy however, but really it's like any other multi-player wargame where you agree shared boundaries, and pick your time for breaking them to shoot for the win. We don't see real joint alliance play where two players combine to wipe someone out, then move on to the next objective. Maybe that's just our group think though. Too nicey nice.

But if you want to play a bash up the leader multi-player wargame, this played easily and enjoyably. But the experience for me wasn't much different from Mare Nostrum or any of the others.

Bad things first:

I'm really disappointed with the quality of the components. Cardboard (all the counters) are of under-average quality, they're not as compressed as the ones made for generally any German publisher, as well as the wood, it's not as good in quality as the German pieces.

Also, the action counters (move, defend, support, etc) share all the same back for each house (the house crest), but they have been printed on one stance on the front side, and some counters from the same house have been printed on the reverse side, this means that if players actually pay attention to detail, they can guess pretty well which actions that particular player is going to use during a turn... most importantly: where!!! That was quite a no no in my book of perfection!

SO FAR I'M NOT CONVINCED ABOUT PRODUCTS MADE IN CHINA. THESE HAVE BEEN OF CLEARLY INFERIOR QUALITY.

As for the game per se, I had a go on a 3-player game and now one more on a 4-player game. You can get a much better idea of what the game is about, but still! This is a 5-player game! The problem with less then 5 players is that there is at least one faction that is going to benefit from the absence of any of the other elements! This gives some advantage.

Still! Loved the tension the game mechanics create. There are very limited resources (meaning especially the planing chips) You look at the board and see dozens of possible options, but know that your action counters are not going to let you do them all, so decision making is very painful. In that regard I loved the game. Nevertheless, I will play it two or three more times (after all the rules are settled) before giving a definite score.

A friend of mine summed this game up in one sentence after our first play, and I find it horribly accurate - "It's more the Game of Games than the Game of Thrones."  The game itself borrows mechanics from numerous previous games, which isn't bad.  But the theme of the books doesn't carry through very strongly into the game itself so the mechanics stand out more than the game play.

The game is fun to play with a great deal of player interaction, but it has its holes (like not being able to build ships when you lose control of a sea zone) with perhaps too much reliance on randomness with the event cards.  We'll play it, but it often loses out to other games.

A game based on a great series. Lots of fun, but a little too predictable strategy wise like risk. In our group opening moves are almost set in stone.

The main mechanic is that you place orders on each area for which you have troops and then use those troops to either move (and possibly battle), support others, gain influence tokens or defend. But there is so much that goes with that. The play is asymmetric so each house has its own strengths and weaknesses due to their location and battle cards as well as their starting influence on the three influence tracks. Each game is unique and the interaction between players is significant. This is a must try regardless of whether you like the books/show.

Based on the first 2 games, I really liked this game, only problem was I rarely play with 5 players.  Great tension and I like the planning mechanism.  Lots of diplomacy and back-stabbing, so it should be played with the right group.
However, the 3rd game I played, it was turn 8 or 9 before we got a muster card, so the game was pretty boring.  I reduced my inital rating of "9" to "6" based on this game.

A build up and fight game with George R. R. Martin's novels as the background. There are some clever ideas here and some less inspired stuff. Mustering and supply are too important to be unpredictable, for instance. And the game lasts a little longer than it should, in my opinion.

But it's still a good game and a must have for those who read and enjoyed the novels.

Beautiful and interesting game. Too bad that it is only balanced with five players. 

Order mechanics is interesting one, and leaves quite a lot of room for negotiations and backstabbing.
I don't like the power-token bidding though.

The best war game we currently have.
Great strategy.
Only complaint is the static map and starting positions.
Every game sees about the same choking points.
We always play with the ports from the expansion.
If you really want a brain burner then play the 6 player game with 3 persons, 2 families each! Group so that noone has two families next to each other.  Fantastic! But takes a while...

(5+ plays)

Who can play?  Strategy game for 3-6 players.

There is a lot of substance to this game.  Auctions, simultaneous orders, battle cards, and a big beautiful gameboard.  There aren't too many bits to look after, which is admirable for a game of this scope.  Once everyone knows what they are doing, this game can get INTENSE.  This is good, because I can't say that about many games.  And maybe no others that people actually want to play.  There is constant back-stabbing, constantly shifting alliances.  Lot's of thinking about moves, talking players into and out of different moves.  Great strategy options, and yet a simple system with not a single rule question, problem, or argument.

1 Play: One three player game.  Our first game so it moved along slowly.  I could tell it would be a much better game with five or even four players.  The Lannisters seemed kind of crunched.  I absolutely love the books.

I'm no big on backstabbing and negotiation in games, and I can tell that is where the fun is here. Would love to try this with the full complement of players.

RATING: N/A
Nice wargame, where all orders are given secretly and simultaneously. Map doesn't feel balanced, giving house Baratheon a bit stronger starting position than the others. However once everyone knows this after a few games, it tends to balance itself out.
Strongly recommend the Harbors optional rule from one of the expansion.

RATING: N/A
I'm positively biaised for the theme. You need to exploit negotiation to get the maximum out of this game. If everyone goes solo, it can get a little tit for tat. Although the faction cards are a good idea, they often simply cancel themselves out and factions have uneven perks. Despite these flaws, I like the stress of capturing counties for resources and the fight/support system makes it imperative to anticipate the movements/actions of everyone on the field.

A good game, but it can prove to be a little long. Unfortunately, it doesn't come out all that much in my group. Hence, strategies are easily forgotten, and Baratheon usually snatches up a few unattended castles in one turn and brings the game to a screeching halt before it's begun, as everyone is sidetracked. It also seems that the base game is a touch unbalanced, with some houses being set up with a much easier win than others. A game that doesn't encourage alliances, but actually REQUIRES that certain houses work together.

Reminds me of Dimplomacy, but a lot more complicated.  It takes a lot of thinking.  The game lends itself to well-planned attacking, not mass troop movement like Risk.  The more we play, the more we realize the game is not well-balanced.  Negotiations are necessary for some of the factions to even have a shot at winning.

RATING: 8
This used to be one of my all-time favorite games when it first came out.  I still think it's an excellent game and have no intention of upgrading to the second edition.  An elegant marriage of a simple rule set with a surprising depth of strategy.  

That said it's not perfect.  The much-discussed imbalance in starting position (Lannister is all but doomed with five players) and the Westoros decks can be cruel and produce some frustrating game situations if the cards come out in a bad order.

Much to like too, the combat is tense and interesting.  The small number of units you have (combined with the fact you never know how long it will be til more units enter play as well as the Supply track) make this feel very different than most war games.  The hand management aspect lends some interesting situations as well; knowing when and how to lose battles so you can replenish your hand is a difficult tactic to master.

So it has its flaws, but I still love it.

I've played this once with a group of 4 other new players.  Rules explanation went quickly.  The game lasted about 3.5 hours.  Game play was smooth and fun.  Everyone was very positive about the game and we're looking forward to playing again.

Great game.  Provides incentives for strong players to keep weaker players in the game, staving off elimination issues so frequent with 3+ player wargames.  Not too long, not too short, tactics trump army size.  Rules are simple enough for a wargame, but complex enough that you get a feeling you're doing more than just running around killing people.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A new conquest game for me but with familiar elements: card events and programming of your military actions gives an overall Wallenstein feel, with combat resolved a la LotR's Confrontation; as well as conflict from opponents there is a game threat from over the border(similar to Settler's Barbarians/historical scenario) which all players need to contribute power for rewards or suffer consequences for failure. Power is money (which transfers from a reserve to fluid assets like the cabelleros in El Grande) which you use to bid for benefits like going first, plus 1 in a battle, change 1 order. I heard the rumour of diplomacy being a feature so was hesitant in playing the game, but with 3 there was no real sense of looming underhandedness. Maybe interested in playing with more, as there were some interesting movement/avenues of attack, but the diplomacy hook doesn't grabbed me (or the potential elimination).

A lot of new, more compelling 'dudes on the map' games have come out in the last few years. Although thinking about this game makes me sentimental, ultimately this game always winds up a turtling contest until the last turn when everyone makes their move. Sure, there's usually a little jockeying back and forth for a spot here or there, but the map creates natural defensible borders, and if players start conflicts too early, they always see their neighbor on the other side move in. I suppose that's thematic, but the game is too long an experience for something that really boils down to 2 important turns right at the end.

This game really does fix a lot of the problems with popular wargames in that it is impossible to do a cold war approach and it forces players to actually war with each other.

Subtracted points for punishing players who want to experiment and just see what happens when they do this ...

I've only played this once so far but I love it.  It has the same limited resource style of combat that Diplomacy has, along with the same intricate alliances and back-stabbing.  However, on top of that I love the orders mechanic and theme so much.

The only real problem I have with the deck is the Westeros phase and the variability of what will happen within that.  The game I played didn't get any Muster cards until turn 5 and it was really frustrating not being able to accomplish any of the goals you set out for at the beginning of the game.

RATING: 5
One five-player game. Haven't even heard of the books. Too long with too little action. The ganging up that occurs will squeeze out the mid-board players (I don't know the cute fictional name; I was green, in the South). Hurt feelings from receiving the administration of slow torturous death made this a game I voted on terminating after turn 7. This is a game to be played by people who want to release pent up frustrations since kicking the dog is currently frowned upon.

I just can't get into this game for some reason. The theme is decent and the interaction between players is really good as well. I just don't like the abstracted feeling of control within the game.

RATING: 5
This feels like it's so close to being a great game, but it's just missing somethings. The mustering and supply cards are too random, which mean that making plans for future turns isn't that easy. There's no incentive to backstab my "ally" for supply barrels, since the card may never show up again. Further, you have to count on mustering cards showing up at the right time. Ship transport is overpowered. If you lose your access to the seas, you are done in this game. It probably would be a lot better with a Diplomacy-style negotiation phase, but none of the people I've played with want that and barely make any table talk. Since after the 1st turn almost everyone is 2 or 3 cities away from winning, it's hard to identify a leader even though the game turns into a bash-the-leader-fest immediately.

I'd play this again with a group that really got into negotiating and alliances, but then I'd just rather play Diplomacy if it's going to that extent.

An interesting update on the simultaenous action idea of Diplomacy with a spiced up setting that does a lot for A Game of Thrones fans and not much for people who have not read the book (like me), the game mechanisms are easier and more streamlined when compared to Diplomacy but it would be a stretch to call them elegant. The game is balanced not by in-game mechanisms (catch-up) but by the players itself and that is something I don't really like about wargames, and Game of Thrones for that matter. Once a player is behind, he is dependent on the mercy of others if he ever wants to catch up again and even if he does, he will be hard pressed to play a role in the outcome of the game as a whole. Apart from that, an okay game but boiling down a fantasy saga into nothing but a sophisticated risk variant does not really appeal to me. Like all games of this type, I enjoy the company more than the game itself.

Aprl 2012: Down from 7 to 4. I just don't enjoy playing this. Too long and gamey.

Dec. 2011: Still a 7. It feels a bit gamey (i.e. auctioning for turn order, tie break, and ability to play bonus actions) 

Dec. 2007: Tentative 7 after one play.

Components: Excellent, but the game needs player screens!

Diplomacy-esque game with lots of thematic chrome, which is a good thing.

I admire its design:
* Quick player turns
* Unique economic system: power tokens are used as control markers, to bid for special powers, and one more reason I have forgotten
* Luck free (but not perfect information) combat resolution

Why I probably won't play this game very frequently
* It's a long game
* Game is better with more players, which for me is difficult to find for a game of this length and complexity
* I seem to have a hard time warming up to multi-player war games
* Most importantly, I seem incapable of playing games with lots of special cards and special powers. I have an abstract gamer's mind, and I find it difficult to process the network of relationships between these special powers. Of course, time and experience will remedy this, but there are too many games out there!

This game was interesting to play.  First of all there will be conflict.  Diplomacy is a must either through conversation, intimidation or both.  The game in which we played was diplomacy purely through intimidation of force.  No one aligned with anyone else.  Alignments would have changed the dynamics of the game.

To be fair, I don't think we've actually completed a game of A Game of Thrones.  That was weird to type, and I'll bet it was weird to read.  Anyway, the mechanics seem sound, and I very much like the idea of including purposeful deception as a means of victory.  Everyone gets a pretty good laugh when you manage to royally screw your opponent who was counting on you to back them up, all while lining your own coffers.  Unfortunately, it just didn't play as well as it feels like it should.  I know that's a nebulous comment, but we simply didn't have much fun playing this one.  Also, and this is a purely subjective point of view, but I greatly disliked the sword, throne, and crow tokens.  They felt less like game pieces and more like Trapper Keeper decorations.

I bought this because I am a huge fan of the novels. Played the first 4 rounds of the game as a learning experience with 3 others who were new to the game and one person who had played it. I guess I am just not a wargammer, nor I am I the type of person who can play Lanister to the extent that it should be. I'll probably play again sometime, but not too likely to pick up the expansions at this point.

It's a good theme applied to a bad game.  You can go round after round of not drawing a muster card or a supply card, both of which are crucial to force building.  This game plain flounders when you play the game by the rules as they were printed. They are trying to polish this game with the release of expansions, but they won't get me to buy the original or its expansions after the several bad sessions I have already played.

I think AGoT has some really good mechanisms and has a good measure of brain burning and negotiation goodness with the placement of orders. however, i feel that the game is marred by the random event cards. sometimes, you can go a whole game without mustering troops or without bidding for turn order, which can make the game slightly tedious and seemingly broken. man, i really wish that certain major and important game actions weren't determined by a random card draws. otherwise i think i would rate this game a 9 or 10, because i feel the game is SO close to being flawlessly designed. really, this one's a heartbreaker.

Some really nice mechanics here. I was also happy to find diplomacy takes a back seat - I don't really like diplomacy games. Fair bit to consider and the second guessing and bluffing creates a good deal of tension. I think I would have preferred dice for combat. The combat cards are a bit too cerebral for my liking! If the game takes longer than three hours, as some games do, I've usually had enough.

One of the better non-historical wargames mechanically--fast and keeps perfectly with the setting... each player represents one of the Westernos factions... assign orders to each of your units during the planning phase, then move, attack, consolidate, or raid... combat is great and there're no dice, instead using cards (representing each of the major characters) to augment unit strength... oh yeah, can't forget the threat from beyond the Wall... not as clunky as a lot of FFG offerings... had so much fun playing this game I started reading the novels... the components are also excellent

A very solid conquest game. I'm not into fantasy and don't know the books, but the game feels great anyways. AGOT offers interesting options and diplomacy between players. It also minimizes luck (only in random events and those affect everybody, no dice). I also like the bidding element and the fact that the map doesn't come too crowded because of supply limits. Game plays logically and is quite easy to get hang of, but decisions can be very hard. Sign of a good game =) However, gametime can be quite long if you play with five players and whole 10 turns. The game works best with 5 players though. All game components are top notch. Highly recommended.

I like the combat system in A Game of Thrones.  Basically each player has a hand of special cards that they secretly and simultaneously select when they are in battle with each other which are added to the on board battle strength to determine the winner of a battle.  It's very cool because it's diceless.  There is little randomness or luck, but a player who wins is one who know his/her opponents.  What will the other people do?  There is a lot of economic play in this otherwise strategical war game.  There are auctions for places of power and for advantages.  A Game of Thrones draws on many different game mechanics and it uses them well, which makes it a pretty interesting game to play.  That being sais, I generally prefer to play something with a little less take that!.  As it is a combat and betrayal game, it's not my usual bag.  But it's a very well done game that's not for me.

Second play, years after the first:  I'm bumping this up one notch (6>7):  the combat system's still a bit more constrained than what I am used to in a wargame, but it is much wild and woollier than Diplomacy!

This game gets points for being easily taught to new players and providing a nice range of strategic choices.  It loses points for the generic wooden game pieces and dry Diplomacy-style combat system.

RATING: 8
I just plain love the tension in this game, the feeling that every choice is difficult because every choice is critical! But after a couple of years of playing it, I've decided that one of the players (House Lannister) is too disadvantaged, and is pretty much guaranteed to have zero chance of winning and a miserable game. (This is true even with the recommended switch of starting positions in the King's Court track.) That makes this game better with four players than with five, because the four-player game improves Lannister's chances considerably.

(Originally rated this a 9; after a few years I reduced it to 8. As much as I admire the design, I've learned that it really is not "my kind" of game. I can rarely get it to the table, and I am no longer very interested in trying. I still enjoy the occasional play when the opportunity arises.)

This game is improved to by the addition of the Ports (which help Lannister some, but not enough) and six-player overlays (optional but wonderful) from the A Clash of Kings expansion.

Great multiplayer military/diplomatic game based on a fantastic book series. Derived from the original diplomacy, it adds great mechanisms to control builds and expansion. The cards add a welcome random element to combat. Players go head to head very quickly after a turn of expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent entry is the "Risk"  super-family of games.  Good points are the opportunity for cunning with chained moves/attacks, the fixed play time, reasonably good variety in play despite fixed starting positions.  Bad is that the variety introduced through the event deck can result in some dull games with no troops, it is possible that a player will be virtually eliminated from turn 1 or 2.  The game is of lowish complexity and flows smoothly, but depends ultimately (like all these games) on inter-player diplomacy - you'll know whether you like this sort of thing.

RATING: 6
I loved the books and so bought this one.  The very first time we played it ended in under 4 hours, I can see how experienced players can finish in 2 to 3 hours.  I think 3 to 4 hours is ideal for a game so this is perfect for me.  Feels like a much improved diplomacy.  Note in 5 player game Greyjoy can beat Lanister, but the errata fixes it.  It does a good job of capturing the feel from the books of the difficulty of building and maintaining multiple armies.  There are beautiful components. 
UPDATE: Lowered my rating to a 7 after a replay.  I now think ships are too powerful.  The map needs more land areas that are not adjacent to the ocean, and River Run should not be adjacent to the western sea (there are cliffs and a small mountain range in the way).  We play that these areas are non-adjacent.
UPDATE: Played again and lowered my rating again, dislike that if you lose your ships on a sea, it is impossible to build up a fleet and come back.  (I'm told that this is fixed in an expansion, but I don't like to have to buy an expansion to fix the basic game.  I'm beginning to think that FFG does not blind test their games.)

Tried writing some house rules to improve this game, gave up and sold it.

A well designed game that completely fails to capture my interest.  The updated Diplomacy orders system is pretty good and the power tracks are a great idea. However, despite all the cool layers and mechanisms, the game is extremely static.  There are so many limitations to expansion - supply limits, unit limits, combat card limits, mustering limits.  It feels like at the end of the game you've taken maybe three or four neighboring territories over.  There is no feeling of conquest.  The combat system, while I'm sure pleasing to the "no luck" crowd, is simply too dry.  It works better in a short game like LOTR Confrontation.  For a longer game like this, I want some drama in the combat and the game fails to deliver.  The luck is put in the wrong place (removed from combat and put into the Westeros cards), which removes any real excitement from the battles.  I guess overall that would be my complaint with the game - it fails to deliver the level of drama that a game like this should.  If you want a great 3 hour wargame, play Mare Nostrum instead.  If you want a negotiation wargame, this game absolutely pales next to its predecessor Diplomacy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
My favorite Fantasy Flight game and one of their most elegant (a lot of their more recent titles are overly complex for my tastes). There are some gameplay issues with the combat cards (addressed in the first expansion), but overall very strong. Overall, an excellent strategy title that I always enjoy playing but not one to introduce to new gamers. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a very good game.  It takes a lot from Diplomacy, and the game format helps break down the timing problems you can run into with Diplomacy.  The extra add-ons improve, rather than detract from the game.

Plus, it's a terrific implementation of the theme.  Oh, how you scheme and plot.

The one disadvantage I've seen with my couple of plays is the relative weakness of the Lannisters.  They start out pretty well screwed, and sooner or later they're going to get pinned between larger opponents and ground down.

RATING: 6.5
Take a classic game (pre-1985) and a theme that is popular, paste on top and add a lot of twiddly bits and fancy counters. Knizia has done it with Stratego, and Fury of Dracula riffs on Scotland Yard. This game pastes a popular set of fantasy novels onto Diplomacy. But one of the problems is are you really creating a good new game. This one has a lot of elements from more complex multiplayer strategy/wargames thrown into the mix (mostly it steals from Warrior Knights) but does that really enhance a game like Diplomacy? I'm not entirely convinced, I don't overly like the addition of random elements and military imbalances (supply/attrition/support/CCC) if the games intention is to favour the negotiation element. 
Having said that, its not a bad game, in fact its quite a fun game, but it does feel like you would need to like the theme to say it was a great game.

RATING: 5
Some of the mechanics are neat (simultaneous orders for instance); however, there&#039;s quite a bit I don&#039;t like about the game:

1. decks are too small resulting in too large of a deviation in the draws - especially when it gets shuffled a few times.
2. the way Generals cycle through is a very ugly mechanic - Most of the battles are way too predictable.
3. Once you start losing, you&#039;re on a road of no return and the game is long with 5 players.
4. Not enough player interaction amongst ALL players.

I&#039;ve only played it once but I&#039;d give it one more shot.

I think the game would play better if it were played like Diplomacy with players strategizing together, but there must be a reason I haven&#039;t played Diplomacy in 15 years... PBEM play would improve the game because of the Diplomacy aspect.

Well, it's a good game, but there something that doesnt fit my tastes: for example there's not enough random, ok too much random can kill a game, but having not enough can kill the fun. In the few plays made, the most interesting part was flipping the cards!  However I like the background, even if Martin novels are better represented by the CCG of Game of Thrones, rather than this board  game, after all the books are about characters, and in the card game, there a lot of characters, way more than in this one.

Major disappointment after one play...just didn't seem to work at all.  Needing the cards for mustering and to enforce the supply limits made it seem like there wasn't much sense to the game.  Will probably try again after reviewing the rules.

Played again didn't enjoy anymore.

RATING: 9
Excellent game.  My main concern is that it won't hit the table as often as I like because it requires a perfect storm of five fairly thick-skinned players who are not afraid of a bit of heaviness and two or three hours.  I suppose four works, but I've liked it far better with five in my limited experience.

Edit 5/07: It's been on the table a lot lately and still love it.  I struggle with some of the asymmetry though.  I have both expansions but haven't tried them yet.

Edit 11/07: Played with SoS and loved that version.  Seems to have better symmetry, is even more fun and gives no reason to ever, ever play the base game with four players again.

Another crossover wargame.  This one I really enjoy despite knowing next to nothing about the books.  I love the low fantasy feel of it, the hidden orders...just about everything.  I can't wait to play it more to get a better feel for what we should be doing.

UPDATE:  After a six-player game (Martell and the ports only), I'm a little concerned that there isn't much "currency" to use in the negotiations.  As Tyrell, I felt pinched between a fickle Lannister (and the Greyjoy he allowed to range south to harass me) and an unreasonable Martell and never felt strong enough to actually threaten or offer much of value to get negotiations going in my favor.  As usual, Baratheon won after an entire game of nobody doing anything whatsoever to check him.  It's becoming a bit of a tired script.  Still, one of the best Euro/light wargame hybrids out there.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.87
Our gameplay group played for this for the first time. The initial rules and setup took a while for us to get right, and the "shuffle up the deck" cards we misplayed initially by not redrawing a new card (since it wasn't clear in the rules, but cleared up in the additional FAQ). Once we got it down we all agreed it was a very fun game, but I would suggest trying to find 1 person who has played before if you play it for the first time.

RATING: 5
I wasn't very impressed with this game. It is overly long and complex for what it is, and whether you do well or not is pretty much entirely dependent on how much you can manipulate the other players into doing what you want them to do. In other words, pretty much exactly the type of game that I dislike.

I like the action pieces. But they kinda confuse me when i place them face down. Its because i can never remember all of them and it becomes hard to prepare my strategy. But the idea is good.

A fantastic startegic game! The Rules aren't very complicated. They're also logical, however rules give you a lot of possibilities!  One of my favourite games.

Nicely represents the "fluff" of the novels. Interesting game mechanics like hidden order tokens for units and income that must be saved for bidding wars on powerful status tracks and for pending invasions of "wildlings" makes for difficult resource decisions.

Combat is a little static with no dice and limited non secret battle cards. However, the mechanics do force negotiated alliances to survive with inevitable backstabbing jsut like the books.

Great mixture of diplomacy, tactics, and resource management.  I like that the diplomacy is important, but you don't have to depend too much on trust, as your supposed ally cannot just roll over you that easily by a backstab. I would probably rate it a 9 if it didn't take 4+ hours to play.

--Dec2003-- I like the synergy of familiar mechanics.  Once players are ramped up, the game plays well.  Westeros cards seem a bit more random than desired - perhaps something slightly more programmed (like the card mechanism of _L√∂wenherz_) would be preferable. Lots to keep track of; fascinating choices.  One to play again and again - with the right crowd!

RATING: 8
Good game. Mechanics are pretty tight and elegant. Only a few complaints:
1.) The board design makes it hard to easily see where everyone stands. Territory icons can easily be lost (or hidden) under units. In almost every game I've played the winning player (including myself a couple of times) won because the other players didn't "see" that the player controlled X cities (or that the player had direct access to such territories). Having the territories with strongholds highlighted (entirely or along their borders) would solve this issue.
2.) The map layout and house imbalances make some houses hard to play, especially if you can't negotiate an alliance (I've seen a few games where players will ally and carve up another player's territory - and there isn't much the attacked player can do. Thematically accurate I suppose, but I can't imagine that this is a satisfying gaming experience for the other player).
3.) Army build-up is entirely random (driven by the draw of a card). This creates too many situations where a game can be decided by a fortunate (or unfortunate) "Muster" draw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
As a dieheart reader of the novel A Song Of Ice And Fire, I have to say I'm a little bit disappointed about AGOT. It copy-paste the mechanic of Diplomacy onto the novel, which only reflects a small part of the essence of GRR Martin's masterpiece. The game manages to stimulate the secret plots and crueless back-stabbing in the novel. However, the game balance, though fixable by diplomacy, is not very good (Greyjoy's fleet over Lannister). And the mechanic of Diplomacy, well, is out of my favour.

[b][u]Painted the miniatures?:[/u][/b] What?! Miniatures?! Yes, I've bought a few boxes of 100 Years Wars English Knights and Infantry by Zvezda to replace the wooden playing pieces (which look very nice too). That was 2 years ago and I've still only painted a set for the Starks and the Baratheons (and 3 figures for the Lannisters). Other projects got in the way...

Very well crafted game. A great depth of strategic possibilities.  Each game session reveals more depth of play.  The FAQ and Fantasy Flight very helpful.  I find that I never tire of playing this game (that might not be the case for the rest of my gaming group).  Bringing new players to the game can be difficult. As a group plays this game more often the strategy and depth of play is better each time. The Clash of Kings expansion is not needed.  I purchased to acqurie the extra house cards.  In general I prefer to have games that can accomodate 6 people if needed.  The ports from the expansion are a definite plus.  Haven't played the other expansion options.

A Waro based on the books by George R. R. Martin. Meeple-like troops, streamlined mechanics, limited options, and a bluffing combat card mechanic all mark this as a Euro game with warlike options. Each turn players place order markers, face down, on the map in areas with at least one of your units in it. Orders are things like move, defend, or support and the units in that area can only do what the order says. Spreading out, leaving influence markers behind to retain control of areas you leave, and controlling castles is the main part of the game. The winner is the first player to control 7 castles, and there aren't too many of them on the board, so the game always feels tight, tense, and has your brain constantly working out possibilities. Making temporary alliances, bidding on 3 special tracks, and working together to bid away the wildlings are secondary features of the game. The action cards that are drawn every round are a neat way to spice things up as well. All in all, I'd say this is a solid multiplayer game of conquest.

Diplomacy-like fantasy wargame, apparently based on some novels or something. Has an interesting dimension of needing power tokens to bid for special privileges. The Westeros cards can be frustrating when they don't cooperate with your plans. High chaos factor, and lots of intrigue.

This game looked like it had everything in it to make me fall in love with it, but this just hasn't happened yet and I don't know why. I'll update after a few more games, but getting the 5 players together is a bit tricky for me at the moment :(. As with Dune, I wish it scaled better.OK, after a few more games, I just find this game a bit dull. Its got so many elements that I like, it just doesn't come together that well and I can't put my finger on the exact problem. Its just...dull. I think I'd prefer it much more as PBEM.

A great game with some non-negligible flaws. First and foremost, it's far from balanced with Baratheon winning more than his share of games. This is firstly because of geography of Westeros and initial placement of troops, and secondly due to disproportionately high power of fleets in the game. It can be to some extent remedied by suitable alliances and by actively building ships by oneself, but you still need unbelievably cooperating opponents to win as Stark, and their below average in power house cards don't help here.  The last flaw is possibility (verging on certainity in Stark's case) of getting completely driven out of the sea. This at least was fixed by introduction of ports in the first expansion, which can be easily introduced in the base game - don't play without them!

Nice combination of mechanics seen in other games to make a great new one.  You can easy figure out the influence of Diplomacy and Republic of Rome, by example.  I've heard that people say that the game is unbalanced playing with less than five and that some houses are better than others even before the game begins.  We haven't note it.  By the contrary, our games have always been very close and we never felt that someone has started with advantage.

I've not read the novels since I prefer history. In a traditional sense this is not my style of game in scope. I don't care for managing resources or economies etc. But I gave it a shot since I played Wallenstein and loved it. Everything in AGoT is well integrated but there is one level of complexity too many for a multi-player game in comparision with Wallenstein.

I'm going to give it a 7 based on the integration of lots of elements and minus 1 for just not my thing.

I would have given this game a higher review but the fact it is filled with so much backstabbing (which I love) it has left a few friends a little peeved at each other after its over, and so we have had to put it on the shelf a few times to let the blood cool after battle.  such a fun game!

Very nice production. The game is a good mix of diplomacy and strategy, but it's a fantasy game and I'm not fussed about the subject. If it was a true map of Scotland, it would be more meaningful, somehow!
Update: Shows my ignorance as I had never heard of the novels (not a fiction reader). Got eliminated in a trial game but bizarrely I enjoyed it more than the first time as there was no off-board diplomacy which spoiled the first game.
The fusion of different mechanics works well.

A good light wargame with an influence auction thrown in.  I've never cared for auction mechanics, but the war game portion is a good one.  I like the concept of the "orders" phase with everyone issuing orders to the toops simultaneously and revelaing together.  The process of executing one "order" in order around the table and repeating until all orders have been completed also gives players a chance to take the initiative or counter-attack instead of being completely overrun as an opponent executes 5 different attacks as in many other table wargames like A&A.  Not bad.  I'd play it iagain, but I'm not sure if I;m ready to buy it, yet.

RATING: 6
Multiplayer territorial-conflict game that works beautifully with 5-6 players because of the simultaneous planning (yet it isn't a complete cluster of player-driven chaos like the planning in Shogun). Take regions for power (to bid in auctions for better positioning), for supply (to support larger armies) and so you can place more orders.

A few weaknesses: some houses will just never meet each other on the field (e.g. Martell and Stark in ACoK map); the rich get richer in this game (since they have more orders, supply etc) to the point of player elimination for some; the combat system works elegantly for 2 players like in LotR: The Confrontation, but can reinforce a bash-the-loser mentality in multiplayer; and the events, which give the game replayability, can be a little uneven sometimes by controlling the timing of such crucial actions as resetting supply and mustering units. Runewars, a game obviously inspired by this game, deals with the last point by making harvesting and recruiting player-driven, and it's a lot more satisfying that way (ACoK also helps with the muster special order).

More on the similarities with Runewars:
 - Power = Influence
 - Routing Units
 - Iron Throne = Primarch of the Wizards' Council
 - Fiefdoms = Commander of the Warriors' Guild
 - Same victory conditions
 - Westeros deck = Season Events
 - Supply = Winter starvation

Also, I feel really sad about the wooden bits. They're functional, but a game this richly infused with a lurid theme needs to look a lot sexier.

One more: the theme is not strongly integrated. The artwork helps convey the setting, but the abstraction in the game does not glue it to the mechanisms. The only attempt is putting character names in the House Cards, but they are forgettably similar, especially the ones that just have sword and fortification icons. Also, one cannot anoint this as a 'negotiation game' or emblematic of the intrigue in the source material when [i]you can't even trade your power tokens[/i]! Seriously considering that as a house rule.

And another: the rich get richer in this game. You can be stuck without a way to win for a loooong time.

Design is a little lower, on the 3 side, due to balance issues. Subsequent expansions and re-issues (Ports, Greyjoy tweak) help to address this. It is still rich-get-richer, however. Very fun when you're contending for the win, and total lameness when you're stuck in no-man's land.

3+3

My favorite game, hands down.

I've played this a huge number of times by now, probably not all that far from getting into the three digit range. From the comments here on BGG it seems this is not a game for everyone, yet it seems I can never go tired of it. Of all the countless people I've introduced to this game, not a single person has disliked it - except the poor fellow we forced to play the Asos expansion without having so much as heard about the base game before.

Have played several times and mostly enjoyed it although it can go for several hours. Doesn't play well with less than 5.

Wargames have never really been my strong-suit and the necessity for allying kind of sank my first game of this.  It basically felt like I sat around for hours and did nothing much.  Perhaps next time I will fare better.   My rating will change at that time based on a more experienced opinion. [6]
-------------------------------------------
I've played Diplomacy and enjoyed it since first playing this game, which I think helps a lot.  Going into the game with a little more knowledge of what it is like certainly makes for an improved experience.  However, the randomness of the events in the game interferes with my enjoyment to some extent.  How significant that is will depend on additional playings of the game.  My current feeling is that the random elements are really too much.  [05/03/2009]

As multi-player wargames go, this one is pretty good. It's really a game of logistics, with some combat that doesn't result in mutual annihilation.

Downsides include length of play, and length of rules explanation. Also, the game has some issues which are pretty much fixed in the expansion.

Best with 5, then 4, then 3 (borderline).

If you play with 4, you should remove Pike. If you play with three, you should use my variant (posted somewhere in the game's forum) because the initial setup is pretty imbalanced.

RATING: 8
A fun game with solid mechanics which involve no luck apart from your (temporary) alliances with other players. If they go well, you'll win battles. If they don't go well you'll lose battles if you can't fall back on your own strength.

I enjoyed playing this - sort of.  The problem with this game, and most other diplomacy style games, is that people's feelings get hurt.

[2 plays] My rating stands at 7, with two plays about four years apart. I like some aspects of this game and have issues with others. The theme is probably more meaningful if you know the stories, otherwise it is a medieval battle for a place that looks like England. The amount of potential diplomacy in the game is high, and treachery and betrayal will occur at some point, which could be a negative. The constant flipping and checking when assigning the order chits gets tiresome. This aspect has a little bit of a Wallenstein feel to it.

In summary, this is a medium/light diplomatic war game that I will happily play when it makes the table and we've got the time. Stark seems like the most well positioned house to win.

Most recent play 3-13-10 at Cabin Con 2010.

RATING: 6
This is what happens when you take the simplicity of Diplomacy, add in layers of chrome (order markers, biddings, resource generation, etc). The end result works but feels a little force fit together.

There is tension and a good group can make this game shine. However, as it stands, it takes a little longer to play than I'd like it to be.

As a fan of the books, I must say that the game doesn't really mesh well with the theme (the units are generic and the character cards don't really represent the ones from the novels). It's just Diplomacy with chrome.

I thought this was an intriguing game, but my chums didn't care for it a whole lot and felt it was too long, but I thought it was pretty cool. A wargame without dice is a fascinating concept. Its a wargame where the focus isn't on numbers, its on the interaction between players (backstabbing and the like). Fascinating.

Since writing that blurb years ago, my appreciation for this game has only grown. The capabilty for player interaction is great. Note, people who are good at manipulating people and/or bluffing will have a large advantage in this game.

The cards cause this game to play differently every time; usually this results in not having enough musters, supply calcuations, or bidding wars come up; I had one game where I passed on bidding the first turn and it literally *never* came up again - I was stuck in last place the whole game. This mechanic is at the same time a strength (different gameplay each play) and a weakness (its diffcult to plan strategy when you have no idea what will come up in the future).

For that kind of game, it's too random for my taste. If I really want to sit for a few hours and push armies around and form and break alliances, there are similar games that have less randomness. It's not a horribly bad game, but there simply exist similar games that are strictly better in every regard (except maybe for not having drawings of my favourite ASoIaF characters in them).

RATING: 6
A diplomacy-style game based on one of my favorite books. I like many of the game mechanics, such as the way orders are given. However, the game discourages early expansion, which leads people to turtle up and pounce on each other in the endgame. You can also be totally screwed by the arbitrary decisions and alliances of other players. Tedious and frustrating, all too often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Definitely one of my favorite games. The theme is beautifully incorporated and the game design is very sleek in itself. Gameplay in Game of Thrones is tight and exiting. You cannot win by brute force alone but have to rely on all the machiavellian arts of diplomacy and backstabbing.

RATING: 8.7
I think this game would become dramatically better with a steady play group.  Players new to AGoT will possibly lead to a boring game.  I like the way the combat system is set up so that casualties aren't too heavy.  There are some notable balance issues amongst the various factions.  With some tweaking I think the balance problems could be resolved.  The majority of the problem lies with House Greyjoy in the 5 player game as it essentially puts House Lannister in a vice from the start.  

A better option might be to make Greyjoy a neutral 6 and to make the Eyrie a playable faction instead.  This would take the heavy pressure off of Lannister and add pressure to House Baratheon (which is probably the strongest faction in a 5 player game.)  The board would have to undergo some modifications as well (in regards to city and stronghold positioning).  Of course, this doesn't follow the story in the books, but I think it would make for a better game.  If I remember correctly House Greyjoy didn't jump into the frey until quite later anyway.

It's good, but not great. I hate it when a game is considered 3-5 player game when it is clearly not! AGOT with three players is like mockery. I'm seriously you guys.

When it works the system is intriguing, when it doesn't the game is dull. In the golden hour, everyone is in contention and it is difficult to get anything accomplished unless you have someone backing you up, ala Diplomacy.  I enjoy this much more than Dip though in that things actually have to happen rather than just lying to each other and just bouncing over and over again.  But when things lag, it is often best just to turtle and collect chits.  

This game does suffer from what I feel is worse than elimination, being beaten into submission, with no way out, and pretending to play the game until someone mercifully eliminates you.  Though at that point you aren't worth the effort, ugh.  

I've got to say that the red faction sucks.  It is just way too easy to get the Malachi Crunch.  The revamped suggestions help a little, but not much.  As usual Fantasy Flight fixes the most problematic part of the game in the expansion--The Port.  But, I feel that the expansion ruins the balance with 8 cards. My suggestion, get a couple round pieces of cardboard and use the port rules online.

The game itself is a bit dry and mathy, and you can see yourself getting crushed a mile away without being able to do anything worthwhile.  It could use a little luck in the battles for my taste.  Contrary to that there is a ton of luck in the mustering/supply phase.  I played one game where only one muster came up (in the 6th round) for the whole game.  Dullsville.  Flukey games are not that outlandish.

It is just too static for my tastes, despite having neat ideas.

I love reading the books because I love reading about horrible things happening. Unfortunately, the game is faithful to the books--and I don't enjoy spending every moment fearing a knife in the back. Other complaints: analysis paralysis, uneven support/muster phases, and general long playtime.

Dear Game of Thrones, thanks for the interesting games.  I wish I could get you on to the game table more often, but you just have rubbed some people the wrong way (and some say you're broken).  Plus, you and I both know that even "2 to 3" hours is an understatement, don't we?  Have a great summer!

The theme made this playable for me, but halfway through I felt like I wanted out.  If you're looking for this type of experience, I'd say to just play Diplomacy.  There's too many clunky mechanics for me in this, things that just seem to draw out the game.  And releasing the first edition without those fixes (the ports) is just inexcusable.  The theme really carried me through and made it okay.

Only played one 4 player game but had a blast.  I have been looking for a game like this for quite a while.  I would like some more complexity to the game and am hoping for the coming expansion to add to this.  I have heard about houses not being equal but we haven't seen it..yet.  I had a lead pretty early in the game and a general alliance hated me back effectively.  The hate the leader part of the game reminds me of Settlers and I consider it to be a good thing.  The rules were written pretty well with great examples but there were quite a few clarifications that I had to seek out here on the geek.  For example, starting supply was no where to be found in the rules.  I am wildly impressed with this game and will adjust the rank, hopefully up, with more plays.  Can't wait to play again, hopefuly with 5! ****have played a few times since with expansions and have adjusted rank up.

RATING: 5
I was really looking forward to this game, strategic play with a theme I love (read the books). Although I had some doubts, because the books are pretty dark fantasy. There is a lot of cutthroat stuff, betrayal and the more you get into it, the less "good characters" you find. It's a political story. So is the game. I think what bothers me most about the game is the political element, you have to make partnerships, offering things and hoping the other person won't stab you in your back when you need him. I'm just not into such a thing. Which would be fine if you could do without it. You can't. If you try to play on your turf, not messing with anyone and just try to make allies in key situations, you're going to lose probably. It's not a bad game and I figure someone who likes negotiations will have a blast with this game. If you don't like tight negotiations that can backfire, you probably won't like it.

About as perfectly executed military / pseudo-euro strategy game I've ever played.  Awesome stuff.

Have yet to grow tired of it after many plays, and still ache to get it on the table more often.

Edit 12/09/09:  Too many people THINK they like GoT, or WANT to like GoT, and just can't admit that it's not a game for them.  If you're prone to AP, this is probably NOT the game for you.  I've played 9 games thus far this year (year almost over) and only 4 have been played to their conclusion though most all have lasted at least 4 hours.  Not a good track record.  Many players either a) aren't decisive and scared to make an error, or b) can't focus when it isn't their turn, and have to be reminded constantly what's going on.  For me, it's still an awesome game... just exercise caution with whom you're sitting down to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
After one play, I'm still confused by some of the rules, so I'll refrain from assigning a rating.  I'm sure I'll still prefer Risk because I prefer being able to build up armies, which is limited here, and I actually prefer dice to picking a card in order to resolve combat.  I'm also unfamiliar with the literature, so the theme doesn't grab me.  Still, it has potential once I have a clearer idea of how it all works.

Love this game as it make you feel like an medieval warlord. Love it even more because it plays in

I havent played it enough to discover the strategies. 
But the games i have played, were brutal. 

Alliances were made and repeatedly broken. Outraged 
players.....and the most epic game was that 2 players 
were fighting amongst each other while the 3rd won 
got away with the victory.

Well, my only Eurogame. It is a good game, even if it is too (artificially) short and I don't really like the bidding methods for gaining influence - I find it to be arbitrary; influence in this game ought to be more solidly reflected than that.... Also, even though the cards are very balanced, as a wargamer I find the whole war aspect treated far too lightly. Playable for all five players and fun as a famiily game. The rating would probably go up a bit if I ever tried the two expansions. I bought it because I find George RR Martin's books vere, very good indeed.

RATING: 7
Loving the theme helps a lot.

This suffers if the players are at different levels, as it punishes bad moves harshly.

House rule: you have a diplomatic phase before putting down your orders. 5 min to discuss. After this you are -not- allowed to discuss anymore, even after revealing the orders. Speeds up the game, more focus on diplomacy. This made the game more enjoyable for me, it really worked.

We still talk about sessions of this, months later. It has to be at least a 7, just for that.

Maybe I am being too harsh, but I really hate the mechanics in this game. The way you place tokens. The way you play cards with modifiers in battle. The way you decide who has the "special abilities".

Rating is only from one play, but I doubt I'll be playing it again.  It took 5 hours with rules explanation, and I believe I lost because I had one less barrel on the supply board.  What I could do next time, I have no clue, because the map is not really balanced, and the random Westeros cards are really hard to predict.  It seems to me to be no more weighty or strategic than many Euro games that are 1/3 the time to play, and with those you can replay twice more to understand it better in the same period of time.  I like the idea of placing your orders all at the same time and then flipping them up at the same time, but there has to be a better game using this mechanic.  Also, the art for the characters was just horrendous.  Love the books, but the game was seriously lacking.

Based on 2 plays.  After the first game I really was not all that interested in trying it again.  It seemed long and not a good fit for the type of game I like.  However, after playing it again now I enjoyed it a lot more.  I still am just not a huge fan of these type of games with a lot of table talk, alliances, deals, negotiations.  I personally prefer more "dry" games where each person plans their own moves without worrying about deals and alliances.  I do like the combat system and theme of this game more than most wargames.

Very nice Diplomacy variant, and thematically very interesting.  lowered the rating a bit since finding willing opponents isn't really much easier than finding Dip opponents.  Tough one. I like the game a lot, but don't get to play very much as apparently not many other folks like playing 4 hour long games. UPDATE 12/2007  lowering to a 5, I still think highly of this game,  but since I haven't played it in years I'm lowering this a notch. Finding commited opponents to play this is tough, and having to reread the rules each time to "remember" how to play is tough.

The game requires, rewards and encourages table talk, as it is a game of diplomacy, intrigue and traitors; much the same as Westeros is being described in the books. It is therefore a very good adaption of the books, but the game group needs to enjoy such a game style.

The fixed starting positions have a big influence on replayability, in spite of the Westeros cards.
The expansions change that a lot, especially the CLASH OF KINGS, as they bring a lot of variants.

RATING: 8
High complexity makes AGoT take a long time to play at first, but once you get familiar with the system games go much faster. This is an excellent multiplayer conflict game, but if you are considering this as your first one, go play something simpler instead (like Dust). It also has a diceless combat system, so it can provide good contrast to bucket o' dice wargames. 

This game has a very strong element of politics and gang-up-on-the-leader, so stay away from it if you don't like that.

It hurts me to give this such a low rating, but I have too for several reasons.

1.  The game is long.  You're talking at least 4 hours.
2.  It feels like you're just grinding trying to get a tiny advantage.  Combined with #1, this turn to being tedious very quickly.
3.  Too much room for AP.  The game needs a 10 minute timer on placing your activations.
4.  Combat sucks.  Really quite boring.
5.  Not enough space in some of the regions for pieces.

I love the books so I enjoy the idea of this game but I just don't like it in practive.  I'm happy to have played it, but I probably never will again unless I can convince everyone to play with a timer.

This is such a hard game to rate. It seems like everyone has to play each side a few times and play the game a few times in general before playing, as one weak player can really mess things up. (A weak player won't put pressure on other players the way that they should for play balance, resulting in a runaway player. 
The game itself is purty as all heck. Wow.

I played 3/4 times and I think that this is a game only for 5 players, not less, not more. It may be too much long for many kind of players, but its components, mechanics and background make it be one of the best 2003 games released, even if I did not read anything from the novel books. Anyway for me this game suffer too much of kingmaker problem due to experience.

Interesting game.  Contains alot of the things I normally like in a game.  Diplomacy, Negotiation, and even Blind bidding.  I can see this getting alot of plays, I have no knowledge of the novels, so I think some of the theme is lost on me.

RATING: 8
A very fun game for 5 players.  It is a wargame that actually does not punish attackers because winning loses no armies.  This prevents this game from turning into an act of "aggressive turtling."  Great replayability because each of the five houses play differently, and the turn events are random, meaning there isn't necessarily a single best path to victory.  However, trying to play this game with anything but 5 players leads to an imbalance of power.

A huge disappointment. As a fan of the series I really really would have liked to like the game; I was expecting an interesting game taking full advantage of the theme, but instead got a mediocre area movement/light wargame with next to no theme at all.

One combines very well the elements of the diplomacy with the elements of the combat. Secret strategies: insured tension.

Settle in for a longish game with a lot of downtime as players think and rethink their moves. Usually, that would be enough for me to despise a game. Game of Thrones is so good, though, that I'm willing to invest the time.

RATING: 8.5
Good game, but I find it too scripted and imbalanced.  I'd like a bit more hidden information or random elements to make turns a bit less deterministic.  And I think the negotiation element of the game would become more prominent if game turns weren't so calculable.

UPDATE: The ports help fix some of the issues of the game being overly scripted.  Playing with six is also an improvement.  And I may prefer the more swingy house cards from the expansions as they make battle outcomes a little less calculable.

UPDATE 2: I appreciate the game more the more I play it.  It's aged very well.

I've played the game three times, but have yet to complete a game due to schedule conflicts. So far, my rating is positive but I don't think I'm going to like it more than Diplomacy. Diplomacy is my favorite game of all time, so this does not mean that AGOT is not a good game. Fortunately, AGOT is great with 5 players, and with the Expansions I expect will be good for 4 and 6 players, so it should act as a good alternative if I cannot get 7 players together for a game of Diplomacy. My score for AGOT will likely change with more plays. This score is based on my initial impressions.

I've played one game and I liked it. However, it comes with some snafus:

1. It's a bit long and slow-moving. I have pretty decent patience with games and I can handle long games. So I didn't mind this much, I was so engaged the whole time that the time slipped by. The problem for me with this, however, is that most my gaming friends and family, don't have the same patience I do.

2. In the game I played, Lannister was pounced by GreyJoy in the first turn and never recovered. Lannister had no chance. I have read a bit that there are fixes to help Lannister's starting position in order to balance this out. But this was a really bad thing for the Lannister player in my first game.

3. No ports in the base game. I'm glad FFG is coming out with a new edition that addresses this issue, because I can see how it would have been a huge problem--we played with the expansion that adds ports.

4. Westeros cards can be too random. I realize this is what makes every game different and unpredictable, and I think that's a good thing. However, the Westeros cards were very cruel in our first game. We mustered twice and bid for power positioning twice in the first two turns. After that, never again for the rest of the game. GreyJoy was able to pull off a 7-castle victory in turn 6 because its position mustering power and supply in turn two was double what most of us had, again, only because it was so easy for her to take over Lannister's home land. If a single mustering had occured in rounds 3-6, I'm certain the rest of us could have stopped GreyJoy from the sweeping win. But the way the cards played, we never had a chance.

All in all, a good game. And I think it accomplishes that for which it was created: a war game with much intrigue and diplomacy. But because of these few flaws I see, I think I'll hold off on purchasing it. At least until I have a group of players who I'm sure would enjoy it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Near perfect balance of power makes it impossible to just roll your forces across the board.  Your footmen, knights or ships are few, to represent a group of forces.  So making a big play for power in a neighboring region usually means leaving yourself open on your back side.  Which means DIPLOMACY is required.  The simultaneous playing of order markers speeds the game along and makes it an accessible yet deep strategy game.

This game has many sub-components that I like, particularly the auctions on the three tracks.  The partial parallelization is nice too.  Other aspects feel like they could have been done so much better, particularly the randomization of mustering and supplying.  I've never played a game of this and felt completely satisfied at the end, which results in a middling ranking for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Excellent diplomacy game. It has terrific concepts, plays differently every time, it has varying factions and no luck. You need to outplay, outsmart and deceive your opponents while at the same time negotiating so as to do it first before them.

The only drawback I can think of is that the factions have standard starting positions, and therefore the first turns can perhaps be easily scripted and some alliances appear more often than not. But it really is a minor issue.

I expect that my rating will rise the more I play.


Update: The second edition of this game is superior in every regard, and has made the first edition obsolete for me. This is still a great game, but since I'll never choose to play it again I have removed my rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is a perfect example of a light tactical/strategic wargame.  It's mechanics create a system of combat that involves no luck where the victor is the one who managed his forces and alliances most effectively.  A cunning leader can easily determine whether a battle is impossible to win in any given scenario.  This separates it from the vast majority of light wargames out there - ex: A&A - which rely mainly on dice for their combat mechanics.  I think its a very clever game that deserves more attention than it's gotten.  The expansions that FF is putting out look like they are very high quality and I'm very glad that they're supporting the game further into it's lifespan.

The best strategy game I have ever played.  The lack of dice is wonderful.  5 or 4 players is optimal.  However, the hardest thing with it is teaching people.

I have to admit, finally winning at this game has really helped in my enjoying playing it.  While the different houses are rather uneven in their strenghts, it all comes down to the dynamics of your opponents army.  Black and white were in their own shoving match while red and yellow traded blows.  As green, my advantage was not routing yellow when I had the chance so he could keep red and ornage busy.  This allowed me to rout the orange, capture my seventh castle and take the game.  Despite lackluster cards, green has won twice now.

So A Game of Thrones. . .everyone's favorite passive agressive war game. I like this game, but have yet to master the randomness of seasons nor the mid-game land management. . .definitely a lot of screw the leader going on, but if you concentrate on that someone sneaks in the back door to win. . .one complaint I have is the naval units seem to have a lot of power. . .he/she who controls the seas. . .

I played once - and it was horrible. I see potential of this game, but gigantic unbalanced position of the families is devastating the pleasure of the playing.

BTW. Martin books are my No1. ever, and i also played for years AGOT CCG - AMAZING!!! So now sad, that this game is simply broken for me - i don't want to play this title again.

6.5 only for potantial + im freak about Martins world :-)

Supremely fun wargame w/ so many intriguing decisions! The secret orders mechanic implemented in this game is right up my ally! The board looks great. My only major knock on the balance is that the ships can really lock a player down as it is illegal for them to build any if there is an enemy ship already in the water next to the city/fortress during mustering. (This problem was fixed however, in the expansion.)
I love the use of cards, and the absence of dice is a nice touch for this wargame.

RATING: 7.5
Rating based on two sessions with 4 players. I firmly believe that this score will go up with exactly 5 players, as there would no longer be a need for a "neutral" army (which definitely gives an advantage to the player(s) bordering it). Beside the beautiful(!) components, this game is special in my opinion because it (a) is a wargame that plays in a very reasonable amount of time, (b) combines various interesting mechanics succesfully and (c) encourages strategic planning while keeping downtime in check. --- UPDATE: Finally played with 5 and felt it is indeed better with that number of players. Only drawback I can think of, is that there are turns in which you have very little options.

RATING: 9.5
I like this game. I love the theme and the source material. I extremely enjoy the non-dice approach to battle resolution. It just makes sense. There is a lot going on in this game (bidding, resource allocation, diplomacy, outside threats from the wildlings, and so on) that might make it confusing when you read through the rules. However, if you play it once, you will see that the game flows very orderly and allows an optimal use of all these mechanics to be used. 

I'd rate this game a 10 except for the play time. I usually avoid games that take over two hours. This one can take up to four or five hours if playing with a competitive group. Quality over quantity I know but that type of time frame for playing really impacts how often the game would hit the table with my group.

EDITED: Bumped this up to 9.5. If you get a group of people who are familiar with the game, the play time is reduced substantially. Also, that same familiarity in a group adds to interesting alliances that build upon the theme. Its a great game that keeps getting better in my mind.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Potentially great game, but the order in which events take place has decided my fate twice. Once no reinforcements showed up three rounds in a row, the second play I kept ridiculous stacking limits. Spoils the game somewhat.
Another annoying mechanism is that of the house-cards: a limited deck which has to be used completely before cards come into play again. Because it takes a couple of turns before you get your cards back, you'll be left with probably some lame cards.
Conclusion: if my gaming group wants to bring this to the table again, I'll probably join but I'll never suggest it. Too many games I like better, too little time.

RATING: 7.75
This game would score higher if I thought the different kingdoms were better balanced.  It seems like a couple are geared to win and the others just play king-maker.  The game has a whole series of excellent mechanics, so it's fun to play even with any perceived balance problems.

RATING: 8
Have only played it twice, but I really like the overall mechanics.  In particular, the orders system, the supply system, the combat cards, and the Wildlings attack "volunteer's dilemma" are great features. Game is at its best with all 5 players.  I hope to play it more...

This is really great War-game. I love wargames with only little luck(westeros cards in this situation).
 Everything depends on your diplomatic skills, solid tactic and smart moves. I would give it 9.5 or 10 rate but there are some balance issues and alliances between two houses may destroy some other house without any cooperate strategy so diplomacy it's very very important.

Five player wargame based on the famous series of fantasy novels. Interesting mechanics that effectively reduce the randomness usually present in such offerings. No dice! The  meat of the game revolves around a cleaver planning phase where players simultaneously place hidden orders on the board (revealed later in the turn). Factions have some uniqueness provided by character cards and starting positions. An overall very well designed game that unfortunately seems prone to analysis paralysis - especially in the planning phase. An extensive amount of diplomacy can also lengthen the game. The length is further problematic considering that one or two of the houses will invariably be repressed to very weak positions early on and be non-factors in the course of the game unless their fortunes turn (but whether it does is likely to be out of their hands). Wouldn't mind playing again but would appreciate some mechanism that speeds up game decisions to improve the flow and reduce overall length.

I wasn't sure I would like this, but as it turned out, I had a great time.  I don't play wargames, I'm not keen on direct conflict, and I generally avoid long games. However, I'm hooked on George R.R. Martin's Fire & Ice books (the first one blew me away, and though my opinion has gone down with each one, I'm looking forward to the ones yet to come), I have fond memories of Kingmaker and Diplomacy, and I do like colourful maps ;)

1st update (Sep 2012)[9]: The rating reflects my willingness to play more than the game itself, seeing as I've played it only a few times. I love it, though. The intrigue, the backstabbing, the hunger for power. All three games where played before I knew that they were based on a book, and after reading A Song of Ice and Fire, the lust for playing has increased dramatically.

Comment:
An enjoyable game. It reminds me mostly DIPLOMACY because of its turn sequence (everybody gives orders secretly and all orders resolve at the same time. Although I like it very much some players who do not like negotiations and intrigue in board games do not like to play this game. The ratio of this kind in 10% among my friends. Although the card games reflects more of the intrigue in the well known fantasy book series A Song of Ice and Fire (This game is based on these books) this is a good strategy game where the most enjoyable and exciting part is bidding in some areas of influence. We play this game once in two months (not very frequent) but I like it every time that we play.

This is the game that really sold me on [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/publisher/17]Fantasy Flight Games[/url].  A superb addition to any gamer's library as a multiplayer negotiation wargame.  Takes the best ideas from [gameid=483] and fleshes them out very elegantly.  Unlike Diplomacy, this is actually playable in a long evening.  Just a spice of randomness keeps this one replayable.  I can't say enough good things about this game.  It's quite simply amazing.

"Westeros cards" are simply a BAD idea.
Unbalanced starting positions. I dislike the possible coalition against someome (the weakest, the leader, the unlucky...) Elimination game. 
It has no appeal based on theme for persons that haven't read the books.
Long.
Considering how it is based on diplomacy and that it can fall apart due to ships (too useful) and reinforcements (too rare if wrong cards are drawn), I wonder if it is "broken" or close to that. But I won't play it any more, so I'm (luckily) not going to discover it...

This game is very interesting.  It is never the same twice, as you usually have a different house to play, and if you have the same one, your opponents have others.  I really like that this game is strategy only.  You have to make your way without dice.  It really puts the game outcome at a personal level!  The expansions for this game are worth it in my opinion as they do actually enhance the game.

This is the game that got me into the board gaming hobby.  It was "Risk without dice" which was the perfect concept for me. In addition, it has a good theme, great tactical elements, mind-gaming non-dice combat resolutions and an excellent bidding mechanism for some key gameplay advantages.  

In short, AGOT has everything I look for in a game - little to no luck, conflict, diplomacy, grand strategy, tactics and bluffing. Only drawback is the time commitment - this game often runs at 3+ hours due to the huge amounts of AP during the order phase. We've managed to bring that down a bit by putting in a time limit of 7 minutes for orders and 2 orders for all other actions (marching and card selecting).

One drawback - this game is lacking without the Clash of Kings expansion.

Sweet baby Jeebus, but this is a game with a lot going on.  It's not hard, and the turns are pretty straightforward, but everything to consider, all the choices to make, and how things will change from one seemingly small little move add up to a big game with lots of confrontation and shifting alliances.  And I really respect a game with that kind of a design, with the agonizing choices and having to live with the results of a miscalculated move.  The problem is that these aren't the types of games I like or want to play.

For one, I tend to do very poorly at them.  I don't know if it's my misunderstanding of sacrificing units or just a lack of strategic thinking when it comes to these sorts of invasion games, but I can't seem to get my head around how to maintain a wide enough, strong enough force to make a difference in these games.  I tend to feel more frustrated than anything else, and that's not a feeling I want to engender too much when it comes to games.

Even though the theme and atmosphere speak to me, I simply don't become friends with this game. Much to the chagrin of my husband. :-)

The rules are simple and yet demanding. Normally a good thing, but combined with the long session time I experience a very flat learning curve. Although I won at least three of my four tries in this game - and I like winning :-) - it was quite unsatisfying. It felt more like the game played me, then me playing the game.

I've only gotten to play this once, so I haven't gotten familiar enough with it to really decide how I feel about it. There is no randomness to combat, so the gameplay is very reminiscent of Diplomacy. It's more about predicting what your opponents are going to do and preventing it, than it is about focusing on and growing your own empire.

It was fun, I'd like to get to know it better...

This would be a higher if it wasn't for the blind bidding, which I hate. This scratches the same itch for me as Diplomacy, while having much richer mechanics (and a much shorter playtime). I also really enjoy the order system - not quite as much as the Starcraft "stack", but I think it's a good fit for this game.

I dislike how tied to the event deck the game is.

Tentative rating after one 4 player game.  I fully expect it to go higher with additional plays.

Played only once, so I'll not rate it yet. Based on that one playing, I find the cards to cause the game to swing wildly (yes, I know part of that is because none of us knew the power of the cards). All that careful planning ruined because of rediculously powerful cards. Hopefully another play would show the cards do not create a broken game - as was our experience with the first play.

Nothing to change. One of the best games I own.

More than anything else, A Game of Thrones revolves around outwitting your opponents. Everyone knows what everyone else has available, it's just a question of how they're going to use their men and orders and how you're going to use yours. There are only a few random events, but they're just enough to make every game different. All this and it only takes 3 hours tops to play! It's such a great game, I went out and bought the books and they turned out to be awesome too!

RATING: 6
Lots to like here, but very static and very much a game that is so self-balancing that the secondary victory conditions replace the primary.  Victories are allowed, not earned, which is unfortunate given the richness of the systems.

Not done with it yet, though, but I think it will require tuning to meet my tastes.  I'm not sure how to tune it so that it depends primarily on orders, and not so much on petty diplomacy (which has been done before, after, and better).

Great game with varied mechanics and little downtime. Need 5 to play though (doesn't cope well with less) and unsure of the balance. Having said that, we have had a lot of suprise victors.

This is the best designed strategy game I own.  It captures the feel of the books its based on with amazing art, interesting game design and amazingly balanced rules.  If you like the Game of Thrones novels and you like games like Risk... then you owe to yourself to buy this game.  It is fantastic!!

RATING: 8
Great Diplomacy-lite kind of game.  People who complain about the game saying that there is no negotiation probably lose really badly.  If you aren't metagaming you are probably being carved up by the other players, or your group is a bunch of pansies.  Fun stuff.

RATING: 6
Interesting Game - Played with part of the (first?) expansion.  Combines a couple of interesting mechanics,  but far too many special powers, ultimately,  since everyone has a fistful of wonky character cards to play in battle...  I think I prefer Mare Nostrum or Antike.

Played again,  no expansions.  Still more than a little complicated.  Having muster/track resets not always happen is neat,  but feels a bit too random for my taste.

Way too long.

A very smoothly running multi player wargame.  Lots of really good features.  My only concern is that the game might not be entirely even.  Also, like almost all of these style of games, it suffers from the "weak player syndrome."  The player next to the weak player wins.

I really like the mechanics this has. It can be really tense when you are putting down your actions. 

The fact that the games can be so different from game to game depending on when you get a muster action is great. 

That is also this games only downfall for me. For being a combat-centric game it almost suffers in the games where you are starved for troops. I guess that adds to the strategy, but for me it is a minor hindrance.

it also seems to me that once someone gets one of the big items (Bird, Sword, or Throne) they have an easier time keeping it than someone trying to take it away.

This has a euro-style feel to it due to the meeples and bidding but also integrates elements analogous to Diplomacy and light wargames in a novel manner.

Not bad at all, albeit not my favorite. Of course were I a fan of either the books or the TV series, neither of which I know. My tastes incline me to avoid graphically explicit violence or sex (although allusions to it happening are fine) and I've been told that both contain both of these.

Still, I'm glad I own the game. It's just not the first thing I'll pull out and play but it's by no means the last thing either.

See review.

OK. So I played Diplomacy ONCE in my lifetime, and I absolutely loved it. And here I wax hypocritical by saying that the only thing that has prohibited me from playing more of that perennial classic is its length - everyone who knows me knows that TIME is just about the last consideration I give when deciding to play a game. Still, I don't play as much Diplomacy as I'd like. And although AGOT doesn't approach the complexity and richness of the classic to which it gets compared, I don't care. It's my Diplomacy quick fix. I like AGOT because it reminds me of Diplomacy. I like AGOT because it practically eliminates the random factor that can get annoying in Euros or dice-based games. I like AGOT because I like George R.R. Martin's fantasy setting. I like AGOT because stoned b****es can't gang up on you for no apparent reason whatsoever. And I like AGOT because Robert Martin doesn't.

'When you play the game of thrones you win or you die!'

Iedere speler neemt de rol op zich van √©√©n van de grote huizen van de zeven koninkrijken uit de boeken van George R.R. Martin. Deze huizen zullen vechten om de grootste invloed in het rijk om daarmee de 'Iron Throne' te veroveren. Ze moeten echter ook samenwerken, omdat in het noorden de wildlings zich verzamelen om het hele rijk aan te vallen.

Er is hier heel erg veel om van te houden. Bieden op beurtvolgorde en voordelen bij het uitdelen van orders, directe conflicten en daarmee ook wat diplomatie. Het enige wat me tegenstaat is dat de huizen niet erg gebalanceerd zijn. Zo zul je zien dat de Starks altijd een gooi kunnen doen naar de overwinning, terwijl dit voor de Lannisters erg lastig is.

Toch, als dit spel voorgesteld word zal ik het met plezier spelen, vooral omdat de boeken ook zo leuk zijn.

A lot going on in this one and it's long. Some balance issues, and it's long. But interesting mechanics. Not really my cup of tea though, as the battles/card play don't leave much wiggle room, as it's usually obvious what the opponent will play, and the castles/swords don't seem to have much effect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game is unbalanced towards one or two factions.  For the weaker faction(s) to have a chance at winning, they have to team up against the stronger factions.  This means the beginning of the game relies heavily on diplomacy.  This reliance is not a bad thing except if the other factions do not come together, then the game goes down hill fast as the stronger factions will easily win.  Of course if everyone teams up on the stronger factions, then the stronger factions don't stand a chance.

UPDATE: dropped down a notch, hard to get on the table. Quite a lot to explain to inexperienced players, which can lead to imbalanced positions within the game.

The best game I have ever played. A lot of interactions between players (diplomacy). Fast changing (one turn you are the first one and on the next ... trying to stay alive :) ). Only limited luck factor (no dices etc.) ... but your strategy should take in to account some random events. Battles, bidding, strategic planing, using all available resources all make this game my favorite.

I still love the game after all this years but finally I realized that it is not a 10 anymore. It is a bit too long and too intense to be played regularly. I tend to think of it as an event game (although it is not THAT long)

Plays like an improved Diplomacy with multiple additional problems - the winner, as in many four-player games, is almost always 'who was fucked with least', and the war that plays out never has any but the most cursory connection to the war of the books.  Sliding down my list, I'm afraid.

A classic multiplayer attack  (and effect) the other players "80's style" game with a touch of elements of today's games.  Gamers new to gaming could learn alot about how to play games with alliances if they can play this enough to develop a feel for reading how close each player is to victory. (Note that as a "multiplayer combat game" initial forces don't have to be balanced since combat will shift the balance anyway.  Learn to negotiate to win. Create alliances. Most importantly: unlike most Eurogames, don't think you can win by playing the game mechanics alone.)

Review after one play.  Quite fun rules.  Game pace is heavily dependant on the first group of cards, though - a lack of musters seems like it can prevent much activity from happening.  The sea zones are also much, much larger than the land zones and can make attacks from SUBSTANTIALLY 'behind the lines' something to worry about.  So, it seems you need to keep your eyes on both your "fleet" front and army front.  Interesting balance overall.  Definitely worth another play or 12!

Yet to play, but according to a friend of mine really, really fun, though really, really long.

[UPDATE]: Played from 04/03/13 20:30 to 05/03/13 02:00. It was pretty fun, although no one really had a clue about what was the best thing to do. Biggest mistake: ignoring Lannister (perhaps because she was the only girl around the table...), which meant that on turns 8 & 9, she had nearly won by capturing 7 strongholds. Lucky us, she didn't have any Power Tokens to keep areas with strongholds under her control as she moved out. Not that it mattered anyway, as at the end of turn 10 she had the most strongholds... 

[UPDATE 2]: Played twice July 6th. The first game ended after two turns, the second one after three. It really showed me and the people I played with how punishing this game is: if one player makes just one sub-optimal play, someone else can instantly take advantage of that and take the win while none of the other three players can do anything about it. Especially Stark (and Tyrell to a lesser extent), who is less involved with the game since they can't get straight into the action. This makes it difficult for Stark and Tyrell to grab cities and strongholds, since the other three players will already have taken those by the time they actually get to do anything. The fact that there are precise starting positions for each of the houses and that they always have the same house cards doesn't help things along when it comes to replayability. In both games we played this day, there were about 2/3 battles in both games. That's not very exciting. I don't know to what extent the 2nd edition is better, but in the current state, I wouldn't suggest to play this 1st edition myself, dropping my 6,5 rating to a 5,5.

Wow, am I missing something here.  Another wargame that I just couldn't force myself to enjoy.  There's something about the mix of war elements and city/state development that I just don't like, and I'm not sure why.  I played the red guys, which seemed to start off in a really difficult spot to play, at least for new players.  Some of the elements are interesting, like everyone being forced to contribute to fending off barbarians.  I really didn't like the random nature of when new troops appear.  Willing to give it another shot, but I think I'm just not into games that cross a certain complexity threshold.  Pass the High Society, please :/

Really enjoy this one.  #1 in our group for player interaction. Have to say that I can understand why some dont like the fact that you never know when the supply track moves or when the mustering card arrives, as it can be frustrating.  But this random aspect also brings an element of drama when the cards are revealed, and at the same time can bring huge twists of fate for the players, which for our group also results in alot of fun.

If taken too seriously one could be frustrated, but a eurogamer mentality that can handle a bit of randomness with likely enjoy this one.

-: can pose a steep learning curve to non-gamers
-: you can be "out of the game" if you played poorly (or got unlucky) and may need to sit it out (though I have also seen come-backs)
-: kingmaking possible (overcome this by enforcing that a non-winning possible kingmaker must make the move that is best for him))
-: unbalanced: black greyjoy is too strong (needs docks (for all players) and downgrades to raven's court and knight to be playable) and green Tyrell is often too weak
-: needs expansion (clash of kings, $) for balance: docks are vital, other variants are nice for variation
-: needs expansion (clash of kings, $) for 6
-: not playable with 4 or less (unless with a variant I don't know? (I don't like Storm of Swords))

This game has a lot going for it.  I particularly liked the hidden orders as they allowed both for some bluff and to keep everyone interested in the turn sequence.  Combat had a bit of bluff and a bit of number crunching both in good amounts while the supply mechanic kept people from gathering a force without weak points.  I understand there is some imbalance among the factions... but after playing I can't say that's a deal breaker in this very good game.

I can understand why a lot of people like this game; I've just realized that wargames aren't exactly my cup of tea, hence the lower rating.  I do believe the game is well-designed and well-thought out, though time will tell with repeated playings whether there's an "optimal" start for each House. Rating update (11/19/04):  The game is too long for how unbalanced it is; through no fault of your own, you can be beat down  (and stay beat down) over the course of 3-4 hours, with no chance of ever winning.  Where's the fun in that?

Seems really good.  Needs more plays with the right people involved.

RATING: 6
Order system, dice-less combat, and variable supply & recruitment are interesting, but the lack of any structure to alliances & negotiation detracts.

I haven't played this game enough to give a critical review, but my first impressions were very good. I enjoyed this game a lot more than other area-control games, the politics involved make it a lot more engrossing experience. Now that I've read the book, I'm eager to get into it again.

Fun, challenging...just enough random chance.

This game LOOKS like it should be much more fun than it actually is. The components are pretty and the rules are intriguing, but in the end it just comes off as a bit disappointing. Combat is not particularly interesting, and my biggest pet peeve is that units DO NOT die. It is nearly impossible to kill a large number of enemy units. Also, when the game ends it is sudden and I remain unsatisfied with the result.

EDIT: Played again with four people. A lot more dialogue keeps people honest, and as soon as someone hits 5 cities it becomes a "beat the leader" mentality. Still some issues with the game, but much more fun than I originally felt it was.

A very good cross between a strategy game and a classic german boardgame. Propably the best looking components i have seen in an american game. The map is really outstanding. May take a bit long to finish, even with the limited turns, especially if a lot of negotiations take place.

Broken w/out harbors and the correct map to fit the number of players.

RATING: 7.5
Played it once with 3 players, mainly to learn so we weren't expecting much of an experience but it appears a very good game. I like the interweaving and interdependency of the many mechanisms and the need to plan for nasty events. Looks like we'll be having a 5 player game at some point.

Only a 7.5 because I need to play it more to get a proper feel.

This is currently up for trade or sale .. and not because its not a good game.

Edit: as of 21/03/2012 this is on eBay.

Mechanics seem OK, but I didn't really get into the game. Could use better looking miniatures.

One of the best negotiation/wargames I played in the last time. Similar to Diplomacy but really adds a lot to it. Don't know the books so can't comment much on the adaption of the theme... (heard only positive things from my friends though)

I have almost no experience of war games but I fell immediately in love with this one. Just great with all the development going on in the map all the time and the negotiations and random events. Simply great! A bit long, but doesn't matter with such a great game.

I like games that try to pick up where Diplomacy left off, but seems to have many balance issues and AP problems. At least it's shorter than Diplomacy. But it seems like Diplomacy plus a lot of work, which still ultimately comes down the diplomacy part.

Having the Supply event not happen often, and especially if it happens late the first time, can seriously affect the game.

This is more of an overall impression than a true rating for me.  I played this game one time at Gencon 2006 and had a very good time.  I'd love to play it again to see if I feel the same about the game after a second play.

RATING: 6.5
I enjoy the mechanics of this game but find that the game is rather unbalanced.  We have played this quite a few times both 5 player and with the expansion for 6 players( which does seem to help some ) and I have never seen house 'Stark' win a game.  One of the gamers who we play with has read the books the game is based on and says that the game is good at recreating the stetting of the books, who has power, who allies with who etc.

RATING: 9.1
Review with book series, TV series. Best Game i've ever played. Simple rules but fulfill tactics and strategy. It's focus on the player interaction, including bluff, betray and others. The game mechanism working well, and fit the theme, which i really love the world of A Song of Fire and Ice. The only disadvantage is taking too mush time.

Epic political and military struggle, with loyalty and betrayal, just like in the books. And the books are the best, so...
Only bad thing is too long play. 4 hours are just too much.

Best mix of different but excellent mechanisms. Some balancing problem and in particular too much dependent on the alliances; players are always in a vulnerable position, making it easy to gang up on the leader, and ultimately hard to come up with an effective strategy.

RATING: 9.1
Excellent value, dividers for all the characters released to this point, space to store everything released, new character mats that can be helpful when choosing who you want to play, plenty of extra components...not to mention it's got 4 new quality character decks like any of the other larger box expansions. Just awesome.

RATING: 7
Let's be honest, you buy this for the storage solution to all the expansions. But wait, there's more! The new characters here don't all have fun/whacky mechanics to add. I see this as a good thing, because my favorite characters from RDI1 were getting overlooked and this adds a bit of balance for them.

EDIT 9/10/2017: Back to a 6 for me. I may be more willing to play games with this sort of take that style, but overall, I just don't like Red Dragon Inn that much. It's too random, and too time consuming for what it is. While it isn't a bad game, per se, for me it's kind of like Munchkin- I grew out of it. I want more depth and strategy from what I'm playing than the game has to offer, especially for the time it takes to play it.

EDIT: I've found myself more willing to play this of late, and have boosted my score from a 6 to a 7. I still wouldn't say I'm that fond of this style game, or that it's a favorite by any means, BUT I certainly don't dislike it. I feel like the more I game, the more willing I am to play the 'take that' style games.
 
Original: I want to like this more than I do. Simple, quick and quirky, but the randomness makes it unenjoyable to me sometimes. Prefer to play it in a group. It's frustrating when you consistently get bad draws, or your opponents manage to block all your attacks, or retaliate all the time. Makes it feel like your turn was wasted, since you usually can only play one action at a time. Frustrating and too random.

This new installment to an already great game does what most expansions don't, and that is give you a big box to put all previous and all future expansions in. The big box is huge and fits RDI 1-5, Gambling I'm In, all Ally decks, coins, AC and Fort. markers, with miniature tracking board for all existing characters. The copy I purchased even came with kickstarter Drinks! Great buy for new or existing players.

This game isn't terrible for what it is.  I'm just not a fan of what it is.  It strives to be silly and unpredictable.  It accomplishes that goal.

RATING: 8
Standalone expansion.  Must have for anyone that has a few of the other expansions for Red Dragon Inn as it comes with a new large box to hold everything and some updated components: character specific play mats, deck dividers that also contain unique character rules, 5 value coins.  Also comes with four characters with unique mechanics.

More character variety and, equally important, a "character trove" box that can hold all the previous Red Dragon Inn sets along with this new set.

Worth buying early while building your collection, just for the box and the personalized mats and tokens. Just beautiful.

I love Red Dragon Inn, and this is basically an expansion or standalone (2-4 players) with the same basic mechanics and game play.  Plus, it's a really big box to put all my other characters in to make carrying everything around much easier.

Let's see, a big box to carry everything in, and 4 new characters? I know I don't play this game much, but I must have this.

* Kickstarted! *

Four more characters to add to the game, they don't really change up the rules all that much. However, volume five comes in a REALLY big box -- big enough for all the previous sets sleeved and then some.

PLUS: the really big box
MINUS: not much more improvement on the game

Rated higher because the box and new mats change everything. If you already have one expansion for RDI, get this one for sure.

This is what it came to. Red Dragon Inn 5 adds some great characters, and also adds one other great addition. A place to store it all! On top of that, the game added personalized boards for each character, and dividers with descriptions of EVERY character in the Red Dragon Inn universe, which are great for players who are indecisive.

This giant box now holds pretty much everything published up to this point (bar the gambling side game expansion). All cards are sleeved, and there are stacks and stacks of metal coins that go really nicely with the game.

Let's face it: You're probably buying RDI5 for the box. RDI5 comes with a box large enough to fit every single RDI game with room to spare.

The characters are all right. Two of them are very straightforward, simple characters, and two have somewhat complex mechanics. (Lizwick has a second deck and Zakhan is a high-risk/high-reward character who can easily knock himself out of the game by accident.) It's a pretty nice balance.

But, still. I got it for the box.

this was by far the best thing slugfest did for this game it made storage so much better it really help keep all the cards nice and organized fitting all the previous games and expansion with a custom player mat for each character and card list on the back of each drink deck separator and i still have room for future games and allies expansion. the only issue i have is that i have to use one of the old game boxes for all the coins and old play mats and rule books.

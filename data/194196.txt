From what I saw in reviews and live plays, this game seems to be fun.

RATING: 2
I really wonder how something so bad (and with so poorly written rulebook) could be published. Graphics are the only thing that is ok in this game. (My coplayers suggest it can work better for 4players - we played 3. I doubt the difference would make it more playable.)
We really, really tried to figure what some rules are for - the flicking to Away power, the need to make reinforcement pile first and then draw from it instead from the deck, etc. 
The only strategy there is 'hm, which one of ...6? cards should I choose?', so plenty of choices! Rest is practically automatical, just count and do the only option you have. And if you are really unlucky on a draw, you can have a round when you just cannot attack.

Un sencillo juego de cartas de dos a cuatro jugadores en los que cada jugador tiene una serie de cartas cuyo valor va implicar tener la inciativa y sacar cartas del mazo. Cada jugador tiene tres líneas de batalla: vanguardia, central y retaguardia y se enfrenta a otros jugadores según una secuencia dada.

Está entretenido y es sencillo. La estrategia está únicamente en las cartas de iniciativa, porque las otras se roban "a ciegas" del mazo.

Didn't seem to work at all as a two player game.  The mechanics work, but there isn't a decision on who to attack so whoever starts seems to have an advantage.  The score was unexpectedly close but again, there didn't seem to be decisions to make as a player.  Will try it again with three or four to see if it plays differently and is more interesting.

RATING: 7
Very little planning and extremely random.  The art work is fantastic takes up a decent amount of room (especially with 5-6 players), but the game is actually a nice, fun easy going game with a lot of colors and fun moments.  Granted it's play card kill this next player (rinse and repeat) but the overall fun of the game is there 100%.

Une bataille fermée. Ultra aléatoire; très peu de choix. Pas simple en plus à cause de l'abondance des icones. Le mode spectateur est clairement mieux que le mode joueurs vu que le jeu est plutot joli et relativement spectaculaire.

RATING: 7
Fast, fantasy war-fare themed card-game of contest over a hill. Yes, nothing but one wreaking hill. Huge armies of men, elves, orcs, goblins etc. are more than excited to spill blood on those grassy slopes of a single hill. What's so interesting about one hill? What makes it so special? Is there something extra-ordinary that can turn the tide of war.
Fun, whacky, fast, quicly changing, very simple....thematically makes no sense whatsoever, but is so much fun to play.

RATING: 10
Extremely fast and engaging filler,take-that and partnership choices are a must to emerge victorious from the pile of dead bodies on the hill.
Expansions add extra units,tactics and new armies (undead,war-pigs),new larger units,and epic units (cthulhu...)
Playmat also adds to the theme of the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The title is self explanatory: capture the hill through total carnage! Dead simple premise: destroy ALL enemy troops, one by one, row by row. Use either melee or ranged (or both) attacks, as well as magic (which counts as both). Each army (faction) has a leader and special abilities (including specialised actions & units). Gameplay is (again) very simple: draw - deploy - attack - pile up the corpses on the hill. I mean, it's a meat grinder, how refined & intricate is it supposed to be ?!? :)

The core sets are not well balanced though: the goblins will kill everyone and everything...

We expected this to play quickly and simple. Didn't have any high expectations at all, however, we failed in understanding the rules. Two different language versions of the rules. Experienced gamers, native speakers respectively. We didn't play the game, since we weren't able to.

RATING: 9
I've had fun the times I've played it. I think it is easy to teach and can be played pretty quick (depending on player count). I'd recommend playing with 4+ players, 3 if you can't get 4, and 2 if you have to. Definitely more fun with more people.

Gioco di carte veloce e divertente, decisamente più casinaro che strategico. Il gioco si presta a sfide sprint senza troppo impegno, lievemente tattico con una buona componente fortuita, ma comunque divertente se fatto con lo spirito giusto. Il contesto è quello di mandare allo sbando (e carneficina) le proprie truppe distruggendo quelle avversarie per accumulare punti. Giocabile senza troppe pretese.

Can be a fun chaotic filler in the right group. Might have some more decisions than it seems at the first glance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
First play impression: maybe my tastes are devolving, but I enjoyed this game.

More and more I've been appreciating games that rely on randomness to create fun situations, rather than relying on tough decisions.

And that's the name of the game here: very few decisions, you almost just watch and see what happens as the game plays itself. You just play one card during a round. This usually results in you adding a bunch of army units to your side of the battlefield from the top of your deck. Some of the units will do a surprise attack as soon as they show up, some will summon more units, and some will have special abilities. Then you do an attack with your army, which usually ends in destroying an opponent's entire army. But that's okay, because on your opponent's turn he'll usually summon a new big army to destroy somebody else's army. After everybody takes a turn you hand out some victory points based on who killed the most units, then you just do it all three more times.

I found it fun mainly because of the variety. Each army has their own feel, unique units, and their own special abilities.

Will have to see how it goes after more plays, but I'm liking it so far.

A pathetic offering.  You make 4 whole decisions in a game.  The rest is luck.  The rules are poorly written, not clearly laid out and missing important information like card anatomy.  For some reason the rules are designed to fit on an 11/17 folded page rather than take a little more room and add more clarity.  Steer well clear of this tripe.

Interesting mechanism with a lot of gorgeous cards.
Every player picks a race and the according tokens and cards.
You draw your starting army from your deck and place them. There is a front line, middle and "back" line. The placement of the units is indicated on the cards itself.
Then everyone plays its first initiative card face down and the player with the lowest value goes first.
You draw the cards according to the initiative card and immediately place them on the army and resolve immediate effects on the card directly. This is a very cool aspect of the game, what you can and have to do is always indicated on the cards itself so you are led through the whole process.
After that you can do your attacks according to the initiative card (infantry or artillery attacks)
The player who kills the most units in the round gets the most valuable victory point token and so forth. If you manage to kill all units of one player, you get a "bonus" token (victory points).
The player with the most points at the end is the winner.
The first game I played was great (with 3), the second (again 3) was dull so I gave it a mediocre rating.

Bezzerwizzer is an OK game, but I'm surprised it's ranked as high as it is amongst party games on BCG.  It's a trivia-oriented game, but the selection of questions is quite dismal.  One question will be absurdly easy, so that everyone should be able to get it.  The next one will take a PhD-level of knowledge to get.  This might not be an issue if the designers had set up varying levels of difficulty in the game (more points for high difficulty questions), but it just ends up being very random. 

The game also fails to create any sort of "atmosphere" in my view.  Game play dynamics are OK, but I've found that it's really very luck based.  

This is one of those games where I actually think it has some decent potential, but the creators failed to realize it.  My S.O. and I occasionally play it, but it's become increasingly rare.  It's not a bad game; just average.  I'm surprised it's rated so highly here, because I'd put it low on my party game list.  Honestly, I'd prefer Trivial Pursuit over this.

Cute little trivia game with the ability to throw in some kinks by out-witting someone or swapping.  Issue that some of the questions can have 4X the impact of others.

Mass market trivia that is actually quite enjoyable. You pick category tiles out of a bag and sort them on how well you know the categories, with the more confident categories giving you more points if you are correct. Other teams can exchange your category tiles or even try to guess your question to steal points. Another good couples game.

Ever since my childhood of playing Trivial Pursuit I’ve been desperately seeking a trivia game that gives me that fun trivia feel, but packages it in a way that will be more palatable to trivia haters.  Most people don’t want to play trivia games, because if one person is better at trivia then they will win.  I picked up this game with very high hopes that it would be exactly what I was seeking.  The concept of valuing the categories based on the individual’s knowledge, and having opportunities to steal questions that you might know better than your own, sounds brilliant.  I wanted to love this game so badly, in fact I want to give it a second chance just because the concept feels so right.

The problem is, despite the designer’s best efforts, this game just doesn’t manage to take enough sting out of trivia gaming for those who don’t have a lot of trivial knowledge.  You can do your best with the tiles to move around categories that will maximize your odds of scoring big, but if you draw a pile of categories that fall in your weak areas then you will lose.  In my first play of the game I raced out to an insurmountable lead because I’m the only trivia buff, and the rest of the players struggled to move at all.  We even quit halfway through because no one was having fun (not even me, because crushing opponents who are disinterested does nothing for me.)  The biggest indictment for this game is the fact that we quit when someone said “Can’t we play something fun?” and everyone at the table agreed.

By far the best quiz game I've ever played because it adds a lot of nice tactics to the game, which most quiz games doesn't really do very well. Blows something like Trivial Pursuit completely out of the water. Everyone should have ONE quiz game in their collection (for when you have people around who won't play strategy games) and this is the one to go for, no doubt about that.

Bezzerwizzer is a game of knowledge like Trivial Pursuit, but it's a lot better in my opinion! You get questions from 20 different categories and you have a few "special powers" you can use in each game. It's a decent game, but I prefer WiseMan (both games are actually Danish).

It's a trivia game.

This is a perfectly nice trivia game that's designed for parties.  It can be played individually or in teams - up to 4 (although really with extra tokens you could stretch that).  If you're like me and actually miss your old Trivial Pursuit days but want a game that's more forgiving for your friends - this is for you.

The concept is simple - each team draws four tiles from a bag that represent the 20 categories.  Then they arrange them based on how well they think they know them - so you put your best category in the 4 slot and the worst in the 1 slot.  On your turn if you get it right, that's how many points you get.  The spice to make it a party game are the Bezzer tiles - which let you try to answer a question another team can't, and the vicious Zwap tiles, which let you swap any two tiles on the table.  Adds just enough to make the game a hoot.

The only downsides are the questions can sometimes be painfully easy.  Also some of the categories and questions seem very European.  But hey - this is your chance to broaden your horizons!

This is the best trivia game I've played. The mechanisms in the game - weighting your randomly dealt topics, and swapping topics with other players - allow the game to adapt to a group's particular expertise. If everyone knows about, say, architecture, then whomever is dealt the architecture category will choose to play it early for a mere one or two points, because they know it will otherwise be stolen by another team. This forces the group's more difficult topics to be placed later in a round, so they are worth more. 

It's a shame (for non-U.S.Americans, anyway) that the politics, community and sports categories are quite U.S. centric, although as I have explained the game can adapt perfectly well to the players. Other than that, though, I find the questions to largely be about lasting, significant things from various fields - art, literature, science, history, nature - rather than the sort of gossip and inane celebrity, TV and sport trivia that would render the game unplayable in twenty years.

2-4

Voorbereiding:

Elke speler neemt 1 pion, 2 bezzerwizzer tegels, 1 zwap tegel en 1 speelbordje. Plaats de pionnen van alle teams (of spelers) op het startveld. Stop de 20 zwarte categorie tegels in de zak. Kies een team (of speler) dat mag beginnen.

Speeloverzicht:

1/ Elk team trekt 4 categorie tegels uit de zak.
2/ Plaats de 4 categorie tegels op de 4 plaatsen op je bordje (bij 1, 2, 3 of 4 punten).
3/ Te beginnen bij de laagst gewaardeerde categorie beantwoordt elk team 1 vraag uit de corresponderende categorie.  Per juist antwoord ga je 1, 2, 3 of 4 stappen vooruit op het speelbord, afhankelijk van de punten die je aan die categorie hebt gegeven.
4/ Het team aan de linkerkant leest de vraag voor jouw team voor. Daarna is het volgende team aan de beurt, enzovoort.
5/ Je kan extra punten scoren door bezzerwizzer en zwap tegels te gebruiken.
6/ Wanneer elk team zijn 4 vragen heeft beantwoord, gaan alle categorie tegels terug in de zak.
7/ Herhaal de stappen 1-6 tot er iemand als eerste een volledige cirkel rond het bord kan maken. Dat team wint.

Bezzerwizzer tegel: Als je denkt dat je een vraag van een tegenstander juist kan beantwoorden, speel je een bezzerwizzer tegel vooraleer de vraag is gelezen. Nadat de vraag is gelezen, mag het andere team als eerste antwoorden en dan jouw team. Als zij fout antwoorden en jouw antwoord is juist, dan scoor je 3 punten.

Zwap tegel: Speel deze tegel aan het begin van een beurt om een categorie van een andere speler te verwisselen met 1 van jouw categorieën. 

Nadat je een bezzerwizzer of zwap tegel hebt gespeeld, mag je deze tegels niet meer gebruiken tot de volgende ronde.

Bezzerwizzer is more interesting than your average trivia game given the number of different question categories there are and the ability teams have to swap questions or steal them from other teams. 

Unfortunately a trivia game lives and dies by the quality of the questions it asks. Too easy and no one feels challenged, too difficult and the game feels hopeless. None of us would claim to be a genius or even far above average, but for my group Bezzerwizzer was the former. Most of the academic questions felt like they'd be suitable for high school students and we aced most of the pop culture questions as well. 

Your mileage may very, but for us Bezzerwizzer never felt like a true competition between the players or the game itself. If we could swap out the questions for those closer to our level this game's few clever ideas would likely make it a hit with my group. In its current state however it will remain on the shelf.

This nearly nails the 'modern trivial pursuit' title. It removes some of the frustrating elements of the classic game. The only problems I have with it are: 1. The name 2.The dull art design. 3. An extra tile should be included for when you get that ridiculously hard question.

[1 play] Pretty good trivia game. The main mechanics here address the problems of knowing more about some categories than others, and of having someone else get a question they don't know but you do.

Bezzerwizzer is a decent effort for a quiz game. It doesn't have the long-windedness of Trivial Pursuit, allows for a couple of tactical shenanigans, and quite generally keeps the rules mostly out of the way. That's pretty good. Then again, it's still just a simple trivia game.

It is much better than Trivial Pursuit - you don't have these random dice-rolls. There is still some luck which categories you get, but you have some influence by choosing which will give you one pints and which 4 points - plus the swap-token to swap one of your categories with one of another player...The Questions are of very changing difficulty - some I have no Idea about and others a ten year old could answer... SO it is still much luck here...

RATING: 7
This is a pure trivia game in the sense that it is only about answering questions. Each player or group of players draw tiles with different categories which they then can order from one point to four points making some categories more valuable than others. During the game players of the other teams can try to answer your questions and each team can also switch categories. 

Since I have a passionate hatred against Trivial Pursuit it is interesting that this game improves in many ways with simple solutions. While trivia games aren’t my favorite genre I can stand playing this. The reasons are that it involves some strategic choices and you are able to answer the other team’s questions, making it more engaging and interactive. The game is also relatively quick and can be played in an hour and go progress when you answer a question correctly. One thing it doesn’t seem to have solved is that the questions seem to vary much in difficulty, but you can’t have all.

I like trivia, and I enjoyed the rules of this trivia game--random categories, the possibility of switching, stealing questions and so forth.  However, the difficulty level of the questions varied wildly; most of them were either everyone-knows-it easy or too difficult for us. I also think it would be nice if, as a party game, it could go above four players without requiring teams. (1 play)

I like the idea of a trivia game with a bit of strategy to it, but the questions were quite easy, in the game we played I think there were maybe only two questions that everyone didn't know the answer to. This renders the 'bezzerwizzing' aspect a bit pointless. Back to Trivial Pursuit, god help me.

Trivia games are not games, they are [url=http://www.human-memory.net/types_declarative.html]non-interactive skill[/url]  contests, played on an uneven field, which are fun for equally matched players/teams, but usually devolve into which team gets lobbed more softball questions in their weakest category, à la Trival Pursuit.

Fun game. I like almost all quiz games and this has a "tactical" twist.

When we played it we had problems with when letting the reader use his Bezzerwizzer marker since he read the question he gets a little more time to consider doing this. Of course this isn't a big problem but we like to think about these things :-)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Bezzerwisser tries to add some gameplay to trivia genre, but goes about it the wrong way: since you get to decide how much you score from which category, it means that you'll score more from easier questions. This is more than a little bit anticlimatic and silly (would make more sense if opponents arranged your categories for you). Add to that some equally weird twists and Bezzerwizzer is a failure with nice bits.

I'd rather play Wits & Wagers, Arvuutin or even plain old Trivial Pursuit.

The problem with bezzerwisser is that it takes too long. 
it is also straight up trivia and their is a big gap in difficulty.
For instance I would have liked it more if the question for 4 points was a hard one. question for one point an easy one.
This isn't too hard too implement. But as the game it is sold it is not.

Played wits and wagers after this and that is trivia done right.
another example would be fauna.

Same as the Mini edition really, just get one or the other if you're interested in the game.

A quiz game, better than trivial pursuit by orders of magnitude - but still a quiz game (that's me implying that it therefore isn't really much of a game at all, not that quiz games are despicable - at worst they are boring and I'd rather just sit and talk about whatever instead). The way you can use your bezzerwizzers and swap, and ordering your drawn categories for point scoring is what makes this one more fun for me. Also - the questions are nicely made, no questions about figure skating champions in the 60's which is a good thing for me. If you want a quiz game, this one is fine, and takes less space than the regular version but is otherwise just the same.

In its latest edition, I think this is one of the best quiz games out there. The Swedish version from 2017 is very solid, and also modular. Additional categories can be bought and used with the game, and if you want, you can switch out the ones you don't really like. So you can customize the game to contain only the categories that fits you and your party.

It's fun and easy, and the bricks makes the game interesting even when it's not your current turn, since you can affect other players' turns as well.

A minor downside is that it is 4 players only. More than that and you have to play in teams.

This is a new take on the Trivial Pursuit-style trivia game, but without the annoying superfluous stuff like moving your pawn on a board and rolling again.  The game adds category-switching and jumping in on others' questions, which adds a nice bit of strategy.  The question set is very recent, but will probably seem dated in a few years.  I really wish this could accommodate more than 4 players without team play.

Good mechanics for a trivia game.  For the group I played with, the balance was off.

A smart and fun trivia game that has a very smart mechanic to allow players/teams to assign their own point values to categories each round so the game is often much closer than most other trivia games. I really enjoy this one still, although the issue with most trivia games is still prevalent where many questions simply seem too easy/hard for different groups. As I usually play with college educated individuals, particularly Math/Science minded people, we have found the Science/Math category in particular to just be incredibly simple. Overall the questions are probably  bit easy in most categories for many adults. Still, my favorite trivia game that I'm almost always willing to play or teach and have fun with. Played a lot during college.

One of the best quiz games out there. Interesting and lots of questions. Nice design and good range of topics. The added spice due to the special ability tokens (change topics, challenge opponenets) make it even more of an interesting game, especially when compard to dust collectors such as Trivial Pursuit and the like. The degree of difficulty varies quite a lot between questions sometimes and that can cause some distress, but then again, there is an equal chance to get an easy question for all teams

Wissensspiel, das aufgrund seiner Mechanik (man zieht aus einem Beutel seine Kategorien und darf diese unterschiedlich stark gewichten) nicht so langweilig ist, wie andere Wissensspiele. Auch die Möglichkeit, anderen ihre Fragen zu stehlen, ist eine gute Idee.
Letztlich bleibt es aber ein Wissensquiz, bei dem einige Fragen lächerlich einfach sind und andere nur von Experten auf dem Gebiet beantwortet werden können.
Als Variante haben wir in Teams gespielt, was ich besser fand.

We are a family of trivia fans, and Bezzerwizzer is among our favorite modern trivia games.

What is great about Bezzerwizzer is that it plays a bit quicker than Trivial Pursuit, but still includes thousands of legitimate, interesting trivia questions, so that trivia "purists" will still be fully satisfied. We also really enjoyed the level of category granularity (much more granular than Trivial Pursuit), so that you can truly strategize based on the specific sub-categories that you tend to do well at. 

Pros:
-Beautiful, high quality board, tiles, box, etc., and no major accuracy issues found with the questions thus far. And TWENTY different categories of questions!
-A large number of questions available (we have played this game a ton, and still aren't even halfway through all the questions!)
-In our circle, the trivia lovers truly adore this game and even the more on-the-fence trivia folks tend to prefer this game over Trivial Pursuit
-The questions seem to generally be the right level of difficulty for us. There can sometimes be variations that cause slight annoyance (e.g. one REALLY easy question followed by a much more challenging one), but, overall, the trivia quality is very solid here.
-The Zwap and Bezzer tiles add a fun element to the game, and the game overall plays pretty quickly (30-45 minutes per game).

Cons:
-20 questions (1 from each category) are on a single card, which makes us reluctant to discard the card after reading just one question... BUT, if you continue reading questions from all the same card, it can get a little tricky, as it is possible that you may at some point want to steal a given category from an opposing team member (and technically, you shouldn't have seen the question before making this decision). We try to play by honor system and just look at the questions / answers we are reading, but the card mechanic can get a bit clunky for us, since we are torn between not trying to blow through all the cards too quickly (we want to eliminate the risk of repeat questions as much as possible), while also still making sure we're not inadvertently seeing any other questions/answers on our card in advance.
-There are a few little annoyances I find with the Zwap / Bezzer tile logic (e.g. there is really no incentive to be the first player to use a Zwap tile, as the other player can just Zwap back later and totally screw you over...), but we proceed anyways and sometimes don't even choose to use these tiles in a given round, given the potential downsides.
-We don't love the 'home stretch' detail of the rules (e.g. the ability to use your Bezzer points to send a player BACK instead of sending yourself forward at the end), so we tend to just keep things simple and omit this rule.
-The cost is a bit steep from what I've seen (we paid close to $50 for this game on Amazon...) - but we've already gotten our money's worth, and then some.

Fingers crossed for an expansion - this game is a gem, particularly for trivia lovers!

I don't care much for trivia games in general, but the simple addition of "swapping" categories and "buzzing" in on the questions given to other players surprisingly makes the game slightly more palpable... but other than that, there is nothing different here than, say, [b]Trivial Pursuit[/b] as the mechanics are by-and-large the same.

Bought new from Salvation Army. Trivia game with cool mechanics on selecting your topics and what you can score for them.  You can also jump in on other teams' questions.

Considering that it's a trivia game, it's one of the best. I don't feel like anything is entirely unfair as you have the opportunity to steal answers from opponents. A lot of the questions are answerable but some are still pretty difficult. You have the chance to strategize by swapping categories with opponents to better your chances at answering correctly. It's a pretty cute game considering what it is.

The best trivia game out there. Random choosing of catagories. With the added chance to swap a catagory you may like with your opponant, or just to screw them up.

Only main issue is that a game (once round the board) can be over in 3-4 rounds, although judging by the severe hatred of trivia games on this site by most, may be a good thing!!!

Finally - 20 categories instead of the usual six of Trivial Pursuit and its clones.

I'm not a fan of trivia games. I was given this as a gift. I did appreciate the additional layers of strategy that went beyond simply "know the right answer to this question." Trying to get and hold onto the categories you expect to do well in is a significant part of the game. That said, some questions were clearly simpler than others by wide margins. For lovers of trivia games, this is probably a win. For me, if I have to play a trivia game, I'd rather it was something like "Wits and Wagers," which makes evaluating the other players as big a concern as knowing the exact answers to individual questions.

tl;dr: fine, except for that one thing

I had heard good things about this trivia game. It's not my favorite genre, but I don't mind playing them usually.
I would say: this is like [thing=2952][/thing] without the board. Also, you can choose what categories you will score more for. And that's a good addition to the genre.
The only real problem I had with the game is the stealing of categories. If someone steals your top category and gives one you suck at, you're screwed and there's little you can do to remedy it.
I would play it again, but not with the stealing.

Standard trivia game.  Unfortunately I'm not a huge trivia buff.  You can pick and choose your best categories to make them worth more which is nice, but overall the questions mostly aren't for me.
Question difficulty is somewhat inconsistent.  Sometimes your question is "What state is Tallahassee the capital of?" when we're hours away.  Getting the "What holiday is the 3rd Monday of January?" the day before was also quite funny.  Besides the occassional freebies, there's a lot of tough questions that only the gurus would know.
Fun party game regardless.  We're not out of questions yet, but occassionally repeats come up which we shuffle back in.

Admittedly a pretty good trivia game.  Rather than luck it relies more on interaction and knowledge (WHAT A TRIVIA GAME SHOULD ALWAYS DO!).  The random element comes from an assortment of many types of categories, but "Zwaps" will let you rectify that slightly if you desire someone elses.  The ability to answer another teams question is rather enjoyable too for those times you just know you know something that someone else doesn't.  All and all pretty good for what it is, certainly the first trivia game I've played that's gotten it right.

Best trivia game I've ever played (not a huge fan of the trivia game genre, though). The questions have a good balance of medium difficulty, impossible difficulty, and soft balls, but the unique aspect of rating your category tiles and the ability to swap and piggy-back on your opponents' questions add an additional element of fun to the game. Since I don't play very often and there seems to be a huge amount of question cards, I've never run into any problems with repetitious questions. I don't generally like trivia games as a rule, but when I'm in the mood for one this is definitely the game I like to play.

Bezzerwizzer just doesn't deliver on the promise of a gamer's trivia slog.

Bezzerwizzer's an interesting entry in the trivia genre.  On one hand, it has a topic-drafting mechanism that I adore (can some other trivia games implement this, please?).  On the other hand, the questions are all over in difficulty.  To give an example, my family (not scientists, in the least) will choose Science or Nature simply because the questions are so easy rather than choose topics they would typically be strongest in. 

Bezzerwizzer also seems to lack enough questions to give it much longevity (I believe 5000).  It'll certainly be fun for several plays, but those questions will run out fast.  This is exacerbated by the fact that so many will fight to get the same "easy" topics turn after turn, making those questions run out faster than others. 

Have I enjoyed the game?  Sure.  Is it a must-purchase game that will last you some time?  No.

A surprisingly fun trivia game.  Takes dice rolls and other awkward means of movement out of the land of trivia once and for all.  Instead of maneuvering around a board trying to get to the right spaces, you wager your knowledge of the 4 categories you randomly draw each round for advancement.  Plus, skillful use of the Bezzerwizzer and the Zwap tiles add a level of excitement not usually found in trivia games.  With every question for any team up for grabs (if the original team misses the answer), all players are usually rapt with attention as the game progresses.  Trivia is not my favorite style of game, but this game is fun, and best played with 4 teams of 2, although a 4 player FFA is almost as fun.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This little trivia game really shocked me with how much I liked it.  The basics are the same as in any trivia game -- get asked questions, answer them to the best of your ability.  The trick is that you have to gauge how likely you are to be able to answer the question based on the category, without hearing the question.  The questions are well-written, and range from moderately easy to devilishly hard, which means you can't be certain to answer a question in any category.  There's a little bit of take-that, and a few ways to try to steal questions from your opponents if you know the answer. These few small tweaks are enough to take the game from just-another-trivia-game to something that is a lot of fun.  If you loathe trivia games, don't seek this out, but if you always liked [gameid=2952] and just wished it was a better game, this is definitely something you should play.

Bezzerwizzer is essentially a trivia game with a lot of different categories.  Each team draws a random selection of categories and then has a limited ability to swap categories with other players... and then you answer questions as you would in any other quiz game.  I'd recommend it as a superior alternative to Trivial Pursuit.  If buying, be warned that there are American and British versions of this game.

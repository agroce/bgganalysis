Spend cards to play cards. Play cards into a tableau to either generate points or a greater income of cards. Some special symbols can come into play to determine the effects of various cards. Certain cards require one another. I think it's decent. Luck can sting quite  a bit in this one. You might literally just have no opportunity to do much of anything and fall quickly behind. That's the one factor that annoys me the most. But it should go by quick enough to shrug it off and try again. Although further play might be needed to see if the decisions get too repetitive too quickly.

A clever card game but once someone makes a big score they tend to run away with the game as scores are effectively multiplied each round (perhaps adding points gained would be better)

RATING: 4
Oh, this is a poor game.  Think San Juan or Race for the Galaxy simplified to such an extent that every interesting decision is bled out.  Cards in The City just give you income and/or victory points, some do need to be played before others.  

An engine to generate more than enough income can be built very quickly.  With four or five competent players, there will be  problems with the deck running out.  Expensive vp scorers are all placed by the mid-game, leaving players to creep towards the winning post by cycling through the dross that is left.  

The City's artwork is bland, boring and functional.  Card quality is good.

Basically a very nice game, but a bit spoiled by lucky card draw, optimized card play and accelleration in VP score.

Easy to teach and to play card game to built the most effective city. Not to compare with Glory to Rom.
A litle bit abstract and sometimes luck driven (without some good starting cards the other player can really run away with the score).
Not a bad game.

Ein Vergleich mit dem sehr viel komplexeren Ruhm für Rom ist sicherlich etwas weit hergeholt. Aber evt. kann man es als eine very-light Version davon bezeichnen. Es spielt sich recht schnell. Der Ausgang ist jedoch extrem von den richtigen Startkarten abhängig. Wenn man schon in den ersten 2 bis 3 Zügen Ketten mit Einkaufswagen und/oder Autos erstellen kann ist kaum noch auf dem Weg zu den 50 Punkten einzuholen. Da das Spiel aber auch nicht sehr lange dauert kann man ja noch eine Runde spielen. Es sollte jedoch nicht immer nur einer das Glück bei den Startkarten haben dann wird es doch etwas nervig da man aufgrund der raschen Punkteexplosion kaum noch eine Gelegenheit zum Aufholen bekommt. Nettes einfaches Spiel für Zwischendurch.

RATING: 2.5
The income growth sort of breaks the game. After few turns, you have huge income and with 4 players, pile runs out every turn (20-30 cards per player).

Some cards like U-bahn are hard to evaluate for points (you need to count all fountains in your cards and then number of fountains within opponent with most of the fountains).

Lot of counting in this game, you need ton constantly know your income and check for >=50 VP's ... also there are many cards that give 1 incomoe or VP per something (so count, count, count ... ).

Some cards are overpowered (5x Stadtvilla wins the game if you are lucky to get them, Baukolonne gives quite huge advantage)

May be playable with house rules that severely limits the growth and reduces need to count all the stuff again and again.

The City has everything a card game needs: it’s easy, it’s fast and it’s even fun; moreover, its theme is satisfyingly developed as well, even more so considering it’s a quick filler.

Being both by the same author, I wasn’t surprised The City plays in a similar but simplified way to Race for the Galaxy: it only keeps its core «discard a number of cards to build» mechanics and translates it in a trendy urban sprawl setting that both works well and loosely fits the theme. Mind the combos to win! (January 2012)

Edit: after further playing, The City has completely won me over: it’s a light yet challenging game depending massively on luck, and I love games where luck plays a prominent part. 

Many players I’ve played with dismiss it exactly because of this though, since drawing the right card at the right time is much more effective than a player’s skill. 

Nonetheless this is exacly what I like about The City: everything here is about luck, thus in June 2012 I have raised my rating from 7.5 to 9.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
For what it is, this was pretty fun.  It felt like it did have a few issues, the worst for me being how the game escalates.  It also does seem to have a runaway leader problem, but then again it is a 20min game.  I LOVE the artwork on this one, and while the game is obviously pretty abstract, at some level, with the way the cards combo, it actually is kind of cool see how those combos make thematic sense.  One I will probably keep, not because its mind blowing, but because its a fun 20min game, with just enough choices to keep it interesting, and the box is small.

2011. 2-5p, 20m. Tom Lehmann. hand mgt, filler game. It's a stripped down (to bare bones) take on San Juan and RftG... but it ramps up extremely quicly to be a fast filler. Experience is helpful, but luck of the initial draw is significant per my BGG buddies... it's very hard to beat someone who gets a killer initial deal.

A very small variant of cards-as-currency card games. At first you struggle with building your income, but it's the player who starts producing points first that wins. Therefore, usually it's a little repetitive and luck-driven. Another disadvantage is necessity to count points with own counter (or just pen and paper). It's fast  and easy enough to play from time to time.

Normally, I'm a huge fan of engine building games like this, where you're gradually building up your capabilities over the course of the game.

However, in my book, it just doesn't work well for a filler game like this.  There's just not enough time for the engine building to be interesting, and before you know it you've gone from zero to 60 and the game is over seemingly before it really got started.

I definitely prefer The City's big brother, Race for the Galaxy, as I'm sure most gamers will.  It offers the same card game engine-building experience much more satisfyingly, although at a greater time expense of course.

This is one of the better filler games out there. If you have 10 minutes, the game of choice is usually between somehing like For Sale, No Thanks, Yin-Yang, High Society etc., but those all share a bit of (semi)-auction mechanics. The City has none of it, simply because there is minimal interaction! Still, it's a filler I enjoy more than some of the other very short filler games. 

It uses one simple mechanic from RftG (after all it's the same designer). There are a lot of different buildings and I was actually quite surprised how many combinations there are. Still, it's a game with a big luck aspect and it's a bit "fiddly" to calculate your income and score every round, and you need a pen and paper for keeping track of the scores, which I think is a minor letdown.

My recommended number of players: 2, 3, 4

The City is a very light game. It resembles the feel of Race for the Galaxy without all the rules complexity. This is in one way a good thing as even my girl friend, a non gamer at heart, will play and enjoy this game with me. On the other hand, The City is a very light game and after finishing a round of it, I wish I could have played Race for the Galaxy instead.

But that doesn't mean that I don't enjoy The City. It only takes ten minutes and there are some real synergies and card combos within the deck which are fun to discover. Even the race feel is there as you try to hit the 50 points threshold as fast as possible. I just fear that The City isn't deep enough to hold my interest for a long time.

What I really don't like is all the counting you have to do each round, I wish Tom Lehman would have come up with a better mechanic to trigger the end of the game.

To sum it up: If you want a ultra light version of Race for the Galaxy you can't do anything wrong with this one.

It's probably a broken game, as the points accelerate exponentially towards the last couple of turns.   I don't see where catching up is possible at all.    I can also see where the counting up of card draws and VPs each and every round could get tedious.   Stumbling through the German slows it down as well, but it's still just a 10-minute filler.   As such, I wouldn't mind playing it a few more times.

2017-02-21 : Game-night and one participant texted he'd be 30 minutes late. So I figured I'd throw this cardgame which said playtime 30 minutes on the box on the table to tide us over. I had read the rules before and it all looked pretty neat. City builder - dual-purpose cards i.e. pay with cards to build cards- prerequisites for builds, building chains, choosing between gaining points and/or cards, cards feeding of each other, very clear iconography - short : this little game looked like a winner. 10 minutes later the game was over - it had lasted 7-8 rounds. So I pick up the box, check again that it says 30 minutes and thought that this was a fluke of some sort. So we play again. 10 minutes / 8 rounds later the game is over again. Hmmm. The game is decent enough in structure, but it ramps up so fast that it's over before you're even properly started, leaving an unsatisfactory taste in your mouth. It's a bit funny if the worst thing you can say about a game is that it's over too quickly, but that's the case here.

This is a very quick and light engine-building card game.  It's decent and relatively easy to teach.  At the time of writing this, it's only available in other languages, supposedly with an English edition forthcoming.  You can use a small chart for the translation as there aren't many words in the game, but it did hinder my enjoyment of the game.  Not bad, and pretty quick.  May re-acquire the English edition whenever that happens.  May not though, as I wasn't truly wowed.

Quick but interesting engine-building game with fabulous art.  Some difficult decisions to be made, as cards must be used both as buildings to expand one's city and money with which to purchase them.  I love the theme, and the German language cards are a plus. A small crib sheet will get you through if your German needs a bit of assistance. Fun, portable, economical on table space; good for pub, work, school or travel. Recommended.  N.B. - I find the game more satisfying when we play to 100 points rather than 50 points.

The City is an engine building game that has been stripped down to the bare essentials. It can be explained in a couple of minutes and played in ten, and that is because there are really only two and a half ways to build an engine so interplay variability is really (and I mean really) low.

Apart from being multiplayer solitaire (which I don't think is a disadvantage here; the game needs to be played quickly, and the solitaire aspect certainly helps with that) you're depending entirely on the cards you're dealt. If they aren't suitable for kickstarting your engine quickly you're pretty much out of the running. The game is short enough for that to not matter much but you shouldn't go into it with the notion that people will be starting out on equal terms.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Really love this game. It is also my wife's favourite.
I read some critics to the art, we love the rough sketchy art. I think it suits well with the theme of the game. You are sketching (creating) the plans for a city.

The designer had released Jump Drive with some ideas from this game but in the universe of Race for the Galaxy. We still love this version. Total keeper.

RATING: 3
The game itself isn't that bad - it has some elements of San Juan or Race for the Galaxy (sam designer). What makes the game unbearable for me is the bookkeeping. After each turn you have to check how much icome and victory points you get. But as many cards give these dependent on the amount of symbols you have in game and each card adds ome of these symbols you have to count your income new each turn.
In both games I played after half of the game I had an income higher than the maximum income which lead to very few interesting decisions.

Feels like a very light and stripped down version of Race for the Galaxy, not surprising considering the designer.  I liked the game - neat choices and fast playing time - but I wonder who the target audience is.  Too shallow for the RftG hardcore crowd.  Too complicated as a gateway.

Enjoyable card game, around San Juan sort of eight - maybe slightly down the spectrum to Race for the Galaxy.  Provides some variety if you have played a lot of those games.  Will take a game or 2 to get used to the German on the cards, but pretty straightforward (wouldn't bother pasting up)

When we play this, we laugh maniacally when we build a city and draw 18 cards each turn.  The fact that you're starting slow, but at the end of the game are drawing tons of cards feels very addictive.

And all this in less than 15 minutes, while taking simultanious turns?

I don't care if some say it's not very balanced: it's addictive!

PS: works very well as a portable sologame.

I really enjoy this game but after a number of plays I am starting to see that there is really only one strategy to do well. This is not bad if you are playing with the same group but if you have experience with this game and play it with newcomers they will have a hard time keeping up.

Start with Race for the Galaxy. Remove the strategy, tactics, psychology, and all traces of player interaction. Then add a lot of extra upkeep. Voila! You've just created The City!

Do you really want to draw 20 cards and then figure out which 12 to keep and which 8 to discard? That's the most aggravating part of the otherwise awesome Race for the Galaxy. Here, it's pretty much the entire game. Well, I lied, it's not the entire game. The rest of the game is counting up how many cards you're supposed to draw and how many victory points you're supposed to take [i]every single turn[/i]. Exciting! Oh yeah, one more thing. I left out one detail about the avalanche of cards you're drawing and sifting each turn. Their powers and modifiers and titles are all written in German. Huzzah!

Even though, this is pretty much just a luck based filler game, it is a fun one.

I don't know why everyone compares it to Race for the Galaxy, as they don't have much in common, but well. It reminds me of a better and faster version of Friesematenten, aswell as a much shorter version of Suburbia.

A good and fast filler with easy rules.

Beautiful, bright and colourful - I found the artwork on this game to be immensely satisfying.  Solid mechanics too in this game, which require you to build up sets of cards with similar symbols and multipliers in order to score big points.  This often requires you to throw away many good cards and risk it all for a few extra symbols that you really need.  Had a lot of fun with this and as a bonus it's really small and portable.

Seems very polarizing. I suspect it won't fly with me since it sounds like a very dumbed down RFTG, so the thought was obviously to try and capitalize on Race's success and aim this at families and kids for whom Race is too complex. (not a horrible idea really to bring them a version)

You'd think it would still pass as a filler for others but it sounds like there are some faults here like luck too high and others

RATING: 6
A simplified San Juan derivate which can easily be explained in five minutes and played in twenty. If you don't get your engine running in the first two rounds, you've lost as cards score points every round and there will be only six rounds or so. The rapid engine building is an annoyance. People will be able to draw 16 cards per round only to discard down to an allowed total of 12 cards. The hand management aspect gets lost in this shuffle. As with all combo building games, I suck at this game but the short playtime is a big plus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An enjoyable game. Not being a huge RftG fan (I really like it, but never truly got into the game) I have no problem with this being an overly simplistic retread. My opinion is probably a little outside the norm, since I don't believe that RftG is as complicated as everyone makes it out to be (at least if you only consider the base game), so this almost feels like a natural extension of that game system.

Of course the theme is completely pasted on and seems pretty silly, but it's fine. It seems like you can really get rewarded and punished by early card draws, but drastic changes can take place over the course of the game.

I still don't know how I feel about the endgame. I guess the game is much more of a sprint. Many people like to get their engine going and then crank it a bunch at the end, but I can imagine that many people would feel frustrated at how quickly the game ends. But at the same time it encourages you to go all in on a certain strategy and hope that you cross the finish line first (or further). And if it doesn't work out, so what, you can play it again in 5 - 10 minutes!

Let's be honest: this is multiplayer solitaire AND very luckdriven (what comes to cards you get). But The City is very fast to play (10 minutes) and it offers in that time a quick puzzle to solve -> these are the reasons why it survives. In a same time it isn't that exciting or unique so no reason to give it any higher rating. I own a unofficial "finnish edition" which makes the game very smooth to play.

Rating based on one play. Some have described this RftG-light. Make that ultra-light. Engine-building stripped down until there is almost nothing left. Disappointment.

Played it again and now rate it a 6. Of course it's very minimalistic, but you have to realise it's only a short filler, and for such a short filler is has quite a bit of strategy - although it's mostly about making the best of the cards you draw.

RATING: 4
The City seems to pursue the question of how far a mechanism like cards-as-currency can be reduced. The answer, at least for me, is 'Too far'. While I can see the merits of this little package as an introduction for San Juan or Race for the Galaxy, it lacks interaction and, therefore, anything that would make it an actual game. In fact, The City might be the game that all those who managed to perceive Race for the Galaxy as non-interactive have actually played.

Nice, lighter version of Race for the Galaxy. It's not essential game by any means, if you're going to get one or the other, I'd pick RFTG in 99% of the cases. But there are times when even RFTG seems like too much work and then it's nice to bring out The City. It's easy to learn but you need to know little bit German. 3 years later, Splendor fulfills my light endine-builder needs better so I'm lowering the rating, but it still has a place in our collection thanks to small size, Splendor isn't very portable.

I can't see myself ever saying no to this game because it just plays so fast.  I like RftG and San Juan a lot, they are a couple of my favorite games, but despite this feeling like I have less control, it plays so quickly that it doesn't matter.  I really wish there were an English edition so it would be simpler to introduce to others.  As it is, it's still pretty simple even with it in German.

I wanted to buy this game after one play, so I guess I like it.

Fast enough to be deemed 'quick filler' but decent enough gameplay to count as a 'real game'. thumbs up bang for the buck factor.

I actually think I prefer this to San Juan and Race for the Galaxy: it's as multiplayer solitaire as both of them, but it's so much quicker to play that I don't get bothered as much by it. Less rules as well. One of those 'let's concentrate on individual races to see who's the quickest' games. But this one is pretty fast, so it's over before you're bored.

RATING: 6
I've played this a few times now.  I quite enjoy it as a very light, engine-building game.

However, I'm not sure how long it will continue to hold my interest.  It seems to be largely determined by luck: at the start of the game, you might have a decent combination of cards to begin generating income right away; if this happens, it doesn't take very many turns before you can achieve an income of 8 or more; and once that happens, you can buy just about any card you pick up, so luck of the draw plays a huge role.

Having said all that, I enjoy trying to figure out what the German-named buildings are, and I find it quite a relaxed, fun game since I don't feel too badly if I lose.

I finally got to play The City last night. It's very cute. I can't even call it a watered-down Race for the Galaxy, though it shares some concepts.

You have a hand of cards.
Everyone chooses one card, simultaneous reveal.
Pay for the card by discarding some number of cards.
Each played card has income in cards and VP (though only really good cards have both non-zero)
There are synergies and bonuses based on three types of card icons.
A very few cards have pre-requisites, for example cannot build a University before you have a school (fictional example -- I don't remember which side of its pair the school was on, since I didn't play it and my gaming German isn't the best.) IIRC all there were multiple possible cards to enable any given thing, and multiple copies.
When someone's explosive snowball goes over 50 points, game ends.

There's a jump-start option (everyone has one starter card, the Architect, with zero cost and one card of income. IIRC three of the five at our table played them, including the winner and second-place players.)

There's a "my hand is truly horrible" option (draw five keep four mix-and-match like the hand-explore from RftG.)

The one thing that worried me was that a few expensive cards synergize with other people's tableaus; in practice on the last turn someone asked "does anyone else have a SomeBigGermanWord" and it never came into play otherwise. After Brian won he showed off the capstone card of the fountain strategy, which costs 11 out of a hand limit of 12 and scores VP for both your fountains AND one other fountain player's fountains.

We shuffled the deck twice in a 5p game, I think, plenty enough time for the deck to get the good cards sifted out. A cleverer person than me would have been considering denial in their discards, but by the time I was wealthy enough to realize that I didn't have time to play all my synergistic cards, it was too late.

I like this game. I like the mechanics and should really get into the more mature games like San Juan and Race for the Galaxy, but for now I'm happy to play this most of the time as it is pretty quick and fun.

But I do have to say that I do get the feeling that this games is based on quite some luck when played between people that know what they're doing. Some cards will just get you a boost if you have them in your starting hand and some will really give you the victory if drawn at the right time. I think the aforementioned games are a little bit more based on skill than this.

Then again, what would you expect from a little 10-15 minute game?

Update: it is wearing a little for me. I still like it, but I think I would like a game a little deeper. Still a great game for what it is.

-No interaction
-Having to check every card interaction every round

This is the first card game I played where other cards are the cost to play them (sorry Race for the Galaxy and Summoner Wars!)

I found this to be a really interesting mechanic. However, it was quite annoying to count the income and victory points you get each turn, especially when you have to check every card interaction. Imagine Suburbia without the Income and Reputation tracker *shudders*.

Also, almost quite literally no player interaction (not even blocking!)

I definitely want to play more games with this mechanic now though! Race and Summoner, here I come!

Suburbia is the better game.

Packs a huge punch in a tiny box and a really short playing time. 

A two-player match takes only ten minutes. Since everything happens simultaneously, adding more players does not necessarily mean a longer playing time; The game length is just the amount of time the slowest player needs.

Player interaction is limited to occasionally benefiting from the cards other players have built.

Great and inoffensive filler: a Race for the Galaxy in 15 minutes with a cheery For-Sale-like theme and art, and probably the best money-points conversion engine I've seen outside of Dominion. Purists will argue that it's entirely driven by the card draw, but when you can get an entire game played in 20 minutes, who cares?

Mind-boggling that no English translation of this has ever been published, not least because of the rabid RftG following.

Great weight and decisions for a 15 minute filler. Explaining the German bits were a lot easier than I expected, with just a few phrases needed to be recognised. After that you've got a game of playing about 7 or 8 cards out, which means you need to get a card building engine working quick smart, and/or a VP scoring engine even smarter. Building a card is done San Juan style, so it combines the same fun decision process as San Juan, but plays a lot faster as it's all simultaneous and the game rockets along once the VPs start coming. Then there's all sorts of ways to build engines through either combos or delaying/building big buildings meaning there's plenty to explore. I'm glad I've picked it up.

Instant hit with me. This is similar in feel to "San Juan" and "Race for The Galaxy" but is much more accessible. There are basicly two phases of RftG combined in one! And no trading.
I like this very much and look forward in playing it again. Just the right game for the right price.
The only nitpick (I have to write down my actual points)
Update (01-05-2013): Finally found someone who DIDN'T like this game. Still he pointed out many things which I LIKED very much in this game. For me this is my definite RfTG-fix and therefore I raise my rating.

The cards can be used as buildings and as currency, interesting idea. There are some possible synergies between the cards, but most of the times luck plays a major part and overrides any possible strategy. A pity, because it has the potential to be a really good game. There are some variants (on BGG) to reduce the amount of luck a little, but they don't help much.

Update: First play face to face and not only is the Deutsch a hurdle for smooth entry, but the scoring after each play really breaks up the rhythm, with stuttering accounting. The only way I can see to pick up the pace of scoring is firstly a new card is offset from your tableau, then with the running total from the previous turn add the score of the offset card plus any bonus for the symbols etc. Likewise with the $ adding previous total etc. But is it worth the trouble?
 
Playing solo a lot at the moment (aim for 50+ vps after round 7 or 8-determined by a coin flip).

For me it is a design in which you emotionally learn to let go of valued cards in order to progress; the 'discard to pay' is an angst filled mechanic, two-fold not only in having to discard a high scoring card/combo but there is the possibility of the discard getting into someone elses hand.

Great concept - but the game is very short; too much depends on the luck of the card draw. It's easy to get fucked up big time or be the most certain winner of the game after the dealing of the initial hands and the first two or three rounds of play. This is said after only one playing, so I may be wrong here. Nevertheless, if you have non-gaming friends, this is a game I would suggest playing. UPDATE: After a few more playings, the above said is still true. But the game is that short (7 to 9 rounds), that it doesn't matter much. In fact, this is a great 2-player game! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is one type of filler that I really like - multiple uses of cards and engine building. It feels a bit like first slowly pushing hard to get a vehicle to start and then suddenly see it spin completely out of control down a steep mountain. The end game can almost be a bit anti-climatic because everything is over just as, or just before, it feels as if you have finally started getting somewhere.
It is not a solo game, but I play solo with two cities.

I was very excited about this game, so I was very eager to play this as soon as possible.
Well, after our first game, I was a bit disappointed.
It didn't give me the good vibes I hoped for.
But I think it will do in the future.
because there are a lot of different cards in this game, you first have to get to know them, before you can feel the potential of the game to it's fullest. Learn the different combinations and conditions of the cards, takes a couple of rounds. We only played one, so......
But, it is quick and fun, so this will hit the table more often.

RATING: 5.2
(+) Very quick game: easily explained and plays in about 20 minutes.

(+) A nice theme for a small card game

(+) Due to its small size, pretty broad player number spectrum and short playing time, a very suitable game to take on travels

(+) Feeling of quick progress. Due to the cumulative nature of income and victory point generation, once a game kicks off, there is a very quick rush to the finish.

(-) Not very original game. The only real mechanic here is the choice to use a card as a building or currency. This mechanic works well, but has been implemented in better and more advanced games like San Juan.

(-) Extremely light game. Rather luck dependant, mainly depending on the cards dealt at the first 2 rounds.

A good addition to the set of engine buildibg card games. In The City it's much easier and faster to build the card drawing so it's eventually a race to get the engine as quickly as efficient as possible. As in Dominion it's important to realize when to switch from money (drawing cards) to victory points. A good fille nonetheless and even if there is only German version available it's easy to play with the already released prelimanary English rules + there actually isn't that many things to figure out anyways.

This game is magical. It's so quick, so tense, so engaging, so unfortunate it hasn't gotten an English release. Buying cards with other cards, aka Race for the Galaxy, is great thinky fun, yet the weight of this is very low. The best part is it's only about a twenty minute game, and it gives you that "I need to play this again" feeling immediately afterwards. Great, great game.

RATING: 4
After ten plays it has dropped another point in the rating. The only thing preventing me from ranking this even lower is that it's over in seven (maybe eight), rounds and ten minutes from opening the box to closing it up.

A robot could play this quite easily. I'm disappointed because it showed such promise. All the different cards with their small changes in values. The combinations on offer. The lure of playing the Baukolonie and double building cheap cards... forget it. Build your Architect on the first round. Build cheap income cards with symbols and specialise on two of the three - say cars and suitcases. After four rounds of doing this your income should be about 10 and it's time to move to the expensive points cards. Don't bother reading what the other cards do - you're probably past the building restrictions by now. Look at the points star symbol and build the one with the highest value - again the points per car (or whatever), symbol ones are best. The penultimate round should see you earning more cards than you can keep. Toss the excess. Don't bother to read anything. Build the one with the most victory points. Done. If you didn't win then somebody else had better cards than you. Oh... there's somebody else there!? Sorry, I didn't realise. Oh good - maybe I get one point for each of your car symbols too.

Oh, it's so, so disappointing. I look at the cards I didn't bother to read and wonder how it went so wrong. Surely we could have a contest and come up with some rules to do the cards justice. Someone seems to have put a lot of effort into coming up with all these different card values and combinations. Was it really play tested?! Sorry, but this city stinks. (On a positive note - it does give my kids plenty of counting practise.)

------------------------
Fairly chaotic, but quick. There's not a lot of tension here and no interaction to speak of. You start building your income cards while looking ahead to what cards you might like to use when you jump to collecting points. There's plenty of ways to earn both points or income, so it doesn't have that San Juan feel that you have to keep a certain card and not use it to pay for another. The simultaneous building makes it faster than Friesematenten's repetitive auctions, but I think I prefer that game (just) and they feel similar to me.

It's simple, but unimpressive. I like that it plays fast, but it needed some harder choices like I have when playing Innovation or... well, a whole lot of other card games. No tension, just a fist full of cards in what's almost a solo game.

Completely broken. I bought it without testing it because I thought that 6 EUR could not be a big loss.

Occasionally people see it on my shelf and ask whether we can play it, so I tell them "It's completely broken.". Then they will say "Oh, come on, maybe it's not as good as other games you have played or maybe it's just not your cup of tea, but I'm fairly sure that something that is shipped in a shiny box by a big publisher can't be 'completely broken'. It's probably just not very good, right?" So I tell them "Well, it takes only 15 minutes, we can play it and you can see for yourself.".

"You were right," they will say afterwards. "It *is* completely broken."

With "Race for the Galaxy" being my all-time favourite board game, the next game from the same designer with a similar concept, but greatly simplified and faster setup and gameplay is the perfect game to either introduce players to RftG or to just have a few quick RftG-like filler games.

The game ramps up VERY quickly -- a bit too quickly for me, actually! It's meant to be a fast-playing filler, but I'd prefer a somewhat slower pace ... after a few plays, it just seems to be so dependent on that initial card draw! 

Hmm, actually I'm not sure about it. It seems pretty clear that experience helps here -- it's not all luck-of-the-draw! -- but wow, getting a good draw at the beginning seems to be a pretty powerful strategy!

I'm not entirely convinced that this isn't random. Yes, there's a little engine building, but with 5 players burning through the deck, you really can't guarantee you'll ever get the card(s) you want. It also seemed that some cards are just outright better; one player was earning 16 points per round by turn 4, almost all from one card. 

Still, it plays in 10-15 minutes so I can't really complain, but this felt much more pastime than game.

The City plays like a really streamlined version of San Juan (a.k.a. Puerto Rico The Cardgame), with a very short playing time and hardly any player interaction. Still, it offers some interesting decisions for such a quick game. One of the better non-collectible (short)cardgames out there as far as I am concerned. Even though I own the German version, my 9 year old son was able to enjoy it after only a brief explanation. I like it best with only two players, although 3 is fine too.

Super light Race for the Galaxy. I just wish they had done it solely with symbols, like in Race... I think I won't buy it until there is an English version out there (but then yes).

So it was overall pretty good for such a fast and light game. My concerns? I suspect there is not very much depth or replayability in the game. In addition, there was a lot of counting of symbols each turn and you had to write your points each turn (or use some chits) which all was a bit teadious for such a light game. Also, the exponential growth is suprisingly fast - maybe it blows up even a bit too fast? Anyways, I am happy to play it again and see how it holds up in continuous plays.

This is pure distilled greatness. First session and we played something like 12 games in row. Of course this is pure economic snowball game and sometimes you know to win/lose after one minutes of playing but that does not matter when game takes like 8 minutes to play. I won one game (against good opponent) only with two cards of income in the end of the game (and I had only two stadvilla - last two cards). Most of you just first collect good card income and then points, but it is also possible (with some combos) to collect points from the beginning and end up with pretty louse card income but still win.

Juego de crear una maquina de producción en donde las cartas valen como puntos de victoria, moneda y dividendo. Las aparentes decisiones se diluyen ya que cuentas con una mano corta al inicio que te obliga a bajar la carta que produce dividendo (si las tienes)  Esto crea efecto bola de nieve en dónde un mal arranque te condiciona la partida (es corta ya que esta pensada para que se cumpla el objetivo de puntos en 7-8 turnos).
Posibles arreglos: Mulligan de inicio, mercado de compra visto, ampliar el numero de turnos, cambio en la forma de puntuar (totales, en vez de sumas en cada turno...)
Por otro lado, el atractivo del juego esta en decidir el momento en el que dejas de buscar dividendos para pasar a puntuar, así como en el uso de las cartas para multiples opciones (algo que han introducido muchos juegos posteriores).

German city builder card game. Pay cards to play buildings that generate more cards and points. Build your engine for combos. It's a race to 50 points. The game escalates as fast as it ends.

[TO GO]
urban version of RFTG and San Juan. Gorgeous architectural/fashion-style illustrations somehow meld together in the mind more logically than both RFTG and San Juan (shopping centre, museum, motorway etc)). Orange and green Icons for shopping, industry and R&R pop off the cards.

Had to buy french version - learnt some new words while getting up to speed with the game. Not afraid to buy french/german games if only need to learn a dozen or so words/phrases to get by: eg Glen More, Kingdom Builder.

Simpelere variant op San Juan en Race for the Galaxy.

Spelers bouwen allerlei gebouwen om een stad te maken. Deze gebouwen leveren iedere ronde een inkomen aan nieuwe kaarten en/of punten. Diegene die de meeste punten scoort wint het spel.

Erg snel, maar toch redelijk wat keuzes om te maken.

A lighter San Juan/Race for the Galaxy type game. Worth playing.

Very fun light game. It just misses little something to be perfect (for example it would be nice if high scoring cards would reduce your income). It works well with 2 players and with more players. Definitely a keeper in my book.

Quick little game. Some games your draws simply don't provide the cards you need to get going, but given the game's length I'm okay with that happening every now and again.

10-2012:The game really does have multiple paths to victory and has been a reliable, fun way for us to game for 15 minutes. There is a very heavy dose of luck with a win, but since it's so short there is always next time.

5-2012: Game is new and we are liking it, but it is too soon to say what its staying power is. Early lead is generally crucial, if it is so much that way it will wear out its welcome. But, it could become a go-to game in when need a very quick game.

A good light card-game filler.

My number 1 game of choice to play while waiting for the latecomers.

Light city building themed card game. Had some strategic choices (setting up your engine) and tactical choices (what cards to discard to pay for the one you want to build). Not bad, not great either. Okey filler.

I would've given this game a sufficient rating if it weren't for the sheer imbalance that the Town Hall and Park cards bring to the game. They are objectively better than any of the other cards because they are so cheap to buy while they give you a massive income of both cards and points in return because the fountain icon is more prevalent than the car and shopping cart symbols. I can't believe this hasn't come up during playtesting. Maybe I'll make them more expensive in our games because they simply win the game every time for whoever gets them first. 

But besides that, this is a quick, easy, accessible and pretty enjoyable game.

german edition played, not understood very well, but it was decently quick and pretty much harmless.  maybe i'd like it better in English, when i understood how the buildings were related better.

a little filler, dumbed down San Juan, (mostly) 8 rounds playable in 10 minutes, for what it is it's kinda good

Quick and "half-deep" card game. Plays very fast but also lacks interaction. Sadly you need to do a lot of counting - if someone doesn't like bookkeeping you're out of luck with this game.

Very much like Race for the galaxy, though a bit simpler - also the same things to hate. This is just about a solitaire.

Poor card game. San Juan is 100 times better.

Todos bajan una carta que indica el edificio que construirán. Deben pagarlo con cartas de su mano. Los edificios otorgan PV y pueden potenciarse unos a otros. Quien obtenga primero 50 PV gana.

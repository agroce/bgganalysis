GAME: Catan: Family Edition
RANK: 4477
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A catan family friendly edition that sets up the board for you in 10sec flat.

The limitations and randomness has been taken out of the setup aspect and balances these numbers as equally possible around the board.

Which is good and bad.

Otherwise plays exactly like the way the main Catan is played. 

Starts slow and picks up to the final jump for that 1-2 points grab for the win. The near win period is where resources gets out of hand and its possible to horde those resources and don't trade, just for keeps and for the selfish win.

Not a great exciting trading game that it may be, but nevertheless, the mechanics did fall into placer entry well and makes for a good fun evening of family friendly game of road and house building.

Easy to learn, light confrontational possibilities and friendly interactions during trade makes this game true,y a classic.

Don't like Catan, too easy to get ahead or behind early and win/lose because of it.

I rate the standard Settlers with a 6.6. This edition gets less because of the limitations of its board and components.

It's Catan.  Decent game to introduce people into the hobby, but the mechanics are a bit dated.  Still a classic though.

Not that's it's a bad game.
A lot of people like it.
I just find it kind of boring.

This is a classic and enjoyable game. It has this problem though where if the dice don't cooperate you spend several round sitting with no cards or few cards in your hand. If you've ever spent 20 minutes watching the other players play while wishing your numbers would come up, you know exactly what  I mean.

Classic game which is easy to get in to, however if you do not have a very co-operative bunch playing it can be a veeeery loong game.

Not always as much fun as it should be!

There are just so many Catans now that its almost confusing to talk about if you are not able to buy all the expansions. Either way, my wife and I like playing the game because we are on equal grounds when it comes to winning and we like to bet on who will win.

It's an okay introduction to Catan, and it ensures everybody has an equal footing at the start. Although this is a problem with original Catan, it comes at the expense of variety, so it doesn't have the replayability of the original Catan.

The hexes on the board are attached together in groups and the numbers are printed on the board. Some randomization possible, but not much; quicker set-up with less floating pieces seemed to be the goal here.

Had it's run.
Was a really good introductory game.
There are much better ones now.
The game itself offers nothing much.

Not sure if with expansions it becomes more interesting.

Not actually Family Edition.  I just have the Mayfair Games 4th Edition published in 2012.  I couldn't find it in the Collections list.

What is there to say about Settlers that hasn't been said better elsewhere?  Endless strategic depth.  Position-based strategy, trading / politicking, and understanding 2d6 dice odds - some of my favorite things in a board game!

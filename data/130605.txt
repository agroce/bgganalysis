Hard to rate after one play but my interest is tickled.  Lots of little bits and tokens and stuff so the set up takes a while, but the game plays along at a good clip once you get it all up and running.

I feel like "exploration" is one of that most difficult things to get right in a board game but I think Lost Valley does an admirable job.  There is a great sensation of trying to forge ones way through a harsh wilderness, living off the land and trying to strike it rich.  Glad I backed this one.

I can handle the long wait if the final product is good. Sadly, this version is quite inferior to the old version. Rules, Player aid, components, they all were better in the original version. Dropped from an 8.5 to a 6. I'll think twice before doing another Kick Starter or Pandasaurus Game.

Update-- After playing the new version I am reminded what a great game this is. I'm still quite disappointed in pandasaurus games for releasing such a poorly produced product but that doesn't change the fact that this is a good game. I think I'll be pimping my copy. It is worth salvaging.

Great game of being a frontiersman, while on the surface the game seems complicated, once you actually start playing everything makes sense and works together well.  The limited resources on the board and small space you have on your character make you have to plan what you want to do, excellent game.

10x10 2015. This game feels pretty different from any other game I've played.  It's very thematic and you can easily feel like your a prospector buying gear and mining for gold.  Turns are very short and click along quite nicely.  And the game provides a good sense of exploration and discovery which is somewhat uncommon in board games.  I'm not sure if the skills are balanced and the game can have a run away winner early on.  Also, although they took some steps to fix it, tagging along behind someone and mining their mine seems to be a solid strategy.  River gold vs. mountain gold seems pretty balanced.  Focusing on treasure hunting is cool but did not seem to be a winning strategy, although using it to supplement river gold worked for me a couple times.  The components are nice and pretty and there's some cool custom dice.  But it would have been nice if the components; especially the skill tokens, which should have been cards; indicated what they did so you wouldn't have to go back to the rule book.  The rule book is a little rough and you'll need to refer to the BGG rules forum a couple times.  Overall though, the game is unique, fun, and thematic and relatively quick for how big the game feels.

Only 2 games played so far, but it was a hit with our gaming group.  Unique theme and exploration, multiple paths to victory.  Use the BGG forums to clarify the rules and printout reference sheets.  Takes about 5-7 turns for players to figure out the rules, once they do, the turns are quick.  Really like it so far. . .

Could have been an 8 based on gameplay, but....
The components in this are borderline unacceptable.  The printing and cardboard components are poorly done, the wood bits are poorly finished, and there was errata distributed almost immediately for mis-printed tiles, including instructions from the publisher to "mark it with a pencil" while waiting for paste-ups.  Seriously, this was a YEAR late in delivery, with very little evidence of why.

Managed to procure a copy, despite the very best efforts of the publisher to make this impossible for people outside of the US - their incompetence in this matter is so bad, I half didn't want to purchase a copy to show any form of support - but as it was someone selling on their unopened copy, it was the best case scenario (lost their desire to play through another aspect of publisher uselessness, and a two year delay in actually putting the game out).

Substantial additions that all improve the gameplay from the first edition, providing an entirely new means of finding gold. Just a shame my opinion has been soured because of an inept publisher.

I Kickstarted this one. No more looking at and balking at used ratty $80 plus used copies. Enjoyed seeing the overpriced 1st editions drop to 20 bucks to unloaded them. Learned a long time ago sitting on something too long and being greedy will get you burned. There is the secondary market price for printed Art work you will find, you know you payed $125 now it is $1,500, finding someone who wants it is one thing, getting that price is another, except for a fool's buy. Ah, that poor guy still has his $80 yard sale copy, should have taken the $45 given the condition.

During the course of the game, players must explore the ever-expanding lost valley in hopes of discovering a gold vein in a mountain, a virgin forest to provide timber or a fishing spot along the river to provide food. The map will be different each time you play, so you never know what lurks around the corner.

I love tile laying games and Lost Valley 1896 is one of the most unique ones. The variously shaped tiles is just one of the interesting parts. The decisions seem endless and each part makes sense. Fishin makes sense, mining for gold makes sense, moving back to the village for equipment makes sense. Extremely fun little game that doesn’t get all the love it deserves.

For some reason, this game reminds me of Tikal. You can work on something (Tikal a dig site, here a mine) and then someone else can come along and gain from your hard work. It is a good game and I would gladly play again, but not one I need to own.

As a huge fan of the original, the reprint is unimpressive.  The components are a downgrade at every level.  Removing the essential crib sheets and replacing the with a larger, useless piece of cardboard is frankly inexplicable.  The simpler rule fixes, bridges, triangles, claims are great.  The convoluted rule fixes, skills, ice movement, win condition seem unnecessary.  Adding 5-6 players makes no sense.  Finally, the rule book is a mess and a major downgrade.  All told, there is very little to justify the late delivery or high cost.  I will not back another Pandasaurus project.

Only one play with two players and I was a little disappointed based on some of reviews for this game. Somehow, there needs to be a little more interaction -- maybe with more players? Otherwise, it felt as if we each go our sides of the board and build up. Quite a few game pieces -- highly recommend an organizer tray. Needs a few more plays.

Getting through the rule book has been a frustrating challenge. After spending about 4+ hours reading the rules, looking at all the online Player Aids, and reading all the questions in the forums, I think I'm finally ready to start playing (it better be good).

12 months later, I still haven't played it. :(

Acquired 5/2016 in trade.
Was attracted by the exploration and 'open world' nature of the game. Also Tile-laying.
The game is much shorter than I expected it to be. Also it's more of an optimization puzzle with a race element and not a thematic experience.
After some consideration, I've decided to pay this forward. It wasn't what I was looking for exactly, and while it does what it does perfectly well, it fails to wow me, and might actually be too complex for how short it is.
11/2016 - Traded this and Jamaca for 3 Tiny Epic games.

Nice to see this game back in print, although I'm pretty sure I don't care for most of the new additions:  treasure map, XPs, team play, 2P and 6P modes.   I do like the claimed mines, however.    But, you can pretty much play in "classic mode", so that's a good option.   The exploration element and strong theme are still the main attractions.

After further plays, I'm dropping my rating.  The new rules make it WAY too short.  I've had multiple games now where there wasn't even time to go back to the trading post because the ice block was already out and moving down the river.  I think the thing to do would be take the best from both games and combine them.  I like the skills.  I like the treasure clues.  I like bridges and the new hunting.  There is a lot to like, but the game ending so fast doesn't give you a chance to do any of those things.

Rules and component choices are absolutely terrible. Player aids from BGG are mandatory. The game itself is unlike anything else I've played. I really enjoyed it, but it seems like it's over before the more expensive gear would ever be useful. This might change after multiple plays if people explore less to prolong the game.

RATING: 7
This is a unique game that delivers thematically but always left a little to be desired in terms of game play. We attributed this disappointment to the fact that the game is about not being poached or taken advantage of so that you frequently would not do things in hopes that people would move away from you. The experience of not doing stuff or doing stuff that benefits someone else as much as you (though you had to pay the resources!) is not particularly inspiring.

Fortunately, we stumbled onto the idea of playing this 2 vs 2 instead of individually and this game is suddenly a LOT more fun and interesting. The team aspect opens the game up such that players do more instead of waiting to see what other players do and infused our play with a lot more energy than is usually there. People were excitedly planning on what they were going to do in concert. Later on, my teammate and I got horses and then invaded the mountain range the other two players had discovered and stole most of the gold. It was great fun, and the game finally reach the level I had hoped it would. 

UPDATE: I was very disappointed in the new Kickstarter version. For all the delays, the game was released with mistaken components (which they did correct) and rules that weren’t much better than the original. It seemed like every time we tried to play there was some rules confusion. I finally tired of trying to make this game work (first as a team game and then with the new rules) and sold it off.

I WANT to love this game sooo much. At a glance, it reminded me of one of our favorite tile placement/resource management game, The Cave. The Cave is not a perfect game, but the exploration mechanics we love. BUT, this version of Lost Valley is truly not good. The rule book is terrible, to be honest. There is no master list explaining the various tokens & tiles, the number of players varies from what is within the rules to what is displayed on the box, the organization of the rule book is poor at best, plus typos and cut-off words hidden behind pictures of game-play. When I opened the box I found a "correction sheet" and three "corrected tiles". I thought, "ok, they righted a wrong, no big deal", but upon further inspection, the game is just sloppily made all around, and the troubles don't end there. If it had great looking components, maybe we'd stick with it, but this one got boxed up quickly with grumbling and frustration.

The premise of the game was definitely intriguing and I was very surprised at how fun the game was!  Turns are quick, the components are beautiful and having several end game conditions is very enjoyable!  The diamond tiles are so unique and everything about this game oozes with theme! I haven't played with all the bells and whistles like XP and special abilities so the game may become a 10 afterwards.  I also felt the two-player game using the team variant was fun when I thought it was going to be "just O.K". I do not understand all the negative reviews of this game!  Sure the Kickstarter took longer than expected, but that should not be the basis for rating the game itself.  I appreciate the publisher going out of their way to fix some minor issues with a couple of the tiles and creating an FAQ, updated rulebook, and paste-ups.  All I can say is that I highly recommend this game and I think once the game hits the general public, that we will see a rise in positive reviews!

I had played the original "Lost Valley" once long ago and enjoyed the unusual exploration mechanic that allows you to place several tiles at once, but it suffered from awful piggybacking. The addition of claim markers to discourage that and the skills to reward building seem to be good ideas, although I haven't tested them in my first play. However, there are other additions and the game is already quite fiddly, both in regard to rules and components, which is aggravated by a pretty bad rulebook and the lack of reference sheets. It's also very luck-driven with random tile draws, gold and food tokens with random values, and die rolls on top of that. The decisions that the players face feel mostly trivial, and the theme, while fairly well implemented, is not interesting enough to keep me engaged.

Finally got my Kickstarter copy. As far as components are concerned, I'm not impressed. Two pieces were not cut so I had to take the xacto kncfe to them, one of my horses has the front legs broken and the cardboard itself is the worst quality I have ever had in a game. We'll have to see about the gameplay. 

[b]Update:[/b] Played it. It was meh. With two players, there's very little interaction. It is easy to just go to our own corners. 

[b]Update2:[/b] Played it again and this time we followed each other around, which made the game more interactive, more enjoyable but still not fantastic.

[b]Update3:[/b] Putting it up for trade. After talking to the wife about it, we decided that our biggest problem with the game is that the goal was too simple - not enough paths to victory - and the actions too tedious. Everything you do feels like a chore and it just isn't fun.

  Of all the games in my library, this is the game that everybody requests to play 1st.  Great exploration and a theme that is not overused in board gaming.  The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of 10 is that I would have loved to have seen cards instead of tokens for the skills.  That would prevent us from having to pass around the rule book every time somebody earned a new skill.

This game could be great, but it's a HOT MESS. One of the WORST RULEBOOKS I have ever encountered.  If you like scouring forum posts for the answers to countless rule questions, this is the game for you!  It's too bad.  There's a really great game in there somewhere, but it's hard to get to because of the extremely poorly written rulebook.  The rules can be very fiddly as well.  This game also takes forever to set up and put away due to TONS of chits. There are some component issues as well...bad art/graphic design and misprints.

Players are prospectors out to find gold in the mountains, the rivers, the forests, the lakes and the plains - wherever it lies! Each player has a player card that shows backpack inventory, gear, and - if you buy one - cart inventory. Players move slowly to the edges of the map, exploring at the junctions of diamond-shaped and triangular tiles. Most of what is found are locations with gold to be acquired, animals to be hunted for food, and "events" that are simply finding random items or treasure clues. Almost everything a player does requires some combination of tools, timber and food. The game consists of getting these raw goods in order to build things and then get more raw goods in order to use things to get more gold and raw goods. The main issue with the game is that movement is slow and moving short distances to get stuff and then go back is not terribly exciting. The trading post where you can buy most things is back at the start and it almost seems not worth it to get the better goods. The game is a race to be the first to get 10 gold and get back to the trading post before anyone passes you. The game also ends if the river is fully explored and an ice block floats all the way back from the spring head. I think most games will end before this happens, though.

It is not a game with agonizing decisions or highly risky maneuvers. It simply a game of moving here and doing that to go there and get this. Do it faster than the others and you'll win! Oh hum.

Lost Valley is a game about the Klondike stampede that rushed North. It's about the grueling journey: traversing Steep Mountain passes with heavy loads, through severe weather, and ever-dwindling resources.

During the course of the game, players must explore the ever-expanding lost valley in hopes of discovering a gold vein in a mountain, a virgin forest to provide timber or a fishing spot along the river to provide food. The map will be different each time you play, so you never know what lurks around the corner.

What an interesting game! This brings me good memories about those adventure/exploration PC games in the nineties. I played with two, but I guess it will probably be a lovely mess with more players.
[b]Update[/b]: Yes, it works even better with more people. I played it with 5 and it was great!

I had and enjoyed the original Lost Valley, and traded a couple years back for this new edition. It adds a few things, including skills, new hunting, fur trapping, and bridge building. This last element is clearly intended to fix the problem with the game being broken at three players, but I'm not sure it goes far enough to do that.

I really shouldn't talk about this play, since it was about as close to the actual rules as if we had played, I dunno, Caylus, and called it Lost Valley. We screwed up a major rule early and often and it dramatically changed the gameplay. Nevertheless, it still gave a good look at the changes. 

This is a fun, narrative game destroyed by a confusing and vague rulebook. It blows my mind that a game known for a poor rulebook got a reprint with no effort made to correct the issue. Maddening. (In fairness the rule we messed up was not the book's fault, it was my own.)

I want to give it another play, preferably with three, to both play by the actual rules and see if the 3p problem is fixed.

Glad I kept the original. A year late and they didn't even follow through on their KS statements. Inferior in just about every way. Doesn't even get the 1st edition rules correct. Probably my last KS, but definitely my last with this company.

Really great game of exploration. There is a fantastic blend of strategy, tactics, and luck. The core mechanics and rules are simple, but there are enough other additional rules that keep the options and replayability high. The components are also fantastic.

This was a lot better than I expected it to be after reading the rules. I do have a couple of complaints, however. First, there are a lot of resources to keep track of. Knowing when to use what and where has you constantly in the rule book checking to see what you need to mine or build something. This leads me to my second complaint, which is the complete absence of a player aid. For a game that has so many different actions and resources, it would have been nice if they had made the player sheets a little bigger to include this. And lastly, the artwork is pretty shoddy by today's standards. All in all, this is the definition of a sloppy, yet functional, reprint. That all aside, the game is a lot of fun. I think this is one of the better tile-laying games out there, and it's one that I can really appreciate the theme of as well.

Excellent tile laying exploration game with unique diamond and triangle tiles.  Lots and lots of cardboard makes set up is a bit of a bear (pun?) - but plays quickly once you're going and limited downtime between players. 

Absolutely terrible rulebook.  Recommend watching the Game Boy Geek video for a good rules overview.  Also, some bad production decisions.  No player aid (print out the Player Action and Gear/Equipment cheat sheet!), gear and equipment tiles don't fit nicely on the Trading Post board, and only two out of a possible four horse meeples were provided in Kickstarter edition.

Despite it all, the game's charms shine through.

Took a while to get past the artwork on the cover.  A decent enough game.  Limited actions and resources.  Tough choices.  Etc.  The one thing I didn't like was that everyone was still in once the end game happened.  I liked the ice flow on the river but think everyone that wants to be eligible to win needs to be back at base before the river is close.  And if the ice is on the river the prospectors shouldn't be able to get extra movement with the canoe.

At first I loved this game. But the last time I played it, I was underwhelmed. Not sure why my opinion changed so much! It's certainly a fine game. Kind of like a role playing game, as players do take on the role of gold prospectors and have to manage their individual supply and gear. Game certainly ends before you'd expect.

An exploration, tile laying, resource collection race game. In this game you move your meeple around the edges of the diamond shaped tiles, and can interact with the various tokens you discover along the way. The goal is to get the most gold. This game comes with an intimidating number of tokens, but it plays quickly and smoothly. I enjoy how your character can level up the more stuff he builds, which unlocks extra skills and abilities that help you muck about. I'm frustrated by the lack of player aids and the way the game ends. Either one player blitzes head and declares the end early, or else an ice cube token dances it's way up and downstream depending on die rolls.

Finally got this to the game group table after two years, with only a couple of solo plays in that time. Just as I suspected, building the map through exploration is the star  of the game, and it is very fun. I give it plus marks for a well-applied theme (the exploring, the prospecting, the building, managing your gear, and surviving in the wild) and the opportunity to narrate your prospector's adventures (or, in my case, misfortunes). Minus marks for the colorful, but difficult-to-use rulebook with add-on errata; downloading the latest edition and one or more player aids is a must. However, don't let that stop you from giving this a try. We figured it out quickly enough and played twice, our second play going significantly faster. Player turns are quick, with only one move, one action, and one trade to execute (although gear can augment these). Also a must: organization of all of the bits. Unless a deal of thought is put into separating and labeling the components, you are in for a long setup. (this garner's no negative marks from me, since I enjoy that sort of thing :-). We liked it enough that I think this will get played again soon by my group, and I now feel well-versed enough to explain it to new players.

Update: We did indeed play this again (twice) the next week, this time with four. I did even worse this time, but my love for this game only grew. I really do want to re-write the rulebook, though, if only as an exercise to see if I can improve it.

A great sand-box game, which can feel too open-ended during your first play, but is really quite good.  The exploration, open options, theme, and teamwork are all well implemented and really refreshing from our normal pool of relatively dry Euros or fiddly, overwrought thematic games.  The KS took forever (clearly the time was spent redesigning/playtesting the 2nd ed rather than ensuring a great production), the rules are a mess, and there were several production errors with the 2nd edition, but Pandasaurus fixed most of these issues (rules still aren't great). If you were already lucky enough to have the 1st ed, then you might be too unhappy with the production problems to enjoy the changes, but for all of us who couldn't afford a 1st ed copy, I think it's definitely worth picking up a copy of this.  Also, you definitely need to print from BGG files the most updated rules, player aids, and skill cards.  I'm considering making up a bunch more improved skills - many of the skills are pretty boring and no one chooses them - and perhaps requiring that you get 3 XP per new skill.

This is an exploration/race game where players each play prospectors trying to dig for the most gold.  They accomplish this by exploring more of the map (laying new tiles down), collecting resources, building works, buying equipment, hunting wildlife, and of course digging for gold.  The game is ended by either someone returning to base camp with more gold than anyone else or by the seasons changing and the entire river freezing up.

My first play of this game was a rough one.  For one thing, the rulebook is atrocious.  They take reasonably simple rules and unnecessarily convolute them as well as spread out concepts and hide important notes throughout.  They also give little attention to important rules, almost mentioning them as an aside, leaving you to wonder whether or not you read it correctly.  And if ever a game needed individual aids for each player it is this one.  But they aren't included so you'll need to make your own.

Past that the components are passable but not great.  The tiles all look very dull and bland.  Considering this got a reprint after so many years, you would  think they would take the time to make the tiles more vibrant and inviting.  All the components, except strangely the wood resource, are printed on square tiles.  The wood is represented by a brown stick, which seems out of place when every other component in the game is a tile.  But at least nothing felt cheap or harmed the playing of the game.  It just looks boring and unexciting.

Because of the struggles with understanding the game, this more than any other needs another play but our first play dragged while people meandered not knowing for sure what they should or could be doing and trying to understand the rules better or having to look back through the book for item costs and clarifications.

I will say that I think the magic number for this game is 3, maybe 4.  We played with 5 and there is a lot of downtime between turns while there is very little you can do until it comes back around to you.  3 is probably perfect but someone pointed out that with 4 at least an even number of players can split off on the two sides of the river.  I'm not sure how important that is, but it is an interesting point.

The race and exploration along with the almost RPG like leveling and gear mechanics are unlike any other game I have (or know of) so it's worth a smoother play to see if with a better understanding the game is better.  But the rules and mess of that first game are important for others to know going in and definitely taints the enjoyability of what could otherwise be an interesting game.

An already great game got even better with this edition!  Not only do we get a few component enhancements in the form of cute little prospectoreeples and enough horsies and canoes for a few players (but not necessarily everyone who purchases one, puzzlingly enough), but we also get several rules tweaks and add-ons, all of which seem to only improve the game play.  I love the new additions to the game; even though they add even more little details to keep track of (downloading my player reference from the files section is a MUST!), they make an already open-ended game even open-endeder!  Though irritatingly, the still couldn't write a coherent rulebook.  But once you've got all the little rules nuances sorted out, it's just such a fun game, where you can strike out into the wilderness and do whatever the hell you want to do (short of shooting your opponents with that new rifle you just happened to find lying around in the wasteland).  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

Once the newness wears off, the poor production will dominate here. No excuse really, considering how long backers had to wait.

Gold mining themed tile placement game. The object is to acquire as much gold as possible from tiles layed on the board, which grows as players explore further with their pieces. On each turn there are a number of actions a player can make, such as move to other tiles, hunt (to acquire pelts for money and to obtain food), build works (such as sawmills and mines) to make extracting resources easier. The main strategy hinges on knowing when to use already acquired gold to purchase items to make your turns more efficient and when to keep hold of it in an attempt at victory. This is quite an unusual game in many ways and it blends theme and gameplay very well. I can't say that it does anything in a standout way however and it certainly doesn't feel innovative but it's certainly playable enough

Great game (once you get past the rubbish rule book), with a lot to do, quite a deep game. Components are fine but you will need to print off a player aid.  It is a bear to teach, is a bit fiddly and I always forget the rules, but it is a very good game.

Very unique, i have nothing else like it.

Rulebook inhibits first play

RATING: 7
First (solo) play felt a little flat, and I'm concerned about the balance between river gold and mountain gold (I feel as though it would be nice if there was some overlap between the two in value, even if it was just a few nuggets.)  I don't really like the graphics, which seem washed-out and uninteresting.  But at heart there seems to be some fun to be had here!  I just worry that I'll bring it out with a group and they'll feel similarly "meh" about it.  But maybe some actual human opponents will add some nuance?

Edit: They do!  I've played a few times with my wife, each running two prospectors, and it was a good amount of fun!  I'm still unsure whether mountain gold is a dominant strategy but I'm interested in exploring more.

I do wish the rulebook was presented clearer, with fewer background images. Would be nice if there was a photo inventory of the contents. Also confusing to find out at least one piece wasn't cut and would need to be exacto'd.

The rules were messy and incomplete, but I think we still got through it. The graphic design is almost aggressively unhelpful, with no player aids to help. Still, I think the game in there is fun... if you can get to it.

Fun, but some find it to be too luck-based. Going for mountain gold is simply superior compared to other strategies. A bit of exploration is very likely to yield a spot where you can get food and timber near a mine, and off you go. Better at higher player counts, with more leeching of others (which can, and should, hurt the miners), and triangulation shenanigans. The downside of more players is that you have very limited time to act once winter sets in. The skills are very unbalanced, and we don't use them.

Tom Vasel was right, this it probably the best exploration game I've ever played.  Its tons of fun and plays best with 3-4 players.

I love the idea of this game, the theme is fun, the exploration aspect is nice, but there is just WAY to much going on, the different rules, and all the little pieces. It is way to fiddly for a game that should be simple.

Lost Valley is a Eurogame take on frontier life. The main focus is of course on gold panning, but players will have to hunt, gather pelts and build all sorts of little projects to make survival easier.

The rulebook is kind of pain. Poorly translated, or at the very least, poorly laid out and organized. Once you get going, the game is extremely easy to play so it's unfortunate that the rulebook makes it seem twice as complicated as it actually is. There are some confusing aspects to the inventory system as well, certain things can only be carried in certain spots, while other things can freely move between two or three different storage spaces. It's wonky as hell, but again, once you slog through the confusion it actually plays pretty smoothly. There was also a terrible decision to track skills with tokens instead of cards, meaning you have to look it up in the rulebook every time you gain a new skill. It's sloppy and essentially makes the games UI harder than it needs to be, adding to the illusion of complexity.

Gameplay is of the three steps forward, two steps back variety. The resource cost for each action seem to be laid out perfectly to prevent you from ever executing an efficient turn. You are always either a food short, or lack the storage space to claim the resource you want to harvest. There is also a some excellent interaction, as the survival works are mostly communal, meaning that when you build something for yourself, the whole table can swoop in and gain the benefits.  This creates some interesting tension, as it often puts you in the position of using your actions to make your opponent's actions more efficient, which as you can guess, is a losing strategy.

We had a rough go the first time through because of the rulebook, but after the game we were all quite excited to dive back in. It's a sandbox game, so there is quite a bit to explore, particularly in regards to player behavior. Should they clump together and leech off of each other? Go solo and try to score a big strike all by yourself? Just go hunting and not worry about gold at all? It seems like all of these things will work, which makes for a very interesting metagame when it is all said and done.

I cannot believe that such a poor production is possible in the contemporary era of board games design & manufacture. Somehow the great game beneath the horrible manual & bordering on prototype components shines through enough for me to feel confident in having purchased it, but I won't touch anything by either designers nor publishers again until others report on their products. Absolutely unacceptable.

Played with my kids numerous times now.  Excellent exploration-style game.  Only nitpick is that we've had to house rule certain aspects of the game to make it flow a little smoother with the kids.

The game has some problems. The rules could been better. You really need Player aids to play the game, and they are not included. The skill tokes doesn't tell you what the skill do - you have too reference the rule book. Many of the problems the game has can be fixed be some of the files there on BBG and the game is fun to play.

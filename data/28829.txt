Pre-ordered from DVG. Arrived just in time to go to a week long conference with me - looking forward to spending some time with it.

Very enjoyable, only played the first campaign so far but the game still beats me every time. The system is great and the game moves on an doesn't get bogged down in the details. My only criticism is that the allies seem to get unfair advantages fairly often - they nearly always get more battle plan tokens due to masses of supply tokens, and can ignore the crippling stacking rules. 
Maybe this is historic but it makes for a frustrating game when you get attacked by a stack of 6 units, who then draw "reinforcements" and magically summon a new unit from thin air.

I really enjoy this maybe once a year and prize everything about it, but then can't bring myself to play it for a very long time.   There's no doubt the design balances "realism" with playability, but there's also no denying that you just spend too many hours pushing counters around a small map by yourself.....  So to me this is an indulgence not to be enjoyed too often.

It seems like a vintage Dan Versen game: solitaire and lots of chit cups, high production values, good rulebook and kind of "meh" in the end.

I would rather a play a Field Commander game than a Leader game because blowing up stuff and getting blown up is more thrilling than dealing with pilot fatigue.

This one is 3 campaigns in one, although the Desert scenario is the jewel of the game.  This game has a lot of good going for it, as you manage restrictive resources and combat advantages while fighting a smart A.I.

Why not a higher rating?  I don't know.  I'm just slightly above "meh" for it.

Great game. One of the best solitaire games out there. The choice of different battle plans gives this game a high replayability value. 
As a member already mentioned, these kind of battle plans should find their way into multiplayer games as well. 
Can't wait for Field Commander: Alexander.

Only played the Ghost Division scenario so far, and after a terrible start managed to grind out a victory - at my first attempt!

Excellent components, I like the rulebook and also the sample game on DVG website.
First play, a few cloudy issues, but quickly figured out.  Played North Africa campaign, it was a blast.  I can see that due to the nature of the reinforcement system, no two games will be alike, meaning good replayability.  Combat is simple, I really like the Battle Plan system, it's interesting to look at a battle and choose/buy the plans you think will help you the most.  Of course they don't always, but that is the nature of combat-no plan survives contact with the enemy.  
I know I like a game when I find myself thinking about it when driving, working, etc.  
>>>D-day scenario not very interesting, as there is no chance for counterattack for germans after first turn.  It is then just waiting to be eliminated, although once I did hold Utah beach the entire game.

Ordered May 1 so it's on the way!  Looking forward to this as Rommel was one of the first military commanders I really studied up on as a kid(along with Alexander the Great and Patton.  Very eclectic, no? ;) :p
Just acquired 6/2008.
A very challenging game!  The game system is very slick and makes for good replay value.  You come away from this game with a greater appreciation of what Rommel accomplished!  The rules are easy ones to master for the seasoned wargamer and the novice will find them fairly easy to grasp as well.  So far, I have won only once against the game so either A.) I suck  B.) Rommel was an even greater genius than I realized or C.) This game is really cool.  I am inclined to believe it is C ;) :)

Having played through the France campaign roughly 7 times and winning once, I really do like this solitaire game. It's very difficult but once you do complete a campaign the feeling is amazing. The theme is classic and the pieces are all thick and built to last. 

The only downside is that the instructions are fairly difficult to grasp, especially if you are new to the genre. 

I did institute a house rule here which I felt improved the gameplay immensely. Basically if I destroyed an Allied unit, it would go into a 'buyback' pile similar to what I had to do with my destroyed units. In other words, instead of a destroyed Allied unit being immediately fieldable by means of reinforcements, instead of fielding the unit, I moved a random destroyed Allied unit from the destroyed pile to the 'fieldable' pile. The game really does feel overwhelmingly difficult without this mechanic in place. I don't think it detracted from the game or felt 'cheaty' but please do let me know your thoughts on the matter.

Je fus enthousiasmé lors de la première partie puis un peu déçu par la suite. Seule la campagne de France représente un intérêt stratégique...Celle d'Afrique du nord est nettement plus limitée et je n'ai pas joué celle de Normandie.
C'est donc un jeu complètement nouveau qui apporte beaucoup aux jeux en solitaire mais demeure redondant sur la durée...Pas plus de deux ou trois parties par scénario.
Le matériel est très limité, les cartes sont très moches, les pions sans originalité.

Dan Verssen is a master game designer. I have always loved his Down in Flames games, particularly the dogfights, for their elegance, subtlety, and replayability. 

FC:Rommel introduces several cool ideas into a solitaire game which is both clean and elegant. The battle plans, combat system and experience are all interesting and fun.

I played Ghost Division about 10 times before I won, then won once by sheer luck and then the very next time by average luck and a more coherent strategy - so the game does have a learning curve! I then beat North Africa twice in a row - easily before the end of 1941 - perhaps my schooling in France made this a bit of a letdown or maybe I was lucky...

Recommended for fans of Dan Verssen's design style and anyone who needs a good solitaire wargame challenge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like it and admire the design and it is a game I always wanted but...........not that repayable from my perspective.  The games are a bit linear, there is not really much strategy and so much depends on where the allied reinforcements come in.  Beautiful components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The theme is interesting as well as game play. You are in the boots of this great commander, experiencing the tasks and dilemmas he faced in 3 grand operations: The invasion of France, the North African campaign and the defense of Normandy against the Allied invasion. Although being solitaire, you live tense moments trying to beat the adversary (the game itself) which based on the rules and games mechanics it works fine and gives accurate results. The rules are easy and examples of play help you comprehend the whole concept. The only minus is that it represents serious factors like (AT guns, artillery,air raid, assault) in an abstract way ‘softening’ the procedures and results of each battle. Otherwise this wargame is innovative, recreational and one has fun by himself.

This game has moved up from a rating of 6 to a rating of 8.  I recently revisited the game and this time it grabbed me and didn't let go.  I originally found the game too difficult, but have finally managed to win the Ghost Division scenario, which is brutal.  This game isn't a detailed simulation, but I find I really love it as a puzzle game, and have also come to appreciate the broad-brush simulation approach.

A handsome game, but not without its problems. While the presentation is quite nice, and the game play is enjoyable, the rules have lots of holes in them. The rules should have been at least 3-4 pages longer, and covered all of the most troublesome questions that seem to come up every game. As it is, you'll find yourself scurrying to BGG to look for rules clarifications, and that gets annoying.

This game is pretty easy to pick up as war games go, but it's really tough to win.  The Allies just keep coming, and it seems like the more you destroy, the faster they return to the map to fight again.

The more you play, however, the more tactics will begin to present themselves.  It helps to remember that Rommel moved fast, using speed to counteract the Allies.  Speed seems to be the best tactic in this game as well.  Plodding across the map one step at a time just turns into a meat grinder.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
2008 acquisition.

The rating is based on, so far, 1 game of the North Africa campaign.  It is a solitaire, area movement wargame with a challenging AI.

There are a lot of positives going for the game:  its relatively short playing time (for a wargame), the huge replay value (it has 3 different campaigns, and each including the option of applying various setup options), meaningful and agonising decisions (do I use the supply to refit my unit, should I use them for reinforcements, or should I save them up for the coming turn?), the fact that it is a single-player game make this a must-have for anyone without wargaming friends or when your wife/GF/SO is otherwise occupied or not interested.

The rating is most likely going to increase with more plays.

RATING: 6
Solitaire area-movement game on Rommel's three main campaigns from WWII.  The game is fun for a few plays, but ultimately I found the connection with the topic far too weak to hold my interest.  The defense modeling is particularly poor, as all units from crack panzer divisions to static infantry divisions have nearly the same efficacy on defense.  As if the defense system didn't already excessively reward quantity over quality, this is made worse by the chit system which largely drives combat.

I also had issues with the three scenarios provided.  Ghost Division works as an introductory scenario, but nothing more.  The system will hold the tough British tanks in Arras.  You can just dance around them with impunity, knowing that they will never counterattack, which is very unrealistic.  North Africa is probably the main draw, but it doesn't work well either.  Historically this was a back-and-forth campaign driven by Axis supply issues caused by a fortified Tobruk.  Here, fortifications are so weak that Tobruk will fall almost immediately, and the game degenerates into a race to get to Cairo before the British can build up an impenetrable number of divisions there.  The frequent British amphibious invasions at Tobruk are anachronistic as well.  I didn't play D-Day, but given the impotent defense of the Germans' best divisions, the lack of any consideration of bocage terrain, and the absence of Cherbourg (the main American objective of this stage of the campaign) from the map, I can't imagine that it works any better.

RATING: 6.5
I’ve been curious lately about wargames; stormseeker75 mentioned this game on a geeklist, and it seemed just what I was looking for. This is my first wargame learning the rules from scratch (I played Here I Stand but was guided through by an expert). After a few games under my belt, I can say this is NOT recommended for first-time wargamers... there are some key things you need to know about strategy, otherwise you will bang your head against the table (I had to look in the strategy forums to find them out). (To be fair, I'm not sure ANY solo wargame is good for a "first-time wargame".  It's like trying to learn Go or Chess on your own, you really need to practice with someone and get tips from them as you play.)

Upgraded from 8.2 to 8.5.  The battle plans, upgrades, resupply mechanics and AI all make this for a very engaging experience and kick the strategy up a notch.  I love that it has 3 scenarios, the optional variants, and the linked campaign option.

Biggest knock against it so far are the rules.  It's not just that I'm new to wargaming, and I'm clearly not the only one (11 of 18 forum pages are rules questions).  There are too many un-addressed scenarios (esp. w/battle plans) and too many ambiguities.  Some have been dealt with in the various FAQs though (up to 2 FAQs now).  But it does make me hesitate to get the others in the series, as I'm not sure I want to go through another rules experience like this!

Downgraded to 6.5.  I realized that I'm just two frustrated by need 2 specific battle plans (out of the many) in Ghost Division to win.  No matter what other tactics you do.  That and the rules ambiguities have lowered my rating.

2015: Traded away along with Friday for Race for the Galaxy.

First solitaire wargame I played. I like the low complexity level and comparably short playing time for a wargame. Still, it felt repetitive after the first moves and it was fine when the last turn was over. I don't feel the urge to play it again too soon and would choose a solitaire game of Agricola or Roads & Boats anytime. It's a matter of taste I guess. Wargamers probably would chose vice versa.

RATING: 7
I've only played the Ghost Division scenario so far and find the game to be a lot more challenging than I would have guessed. There's a nice amount of replayability in that there are several random elements for the Allies: the battle plans, the counter-offensives, the movement orders, the reinforcements and supplies. You just never know what you'll be up against once the game starts. There are even some intersting optional rules that impact the scenario VPs. Ultimately I think you have to play aggressive and take some chances otherwise you'll never win. Even then, you need some die rolls and counter pulls to fall your way. Very clever design that should never play the same way twice.

Now, on to Afrika!

Just had my first game today in France, ghost dividion (30-11-2010) and i lost of course! Those allied force were keep coming and coming. Anyway i was excited for the desicions i had to make and i think that it is a prety solid game. I 'll play some more games before i 'll rate it. It took me around 3 to 4 hous because i had so many questions and i 've read the rules twice! Thanks BGG

(03-12-10) 2nd play, same op', lost again and it took me 3 hours. Very exciting game and the AI works pretty good. Its a very good solo strategy game because you have to make some very tough decisions.

EDIT: trade it for Glory to Rome, from Latvia
------------------------------------------------------------

bought again the deluxe edition... (28042015) :)
FINALLY I WON! the ghost division scenario!!!! (after 5 plays)
------------------------------------------------------------

FINAL UPDATE:
trade it since i ve finished/won all scenarios. It feels like a pc game, since i finished it i dont want to play it anymore, same thing as [thing=35350][/thing]

A great solo game that has good AI.  Very tough to beat (so far for me that is).  Nice components that comes with 3 campaign maps.  There is a good amount of luck with random chit pulls and die rolls but I think it works with subject matter.

Solo game with interesting mechanics, although some rules need some BGG forum reading to catch. Great quality of the counters, quite enjoyable to touch :-)

I sold it because I need space for other boxes, and because I decided that in my solo-time I should learn other systems which then I can play online or FtF with other peers.

Not bad, but rather too simplistic for WWII combat. In my opinion only the last scenario, where you try to hold out against the allied D-Day invasion is really fun.

If you are looking for a solo war game, Field Commander Rommel hits the mark. Its battle plan chit pull mechanism and operations stack provide plenty of variety and surprises. The chits are of some sturdy laminate although the maps are nothing special. Overall I like for its game type.

RATING: 7.5
Very cool solo wargaming experience.  The engine allows for interesting situations to develop and gives the game system a sort of AI that seems to respond to your moves logically.  Winning is tough; maximizing one's score beyond that is no doubt even more challenging.

Scenarios played: Ghost Division 1940 -- loss; North Africa 1941 -- loss

Pros: Easy to learn, quick to set up, and it can be played in less than two hours. The graphics are nice and simple and easily read, and the rules are well written. Also - fun!

Cons: The system doesn't have massive replay value - don't get me wrong - you *will* get your money's worth and then some playing this little game, but once you've played all the scenarios a few times and won them, then it'll be one of those "Oh yeah, I remember that game!" items in your games closet that hits the table out of nostalgia every five years.

Being new to the Solitaire wargames, I really wasn't expecting much from FC: Rommel. 

Lets be honest, the components are fine, but they just don't really look like much. A little on the bland side. But after making it through the well done rules booklet and sat down to play, what I got was a highly engaging, anything can happen, fun war game.

It's almost more fun to resolve the Allies (the AI if you will) phases and see what you are forced to deal with, or not!

A great little system across the board for supply, battle, ranking up units, and victory conditions complete with additional variants.

You get a lot more than you expect with this package, and I look forward to enjoying many more hours with it.

Nice game and production values. Seems to be very luck dependant, as the first dice rolls decide the outcome of the whole campaign. If you lose badly, you can forget going on, and I don't like having to start a few times until you get a decent battle result on the first round. 
When you've overcome, it is quite fun. And frustrating, as I just can't seem to beat the system.

Played it to death for a couple of weeks, doing each scenario multiple times. overall I enjoyed the games and think there are some clever mechanics that come up with some interesting AI, while still keeping things at a low complexity level. You need to play a few times to wor kout the puzzle as to how best to play each campaign.

There were also some moments when I felt play became a bit tedious, mainly surrounding the repeated drawing of Allied battle plans - but this is such an important part of the system, that in the end it became a bit of a love / hate relationship with me. 

The only real questionable aspect of the entire game is the way the AI generates what amount to seaborne invasions against Tobruk once it is in Axis hands. This happened to me 3 times in one particular game - maybe this capability should be capped to just once per game. 

I would be happy to dig the game out from time to time to do some one off games.

My initial rating was a "7" and after playing all three scenarios I'd hold to that rating. In other words, a good, solid design that affords solitaire players enough detail and challenge to make acquiring and playing this game worthwhile.  

I think it's a promising solitaire system, even though sometimes the solitaire battle system results in seemingly irrational moves (which I why, I've read, some players consider this a better two-player game). 

But it's definitely a challenge to try to win any of the three scenarios, particularly the longer D-Day one, given the sheer depth of and Allied forces. 

As with two other games I've own by this designer ("Lightning: D-Day" and Lightning: Midway"), although I like his game designs, I've had to spend some to many hours reading and re-reading and editing the rules in order to understand how he meant the game to be played. This one, however, is relatively clear, with a decent layout and an extensive example of how battle works. Compared to the seriously underwritten rules for the "Lightning" card game series, "Field Commander Rommel" remains on the light-medium complexity level. 

As an aside: This gets my vote for the ugliest cover of any game I own. 

Purchased new, May, 2009.

I realy like this solitary war game. The rules are simple compared to other wargames but still would need some clarifications and more details. The paper board contains all the explanations necessary for a complete turn and games. One negative note is the initial set up that is realy long trying to find all those unit. After that the game flows well.

Un bon jeu de guerre en solitaire. Les règles sont simples à comparer à d'autres jeux de guerre mais elles auraient besoin tout de même d'être plus claires et détaillées. Le plateau en papier donne toutes les informations d'un tour et d'une partie. Un point négatif est le placement initial qui est relativement long à essayer de trouver toutes ces unités. Après ce petit désagrément, la partie coule bien.

The upside:
-Easy to learn.
-Several scenarios with increasing difficulty.
-Manages to emulate the feeling of the real campaigns with which scenario constraints/objectives. The necessity to go blitzkrieg in France 1940, the critical lines of supply in North Africa and the "defend at all costs" after D-Day.
-The chit-pull is used here to a nice effect. The resources available in war are not allways the ones we most need, and you can never know for sure what the enemy as up his sleeve.

The Downside:
-There seems to be an optimal solution for each campaign, at least I got the idea that you don't have double ways to get where you should.

I really want to like this game as there are some great ideas in it and the components are very good. (They would be great if you didn't have to have Crusaders in Normandy but that is a small point. (Why use silhouettes for a game like this ?)).
More importantly I have played four games and got four total thrashings none of which suggested that I had a chance to win except through the luck of the dice. Two of the thrashings were admittedly hilarious. In the 1940 France game my elite 25th Panzer Regiment was ambushed and wiped out by the Belgian Chasseurs (who had been ordered to abandon Brussels and defend Paris !) Then in my first North Africa game both 21st and 15th Panzer Divisions were wiped out on turn one by a devastating 4 Division British counter-attack.
I suppose a game you can win too easily (Mosby's Raiders for instance) is no challenge but it is the thought that only luck can change it which I find discouraging.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Having logged some serious plays I feel I can fairly judge the product. FC:Rommel gets a 9 from me because it:

1) has remarkably smooth game mechanics that instill appropriate amounts of tension and fear into the player
2) overcomes the hurdle of too much automation that plagues most solitaire wargames - the battle plans and area movement really give you many, many options for play
3) has excellent production values
4) comes with 3 equally large and distinct scenarios rather than one master scenario and several smaller ones that you usually find in a wargame
5) has a not quite punishing level of difficulty that will often (or always, in my case) beat you but always leave you thinking you had a fair chance and wanting one more shot
6) has a very fair price point given the amount of content in the game

If you are interested in area movement wargames, and/or solitaire wargames, you will not regret getting a copy of FC:R. I cannot wait to see how the next iteration of the Field Commander series - Alexander the Great - turns out.

Lastly, this is a solitaire wargame that can be easily adapted to 2 player play, although the German player will need some handicapping in his favor because the Allied player should play more intelligently than the game does (not a strike against the game, it's excellent).

**********

FC: Rommel has reached my hands here in China. I was one of the preorders and my name is on the side of the box bottom - which I think is pretty awesome. A quick remark about the components:

The rules have a very pleasing layout and are extremely clear.
The maps are equally well-thought out and very attractive.
The counters are simple & effective, and come with a unique smooth coating on them that makes them slick, but in a good way. They're thinner than the usual counter, but the slick coating makes me think they'll weather better. Time will tell.

And my copy of the game had none of this chemical stinkiness that a few others have mentioned.

I want to like this game, I really really do but I find it needlessly fiddly pedantic where it doesn't need to be.  The creators have tried too hard to be trendy I think and the game suffers by too many checklists and pointless aspects that don't move the game.  It's not really a solitaire game, it's a gimmick.  It actually plays better as either a two player or playing solitaire by playing each side like a solitaire play of a normal game.  The biggest issue is the often silly allied move orders, where you can have a strong blocking force or a potential attacking force that should advance or stay put but the orders send them off everywhere while the Germans laugh...needs a few modifications, for example you can choose to ignore a move order and stay put if the move order is not logical, sensible or something someone would do, and needs to get rid of a lot of the fluff such as battle plan points etc.  make it simple, one battle plan per unit.

It's...ok.  It's an attempt at a light solitaire wargame, that description seems to be contradictory.  You can have a light wargame, a solitaire wargame, a light solitaire game, but not all three.

I liked the battle chits and their availability being tied to supplies you don't use.  The game flowed well and provided somewhat plausible AI responses.

However, at bare minimum in a wargame at this scale I expect some differing terrain, there was none.  I expect some need to keep your forces in contact with each other and penalties for being surrounded, there was none.  I expect some advantage for out maneuvering opponents, there isn't one.

FC:R is better than all of the States of Siege games save Empire in Arms, but while they're both ok games they really provide a marginal wargame experience.  Perhaps it's not possible, the search continues.

One of my first games. Extremely luck based. You can lose a game on your first turn if you roll poorly, and the AI rolls well. I enjoyed it quite a bit when I first got it. Not sure how I would feel going back to it.

The first two scenarios are puzzle-like, the third one is very different - much more open and dynamic. I've played a lot of games solo over the years, but this is actually the only one that I've played that was designed to be solo.

Yay! A solo wargame I can a) understand the rules for and b) enjoy playing. The ai works well and the scenarios are varied and interesting. Great immersion thanks to the relatively low rules overhead and lots of interesting decision making. Solid.

A great WW2 solitaire game.  The rules are straight-forward and the game plays very well.  Low counter density makes this quite manageable.

The missions are ridiculously tough though.  You will certainly not beat this and be done anytime soon.

This game is extremely challenging as a solitaire game.  At least, the scenario's that I have done are.  It's more about trying to win at all, rather than improve your scores, and a lot of the impact is really riding on those battle rolls.

Umm really looking forward to playing this as I'm a big fan of DVG. The rules are easy to understand, combat is nice, and the 'AI' is good (slightly random at times but I think mirrors Allied confusin vs. Rommel quite well. There's some really nice touches in there with hordes of scenario amendments to make it easier or harder for you.
All of this works great, but as a personal preference I far prefer a long campaign, and although it does link the three, it still doesn't go quite enough for me.
However if you prefer shorter scenarios then you'll love this cos it works.

Have only played the Ghost Division scenario so far and, while it's very difficult to win, I'm getting closer to a victory each time. The Germans definitely need luck on their side to win this scenario. I'm convinced the best strategy is to attack Dinant with everything on the first turn, exploit into Brussels, and then Calais and in the next turn make a dash with the armour along the Normandy coast to Cherbourg. The other two objectives can be picked up later. Initial rating of 7.

RATING: 6
It's simple, for sure.  Maybe too simple.  The rules are very easy to grasp, and by the third full turn of my first game, I had a very firm grasp on what was going on.  Thankfully, doesn't use some of the more fiddly concepts of wargames like hexes and zone of control, instead opting for area maps that abstract out the battles to the strategic level that a general would be looking at.  Also, the simplicity keeps the game short, easily doable in a sitting. However, the game is somewhat fragile, and has a tipping point early in the game.  Either you get lucky and your initial attacks go well, allowing you to roll up the map, or they go poorly, and you never get the supplies necessary to make a very good push.  There's not a whole lot of replayability here, as there's a pretty set strategy for the scenarios.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#000000]1P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] Lightweight solitaire wargame from DVG. It's a doddle to grasp, but a bugger to master. Do not expect a detailed simulation, I consider it more like a puzzle game. Contains three campaigns. A good intro wargame.

Right now this is my "hot" game.  I have played it every night since I got it a week ago.  This game is by far the best solitaire board game I own.  For reference I have played all the Ambush games (europe and pacific), Raid on St. Nazaire and Eastern Front solitaire.  Why I rate is so high is that it plays pretty quick (as compaired to other solitaire games out there) but packs the most tension/action per minute played.  So far I have been playing the first two scenarios(out of three) in a little over 2 hours (including setup and putting it away).

I've had this game in my collection for a few years, and finally got around to trying it out. It's really a fine solitaire that is easy to learn and does not bog you down with overly complex AI rules. The downside is that there is a lot of abstraction at play which might be a turn-off to some.
I have only played the North Africa campaign, and the first time around I got the supply rules wrong and ended up winning very easily because I was never short on supplies. This did not seem quite right given that supply was the major issue of this conflict historically, so I reread the rules and sure enough I was awarding myself far too many supply than I should have had.
So game 2 was tonight, and I won again at the beginning of 1942. It was not nearly as easy, and luck was definitely on my side here. The Allies never got to get any operation launched, which kept 4 strong units out of play. I was able to take Tobruk very quickly, and by a stroke of luck the Allied forces were ordered to retreat in the Tobruk sector, thus allowing me to advance faster towards Cairo and clear out the Tobruk sector from the remaining Allies. Now, with 2 sectors free of Allies and Tobruk under my belt, I was able to accumulate a decent amount of supplies, and combine a string of Exploit and Salvage battle plans to get right next to Cairo all in just one turn using a force of 4 German armored units and one Italian, all of which were upgraded, and I was consistently able to get 11 Battle Plan Points at each battle. A couple of Ambushes from the Allies slowed me down, but not enough and victory was mine. In the end, I was left with 4 reduced armored units in Cairo, and several Italian infantry units securing my rear in Tobruk and Tripoli.
In conclusion, there is a significant amount of uncertainty in this game which keeps you on your toes and creates endless situations. I truly enjoyed playing it!

What a great solo game this has turned out to be. Like many I have tried playing 2-player war games solo. It can be fun but as many also know it leaves you wanting... never quit satisfies. And then comes along this gem. Yes -  you truly play a war game solo. Tough choices and an always challenging supply situation makes for a tense and fun game. Nice production value for a relatively inexpensive game. I will gladly snap up the next offering from this company. Great fun. Also of note... it has a small footprint... I set this up on my work desk in front of my keyboard and monitor - map is only 11x17. That really makes a difference when you want to play a quick solo game but don't want to set up on the main table.

UPDATE - downgraded to a 6. Still an enjoyable game but it is lacking somehow - would love to see the same system but with more chrome.

OK for a few hours diversion, but ultimately not enough meaningful decisions to keep it interesting.  In each scenario, your outnumbered, undersupplied units face a steady march of constantly being replaced, usually well supplied units and you just try to withstand the mass.  There is not really that much you can do with maneuvering.  Most of your decisions come down to whether you spend your supply points on refitting units, getting reinforcements, and buying battle plans.  Ultimately, the dice seem to be king and your luck with dice seems to be nearly as important as what decisions you made.  Plus despite all the different units and maps, each scenario felt too much the same as the others.  The feel of each battle wasn't much more than Memoir 44.

The scenarios felt so unbalanced that in order to win, it would really depend on a streak of lucky dice vs any particular tactical decisions.

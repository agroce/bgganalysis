There looks to be a very good game in here but the rules (lots of ambiguities) and the game length (the publisher is having a huge laugh to suggest this takes 90 minutes) is curbing my enthusiasm after the first play

There is a lot going on in this deep and involved building game. Maybe too much for it's own good. But while there are lot's of things to wrap your head around, after a few rounds they all start to make sense and gameplay speeds up considerably. Players are building a city/production engine communally while trying to gain the edge on their oponent. This could be done by building production buildings close to their oponents houses to decrease their value. Or building a major building near your own to increase their value. Furthermore you can gain points by building communal projects, connecting city quarters by road or just outright destroy buildings when you are the invader. I'm not that sure about the invader mechanic as it seems there are a lot of points to be won there and not every player will get a turn to bash the others up. Besides this there is tons more to do to get goods or money. After a partial play in Essen I'm not sure if I'll like this game enough to invest the major explanation and playing time in it. But I'm willing to explore the game further. Rating's very preliminary.

Juego de construcción de distritos y barrios, para ir sumando puntos. Dentro del juego cada jugador tiene ocasión de llevar a los indios cuando atacan la ciudad. Esas batallas son como un "minijuego" dentro del propio juego. Se hace un poco largo el juego, pero deja buen sabor de boca.

Interesting mix between worker placement to rebuild Buenos Aires (Caylus repectively Carson City style) and light tactical combat (think of attacking a town in the latest Pirates! computer game).
However, it took too long for what it delivers (4 hours first game) and and simply has too many mechanisms, so that you are bound to forget something in your first few games.

Based on one play at Essen 2010.

Onerously complex with little payback for time invested. Don´t see my game group going through this for 4+ hours. 

Of course you are going to build huts, then houses, then buildings that generate resources. Then some random natives and pirates will come along and destroy them for your opponents to gain VPs....not sure where that leaves room for game exploration and appreciation; especially after spending 1.5 hours listening to rules that were well explained.

Rio de la Plata is a game that makes me feel like a curmudgeon Euro gamer. I'd rather be playing games I already know and enjoy. Maybe during another time I'd find more enjoyment in a game like this... it's full of familiar mechanics. But a lot of those mechanics are already done in quality games. I don't see the incentive to keep trying a game like this, and there's aspects of it that seemed out of whack. Too long, with too little payoff.

More objectively, there's a couple things that are a real bummer about this game. Rules explanation took almost an hour. The board has a very bland look overall, and different buildings were incredibly hard to distinguish from each other. The "raid" of the pirates was determined by a random die roll, almost guaranteeing that one player or more would totally miss out on a major scoring opportunity. And, though I didn't read it myself, the game owner mentioned that the rulebook was a mild catastrophe. 

Ugh. There's too many other games to play than this one.

RATING: 7.5
Eurogame simulating the founding and building Buenos Aires. The game has some good mechanics but can be very long. We played the "baby-version" and could not finish in 3 hrs. This is also mainly due to the badly written rules  (there are several versions make sure you have the latest 2.04 EN) and player info cards.
The attacks by Indians and Pirates can be pretty nasty if you're not prepared but could bring a lot of points to the player playing the Indians or Pirates. Compared to other Giochix games this could have been their best game.

RATING: 3
I [i]tried[/i] this game while at Spiel 2010, but unfortunately the explanation was so horrible that neither my gaming partners nor I had any good idea what we were supposed to be doing. A such the experience was a total waste of time, and that still irks me. The reason I wanted to play this game was its two stage-structure: in the first stage you simply construct the city in a fashion which to me bears an uncanny resemblance to the way things are done in Carson City; in the second the weakest player takes on the role of invader and tried to destroy buildings of other players. This insidious mechanism in theory accomplishes that the leaders can't get too comfortable, and are kept in check, while the weak(er) player gets a chance to remain competitive.

Even though I doubt I would have purchased the game (the ‘special Essen price’ of €36, reduced from a truly ludicrous €45, was still too high for what I would get) the idea wasn't altogether bad. Perhaps some friendly geek in the neighbourhood did take the chance of purchasing it and will bring it to the table in the years to come. Unfortunately from what I've seen is that the public's favourites have taken up residence in the area; and Rio de la Plata is [i]not[/i] a public's favourite.

[b]Update[/b] Many years later I was able to play a game of RdlP. After exhaustive study of the rules—which in their 2.03-incarnation are still not the clearest—I was able to explain them with some confidence, and attempt a first game. Unfortunately the effort of familiarising myself with the rules turned out to be pretty much wasted. The core idea of the game, that you build up a city which is then torn down by one of the players, is rather cool. It's just that the pace of this game is glacial with long, arduous build-up of real estate and resources; and that it can be gone in a flash unless taking precautions by not removing placed workers; thus making the game even slower. The question also remains what is supposedly clever about it: as a simulation of the troubled birth of Rio de la Plata-region it does an excellent job. But it leaves open the question of whether it makes for a good [i]game[/i]. The barren resource conversion added to the very meager and slow worker placement just means that all you're doing is adding various limited resources in differing ratios to another, causing different amouts of money and VP to roll out of the process, sometimes even at different moments in time. Finally a tally is made of how well the houses in each district are doing... but development seems rather frontloaded by the way bonus and malus points are awarded. In short, Rio de la Plata might be a nice 75 to 90 minutes-game... and therefore it is too bad that it takes twice as long.

What also isn't helping is the subdued artwork which makes it difficult to discern the buildings. Is that a Barracks or a Corporation? Oh no, it's a Monument. Right. Ehm... 

[b]Update[/b] Sold off. Goodbye, and good riddence.

Initial impressions after 1 play:

Very interesting, and potentially very strategically deep. I liked the integration of building and combat, the politics, and the positional on-board play (during both building and combat).  After one play we had some concerns with balance, particularly regarding the turn order - going later seemed better in multiple ways, but you could only move forwards.  However, with one play we are far from understanding the strategy, so this may or may not be borne out with further plays.

Altogether, I would love to play again, although I am not sure I will get to - it is much longer than the play time listed on the box.  With 4 of us it took 5 hours, and while we were all new to the game, no one was particularly slow.

Durante a explicação o jogo prometia mas com 3 horas de partida não conseguimos sair da 4 rodada. Acredito que ocorrerão 3 guerras no inicio do jogo que só ocorreriam 1 vez em 10.0000 partidas. Isso deixou o jogo bem mais lento. Depois ainda jogamos umas 2 rodadas que fluíram melhor mas já batia as 4 horas de jogo então desistimos. Fiquei triste pois o jogo parecia ser bem legal.

Very good game for real gamers. Difficult, with many options and ways to get VPs. Quite a lot rules but they are elegant. Before play I was worried about two things:
1. downtime - but suprisingly even with 5 players there was no problem with it at all.
2. boring gameplay - but it was very dynamic (even during our first 5 hours-play) this was due to the wars, which involve whole group; and due to lots of worker placement possibilities, along with many ways of gathering VP, we did not feel like doing the same thing every turn.

Also the setup is very quick and easy.

My rating could be 10, but I lowered it:
-0,5 due to very long gameplay (the game is fun but sometimes we dont have 3-4 hours to spare) - so the game is played once per month.
-0,5 due long explaination process

Theme is thick as gravy. 
Well executed mechanics where the players are building together yet get points for themselves. Has an almost RPG feel to it.

Only played twice so far.  Not sure what to  make of the game.  The resolution of attacks/war seems somewhat strange.  In our game an attack occurred four times and at least twice we wondered why the attacker would bother to attack when it appeared that he would give more points to his opppents than what he could possibly earn for himself from destroying buildings.  Maybe I interperted something wrong.

I didn't play, but I had full rules explained and caught several glimpses of 4h game...

The game explanation took 1 hour exactly.  Many many rules.  Ergonomy is non-existent.  Similar drawings on tokens are just scandalous and there's lack of ANY help anywhere on the board or tokens (even no buildings' names!).  All in the name of language independency, I guess..  Easily one of the most repelling games ever in the presentation/accessability regard.

The game itself is looong, tedious and not rewarding.  Waay too little payback for time invested.
Several mechanisms are very gamey and arbitrary, not going along well with the setting.

I will never try it.  Maybe it works, but satisfaction from playing it is near 0 level from what I've seen...

[the game has specific very 'De-Vulgari-Eloquentia'-like Italian feel -> 'squeeze anything you can in the game;  it's a historical game after all; never mind the gameplay']

Provisional rating 6 based on a partial play.  We played only up until the first war.

I respect the ambitious design of this title.  Worker placement drives a relatively generic resource management and point generation framework in the building of various minor and major buildings in the city.  Production buildings are built in a city grid, and may be used by any player adjacent to them, not just the player who built the building.  To me this subsystem greatly resembles Inca Empire, but in a more interesting way as only one player may use the production building at a time.

The war mechanic is perhaps the most innovative aspect of the design.  Every few turns based on a die roll with a gradually increasing probability, natives and/or pirates will attack the city.  One player controls the natives and is tasked with destroying town buildings, while the other players attempt to defend the city to both deprive the attacker of VPs and save their own stuff.

Unfortunately, while there is a lot to like in Rio de la Plata, it doesn’t mesh with my personal taste one bit.  I’m not a great fan of Inca Empire, and I don’t really care to have the buildings I’ve spent all game building destroyed.  So while this is a very interesting title, I’ve seen enough and don’t wish to play a full game.  It’s easy to imagine a gamer who will appreciate this game however, and I don’t begrudge those people their higher ratings.

A very odd game that combines Euro-style resource collection, worker placement, building, and VP collecting with a nasty combat system that has players taking control of raiding warriors that tear down the progress others have made, earning themselves VP in the process.

The overall feeling of the game is extremely negative and frustrating. Your plans to build are constantly smashed to the ground, your ability to defend is very limited. Someone is going to have a shitty time playing this and you try your hardest to make sure it isn't you.

Well it will never be me again because I have no desire to ever play this game again :-)

Worker placement strategy game with engine building (slow build-up) and a war subgame (battle resolution is straigthforward and without dice). Difficult to evaluate as the first play was stopped after 7 of the 20 rounds (and 2 wars) and 2,5 hours of game play (5 new players). Probably too long, but the shifts of focus during the game from engine (re)build-up to special buildings and special characters mixed with the wars against natives and pirates remain interesting. Needs a second play.

Apart from the great looking box cover I can't say anything positive about Rio de la Plata. It has all the worst aspects of recent Italian games: long rules add exceptions but not depth, slow tempo, unfunctional artwork.

I played once with some good players, the game need 1 hour for rules and 4/5 hours for the game.
I think the game is broken , there is one strategy to win it be buying the personalities who gave you a lot of pts at the end. The war elements in the game just don't work and make and don't cause many damage to your opponents.
The board is to big we build all the buildings that make pts and the half of our and the board was half empty , so no stress for lack of place ( shame ) we need 1 hour for the first 10 rounds and 3/4 hours for the next 10 rounds, the problem is also the thing that you make your move and wait 15 minutes to make another moves or resolve the move you done before. So i was able to play some fast game at another table :) 
i really don't not recommend it to any one , i don't like it and gave a 3 , if you like loooooooong game with worker placements and some war elements try Dominant Species for me it's better.If you want check out me battle report from games in my profile.

This seems a good game, but you have o learn it first. You must spent a game or two, to feel what it really capable of. I want to play it again, for sure.
Played my second game tonight, and a lot of different strategies arise. The importance of the town is relative. You only need it to get resources, so you must try to get VPs during wars. It doesn't matter if your town is completely destroyed, just jump for the battle and win as most you can get, you will have time to start building again. The boat is really powerful and the built of the fortress is also a good VP generator.
The big failure is the rulebook, it doesn't have the info you need, many rules are a little ambiguous, and if you could find this exceptions on the rules, I believe it's rating would be higher.

After a couple of years I played this game again. And the conclusion is that the game does not work. In the opposite I thought in the first games, is not fun to build the city to be completely destroyed again and again. The war mechanics is very convulsed. I did not enjoy this game this time.

Harking back to Junta, where you have two separate games bundled into the one experience. The problem is that it requires teaching and learning two different rule sets. One is the traditional build an engine and then populate that engine with workers to generate goods to generate money and VPs - traditional worker placement. The second is when war strikes, and then the game is turned into an abstract Gipf type game with pieces moving around the board doing captures and earning VPs. Thematically, they're linked beautifully to the foundation of Buenos Aires and the problems it had to overcome. Gamewise, it's different from others out there, which is always appealing, and I suspect the game has legs because engine building usually does. It's just tricky to get into, having to teach two games in one.

This is one of those games that tries to be a euro and a war game and fails at both. It starts with the poorly-written rule book that makes a book on quantum physics sound like child's play. The gameplay itself can be interesting as it has cooperative elements to it but not enough to make me devote 3-4 hours to play it. 

Too heavy for a euro and too abstract for a war game.

Overly complicated: too many rules, and way too many mechanics squeezed into this game - in this case, less definitely would have been more!

Too long: extremely slow initial build-up phase; too many different buildings. An early war may destroy much of the early build-up leading to an even longer re-build-up.

Non-functional artwork: you can't keep the buildings apart.

Two games in one: although thematically correct, the war aspect of the game absolutely doesn't fit into a build-up game. Also: extremely frustrating and pro-longing the game when there is a successful war.

Victory point imbalance: the attacking player scores like 2x the victory points ALL players have scored during the build-up part of the game. This seems stupid.

There is a lot potential in this game that has been wasted - probably by too hasty publishing. I guess, one year of more work on this game might have helped to cut off the ballast, balance out the war aspect or abstract it in another form or whatever, and finally make a fine game. In this current form, it's no fun at all.

INteresting theme, and a very fun, if heavy and very long worker placement game. There's a lot of little rules to remember but thank god there's been a revision. Plus the player aid really helps. so much to do and despite the 20 rounds it still feels like too little time to build everything. The war "game-within-a-game" phase is interesting , as it breaks the flow of a game that mught otherwise be a bit too dry. Love the style of the game, and despite the minor building tiles being way too msall for me liking, I really dig that medieval tapestry style :)

The worker placement phase is familiar, with players competing for turn order, to gain resources and money, claim land, and construct builings (both minor and major, with the latter often requiring a multi-player WP investment and providing a bonus to adjacent minor buildings), as well as ship goods back to Spain (for VPs), and purchase Public Offices (also for VPs, plus benefits like free reources). During the war phase, one player (alternating each war phase) controls the invading Indians, and attempts to infiltrate the city, earning points for destroying buildings, while the other players defend the city and earn VPs for killing attacking tokens or their losses. This phase is fairly involved, with in-depth rules, and adds to the reality of the second founding of Buenos Aires by the Spanish.

(-) Wars can feel pretty harsh and they often feel out of balance - however, if you rationalize it, they are probably more balanced than meets the eye at first sight. The overall impact of the wars on the final score is usually also limited to about 25% of the final score in case of an exceptionally succesful war for the attacker.

Note: When playing with 5 players, 5 wars will occur. This is quite a lot. The final war will also take place late in the game, which might be a disadvantage to the player having the role of the attacker in the final war. Therefore, the game probably works better with 4 players

Interesting game! It is thematic and it offers many victory paths. The battle is very exciting and it can ruin your plans if you are not careful. Its complexity is above medium, but once you start playing it, everything goes easy.

Very competitive and huge game. Took more than 5 hours to complete and another 1 and half to explain rules. Lots of stuff to do in game with worker placement and very interesting the war element. I am not sure of how this affects the balance of the game thought. Loved the complex and variable strategy.

Rules are a mess. Gameplay is decent and fun. AT some level because when players start fighting like they are playing checkers is the most annoying thing I've done in a long time! Which is a petty because this game has lots of good ideas and some of them I could actually copy to use in my own design (if I did).

Played at Spiel. Partial game (one ship arrived; one pirate raid). Painfully slow to get going. The pirate raid felt like a bizarre add-on mini-game. A feeling of "not quite getting it" - a common feeling at Essen.

I'd be happy to play again if the opportunity arose.

This was one of the horrible gaming experiences of my life.

The explanation was quite long and the game has a few small rules, but it all seemed quite OK. There's quite a bit of resource gathering and building and that all works fine. There's a few ways to score points along the way, which is always fun. And then comes the war aspect of the game. It put the whole game on pause and introduces a whole sub game. The attacker scores about 4x the amount of points the people building and defending score. And it goes on for quite a while. And, most of all, it makes me wonder: why bother building stuff so someone else can score points destroying it (you cannot destroy your own stuff)?

I broke this game off after 7 of the 20 rounds because I could not bare it any more. We had taken 2.5 hours to play just a third of the game, and I enjoyed it less with every second. The thought of having to keep up with this for a few more hours was too much.

We played with 5, all new players, but we played at a decent pace. I can imagine the game having a bearable playing time with 3 experienced players, but no, this took WAY too long, and I didn't enjoy a second of it. The building and resource part of it was ok, but nothing special, the war element completely screws everything up.

This is a pretty speculative rating. I'm unsure of how similar any future plays will be to this one, but I enjoyed it. We spent 20 minutes building the city up, to spend 2 minutes tearing it down almost completely with a war, and repeated 5 times. At the end of the game, the palace and cathedral were completely unbuilt, most of the city was empty. Perhaps we're just too dicky to play this, but it was fun, if unexpectedly hard to make any real progress.

We stopped after reaching 7th round (of 20) after 2.5 hours of play.... The box says 90 minutes!!!!
The idea is not bad, but the fiddly rules are!

Rio de la Plata has a good bit going on.  There's a fairly strong building game here, with buildings that help you do things, buildings that give just you points at game end and buildings that give points to whoever helps build them and bring into effect different benefits.  There's also a shipping game in here.  And there's wars.  I liked quite a bit about the game but had three main issues.  

Firstly, the game was long for what it was.  Our first play took four hours (after about an hour of rules explanation), and if it could have fit in two hours it would have been a great experience.  As it was it felt dragged out.

Secondly... the game is graphically challenged. The color scheme is incredibly bland and the main board is simply a grid, but I can deal with that.  Worse, there are many different chits with pictures of different buildings and it's incredibly hard to tell most of them apart.  

Finally, wars.  This brings in a luck aspect to the game.  It's random-ish when wars will happen, but they get more likely the longer you haven't had one.  Which means that it's fairly random who will be controlling the attackers.  In our game one player was completely devastated by war.  On one a great number of his buildings were destroyed by a rush of eight attackers (which also gave an incredible number of points to another player).  But on the turn when he finally got to fight a war as the attackers, the gunner killed over half the attackers and he was largely impotent.

A great gamers game! With my group this game will take at least 180m. The rules should be more clear and have more examples. FAQ helps a lot!! Have to play it more!

At first impression this is a very involving game with several mechanisms and a strong narrative in the background. But during the second 5p play it appeared to be too much of everything, so we were pretty clueless what to do and the occasional pirate attacks steered any longterm strategy to waste.
Conclusion: messy game with unclear rules which takes way too long. I suspect that the designer has more or less scripted the way it should be played.

An interesting boots-on-the-ground look at colonization, in a genre which sees much, much more traffic at the national stategic level, a la [gameid=9625], [gameid=22545], or [gameid=33160].  It's a halting translation of the theme, though, probably because you're playing competitively in something which is better expressed as a mostly cooperative activity.  Landing in a place you're unfamiliar with,  feeling the everpresent threats of starvation and invasion, and knowing that there's nobody to save your group if you fail had a tendency to make the colonists stick pretty tightly together in these situations.  Sure, there was political infighting just as there always will be when a large enough group gets together, but it doesn't change the fact that putting the theme onto a competitive zero-sum Eurogame doesn't feel a bit awkward.  Still, considering that the game tackles a difficult theme, it encapsulates it pretty well at a high level.  Growth clusters in a very organic level, and it feels like this really might have been how settlement could have progressed.

This is not to say that the theme doesn't have it's share of awkwardness.  The game is rife with Eurocentric views of colonialism, especially the lazy stereotypes of "nothing existed there before the Europeans showed up" and the "faceless natives who only exist as a threat."  The game can't be expected to deliver a doctoral dissertation on colonial history, but a treatment that was a little more sensitive would have been nice.

Mechanically, the game is a typical resources/money/points engine, but with some twists that really separate it from a crowded genre.  There's a constant threat  of an intermittent native/pirate attack.  The attack usually results in the destruction of infrastructure, and plays out in a manner that is almost like an abstract, though one that the colonists can rig in their favor with a bit of planning.  

There's something very unique here overall.  If you look quickly, it seems like it's another euro you've seen a million times before, but there are some rough edges that make it more compelling than you'd think at first glance.  Those same rough edges are sometimes irritating, and the whole game feels like it could have used more development.  The [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/58059/rio-de-la-plata-english-rules-203]new rules[/url] help, but there are still some awkward rules on placement.  There's probably a great game here with some house rules to make it more streamlined, though you have to be careful not to lose the game's charm in the process.

Finally, be aware that every session of this I've played has gone well over the amount of time that the box has said, even for a learning game.  Don't think of this as your usual evening-length euro.  Prepare for closer to 5 hours than 2.

After two plays I'm sure of one thing: this unique title conveys the historical period beautifully. Players collectively build the nascent city of Buenos Aires and defend against periodic attacks from the natives or more dangerous British pirates; one really gets a feel for this as roads, buildings and walls are erected and eventually the harbor is built which allows players to ship goods to Spain. What I still haven't figured out is whether this all translates into an interesting game to play (it is certainly interesting to watch it unfold). Things develop slowly and investments are partially destroyed in the early wars. After our second play we were still struggling with getting the city off the ground and in retrospect spent most of the game in mindless subsistence mode; the mechanics however suggest the ability for much more progress to be made at which point I could see the game becoming more interesting. 

Although I'm happy to own it as I am still intrigued by the prospect of "solving" the problem of the game's difficulty, I can't really recommend this as a purchase to anyone else. The game requires 5 dedicated gamers who are willing to explore this one repeat times before it (hopefully?) reveals its splendor.

Habe das Spiel gestern auf der Spiel 2010 in Essen probespielen "dürfen" und als erstes fällt die absolut unzureichende dt. Übersetzung auf (ich habe keinerlei Idee, wie man als Übersetzer Zahlen - nicht ausgeschrieben, sondern die Ziffern - komplett durcheinander bringen kann? So fährt das Schiff in der dt. Übersetzung bei 3 Spielern - ich weiß jetzt nicht die 100% genauen Zahlen - bei 18 Gütern nach Spanien, in allen anderen Sprachen aber erst bei 21; 7x Anzahl Spieler).
Solche Fehler ziehen sich durch die gesamten Regeln.

Dann wirkt das Spiel auf mich, als wenn man versucht hätte, einen Wettbewerb im "wieviele Spielmechanismen kriege ich in ein Spiel ohne, dass sie wirklich in einem Zusammenhang stehen oder logisch erscheinen - geschweige denn spielbar sind". 
Ich habe schon hunderte Spiel gespielt und dieses Spiel hat mich - trotz des Potenzials, dass es birgt - sehr enttäuscht.

E' vero, il gioco è lungo e ci sono parecchie meccaniche da acquisire prima di potercisi divertire, ma averci giocato per 4 ore fino alle 2 di notte ed aver avuto voglia di arrivare a finire il ventesimo turno tutti e 4 i giocatori mi sembra un ottimo risultato. Ripeteremo certo la cosa, magari il pomeriggio. L'unica pecca forse la grafica delle costruzioni minori che rende difficoltoso orientarsi fra un edificio e l'altro.

Not an easy game to rate.  Even with the revised rules and FAQ, there are many fiddly rules to this game and board/counters are not as intuitive as they could be (so you have to do a lot of referencing for things like public offices).  The game is considerably longer than 90 minutes and it will take a dedicated group of folks to play a few times because the learning curve fairly steep.

There is an awful lot going on in this game and there are many ways to rack up victory points - building minor buildings in a district, helping build major buildings, shipping goods, acquiring public offices, etc.  Meanwhile, you have to cooperate a bit or you will tie up your workers on the major buildings and you have to protect yourself against wars.  Definitely need to play this one more to verify that the strategic options outweigh the fiddly rules and warrant the length of the game although it appears it will be.

This game looks somewhat difficult at first at least for me.
But, once the mechanics are understood, the game flows smoothly.
I like the situation that everybody works together to make the city against attackers and compete with each others.

RATING: 9
Picked up at Ollie's for $3.96 or something.  Had a blast playing Brad's copy, and we went right to Ollie's afterwards and got the last one they had in stock.  This is a game that will see definite play (once I fix the probably weird clay) with my Pittsburgh pals!  

Update: Great concept, but the clay is a real problem and requires actual planning to make sure it's even playable. In practice, it makes it impossible to be like "Hey, let's play Cluzzle!", and so it never gets played.  Relegated to closet.

RATING: 4
This is not a gamers' game.  As a party game, it's not terrible but I'd rather play Taboo.  It feels more like a game to play with children, but encouraging a child to make a clay sculpture that is good but not too good can be difficult- I think I'd rather play Pictionary with children for a similar effect.  The most fun part about this game is playing with clay, but I tend to think it would be more fun to play with clay without the restrictions of the game itself.
Edit: I think that this game deserves a higher rating that what I've given it (at least a 5) but don't feel I can raise my rating because, personally, I don't want to play it.

RATING: 7
{1 play, 6 players} I like this slightly better than Barbarossa.  Supplying the players with idea cards is genius, but the guessing part didn't quite work for me.  Two questions per player just isn't enough, especially if someone's sculpture is too hard to get, but I can see how three might be too many (especially with 6 players).  However, if no one gets your sculpture right away, but then has no more questions... what fun is that?  Yeah, I know, you're not supposed to make your clay too hard, but we all ended up making them too easy, perhaps on purpose, just so they'd be guessed by someone, at least.  Also, the free-form questioning means that other players can miss out.  I like how Barbarossa forces all players to focus, but, on the whole, this game is still an improvement - it's faster, more fun, and streamlined (ugh, that board and the die in Barbarossa)

RATING: 4
it is a game, but i don't want to play it again.  clay wasn't very malleable, but i'm sure it's pretty tough to pick a type that will last the ages.  i like the idea of making things with clay, but i hate the way the scoring works.  i think it would be more fun to try to make things that people should actually guess, and be awarded fixed points based on the difficulty of your subject.  even that still has the fuzzy factor of potentially talking people into what it is.  not talking about overt cheating, just how much spin people are willing to impart on things with body language, small comments, etc.  big replay issues could pop up with the cards too.  i'd much rather play scattergories or some other party game.

Being artsy-crafty person, Cluzzle has proven out to be a great game even with people who aren't confessing themselves to be good in 3D modelling.

It's also interesting to find out how other people perceive the world and the shapes one creates.

Minus points for getting sticky fingers.

RATING: 6
I want to love this game...I really do.  Unfortunately it just seems to lack a little something that I'm looking for in my party games.  Now, don't get me wrong, I feel there is a good game design here.  I guess my issue is that it feels a little disorganized.  It takes a lot of practice before you can figure out just how good/bad you need to make your sculpture.  Then the question rounds are so wide open to any and all questions that it feels very chaotic, and can be hard for some people to take in all the different information.

I think where we've had the most issues is when someone attempts something more creative, like sculpting your answer in the context of something larger or sculpting a piece of your answer hoping it will be connected to the whole.  This leads to questioning difficulties, because sometimes an answer is yes for the sculpture, but no for the answer (or vice versa.)  The sculptor can then become frustrated and the guessers will also get annoyed.  If we can figure out standard rules for this situation perhaps we can get past this dilemma but, for now, we just don't love this game nearly as much as the other brilliant products that Northstar has published.

Played with 3, was just ok. Much harder to guess the answers than I was expecting - we frequently guessed none. Either we need to be better clay-artists or ask better questions or I don't know what.

Clay was also very dry and dessicated. Had to spend quite some time rejuvenating it, which was not fun at all.

Fabulous game. Requires playdough so can be a little intimidating. It's really alright to sculpt badly though- I thought I had (!) and people guessed right away anyway. You need to sculpt badly enough so that no one guesses right away but well enough so that at least one person guesses eventually. Great fun.

The clay was funky, the idea is alright, but seemed too much of a hassle for a game that only takes 15 minutes or so.  The novel idea wears out its welcome, and most people don't want to play it again right after, expecting much the same result.  It works, but it isn't terribly exciting.  There's certainly a better clay game to be made out there somewhere.

Read the rules, pulled out the clay and it was all fetching hard.  Added some water and that just made it mushy,  Need to go and buy some Playdo to replace it and then give it a whirl.  Was disappointed with the quality of the clay, where this is so integral to the game.

Some of the clay eventually fixed itself with the water (give it a few weeks, if you have enough time) and the rest i replaced with Playdo.  We had so much fun with this game.  My one play was done over 3 rounds.  The genius is in the questioning round...  ask enough questions to help yourself get to the correct answer without giving that one little nugget too much to your opponents.  SO didn't win this game, but everyone is looking forward to a further play!

Not my favorite game from North Star Games (Wits and Wagers and Say Anything trump it by far), but it is a unique take on the party genre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
(First Edition): Good party game. I enjoy party games based around a particular skill set that are built for people who don't necessarily have those skills. The clay sculpting in Cranium is very frustrating for people who have no artistic skill, which is what makes Cluzzle the perfect alternative. Since you're not supposed to make things incredibly obvious, and since people can ask you questions to gain info AND since you can get points from being a good guesser to make up for your crappy molds, it works great for people of all skill levels. It seems a little weird, though that you don't get MORE points for GUESSING something in the earlier rounds... sure, you're screwing the sculptor out of points, but you're harming yourself too. Not a big deal though, the game works fine the way it is. The clay itself is great, too. It's extremely malleable and it's amazing with what you can do with such a small amount. The Cranium clay is absolute crap (and got dry very very quickly too) so I'm glad to see this is much better stuff.

I don't have a great deal of party games in my collection, but there is a place for Cluzzle. 

The rules are a lot simpler than Barbarossa...and the scoring may be a bit more haphazard, but overall I think that's for the best. I felt Barbarossa was probably harmed a bit by over-complexity (at least for the light grandma/kids crowd I like to play this game with). 

Another nice thing is that the game length is like 15 minutes. I may have to start toting this one to game night as a filler.

RATING: 7
Components: Superfluous but attractive central board and player boards. The cards each have a wide variety of subjects from which to choose. The 'clay', however, was more like Play-Doh, but of lesser quality, and incredibly difficult to mold, which interfered with the game.

Experience: The speed element moves the game along, and the question-asking tokens enforce strategic questions. Three rounds, with increasing rewards for both the guesser and guessee, works well. But on almost all fronts this game is less fun than Barbarossa. The main problem of Barbarossa, that of useless turns when one lands on a ghost or dragon, is solved here. But the speed element, and elimination of sculptures with only one correct guess, prevent the players from developing any long term relationships with the sculptures, which I find to be the greatest joy in Barbarossa. Also, in Barbarossa players must hammer away at the same sculptures until someone gets enough points to win. In Cluzzle, it is possible for the game to end without anyone having ever made a correct guess.

I'm not opposed to party games but for some reason I never thought Cluzzle looked all that entertaining. After playing I now see it really is a lot of fun! Like most party games of its ilk the roll-and-move mechanic is pointless; just keep going around the board until people are tired of playing. The process of playing is what's fun, not winning or losing.

RATING: 8
I'm kinda with most others.  I played Barbarossa once or twice, but while I liked the idea of Barbarossa, I couldn't stand the idea of playing it again.  The needless layers of 'game' are removed in Cluzzle, leaving only the fun parts.  It's unfortunate that there's a bit of a problem with the yes/no questions tho.  I mean...   you could play with someone who throws down a lump of clay which doesn't look anything like anything.  Then in the final round of guessing, he could tabletalk the rest of the people into guessing correctly, for a bunch of points in the end...  But played within the spirit of the game, it's good.

This is a distilled Barbarosa, refined down to the purest, and most fun, elements. If you like Barbarossa (and I do!), you should love Cluzzle. If you find Barbarossa fiddly and over-long, you should still love Cluzzle.

RATING: N/A
Cluzzle is a hilarious party game in which players make cool and funny stuff out of clay. Loosely based on 20 questions, the game creates humorous situations because players are rewarded for difficult-to-guess Cluzzles. 

But what is a Cluzzle? A Cluzzle is simply a clay puzzle. Every player creates a Cluzzle at the beginning of the game. A good Cluzzle is one that cannot be figured out until after several yes/no questions. In fact, the longer it takes for others to guess your sculpture, the more points you get! Just remember that you will get zero points if your Cluzzle is not guessed by the end of the game. So hear the laughter ensue as players shout out their guesses to your comical sculptures. 

Not only is Cluzzle side-splitting fun, but players have the chance to create a personal game card to be included in future print runs of the game. Alanis Morissette has a Cluzzle game card in this limited edition. Go to www.cluzzle.com/alanis to learn why she chose her seven subjects.

RATING: 5
Players sculpt clay models, then play through three 2-minute rounds of questions to try and deduce the other sculptures.  One, two or three points are awarded depending on which round the sculpture is guessed in.  Repeat two more times.  This is essentially the same concept as the legendary Barbarossa , with the player turns and dice rolling taken out.  With such a pedigree the game was bound to work, and is good fun.  Barbarossa is more cerebral, but if you want pure party fun, go with this.

Very fun game for gamers and non-gamers alike.  People worry that they're not good artists, but those people usually do best at the game.

Eh, it's okay. The terrible clay quality is annoying - even if it wasn't wet, that sort of clay just isn't suited to making detailed sculptures. The game itself is, as with many games of this sort, more of an adjunct to the activity of making sculptures and then guessing what they are.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Eh... I kinda like Barbarossa better.  I don't like the short amount of time to ask questions in Cluzzle.  I want to make more subtle clues and so you need people to dwell on stuff more, not crank through the Q&A. 

Another thing is that it seems a bit too easy since you can divulge a lot more info if you want beyond yes and no.  It's rather easy to make a rather vague scuplture, wait till the third round and then just tell some rather signifigant clues to get maximum points.

* Played 5+ times. My initial impression is that this game is NOT as good as Barbarossa. (And if I were Klaus Teuber, I would be giving the author of Cluzzle a phone call asking why he is ripping off my idea...) Tons in common with Barbarossa, but not in an especially good way, in my opinion. You only get 2 questions per ROUND, which leaves many 'cluzzles' unsolved for the whole game unless the cluzzle is obvious, which means everyone can pretty much guess it, which makes it very boring. But that's not all! Even more boring? You can only ask yes/no questions and the answering player is encouraged in the rulebook to 'tabletalk'. What does that mean? It leads to lots of grey area interpretation of how to answer a question...leaving some players feeling cheated. [f]

Rating would have been higher had we been able to play the game "out of the box". Sadly, we bought a new sealed copy from Tanga. when opening it for the first time to play we found the clay was dried out. We grabbed some playdoh from the kids room but it didn't work too well. The game has a very enjoyable system to it but the poor materials made it unplayable. I have heard there may be a remedy to this issue in the pipeline somewhere. I hope so.

Update: The designer came through with replacement clay that seems to work well. Colors didn't quite match but he sent cards to cover that as well. great support. And my rating went up because the game is better with good clay!

RATING: 9
Cluzzle is like a game of sculpting Pictionary combined with 20 Questions and Thingamajig. Each player creates a clay sculpture that represents a word chosen from a list on their card (or they can choose their own word). The sculptures shouldn't be too realistic, because they're not worth very many points if the other players are able to identify your word right away. But they also shouldn't be too obscure, because you [i]do[/i] need them to be identified - eventually. The later in the game they're identified, the more points they'll score for both the sculptor and the guesser. There are three rounds of clue-giving in which every player is allowed to ask two questions about other players' sculptures. They must be "yes or no" questions, although the sculptor is allowed to elaborate a little bit if the answer is not a clear "yes" or "no." At the end of each round, players may make a guess about the identity of any and all of the sculptures. Sculptors and guessers score 1, 2, or 3 points for correct IDs in rounds 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Cluzzle is clearly an attempt to build a better version of the older German game [GameID=550]. Barbarossa was an over-long game cluttered with arcane mechanisms and tasks that distracted from the fun core of the game. Cluzzle is a huge improvement over Barbarossa. It removes the peripheral crap and focuses just on the kernel of fun, which is creating the sculptures, formulating helpful questions, and trying to identify the other players' sculptures.

In case it's not obvious, Cluzzle is a casual game that's less about winning and gaming the system, and more about enjoying the process and the creativity and the laughter. If you generally don't enjoy party games, your unlikely to enjoy this one.

A pretty neat idea that plays quickly and is easy for everyone to learn. It's really difficult to determine whether a sculpture is too easy or too hard, and which is the right option to choose. Plus it has clay!

RATING: 6
This was a lot more fun than I expected it to be. There's actually quite a bit of challenge in choosing the right thing to sculpt, conceiving of the most ambiguously effective sculpture, and in asking the best questions.  Quite clever.  I do get frustrated because I'm bad at both the sculpting (I sculpt either too well, or too poorly) and the guessing (I often find I can't think of anything). It DOES require creativity--more for the guessing than the sculpting.

I enjoyed this the first couple times I played it, but the scoring seemed to lead to a lot of ties. Of course, now it makes sense why the instructions say that we should choose a certain number of games from the beginning… I think it may be more fun when played that way.

(By the way, making an ambiguous but guessable sculpture is harder than it sounds.)

There are a few strikes against this game.  One - my copy (and it seems like many, many others) shipped with dried-out, unusable clay.  I had to go out and buy replacement clay.  No big deal, but a little annoying.  Second - I find the rules to be a little ambiguous, which often happens with simple party games for some reason, but it's nothing that can't be easily overcome.  Third - it seems that you have to have the right group for this - I can see why some people wouldn't like it.  That said, I enjoy the game.  It is unique and feels different than just about every other party game (admittedly, I have not played Barbarossa).  I think this would actually improve with experience, as you could get used to people's sculpting styles and you could probably formulate more effective questioning techniques.

Cluzzle is a hilarious party game in which players make cool and funny stuff out of clay. Loosely based on 20 questions. Every player creates a Cluzzle at the beginning of the game. Cannot be figured out until after several yes/no questions. You will get zero points if your Cluzzle is not guessed by the end of the game. I Own the revised 2005 Fayfair second edition of Barbarossa which has been slimmed down (read smaller and quicker) from the original making it basiclly the same game! (aside from the 6 player option in Cluzzle and the one rule of deducting point if the sculpture is not guessed; in which both problems can be fixed. One with another color of clay and peices (which can be shaped of that colored clay) and a house rule of -5 point for no guesses and -3 for one.) If cluzzle still must be bought... the second edition of cluzzle is the one to own!

My copy - Jan 2010 Donating to Goodwill

The boys got one for their birthdays that a friend found at a thrift shop still sealed.  The clay was dried out, so we had to buy some Playdoh.  They talked me into playing it with them so they wouldn't have to read the rules. I don't know if they weren't in a creative mood or what, but the whole game fell flat.  The belt was the only thing anyone guessed. We're going to give it to a Dwight's 7 year old to see if he can get any more enjoyment out of it.  At least the Playdoh is fresh now!

The dough that comes with the game is too stiff & crumbly (water didn't really help) and it takes too long to sculpt anything because of that.
July 3, 2011: Bought a 6 color pack of modelling clay.

Gameplay is either chaotic or too structured, depending on the ruleset that you use. I find that there aren't enough questions being asked during the three rounds so it's either too easy to guess or far too hard.
That said, everyone enjoys it, including me.

This is a fun party game.  Works well for some laughs with the right group.  Definitely not one to take seriously.

You pull this out and people think "Cool, it's pictionary with play dough".  But it's really quite a unique game...

Make a great sculpture and you'll get a single point along with each of your opponents (in essence you don't progress at all.)  You want your object to be guessed, but you want it to take a while.  It's about making a "so-so" sculpture and asking some great questions.

This is a light party-type game that is good for a laugh or two.  My biggest problem with the game is that the scoring system is counter intitutive and just plain doesn't work.

Rating could certainly go up with better plays.  Played a few 4-player games.  Seems it can be too easy to guess what other people are creating.  Players need to play a bit to learn how to make their items a bit more vague and how to ask questions that don't help the other players.  Played a bit quieter than I expected.

Cluzzle takes the concept of Barbarossa and gives it a decent packaging and rules. I do enjoy playing it but all players need to play ball - a couple of too abstract cluzzles can really tone done the fun factor. If everyone is in the mood for it it is a great party game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I'm giving this game a 4 for several reasons. For one thing I'm not really a party game fan so the highest this game could probably hope to achieve with me is a 7. But even judging it against other party games I didn't really like it. I would rather play Balderdash, Taboo, or even Guestures. Also, it's barely even a game in my opinion. The guidelines for how to ask and answer questions leave a lot of wiggle room. So much so that there's little point in keeping score. That's not necessarily a bad thing for a light party game but the lack of structure bothered me. Finally, I just don't like sculpting with clay. If you're a very creative, artistic person you may enjoy this game more than I did.

A fun play-dough molding party game.  Pick-up a card and create a sculpture of the word on the card.  Don't make it perfect, but don't make it horrid, because here is the way scoring works.

Get NO ONE to guess your model = 0

Trying to make just hard enough to guess clay sculptures is harder than you'd though. Game is very easy to teach to others and is a lot of fun. You can do well even if you aren't very good sculptor. Actually, you can do badly if you're too good. It's a really elegant and hilarious game! Just seeing new sculptures is both puzzling and fun itself. You can play with just 4 players but it gets funnier with more. One of the better party games.

Update (13.7.2008): I tried to play the game but found out the clay had dried out and wasn't usable at all. I'll try to see if I can put some life into it or do I need to buy new ones...

Update (24.5.2010): Sold the game because of issues with clay. Too much trouble for a game I play once in 2 years. It's a shame really as I like the game quite much.

What a fun little game. I had liked the part where you get to choose what to sculpt with the putty and make it resemble the item you're trying to make the other teams guess.

RATING: 8
Making things out of clay is a lot of fun for me.  I have to resist my urge to be a perfectionist, though, because the object of the game is to have your sculpture guessed, but not right away.  Intentional vagueness and even red herrings have become commonplace in this game, because ideally you want your sculpture to be the second or third thing that comes to mind when people see it.

RATING: 7
Sadly this game is OOP.  A "Pictionary" type game where instead of drawing, you sculpt in clay.  The catch here is sculpting somewhere between "what is that" and "that is so obvious" because the longer your sculpture goes without a successful guess, the more its worth.  But if nobody guesses it, you get no points  Great family fun!

The clay that came with the game is horrible. I tried adding water but it didn't help that much. I thought the game had some potential as a party game, but the clay really lowered my rating. I read on the forums that the designer feels bad about it, and I feel bad for him--it's not his fault.

RATING: 5
I'm really in a difficult position with this game, as it is a game that I really want to like but am left feeling as though something is not quite right.  When we played, it was often difficult to determine the identity of any of the sculptures by the end of the third round unless it was really obvious.  The limited time for questioning is part of the reason for this as it was often difficult to come up with meaningful questions or even assimilate the answers while playing.  I suppose the variant that removes the timer would help improve this.  In addition, optimally, you want someone to guess your sculpture in the third round -- but only one person and preferably the person furthest behind you.  This is extremely difficult to do given the open nature of the questioning and, of course, presentation of the sculptures.  Finally, there is an extremely broad range of topics that you could be sculpting -- places, things (with varying degrees of specificity), specific people, places, ideas, activities.  That makes it even more difficult to figure out what something is.  All in all, we ended up with some very disappointing moments when no one could figure out what was actually represented.  Thus, as a game, this is somewhat disappointing.  As a social activity, it is somewhat more interesting. [03/14/2008]

RATING: 7.8
Cluzzle -- Implementation can make or break a game.  In Cluzzle, the physical components are top-notch, but more important, the rules are exactly what they should be: simple without being simplistic. The rules provide structure stripped of nonessential complications, and in a game where players sculpt puzzles with modeling clay, that's exactly what the rules should do.  But don't forget, the game isn't about the clay, it's about the puzzles you make with the clay.  Making your puzzle guessable, but not [b]too[/b] guessable is what makes Cluzzle involving.  Regardless of the player's sculpting skill (or more often, lack thereof), the result is always a lot of laughs.

I was very excited when I got this game...then I played it. On paper, it seemed like the game had alot of promise. However, I found that the game chose to instead focus on the question and scoring system instead of the heart of it: the sculpting. 

Players are given a card with several items on it. They choose one to sculpt. Once all players are done, a sandtimer is turned over and players can ask 2 questions of any player/s. They then write down all the answers. Points are scored for guessing the answer and for the sculpter. Guessing is done over 3 rounds with each correctly guessed sculpture taken out from subsequent rounds. More points are scored for guesses made in the later rounds. 

Most of my friends just decided to forget about the points and guessing and took more interest in sculpting.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Artistic, Party. Players sculpt an object with the aim of opponents guessing it not too soon and not too late. Haven't played this yet, but looking forward to it as a small party game.

it's a fun party game, simple, brain-less and quick, but if you are expecting a little more strategy (which may not be suitable in a party-like setting), Barbarossa is much better.

Plays okay.  I'm not sure I agree with the mechanism for scoring.  Seems like all players progress together around the scoring track regardless of outcome.

RATING: 5
Tough one to rate.  Can be kind of fun in an amusing way and I like how you have to make your shape guessable but not too obvious.  On the downside, I just never feel like playing it, so I'll go with a 5.  Also, my version came with crumbly clay.  I heard the company was excellent about replacing the clay, but I didn't want to play enough to even ask.

The clay it came with was totally hard and useless.  I bought a party pack of miniature Playdoh cans at Target, and then the game was pretty fun!

Great game.  As a highly competetive person, I find myself relaxing and enjoying the clay.  Great game for an opener or closer.  Lots of laughs as well.

[Eagle Games 04 edition] {Party; creativity, clay, paper-and-pencil; optimal 4-6p} Cluzzle is an enjoyable party game. (Who doesn't like molding clays?) It's suitable for all kinds of players (regardless of age, level and sex); esp. a group of male and female :laugh: Sometimes, players will laugh on the floor when a 'weird' clay is produced, which people cannot recognize at all. Players can practice creativity and handcraft skill in Cluzzle. Besides, players have to ask 'smart' questions to deduce what the target word is - smart questions are the ones to let you know more about the object without hinting other players.

We create a customized set of words special to HK environment to enhance its replayability. Cluzzle has a strong English barrier. It needs a dictionary to play.

[House rule] when a correct guess is made; other players can vote if they agree that Cluzzle is good enough. If half or more players agree, both players get full score. Otherwise, each of them gets only 1 Clay Dough.

Fun, party game provided players take it in spirit.

Unfortunately, the clay is not very good. It becomes tough very quickly and crumbles while sculpting. I've replaced mine with good ol' Play-Doh which works much better and smells oh so good. Glad that I didn't pay much for this one.

Great little filler. Takes a bit to figure out how to play, not understand the rules, but how to play. BUT then it is lots of fun. It comes with a tiny amount of clay. I suggest a Play Dough replacement.

Hilarious party game (with the right group).  Great fun for everybody, though, the wrong kind of group can truly kill the fun.  Problems with clay drying.  It receives a 9 as a party game, not because it's a great thinker's game.

I had high hopes for this one, but my clay arrived dry and brittle and the tricks haven't fixed it.  It isn't worth it to me to go buy new clay, although it should be, since I haven't played it as a result.

Great party game! Fun is within the modeling of the clay. I am not so sure about the rule of being awarded with more points when your item is being guessed later on. There's something really bothering me about it, but who'd complain when he gets to scult with clay anyways?

Have only played twice. Enjoyed both. The first was with a non-gamer and my gaming wife. Very pleasant time. Second, with my wife and slightly disinterested daughter and was a little slow. My daughter's artistic skill was a disadvantage as we always knew what she made, usually without a clue.

Relatively quick, fun party game where you don't necessarily have to be good at making clay sculptures in order to win.  Most of the fun is in hearing others' questions and trying to figure out meaningful ones to ask yourself.  I can see Cluzzle coming out for several more plays before I'd be done with it for a while.

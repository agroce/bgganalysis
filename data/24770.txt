I suspect that this game is not at its best with 5 players. The setup is always the same regardless of the number of players, i.e., 5+5 cards dealt on the table. This left me with a feeling that the fifth player almost never gets to choose from freshly dealt cards.

Fun game though. Nothing to get excited about but fun still.

RATING: 8
Brilliant game.  I like games where you don't feel like you're losing all the way through - that you've got a chane of winning, and this is one of them.  

I played the german version, which is the elephant game, NOT bull in a china shop.  The elephant game graphics were lovely, particularly the elephant cards, and I can't imagine the bull version would be half as good.  Judging from the cover it isn't.

Highly recommended.

A decent enough sort-of-take-that game.  Game duration is on the shorter side, which is perfect.  It can be a little frustrating, and I've seen a runaway leader once or twice, but decent enough quick fun.  I carry it in my big bag almost all the time (due to the small box) and pull it out on occasion.

A simple filler which has bit of depth in it as you decide upon either scoring high or hurting your opponents.  This being a bit more complicated than other card fillers is what drops down its rating for me (as For Sale and No Thanks! is a breeze to explain and pick up on compared to this).

Fun, fun game. This game is basically a disaster management game. How can you lose the fewest china cards each round? We had a blast playing this and I can't wait to do it again! One thing I have found out about this game, I am TERRIBLE at it!! I have scored in the 40s and 50s in the 3 games I have played and the winning score has been in the 70s. I just can't wrap my head around this one. It is fun, though.

The golden rule of all euros made filler: be content and reduce your losses. This is pretty how Der Elefant im Porzellanladen (Bull in a China Shop in its English translation) plays, a boring game requiring you to repeat endlessly the same attempt at limiting your damages while leaving you no actual decisions: in order to be fun, a filler needs to be light and thoughtless but the Elefant is neither.

It's not as bad as most people say, a little bit random and chaotic but the decision of "what to score" is enough good and fun that justify playing this game from time to time. Moreover, my wife and mother in law likes this filler, so what more can I expect?

I bought this game for a little less than 3 € so I don't mind the money spent.

At first the game looks like presenting interesting choices (which of four scoring options to choose), but in the end the whole experience is marred by the totally random card draw. Could knowing the deck help control the chaos? Possibly, but it is a time investment I am not interested in pursuing.

An unforgiving and brutal game where you're trying to keep your head above water.   It does seem rather luck dependent though, as you can really get screwed if the wrong destruction cards come up, or get lucky if the right number/color cards come up for you.  On second play I enjoyed this a lot more, so rating up to a 7 from a 6.

RATING: 5
A good-ish set collection game.  On your turn you must draft a card.  You can either take a penalty card which generally hurts you, but rewards you with a dollar, or you can take a points card which scores you points, but costs a dollar.  So, basically, you draft penalty cards when the penalty is the least possible in order to get dollars to buy the scoring cards with.

The scoring is sort of interesting in that scoring happens 4 times per game, but each time you must decide score a different one of 4 different ways to score.

Overall, it's alright as a filler type game, but I didn't feel like there was much control over whether I did well or not.  It's still ok, but nothing I'd seek out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Nothing special with this really. You either buy some china or you have to take a bull which smashes particular sorts of china or you use your one sinle pass of the game. Sometimes you are forced into one of those options. If you have no cash you must take a bull which gives you cash or if you have two cash then you must buy a pot or in both cases use your only pass card. |Some interesting decisions and a great scoring idea but not enough to raise this rating higher. 1 Play.

RATING: 5
Yahtzee-like scoring but, not overly fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Either pay a dollar to buy some china OR take a bull card to discard some china and earn a dollar. You can never have more than two dollars. The four rounds are very quick and players choose a category to score in, the catch being that each category can only be used once. A little abstract but I like the Yahtzee element to the scoring.

RATING: 3
Has every appearance of being a trivially simple luck-heavy piece of fluff, except that it features and rewards reasonable ply analysis (he-goes-then-they-go-then-I-go-then) with a generously healthy serving of screwage.  This is Good Stuff.  Not the deepest thing ever, but is nice.  Somewhat, if faintly, reminiscent of an inverted version of Quandary/Loco!/Thor/FlinkePlinke with no groupthink.

RATING: 3
I strongly dislike this game, although most people I've played it with seem to like it more than me.  Note there is a provable problem with 5 players where people later around the table are at a significant disadvantage, so even if you like it don't play it with 5.  You really don't have much (any?) of a choice each turn and can get wickedly screwed over by the deck.  I prefer fillers to have some skill somewhere in them.

This is a game where you have to make do with limited choices each turn.  Buy or break (sell)?  It's all about the timing as you want to have a strong combination of cards for each scoring round, and each time you choose a different way to score (not unlike Yahtzee).

My complaint is that mob mentality can penalize a player that goes against the pack.  If everyone buys and you decide to break, soon enough you'll find yourself only able to lose precious china while everyone else is shopping.

Not a bad game, but I'd pass on playing it again if offered.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Components: Functional, somewhat attractive china cards in the Playroom edition. The blue and green bulls are a bit difficult to distinguish.

Experience: Horribly unfun. Every decision is either to receive a punishment, or to take a card which will later result in another punishment; get punched in the stomach or slapped in the face. We aborted after three scorings. I like the scoring mechanism, by which we must individually choose how we will score each round (a la Yahtzee), and hope to see it in other games.

RATING: 3
Is this really a game?  I'm probably being generous by ranking this at 3. We played a 5 player game of this...1st player won...which I would guess is very common.  Maybe it could be better with fewer players.  If the right bulls come up when it is your turn, you have a chance to win.  Otherwise you lose.  First player gets first crack at the bulls each round (usually).  I suppose there is some subtle strategy on when to score each category.  But this is a very thin positive on an otherwise bad game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Potentially interesting game marred by a lack of decisions.  On the one hand, I actually don't mind at all the destruction/building paradigm. The part that's odd is the fact that there are so few decisions: if you have no bucks you must take a buck, if you have two bucks you must pay one. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A bit dull & dry. I was disappointed, especially because it is a Schacht design. The interesting mechanic of scoring 1 of 4 ways each round just wasn't enough to carry the game.

RATING: 4
Played with both 3 and 5, and neither time did I feel I had much control at all.  You can do a lot of thinking on your turn, but the outcome seems largely random.  I'm very disappointed, as I was really looking forward to this one.  Maybe I just don't get it though.

RATING: 1
Studies have shown that the pain of a loss of x percent is felt more strongly than the pleasure of an equal-sized gain.  Bull in a China Shop seeks to prove this principle by subjecting it's players to successive rounds where they have to choose a "bull" card that destroys one or more (sometimes all) of the point cards they have been collecting.  

It sucks.  It's perhaps the worst game I've ever played.  Each round, I had to choose to lose one of the cards I had gained -- sometimes I had no choice and had to lose all my cards.  There was nothing redeeming to this game, nothing enjoyable.  Successfully buying a particular card did not in any way equally counter-balance the feelings of loss caused by the bull card effects.  Each of us winced each time we played, and even the winner of the game ended it feeling like she had been punched in her (figurative) balls.  If you are so unlucky as to come across this game, I suggest that you tear it apart for parts, and burn the box.

Not great, but still a GOOD filler card game.  Uses the common "take the bad with the good" mechanic (i.e., Take 6, San Marco, etc.).  Has a Yahtzee feel since players have the same scoring options.  The length is perfect for what it is.  The only reason why I don't give it a 7 or higher is that it feels like you really have little control over your choices.  Grade: C

RATING: 5
A filler/family card game with easy rules and simple play.  I like the mechanism for forced buys.

I also like the 4 scoring categories, each of which must be scored by a player during the game, but a player chooses the order.  This means a player either has to remember and or deduce what their opponent might be going for.  So there is strategy even though the draw of the cards is luck. 

It seems to last a little long for what it is--the box says 30 mins, but after 20 mins I want to hurry it up.

Schacht has a knack for quick, clever, painful decisioned games, and this is certainly one of those.  It's filler-ish, but I think there is some brain burning to be had.  It has some psycho-strategy (trying to predict what others will do, and out-think them).  It's kind of nifty that all the choices and what people are holding is right out there in the open... Like this game a LOT.

Just bad.

Set-up is a bit longish for a supposedly short game.
Almost everything you "build" gets destroyed, so no feeling of accomplishment or constructive plans.
The optimal choice make on your turn is almost always extremely obvious-- lack of feeling of skill or player agency.
Almost no way to strategize well the scoring categories you choose to fill each round-- Your choice of scoring category is almost entirely based on the tactical choices you were forced into up to then, and you have very little control over what you can do later in the game...

Why would I want to play this again?

Pretty nifty little game of min-maxing with Yahtzee-like scoring. Plays quickly enough, but it didn't really grab me. There's also a limited amount of "screw your neighbor" which helps to keep it interesting, but in general it seems pretty easy to avoid serious damage. *UPDATE* Now that I've played with the *correct* rules, the game is quite a bit better. The decisions are a bit more challenging, and the scores were lower.

PLENTY of decisions for a game of this weight.  Certainly more than No Thanks! and at least on par with Coloretto.  You need to be aware of the other players position when deciding to bite the bullet.  There's no sense in passing if you are going to end up getting screwed on the next turn anyway.  I think there is quite a bit of strategy in selecting the vase cards.  You can go for one color, or avoid even or odd numbers and build a balanced hand.  Excellent filler.

I probably would have added 10 more elephant cards, dealing out 2 per player to start the game.  They then could be used in place of the money cards, which add a little bit of fiddliness to the game.  Just turn in an elephant card to buy a vase, or take an elephant card as money.

RATING: 6.5
Schacht has a way with this type of game, although in my mind he succeeds here where he failed with Diabolo last year. This may not be entirely original, but for me the game is rather compelling. Don't look forward to the US version with presumably new art (Bull in US vs. Elephant in Europe).

First played August 9th, 2007.  It's a quick learn (<5min) and quick play (~30min).  It seems there is more luck to this than strategy.  It's a ok filler.  You have two options: buy china (for points) or take a bull (for money and probably lose points).  After four rounds the person with the most points wins.  I don't know if I'd recommend giving this a game play.  If you like to try different filler games, give it a cautious shot.

A great little card game from Michael Schacht, one of my favourite game authors.

Devilishly simple, and that's the joy of the game.  Difficult choices each and every round, from choosing your action to how you score... pick wrong and you'll have a difficult time, but sometimes it's necessary to keep your opponent from taking a commanding lead.

An easy '8' for me.

Set collection game where you are forced to frequently break up and discard your sets. It tends to feel like the good and bad stuff that happens are more driven by circumstance than skill.

A nice little filler that presents some fun choices on each turn.  You have to balance between taking care of yourself but also watching the other players, trying to put them in the worst situation possible.  The theme is kind of funny and makes an otherwise completely abstract game a little more palatable.  I don't think this would play nearly as well with 5 players, and I would like to try with 3, as I suspect it might be better that way, with a tad more control - or as much control as one can have with a cardgame.

[LUP 07-Feb-2007] Richard picked this up in Germany for Melissa.  Very good game, a fair bit of decision making in terms of what scoring to perfom in the scoring rounds and which pieces of china to sacrifice to the elephants and when to attempt to screw the otehr players.

Based on one play with five mean players.  This was a fun, fast-playing, clever game, easy to learn, with plenty of screwage ("he doesn't have any money, so he's taking an elephant, so I'm taking this elephant so that he loses all his green pots" etc.), and I imagine the screwage goes up with fewer players.

Update: Hmm, I have since played several 3-player games (with less aggressive/mean-spirited gamers than in my first play), and it hasn't been quite as much fun.  This phenomenon must be investigated further, ha ha ha.

Update: it was "pretty good" with 5 players in my regular group; not [i]quite[/i] as awesome as my first play, when I realized mid-game that one of my opponents was clearclaw.

2009-10-31: Dropping to a 6, as it's just not getting played.  I still think this is a cool game, though.

Well, kinda playable but not so special card game. You buy porcelain vases (color and value differs) and try to avoid the most disastrous elephant cards (breaks specific colors or values of the vases). Has some yatzee elements while you have to score one different scoring attribute in each of the four scoring rounds.

Elephants and porcelain shop keepers don't go well together!  I love the theme, and this game proves it.  Several interesting tense choices to make throughout the game b/c with no money, you must take an elephant, and with two money you must buy porcelain.  Some times, you will be on the bad end of a vicious cycle so you MUST see it coming and get out of that loop or you will get nailed.

Light cardgame that does a good job of filling in-between sessions or closing an evening.

The rules are probably a bit on the obscure side as for clarity but nonetheless, it's not a complicate game so we managed.  We discovered that there CAN be some move that can virtually brake the game if no one is paying attention.  One player can be the one always taking bad "elephant" or "bull" for that matter.  

In any case, it's light hearted so we took it like that.

RATING: 6.5
On your turn you either take a bull card which breaks some (or all!) of your china and take a money card OR spend a money card on new china.  When you have 2 money cards you must take china.  When you have 0 money cards you must take a bull.  

The cards have different colors which determine what gets broken... the trick is to try to mitigate your damages and perhaps leave a tableau that enforces your opponent's to take damage.  There's a lot of look-ahead and praying.

I like the game but fear that it may just be TOO tactical.  Hopefully further play will prove me wrong.

It is somewhat chaotic but playing is fun. Three players is the best number for the game. You get more decisions and can plan ahead better. Four is still ok for a more chaotic game, but five is pushing a concept. Not good with 5 players. I especially liked Yathzee style scoring.

Update (27.6.2008): I tried playing with the action cards mini-expansion. They were a nice idea but seemed to be a bit broken the way the original rules were written. If someone gets too many china at the start, he can usually break two of them at a time without too much harm to get more and more action cards. This actually benefits most likely the one who is leading - something that probably isn't original intent. 

I recommend you play using following changes when playing with action cards:
1) Give everyone two cards at the beginning but you must discard one of them.
2) Every time you gain an action card, you can have maximum of one of them. If you have two, discard one (of your choice).

I liked the game a lot more with the restriction of one card only. Action cards make a game slightly better as they add uncertainty to the game.

You're extremely limited to when you can avoid cards and when you must pick up cards, so you can see the train wreck coming, that everyone can avoid this really bad set of cards until you're forced to pick them up, and it's coming, it's coming, and then it hits. And you're stuffed. Although I do like how you need to choose each of the scoring categories once, introducing different needs for each player each round. I've yet to be swayed that there's more mgt than luck, and the game play isn't interesting enough to explore enough to find out. It's an occasional play.

System feels different and all that but it's sometimes just too cruel. Fellow players have to be mean to win. Also the yahtzee-style scoring doesn't fit, well, at least I don't like it - though I know many who do like..

Feels a bit constrained. The choice of what to score a bit obvious. Yet it somehow manages to be fun. I guess the game is about setting up the most destructive situation for the opponents rather than trying to do something constructive for oneself. The more players the merrier.

Der Elefant im Porzellanladen

I really like this nifty little card game, even though I'm really rubbish at it!
Painful decisions on whether to take or break china, with the decision sometime enforced upon you depending on your money status: 
no money = have to break china & get 1 money as compensation, 
1 money = your choice to buy or break,
2 money = must buy china.
The four different scoring options, all of which have to get chosen once, also make for a painful choice.
Very good fun.

Lots and lots of luck. It sometimes plays itself. If you win you don't really get the feeling that you deserved it so much as your opponents were just unfortunate with the draw of the cards. That said, it's a game built on schadenfreude that's be sure to get a few laughs and groans at someone elses expense. I'd like to try a variant where the pass cards are discarded from the game and instead a player can always pass their turn by paying one porcellean card.

RATING: 5
This is not a bad game.  In fact, it is yet a new ingenious way to form card sets in order to score points with some mean decisions.  It is just that it came late to my gaming life, in a point in which I am in the mood for something meatier to spend my precious limited playing time, so I feel that playing funny games like this is kind of a waste.  Besides, I've seen this formula working so many times that the enchantment has simply vanished away.

Mindezek ellenere tetszett nekem. Ha vegre sikerul vegigjatszanom a jatekot normalis korulmenyek kozott, lehet felmegy az osztalyzat, csak most a legkor miatt -1.

游戏中每个镇长都需要努力经营自己的小镇，规划建设，还要不断受到各种天灾人祸的侵扰。最终在村民的四次投票之后，获得票数最多的镇长可以荣获年度最佳镇长的称号。规则很简单，每次玩家行动不是买一个建筑就是选择一种灾难摧毁建筑。游戏的美工设计非常卡通，看上去是一个小清新游戏，实际上游戏过程充满腥风血雨，看着自己的各种建筑不断地被摧毁也是需要一定心理承受能力的。四次投票的投票方式是玩家自选的（分别是每种颜色建筑最大值、最小值、一种颜色建筑总值和所有建筑总值），而每种投票方式只会出现一次，这点设计很有rk老师的风格。总之是一个不错的暖场游戏。下次玩的时候把神力牌加进去试试，相信策略度又会有一个提升。

Very subtle control that can be completely wrecked by the random player.  The four different sorts of scoring is a very cool touch that should be stolen and reused by other games as soon as possible.  As Andy Merritt observes, there are major issues with the five-player game.

I think this is a strange card game. It feels like a filler but between the longish set-up and the need for serious planning, it plays like a serious strategy game.  I'm not sure it will find an audience. The theme seems too light for serious players and the play is too deep for light players.  That said, I enjoyed it.

RATING: 6
Has typical Schacht elements: set collection with painful decisions to make (take a card to reduce your hand or try to risk it). When scoring is triggered, players get to choose how they want to score (clever system that one). However, because of game limitations (players have to buy porcelain when they have two money cards etc), the game feels a little contrived. It all feels rather processional as the decision making is quite limited. If I had a choice of similar games, I'd go for Coloretto.

This is my "Hit from Essen". A great filler card game that plays in about 30 minutes. A small decision tree, but some interesting choices to make. I really like the 4 scoring moments when you have to choose (yahtzee style) whether you will score "lowest in all colors", "highest in all colors", "all of one color", or "all cards".

Highly Recommended!

I can only imagine that occasionally some players will be faced with real choices when playing this.  In my very limited experience, I found that most of my decisions were so clear cut that were it not for Russian Roulette aspect of the game I'd find the game appallingly boring. I say Russian Roulette with some trepidation though as the difference here is that you can see the bullet in the chamber a turn before you have to pull the trigger.  I like the concept of the game, but the options available seems so clear cut that I fail to see where I need to be involved.  

I feel the only real choice that the game offers is how you score each round, and there isn't much choice there, rather you try to tailor what you can to get something worthwhile when it is time to score.

Bull in a China Shop: Played this with 5, and it was interesting, but too many times we felt forced into actions we didn't want to take. I think that the addition of the printable Action cards available on BGG will help with that - more change, more choice, will keep things feeling less boxed in.

1 play, partial game. We quit because it just seemed too random - you have some control in the game, but really not very much. You have to decide which of your 4 scoring types to score each time, but I'm not sure if you have a good basis for the decision? Would like to play a full game of this some time, although probably will have to wait till another con to play someone else's copy!

After three games I'm not interested in bringing it out again anytime soon.  I believe the limiting factor is that you can only have two dollars at a time.  So if you have two dollars you must buy china.  If you have no dollars you must choose a bull.  If you have one then you get to choose your action but you then choose the next action by default.

Usual functional game from Schacht. The 4 different scoring is a great idea, but seems of little weight in the actual game.
The city retheme by Kanga to Quietville is great. The gameplay makes more sense that way and the game is just more visually appealing. Iconography for monsters could be better to quickly assess what they do.
Divine intervention cards add some interesting gameplay element, but make for a whole different game.
This game is ideal with 3 players; with more you are a lot less involve in the gameplay.

The more I thought about this one, the less I liked it.  At first I really enjoyed it, but then it dawned on me that every decision I saw anyone make seemed to be the obvious choice.  It seems to be almost all about the luck of the cards, and any control is an illusion.  Still, it was fun, and the Yahtzee-like scoring is great.

RATING: 5
[Amigo Spiele 'Der Elefant im Porzellanladen' 2006 edition] {Filler; hand-management, drafting, set-collection; optimal 3p} Bull in a China Shop is an average filler: interactive, fast-paced and tactical.  Luck of draw is important but it allows players to have certain control in getting better score. It is a game about hand management skill, which is usually fun for general players. It is quite trivial to choose a proper scoring method each round.  It has some minuses - it is not very engaging and the theme is tenuous. Nothing new or special but it is nicely playable.

[Updated in 2011] I got a chance to try this game with 5p . It's a disaster. The last player in the sitting order hardly has any possible choices at all, even if he/she is aware of the situation and users his/her push card early.  And the first player can win the game readily.  This game won't work with 5p.  I would rate this game a '2' for 5p.

Very fun and relatively quick card game.  Even though it's fast playing, you need to consider each of your decisions carefully, but you will have those moments -- and you can see them coming -- where the other players have limited your choices and you're just going to get screwed.  

I also like the Yahtzee-style scoring in which you select one of four ways you can tally up your cards to exhaust after each round.

(I tried the Der Elefant im Porzellanladen version, which is a nonsensical theme but does a fine job tying everything together.  The Quietville theme looks... dumb.)

RATING: 5
Bull in a China Shop is different enough to warrant a spot in your card filler collection, however, it does not scale well and seems to only work optimally with three.

The scoring options seemed innovative upon first glance,  however,  repeated plays revealed that those choices - and largely many others in this game - are really nothing more than pseudo alternatives.  

In a roundabout way,  at least you can say that you were  forewarned.  After all,  there is a lot of bull in this game.

I'm glad I had a chance to play this. It's classic Schacht, with limited actions each turn, and almost always difficult decisions. It sort of feels a bit like Coloretto, and a bit like Hansa, both games I like. But here I always feel like I'm on a boat that's taking on water faster than I can bale it out, and that's not a fun feeling for me, even when I win.

RATING: 7
Bull in a China Shop was a great filler card game that I’m now tempted to buy. It was originally released as Der Elefant im Porzellanladen by Amigo Spiele in 2006, but renamed Bull in a China Shop when it was reprinted by Playroom Entertainment. It’s a simple and quick card game with some interesting decision-making opportunities. Basically each turn consists of either spending a money to buy a piece of pottery (that comes in 3 different colors and of varying values) or taking a money, but having to take a destruction of pottery card in addition every time you take a money. It sounds like a frustrating Sisyphus-like exercise of constantly destroying the pottery that you just bought, and in a way - it is. But that’s the fun part because it’s all about timing the taking of money so that there are destruction of pottery cards available that don’t harm you much, if at all. The destruction cards destroy things like all of your pottery in a certain color or all of your even-numbered pottery, so if you time it right (or are lucky, which is often better than being good, of course) then you’ll get a money without having to destroy anything. The second interesting element of the game comes in the scoring, which occurs four time over the course of the game. At each scoring interval, you have to decide whether to score all of your pottery of a certain color, your highest valued pottery in each color, your lowest valued pottery in each color, or all of your pottery. The key is that just like Shear Panic, your options decrease because you can only use each scoring option once in the game. Figuring out when to take money versus buying pottery, and when to use each scoring option is a fun challenge. While the game is extremely random, it’s quick and light and still allows for some interesting decisions to scratch your head about and wonder back on whether things would have turned out differently if you’d chosen the other path.

RATING: 6
Didn't enjoy this much but find the design interesting. I wonder whether I subconsciously decided this was interesting due to the "game beats you up" nature it has in common with games like In the Year of the Dragon.

In this game you spend money to buy specific point-scoring cards, or if broke take money from the bank in exchange for taking disasters that destroy specific selections of the point-scoring cards. Taking these disasters is the only way to get money. Four times per game the cards you've managed to not lose get scored in one of four ways. You must use a different one of the four ways each time.

The mechanical balance seems to be for the disasters (the bulls) to be extremely destructive on average. It can feel arbitrary whether you managed to have anything at all worth scoring when it's time to score.

Cute little card game of collecting and destroying pottery with a Yahtzee type scoring mechanism (at each quarter point during the game, each player separately decides which category to take their points in).

Some luck in how the cards come out of course, but this can often be manipulated with good observation on what other players need to do, and what the rules will force them to do in certain situations.

Played once (with 5 players). Despite some interesting ideas (the scoring rules), my only play of this game has been incredibly boring. I suspect it may be because I played with 5 players (but then, it was supposed to be playable with 5, although reading the rules was enough to make us suspicious about that). I might try and play it again with 3 or 4, since it is short enough, but even then, the high luck factor makes it unlikely to be a game I really enjoy.

I am intrigued by this game.  The draw to play this game again is trying to understand the flow and timing because it never seems like there is an optimum move.  Having elephants run through your china shop gives you money to buy more china, but also potentially destroys the china currently on your shelves.  Being in a position to force elephants on your opponent because they are broke can be fun in an evil sort of way.

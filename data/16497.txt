Se trata es de colocar el mayor numero posible de condimentos del mismo color uno junto al otro. De este modo se consiguen valiosos puntos. Pero los jugadores tienen que tener cuidado con las ratas, pues cuando hay demasiadas del color propio, ¡la partida concluye antes de tiempo!

Short two player filler.  Quite fun and tactical.  Possible last tile issue if this happens to contain one of your rats on and you already have three uncovered at the beginning of your turn.  In these circumstances you would not be able to cover the rat up and would loose instantly.  Not likely to be a problem otherwise as you have two tiles to work with, although in similar unusual circumstances if both these included a rat you would also lose.  Suggest that rats are ignored on the final turn in these circumstances.  (Sold Sep-06)

My rating is not for Rat Hot, but for its predecessor, Junks (or Dschunke or whatever it is called).  My wife loves to play this game, and I am a fan as well.  The playtime is quick, and there is a subtle strategy - there is a lot that can go into building up and protecting your investments.  There is a fair amount of luck of the draw, but that keeps the game interesting and prevents too much AP time.  My wife regularly requests this, and that means that it gets an 8 in my book.

I own Rat Hot, a very quick game, and with different scoring rules than its predecessor Dschunke (the tile game).  The new scoring rules do not use a geometric progression for scoring based on the number of adjacent symbols, and you score with each tile placement rather than waiting all the way to the end of the game.  (The end game also provides a second scoring round, but again, without the geometric progression).  That Rats are now sudden death if you have three showing, rather than just being -1 modifier to a score, either makes the game more tense and the rats actually matter, or else they make the game too lucky... I think the former rather than the latter.  

I enjoy the game as a good, tactical tile-laying light filler.  I think the intermittent scoring is nice, although I wish the distribution could have been kept the same so that you could use the long-term scoring rules instead.  The color-blind should note that the new edition is much more friendly than the old, print-out one.

It helps when you read the rules more closely.  A fun, tactical game.  Playing two tiles enables you to make  clever moves and to make sure you cover up your rats, as you don't want them hanging around.  It is dangerous to leave even one rat showing.

Na ez a játék pénzkidobás. A szokásos jó Queen games minőség, de a szabály egy hulladék. A leírás is de az ötlet is egy vicc. Komoly szabálymódosítást kellet végrehajtani, hogy használható legyen a játék, de akkor is csak akkor jó, ha egy kis gyerek érdeklődik a játékok iránt és nincs más.

I do declare this a hidden gem and I'm surprised it has such a low rating. Sure, it is a bummer when you lose the game to having 3 rats visible, but that tension makes the game interesting--do I handle the rats or do I score points?

RATING: 6.5
A minute to learn, a lifetime to master? Not quite, but there's plenty of strategy for such a simple game. The rules could be clearer though. For example, they say that you score when the addition of a piece changes a grouping on the board. But they do not clarify if this affects groupings that are split/shrink, nor what exactly a group is (my wife thought it was a straight line, I thought it was any orthogonally connected pieces of the same kind).

12/24/05 - this one is quick. Cool thing about this game is that the board gets built as you play - very cool mechanic. You need to be aware that at any moment you could immediately lose the game if 3 of your colored rats show up on the board. So, contrary to the naysayers of how they don't like this aspect of the game, I say - you know that going in so play smart!!

RATING: 6
Enjoyable tile laying game for two.  Most of the time it plays fine and is quite fun.  Unfortunately though, you can lose just by dumb luck of the draw.  It is usually easy to place a tile with an opponent's rat in a position that will take several turns for them to cover.  In the meantime, if more of their rats come up within a few turns that player loses through no fault of their own (only luck).  It isn't a satisfying way to lose (or win).

Arranging tile depths so that scoring locations are locked in is a surprisingly subtle enterprise.

The new version, Rat Hot, is a far far poorer game than the original D:dK.  The new scoring rules in particular remove most of the strategy and angst from the game.  Buy the game, it is a great game, but throw away the new rules and play by the original rules.  You'll be glad you did.

The original rules can be found on Michael Schacht's web site.

Fairly simple 2-player game. A nice diversion from the card-driven staple of Kosmos 2-players. Great for kids (4+). Unfortunately the game doesn't come without coins, so both players have to give some back when the bank runs low. The 3d aspect really adds depth to the game. Pun intended, but true.

RATING: 6
Fun little game for two which is harder than you would think at first&mdash;blame the stacking. But it makes you think in a nice way; it isn't as hard as, for example, Java. Of course its simplicity didn't stop me and my girlfriend from getting a crucial rule wrong: we played that three rats of a single colour meant *instant* death for the unlukcy person, instead of *at the end of his turn*. My, how the game improved once I corrected that error (thanks, B Weage and Liumas!). Originally a thin 7, I dropped it to a 6 as luck of the draw really is quite influential, even when considering that it is balanced by the fact you can try to build impossible-to-bridge constructs and even, if you're lucky, manage to force a player to lose because he can't cover his rats. It's a 'thick' 6, though. One very minor suggestion: have the yellow disc count for 3 points instead of 2.

RATING: 7
Picked it up as a little bonus inside of another Queen Game.  

Fun little game for 2 players.  Plays in about 25 minutes.  The rule translation was a little weird and missing a few clarifying points.  One area that we screwed up was the stacking part.  We kept stacking on many layers (as long as it didn't go over a blank space and as long as it covered at least two pieces).  But it started to get crazy.  I think the layering rule on each floor would be needed.  (A space is considered "empty" on each floor as opposed to just the bottom floor).

Liked it.  Would play more.

RATING: 6
Production: Cute little pictures on functional tiles.  I found myself repeatedly thinking that two types of spice were the same, when they were not, because of the similarities of the iconography.  Play: Drawing two tiles allows a player some flexibility on how to play out their turn, and maximize their points.  It is an interesting side game to also be trying to hide one's rats and expose those of the opponent. (2+1+3) (2 plays)

Puzzling little two-player game with a dominoes theme, but allowing for curious stacking of tiles. You can play aggressively, and if you ever end up with 3 rats face up at the end of your turn you lose immediately! Every game seems like it would be a fresh challenge. I'm curious to try out the alternate scoring for longer chains.

A beautiful, little thinking game with a certain component of anger. The more
you play it, the more possibilities for moves you discover. "Rattenscharf" also
qualifies as a solitary game. Though one will miss the tears in the eyes of the
opponent, at least one will always win. ;-)

This is a good tile laying game that plays quickly and the art is excellent.  It's a pretty compact game as well if it weren't for the fact that it's in a box by the publisher Queen.  It kind of reminds me of Taluva where you to stack tiles and when you do so you must cover at least sections of two different tiles.  It has an interesting mechanism that if 3 Rats are showing at the end of your turn, you automatically lose.

Nice & short, but inadequate rules.  For such short rules & simple rules, to look up to resolve several issues--seems as though others had the same questions.

Strategic little game that is too much of a brain burner when played with some people.  Therefore it can lag.  However, if you are used to chess lulls, these time outs will seem short.  It is difficult to plan ahead because as in chess, the board changes immediately before your turn.

the tile placement reminds me of Hanging Gardens, which I dearly love, except that everyone places tiles in one location whereas in Hanging Gardens, each person has their own tile laying area.  Also reminds me of the Taluva tile laying rules, and there all tiles are laid in a common area, like Rat Hot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A reverse Shangai of sorts.  Try to minimize your exposed rats while laying tiles with your opponent's rats showing in difficult configurations.  If that doesn't seem like a winner then try to group your spices together.  Very simple and puzzle-like with the interaction adding an element of difficulty.  Fun, light and for the whole family.

Rat Hot is a light short tile laying game for two. The basic gameplay is somewhat like three-dimensional dominoes. What makes it quite a bit more exciting are rats. If too many of them appear on table at the same time, you lose immediately so you need to score as many points as possible while still keeping the rats at bay which can be a difficult endeavour at times.

This game is probably near perfect with regards to its time/depth ratio.

Strangely large box, a bit expensive for whats in it and an off the wall theme.

The game play is great. Simple to learn and teach, however, there is far more depth than is apparent at a glance.

This game flew below my radar and was brought to my attention by a fellow BBG'er....Thanks Travis!

This game has a theme that makes an introduction to abstracts appealing to most people.

Definitely made me want to play more 3-dimensional abstracts, but did it make me want to play this one? I'm not so sure. Would like to play again knowing what I know now.

Fun 2-player game. Trying to figure out which is better: tightly packing the tiles or letting them sprawl; making 2-tile clusters, 3-tile clusters or even larger; spreading out or stacking. There is much to think about.

I came so close to winning the first game! His final two tiles both had rats in my color with a third one already on the board. He played them both in such a way that I couldn't cover any of them with my final tile and so lost with three rats showing. I would have won on points.

Second game the tiles just weren't on my side but I did make it to final scoring. He won on points. We actually ran out of scoring chips and had to keep track of the last few points on our fingers.

First played this on Feb 13th 2007.  This is a simple game where you try to capture points more than your opponent.  It takes maybe 2 minutes to setup and explain and can be played in 10-15 minutes.  So it's a good filler game.  There doesn't appear to be too much strategy to it and the luck can play into it quite a bit I suppose if you draw say two rat tiles and you already have two on the board that can't be covered up.

I've only played with the Rat Hot rules so far.  I can see why some would prefer the Dschunke ones, but for now I'm satisfied with the Rat Hot rules.

Absolutely themeless, but I like the artwork, the game is really easy to teach, and provides a good challenge.  It feels similar to Hanging Gardens (or maybe I should have that the other way around), and the risk management regarding the premature losing conditions is fun.

The game is rife with the feeling of "I can't," as in "I wish I could cover up that bad rat on the third level, but it's too high and there's no stable base for my piece, so I can't..." Your options don't amount to much more than in Tic-Tac-Toe.

Maga a játékötlet remek, de én valahogy nem vagyok elájulva a kivitelezéstől. A képek azt sugallják, hogy ez inkább egy gyerekjáték, de nem az, ráadásul a fűszeres téma nem tudom, hogy kihez állhat közel. Én valami teljesen absztrakt szimbólumrendszerrel jobban el tudnám képzelni, hiszen ez tulajdonképpen nem egy tematikus játék. A doboz ormótlanul nagy a tartalomhoz képest, és vagy mi játszuk rosszul, vagy túl kevés a korong kettőnk pontjaihoz (a végső értékelés után).
A játék szabályrendszere mindezektől függetlenül nagyon tetszik, fordulatos játékmenetekre számíthat az ember.

12 plays in the first month (at a time when a lot of gaming is at a premium) says a lot. Bought somewhat on a whim at the local game store grand re-opening, it has been this year's quick game hit. I liked how it progressed in our play too, first as a quick score points tile laying game where the rats were not that important, to now where it is a battle to make the rats as overwhelmingly important as possible and point scoring happens where it can.

Technically we can play a more strategic version of the game with the same components but so far we like it as it is. Deeper than it looks.

RATING: 8
Rating is for Dschunke. I like this game a lot. It's like a screw-you version of dominoes and the stacking elemement adds a nice level of complexity. I like that it is just pickup and play with no major setup required. Original Dschunke: Das Legespiel rules only tho.

Homemade version
Constructed in Jan 2006

1 - Brightened the jpegs and increased the contrast.
2 - Changed the colour of the "S" to blue instead of brown.
3 - Pasted the images into a Word doc, sized them to 90% then printed them to heavy white cardstock
4 - Glued the cardstock to illustrator board then cut the tiles with knife and straightedge.
5 - Made a tile of the title graphic square. 
6 - Formatted the text of the available rules summary file to fit on the back of the title graphic tile.
7 - Created a single graphic file of the Start tile, printed it to heavy cardstock and pasted it to the back of the first Start tile so it is double sided and easy to find.

Sweet little game. Great gift idea as well.

A very nicely done 2-player game.  The original rules (scoring only at the end) are a lot more interesting than the new rules (score as you go).  The new rules are good for those in need of "instant gratification," but the original rules make for a more thoughtful and fun game.  Strangely, this very simple game was a little difficult to figure out right away, because the rules were not that clear.  Better illustrations for the examples would have made a big difference for me.  There is a small amount of "take-that," but not too harsh or nasty.  Pleasant game for two kids.

Print and Play: Printed from the files on the Rat Hot page for  Dschunke: Das Legespiel.  Pasted on self-adhesive linoleum tiles and cut out, finished with Krylon Crystal Clear.

The tile placement mechanics are clever and simple- don't have air under a tile, no 'undo' tiles right on top of another.  The last couple of turns are really important, as they can alter what came before but by virtue of being last, not much can alter them.  

I'm considering a variant where a rat adjacent to any goods at the end means that those goods score as zero.  Isolated rats would still be -1 point.

Small little Schacht game for two. Re-development from Dschunke: Das Legespiel and I'd say it is better in its new form. New scoring makes game less strategic and more tactical and most importantly faster. Rats also create a needed tension since you lose if there are 3 rats of your color showing at end of your turn. A very good 10-15 minute filler for two.

RATING: 6
Available in Michael Schacht's own website as Dschunke - das Legespiel, Rattenscharf is a pleasant but not really memorable relative of Sid Sackson's Domino Bead Game: two players try to score as much as possible playing out tiles on the table who must make as many matches as possible with the mesh of tiles played before. On the one hand the use of the third dimension is rather refreshing, and the use of rats introduces an element of menace in the game (if three rats of the player's colour are on the table and they can't be covered it's curtains). On the other hand the draws influence the development of the game a tick too much for my taste.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
An agonisingly good twist on dominoes. A bit like Hive, Rat Hot builds (literally) layer upon layer of strategy, but unlike Hive seems to be relatively balanced in the attack/defence departments. The whole thing is delightfully presented, ridiculously easy to explain and highly competitive. Deserves to be better-rated.

Would be higher-rated if too many decisions didn't depend on hoping you could turn up a non-rat tile.

Taking the best piece out of Dschunke and turning into a 2 player works pretty well. It's tile laying and tile covering. The aim is to create pressure by placing opponent's rats in difficult spaces to cover up (3 face up rats and you die) whilst creating groupings of spices in your colours to score along the way in case there's no instant death and the winner is on points. It's pleasant without being overly deep.

Not to be confused with Hot Rats, this is a decent 2-player game. Not quite a 2-player version of Dschunke, more a puzzle on the theme, for which I mark it down.

Fun tile-laying game with the neat twist that you can place tiles on top of other tiles. We've played with both sets of rules; both have their own advantages (a bit more tactics perhaps in the Queen rules; more intriguing scoring system in the earlier version).

RATING: 5
Enjoyed it once or twice.  Rats can come out a bit too quickly, making the game be much more about 'cover my rat' than about making points.

Good players are able to place rats in places that it takes 3 moves to cover up -- with how fast the rats come, that's a sure fire way to lose.  

Feels a bit too random for me.

RATING: 8
An easy light two player filler.  Many fun decisions.  It seems a bit too easy to come up with three rats against you.  Which means that if someone gets un/lucky the game is blown. I'd rather the game only ended immediately and penalized the three rat player of a certain amount of gold.  

Otherwise, it is just too damn random.  To me that is a shame as the game is rather good.  I'm rating it an 7 based on what I figure it will be like after my changes.  Had a great time playing it as is though.

Looking forward to playing it with the original rules.

Update: The original Dschunke: Das Legespiel rules are much, much, much better than Rat Hot.

Much.

We may have played with incorrect rules, so I'll reserve my rating.  The way we played, there is a strong "take that" element, sort of a mean-spirited dominoes.  Probably not a game I'd enjoy too much even playing correctly, but you never know.  Update:  I think we did play incorrectly before.  I had a good time with it despite my challenges with geometry.  Could be a fun game to play with children too.

I have two or three large questions about the rules, starting with what about the rats on the last turn, when the last player only gets one tile to play?  But even if every single one of our guesses about the rules happens to be exactly right, we've got a good game here.  Place a tile anywhere contiguous or properly stacked, no symbol-matching necessary.  But score points if you do get symbols to match.  Score for a group only if you establish it or *make it bigger.*  (The rules just say *change* the group.)  Keep count of the rats of your color if you don't want to risk losing it all on the last card.  That's the way we played it, and maybe we were right or maybe not about all the details.  The basic activity of the game, deciding where to put your tile, is an interesting one, so however the numbers are supposed to work out exactly, I believe it's a good game.

RATING: 7
[RGG 'Rat Hot' edition] {Food, filler; tile-laying} Rat Hot is a tactical 2p game.  It's interactive with mild confrontational and fast-paced.  Rule is simple and clear.  I like the sudden death rule, which adds excitement and tactical options.  There is luck factor but Rat Hot is never random; players have to smartly place their tiles in order to achieve higher score or to barter the opponent.  It is a light game - it is very easy to work out what the opponent is doing.  Obviously, placing opponent's rat higher (in level) can cause them trouble because it is more difficult to be covered.  Knowing when the game will end is important; otherwise one will unnecessarily defend against rats and lose scoring opportunity.  The game is balance - I don't see any advantage of being the first / second player.

The theme is thin. I use a draw bag to draw tiles.  It would be better if the tiles are larger. Then it would be more attractive to children.  Sometimes, the yellow and grey markers are not enough for a game. The publisher should provide more.  By the way, has Queens Game ever understood that we do not prefer such a large box?

Easy to play 2-player with enough decision making to make it worth the effort. Do I go gor points, or do I take steps to deal with rat problems? Notre Dame is still the best game with rats in it though.

Update May 2016. Used to enjoy playing this with the kids, but they grew up, so no more games. Sold.

RATING: 5.5
Bears very little resemblence to Dschunke, which it is arguably related to.  The first few plays are interesting as you learn the game, but I can really see this getting samey after 5 plays or so.  It seems to have very clear tactics after the first few initial plays, so much of the game comes down to luck of the draw.  Points feel more like a tie-breaker than a victory condition in this game, as forcing the opposing player into Sudden Death with 3 rats is a major factor in many games.

This was a clever tile-laying game that is somewhat reminiscent of a significantly simplified version of Java since you're building up 3-D and trying to cover spaces that are useful to your opponent.  I did terribly on my first play, but would certainly be willing to try it again sometime.

So the one and only time I played this, I took the last turn and was forced to play the last tile which had my third rat on it; and no matter how I played it, I would lose.  That was disappointing.  That said, now that I know that's a possibility, I want to play again so I can prepare for that possibility happening.  Because after a couple of plays, I think the potential's there for another fast, fun 2-player tile-laying game from Schacht (like Architekton).  Update: Played it a few more times and have definitely seen the light.  Another winner from Schacht.

(own by ale). I feel like your planning and strategic play is always messed up by the fact that as soon as 3 rats of your color are out, you've lost the game. And it seems that it is something that happens too often! Probably requiring 4 rats of your color would make the game less random and more enjoyable.

Light, quick with beautiful components - hard to really plan your moves, but some decisions to be made. I suspect it's better with more than 2 players, but I enjoyed it 2 player anyway. This is a good light filler game.

RATING: 5
I really hope that this goes up on future ratings as it's an absolutely gorgeous game to look at and I love the theme.  However it does seem to be based on almost random screwage and a cross between educated guesswork and shots in the dark 9depending on how many are playing and how well they are playing).  Ok so there are a lot of other hard to predict screwage games out there...Asteroyds for instance, but this one has such a big box and lavish components that one expects a little more.  Actually it's k,ind of like Cartegena in terms of its atmosphere and overall level.

It's going to hit the table a few times and when it does, I hope my rating will go up.  I really want to like this one more!  I fear it may even go down to a 3.  I almost fancy having a go at designing a new game around the pieces or at least tweaking the present rules - keeping it light but with just that much more control.

Really?! That's it. Play two cards. Get hosed because someone moved before you. Stick barrels on a ship to score points. Continue until done. At least it is short. 

A very light Euro. Would be a good intro game as it is ridiculously easy to play.

Comment 	
I have to admit this was a sleeper.  It looks so simple that there couldn't be that much to it.  But man was I wrong.  Montego Bay offers more direct player interaction than just about any non war game I have ever played. The rules are short and sweet. Anyone can play and you can think as hard as you want or not think at all and still have fun. The psychological aspects are outstanding and since it is quick, you can play again and again.

This is a great simple game.  I feel the production adds to the game.  It feels thematic, while this could have easily been a completely dismissable abstract game with a lessor production value.  It is quick, easy to learn, and a great family game.  I would only recommend it as a family game however.

Interesting, quite chaotic but also with sufficient opportunity to second guess and screw other people up that it never feels like you are out of control. The scoring is pretty straightforward area majority but it is the movement of the dockers and pushing each other into less profitable spaces that really makes this game.

Not my sort of game at all, simultaneous action selection isn't my favourite mechanic, and add in the random turn order (which randomises again half way through) and you have a chaotic game which could slip into Analysis Paralysis hell with some gamers (as you try to out guess what everyone else is doing).

Doubt I'd be convinced to play this one again ...

RATING: 5
Extremely simple game for a game with a box this size. This is a simultaneous card selection game, and I think if someone cared, they could put a lot of thought into their moves. I preferred to just look at a couple obvious choices and just pick something fairly conservative. A reasonable opener/closer. I think my rating would go down with people who take it seriously and analyze everyone's best move and the sequence of move executions. Sort of like Caribbean, except that at least you know the execution order when choosing move distance.

RATING: 3
This is an area majority game with simultaneous action selection.  You control two characters which move a number of spaces equal to a card you play for each character in character order which is initially determined randomly.  If you land on another character you will move to the opposite side.  There are other movement factors if someone is also on the opposite side.  Where your character lands determines how many crates you add to boats to try and get majority for points.  Sometimes places you land will cause you to discard your barrels and worsen your position.  You can also gain money which will allow you to higher a 3rd character for one round at a cost of three coins.  There is a lot of chaos in this game and it get's worse the lower you are in turn order.  The turn order is randomly determined at the beginning and then it cycles itself in a logical manner.  Unfortunately in the second phase of the game the turn order is randomized again, which can bump you out of a position just when it was looking favorable.  Also having both of your own characters right next to one another is a huge advantage because there's no chaos between your characters movements.  Therefore, the turn order which is determined randomly gives huge advantages.  House rules could fix this, but why create house rules when there are so many great games already balanced by the designers?  Maybe, it's just that I'm not the target audience for this game.  It would probably be ok for a gateway game.

A great family game that is very tactical, light-medium in weight. And marvellous components - perhaps too good? As long as you don't let the size of the box and quality of the components determine the size of your expectations, this is a solid game. Arguably best enjoyed with three players, it's a strong entry in the family games category or even as medium-lighter fare for casual gamers.

Programming game, not bad/not great (another one!): tries to achieve a good balance in anticipation and chaos, but remains a bit on the random side for me. Moreover, it lacks tension (despite the ‘oh! I got kicked out’ aspect), and gets repetitive quite fast.
Could be an option if you want teach majority and secret action selection to an 8-years old.

Baj van a részeg tengerésszel …
Barátunk által szervezett partin bukkant fel ez a „jamajikaji gyögyszem” anno, amikor még egy internetes nagyáruház elkezdte jóárasítani a társasjátékokat (közötte ezt is és még tart az akció).
A hatalmas dobozból egy kis tengeri kikötő hangulatos grafikája tárult szemem elé, majd megkaptam kis és nagy rakodómunkásomat és megismerkedhettem Lusta Dzsekkel is, aki jó pénzért mindenre kapható.
A kikötő raktárhelyiségeit a rendelkezésre álló belső elrendezés lapkákkal véletlenszerűen alakítjuk ki.
A játékban a melósaink segítségével hordókat és érméket próbálunk megszerezni, majd a hordókat hajókra pakolva győzelmi pontokká váltani azokat és a pénzzel későbbi fordulóink során a lustát felbérelni (plusz motyót szerez nekünk, ami egyenlő újabb zsé vagy újabb behajózható cucc).
Természetesen egy kikötőben balesetek is előfordulhatnak, hiszen csúszik a banánhéj, szemünkbe tűz a trópusi nap, vagy reggel egynél több „hidegindítót” vette be a munkásunk, így a berakott hordók közül egy vagy több össze is törhet.
Ebben az egyszerű felállásban jön pár csavar. A játék két felében (tehát 2x egy játékban) véletlenszerűen kialakításra kerül a játékosok kis és nagy munkásának sorrendje. Mindenki titokban kiválasztja, hogy az adott munkása mennyi lépést mozog (1-5 értékű mozgáskártyák/melós), azaz melyik raktár ajtaja elé szeretne kerülni, majd egyszerre felfedjük lapjainkat. Innen a sorrend szerint hajtjuk végre őket. Aki egy másik bábú által elfoglalt helyre lépne a lépéseinek legvégén, az „áttolja” azt a munkást a túloldali üres helyre. Ha nincs átellenben üres hely, akkor visszalép a legelső üres mezőre, bármi is az.
Ez a „programozás” a legizgalmasabb része a játéknak, vajon bejön-e a lépésünk, vagy sem. Kockáztatunk több hordóért vagy a biztos kis bevételre hajtunk?
Egy-egy ilyen fordulóban a megszerzett hordókat hajókra pakoljuk (vagy a már meglévőket összetörjük), az érméket begyűjtjük.
A rendelkezésre álló 4 hajóból, ami tele van, azonnal kifut és kiértékelésre kerül, de a legelső helyen álló mindig kifut, bármennyi hely maradt még rajta. Bónusz 1 pontot szerez az a játékos, aki egy teli hajó kifutását kiváltotta azzal, hogy utolsóként tett a rakterébe hordót.
A berakodás-kihajózás végén az utolsó helyen álló munkás jelzőjét az első helyre tesszük át, így a következő fordulóban megváltozik a játékosok mozgásának sorrendje (a játék második felében, pedig újrasorsoljuk az egészet).
A megismerése után be is szereztem, mert akkor 2000 HUF alatti korrekt családi játékot vehettem a kezembe magyar nyelven. Nem egy csúcskategóriás gém, de kellemes szórakozás.

I played this with my two young sons (currently 7 and 5) and we all loved it!  It really is a superb game to play with your children.  It was simple enough that my 5yo son was playing independently for his last few moves, and yet there are no random elements but some great opportunities for strategy thanks to the simultaneous action selection and the fun way by which the pieces interact.

Highly recommended as an introductory eurogame for younger children.  Great production values too!

Montego Bay is a light, family style game that not only looks beautiful, but plays well too.  Now, there's not much for strategy here as it's mostly a guessing game, but that doesn't make for a bad time.  While there is the chaos of movement on the pier, there is strategy which exists in placing barrels on the boats.  As for player count, playing at any count other than three is going to make for a less enjoyable time, but the game does function at 4 (extreme chaos) and 2 (though barely).  While it's not a game I'll return to often, it's one I can see myself enjoying each time it comes off the shelf (as long as there are three to play it).

Family game that plays in under a hour. Each round players pick two movement cards trying to outsmart the other players, then gain barrels to fill four cargo holes in an area majority game. That's it, no really, that's it! Of course on the bright side, it comes with a lavishly designed board and beautiful material, which comes in a huge box that could have easily fitted the game several times. But wait, it even comes with a big meeple with stickers on both sides that stands still on the board the whole game. Yeah [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/image/645386/montego-bay?size=medium]Mr. Tally man[/url], I'm talking about you! In short: all chrome, little game, big box.

Hope it makes a fun family game
We werent taken on first play, nice components but no soul in the game - we did a 3 player but my wife thought it was annoying, not fun (she did loose!) After a few plays we found it to be "ok" - and surprisingly easy for a younger player (nearly 6 yo) to grasp

great pieces.
easy rules. 

PLayed with 2 players.
Seemmed a little lacking.
There is a mess with opponent vibe, and you could spend a while thining about "he does this ... I do this ...but If I do this ...and he does this .. " but we didnt do this. Which I think made it feel a bit worse than it is. But then do I really want to sit thewre and think like this in a game. I dont like chess so why would I like this. 

I do like the way you can fill up the ships in a particular way and it was fairly close in the end but by then my opponent was fed up with it.
He thinks:

Montego bay = Strozzi

It's easy to explain and looks great on the table, so it's a good gateway game. I think it's better than the rating on this site suggests.

I cannot understand the comments about not having control. Sure, there's randomness in the order of the ships and the initial setup, but that's all pretty minor. The simultaneous action selection in this game is certainly NOT randomness (if you think this, try playing it with selecting your cards at random).

However, I can see how the game the game might dissapoint if you payed full price for this hefty box. It's certainly overproduced for such a simple game. Oh well, at least it's not a big box full of air like most Queen games.

Hmmm...a £7.99 special from the Works, so can't complain re value.  This is a VERY nice board and bits.  However my one play so far, as a two player, was simply boring and horrible, with the game requiring a bit too much in the way of superfluous tactical messing around to little real point.  Wont try again for two.  Can see it would be a bit of a hoot as a near random chaotic family 4 player, with all chance of planning, tactics etc removed. Will try out soon and re-rate at that point.

Edit: retreated.  It is indeed a splendid chaotic hoot for 3/4 players!  But NOT a 2 player game.

Ha a Montego Bay ember lenne, akkor az a típusú karakter lenne, akiről mindenki tudja, hogy elég bugyuta szegény, viszont nem idegesítően hülye, inkább szórakoztató, ahogy előadja magát. Kb. ezt éreztem a Montego Bay-nél is: bugyuta is, kaotikus is, meg láthatóan vannak bőven fogyatékosságai, de mégsem lehet utálni érte, az első játék kifejezetten szórakoztatóra sikerült.

Nagyjából félúton van a Ki nevet a végén és a Puerto Rico között. Nem lesz soha kedvenc játék, de amíg elfér még a polcon, maradni fog.

A jól ismert kedvezményes árt mindenképpen megérte, a doboza méretétől viszont kivagyok. Felkerült a polcom tetejére.
A játék maga jópofa, szimultán titkos akcióválasztáson alapul. Ezt a Niagarában nagyon szerettem. Itt valahogy nincs meg az az izgalma a dolognak. A játékos sorrendre kell figyelni elsősorban, és ez alapján kalkulálni. Persze lehet, hogy áthúzzák a számításainkat, ez remek! Érdemes a két munkásunkkal megtámogatni egymást. A gond csak az, hogy pl így a kanyarban bevédheti a két bábu úgy a másik seggét, hogy a játék végéig tuti ott lesznek. Na ez nagy hiba, mert pl én miután vezetést szereztem, ezt megcsináltam, aztán csak azért jöttem ki onnan (biztos 3 hordó + 1 ezüst), mert így nem volt izgi. Persze ez függ a pályakialakítástól is, de ez akkor is hiba. A hajóra felrakodás is tetszetős: taktikázós, kockáztatós, és gyors; pont ahogy az egész játék. Viszont úgy érzem, hogy mindenből kapunk egy kicsit alap szinten, de pont ezért semmiben nem lett kiemelkedő. Csak a doboz méretében..

the art work is beautiful, the components are good quality & beautiful &  but  the 2 player mechanics are dismal.
The 4 colors are divided between the 2 players & some rules are vague  enough so that you have to make up your own specifics. The order of play is set for a long time, providing an advantage for one player that is hard to overcome. There were times I felt as if I were playing RISK...(that feeling when the person ahead is impossible  to  take down  & you're stuck & just want to forfeit the game). We tried forcing the play order so that it was every other turn but that didn't help much. Perhaps with more than 2 players it might be better, but I'm not sure we have the patience or desire to try it after such an epic  fail the 2 times we played it with 2 players.

Simultaneous action and area control game, which Queen have aimed squarely at the family market. Nicely produced, quick to play and although it's simple there is still scope for groupthink, outguessing and some deep analysis.

Gioco molto simpatico e cattivo, anche se quasi completamente ingestibile e ingovernabile. Poche regole e meccaniche semplice rendono il tutto allegro per la grande possibilità di interagire con le mosse degli avversari. 
Gioco che merita per la sua allegria e non certo per il lato strategico. Materiali gradevoli.

A case of decent production values trying to sell an underwhelming game. Two of your guys move around a track, trying to land on spaces that will allow you to get goods onto boats for VPs (each boat has a limited number of spaces with points for 1st, 2nd and 3rd). You choose a movement card for each guy, and everyone simultaneously reveals. Everyone then moves in the pre-set order. Here's the chaos bit. If someone lands on your guy before you get to move it, it gets dislodged and you'll start your movement in the new space. With a small track, dislodgement is rife. Each turn, you have to assess who can dislodge you before you move, guess if they will, play a card that will give you something decent either way, further assessing what your potential end-space might be if people then land on you post-move and dislodge you further. As the only mechanism of the game, random followed by random ain't that great a turn-on for the discerning gamer, and it ain't that exciting for family either given the game goes half an hour longer than the mechanism can sustain. The result each turn could be taken as entertaining chaos if you're set on enjoying yourself, but there's not otherwise much to hang your gaming hat on.

Négy személyes játék, melyben kikötői rakodók vagyunk,konkrétan rumos hordókkal kell megpakolnunk minél több hajót a két emberünkkel.
2-3 játékosnál az első két legtöbbet rakó kap pontot, míg négynél az első három.
Mindenki kezében van 5-5 mozgáslap, melyekkel az adott melósunkat tudjuk körbe-körbe mozgatni.
Ahol megáll a munkás, annak a helynek megfelelő dolgot kapjuk. Jó esetben 1-4 hordót, amit tetszés szerint pakolhatunk a kikötőben horgonyzó hajókra, vagy rossz esetben a törött hordó miatt le kell vennünk a hajókról 1-2 már korábban felpakolt rumot. Cserébe viszont kapunn 1 tallért. Ez azért fontos, mert három tallérért fel tudjuk fogadni a következő köre Lusta Jack-et, így egy lépéssel több áll majd a rendelkezésünkre.
Mivel ha olyan mezőre lépünk, ahol már tartózkodik valaki azt kilökjük onnan, ezért sértődékenyeknek nem ajánlott.

Fun, light family game. Pretty random but really enjoyable. Beautiful components. One of our favorite "family" games because everyone can play.

Um... why? Is this a game worthy of publishing? Not since Queen Games decided to reprint Dschunke have I been more curious as to some of their publishing decisions. Who is the target audience for this game? Three people families who think accounting is fun?

Okay, it's a game that plays best with three and I wish I'd read the rules before picking it up. It's an abstract simultaneous blind worker placement bumping area majority game that's so dry it needs a desert retheme. Can I get a refund now? Sometimes you can be clever with your card selection, but most of the time it's a crapshoot. Barrel placement on ships is uninteresting. Did I mention that the bits are nice? She's beautiful to look at, but there's nobody home.

Despite the rinse and repeat nature of the game it passes by fairly quickly - I don't think anyone cares enough about the outcome for analysis paralysis to set in. I certainly don't need to own it and wouldn't suggest it comes to the table very often.

Rest assured, there will be people who like this game - just not enough of them to have justified the effort and finances involved in producing and printing it. It'll suit gamers who like the numbers and dig the great components. It'll suit family gamers who don't have that many games. Great components can't save this one for me though.

Két jómunkásemberünkkel kóválygunk a hordókat tartalmazó raktárak körül, majd ahol befejeztük a lépésünket onnan átpakoljuk a terület tartalmát a saját színünkben hajókra. A hajók, ha megtelnek kiértékelődnek és többség alapján pontokat hoznak a rajtuk levő hordók alapján. A lépéseinket 1-5-ig kártyákból választjuk és körönként változó sorrendben lelépjük. Ennyi az egész, ezt csináljuk körönként, míg minden hajó ki nem fut a kikötőkből. A termekben, ahonnan kipakolunk 1-től 4-ig lehetnek hordók és esetleg egy pénz, illetve vannak helyek, ahol törött hordók lapulnak, ekkor elveszik adott számú hordók a bepakoltakból. A játék nagyon egyszerű és talán ez is a hibája, mert mindkét karakterünkkel az optimális lépés könnyen kiszámítható valószínűleg még 4 játékos esetén is. És innentől kezdve csak a szerencse dönt, hogy éppen milyen kezdősorrendet sikerült sorsolni a játék elején és közepén. Családi játékként azért el lehet pötyögni vele. A játék doboza hatalmas és a tartozékok is. Felesleges volt ez a méret, kisebben is teljesen jól meg lehetett volna oldani.

This is the Captain phase from Puerto Rico expanded and complicated - you load barrels on ships tactically to maximise victory points gained when those ships depart.
How you earn those barrels, though, is barely one degree of randomness above rolling a die. Half of a half decent game.
Just read that back and it seems a bit harsh, now I recall playing this with my family and everybody roaring with laughter as my butterfingered dock workers managed to drop and smash all their barrels yet again. Also it was a £4.99 birthday present from The Works, so who can argue with that?

RATING: 6.5
1 play, 3er.

A seemingly random/chaotic simultaneous-action-selection area-majority game, but probably a lot less random if you're good at guessing what the other players will choose to do. The initial and mid-game token movement order is random, but thereafter all information is public. So I wonder how important the very first turn is? Can you make up for being screwed by turn order initially? Is there such a thing as "being screwed", or do you just need to take better advantage of turn order? Being last gives you more control, except that you're never really sure where everyone ahead of you will have moved; so maybe that control is illusory? 

Our game was a bit long, but I expect that would improve with repeated play. Not sure, however, that we'll play this much: apparently neither of us are great at guessing what other players will be doing! But really, not a bad game at all; certainly not what I was expecting after hearing relatively bland comments about it!


--- Summary ---
The board shows a randomly ordered group of 7/8 (3er/4er) warehouses, each with 2 rooms containing 0-4 good barrels or 0-2 broken barrels, and 0-1 coin. This is surrounded by a looped movement path with stops in front of each storeroom. Players each have 2 dock workers (Big and Little) which start at opposite ends of the board (off the path initially), and 2 sets of movement cards numbered 1-5 (one set per worker). There are 4 piers, each with a random boat with room for 3 or more barrels. At the start, pier 1 has a "pilot" boat -- occupies space but cannot load goods. Finally, token movement order is set randomly at the beginning of the game: chits corresponding to all workers are placed in a row in random order.

Each round, players first have the option to pay 3 coins to hire Lazy Jack for this turn (if several want to hire him, priority goes to player with fewer VP). Place the Lazy Jack token with one of your workers. Then, everyone selects and simultaneously reveals a movement card for each worker. If you hired Lazy Jack, play an additional card of the same type (Big/Little) as whoever you placed Lazy Jack with. The workers than all move in token movement order, with Lazy Jack moving first. If they land on another worker, they shift that worker to the opposite side of the movement path, unless that space is already occupied; in that case, the moving worker moves backwards to the first empty space on the path.

After all tokens have moved, resolve the warehouses in order from one side of the board to the other. If a coin is present, take one from the bank. If there are good barrels in the storeroom, take as many from your stock and load them onto any boat(s). If you take the last open spot, score 1VP and the boat sails: players with barrels on board score VP based on majority (last place scores nothing; ties will score average of sum of ranks, rounding up). Immediately move other boats forward in the pier track, and place a new boat at the last pier. If there are broken barrels in the storeroom, remove as many of your barrels from the boats (exception: Lazy Jack does not unload).

If there are now 3 or fewer boats in the piers, the game will end -- score all boats and most VP wins.

If not, the boat at pier 1 scores, then sails away (immediately advance all boats and draw a new one). Finally, if you had dipped into the last 6 boats this turn, randomize the token movement order. Otherwise, the token last in movement order moves up to 1st position. Return Lazy Jack to supply, and start another round.

I didn't dislike it by heart. I think it's a good game if played following the general "family game style" feeling. 
Components are excelent, it has one or two rules that I'm not tottaly secured about but it could work especialy with the ocasional player. 
I have to play it again to be more secure about its rating.

Now that I've played it again it's a good game to play if you don't want to burn your mind. It's cool to have it and play it when drinking a beer with friends and laughing about the randomness of your choices (of the results of your choices better said)

Light, but entertaining. Simultaneous card play to move your two workers around the docks aiming to avoid, block or exploit other players’ workers. Get it right, and you're loading goods onto ships for VPs, get it wrong and you're taking previously loaded goods off. Great artwork & components.

RATING: 5
Uninspired pick up and deliver game. The object is to transport as many barrels onto awaiting boats before they leave port. Players have two separate workers to carry the barrels and at the start of each round everyone simultaneously selects a movement for each worker that moves them between one and five spaces. From there the workers find themselves in front of warehouses containing varying numbers of barrels and these are transferred to the boats in order to gain victory points. The scoring, whereby players gain points determined by the number of barrels they've managed to place on a particular boat, works well. where the game fails however is in the movement of the workers, which due to not knowing where others are moving their workers to makes it nigh on impossible to implement a strategy. Some may enjoy that chaotic aspect of the gameplay but others will be frustrated by it.

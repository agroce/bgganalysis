RATING: 1
[I]tl;dr - What you do has very little impact on the game as it pretty much plays itself. Definition of luck-based -- it's funny but more of an activity than a game.[/I].
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

In Unexploded Cow, you're trying to collect cows in front of you and score points from them -- some cows are worth more than others, others give you special abilities -- overall this is a crazy, mad, in-your-face sort of take-that game. 

Unfortunately, it's far too luck-swingy and random, not enough strategy to plan ahead. Fun if with the right people. Altogether, a pretty inoffensive game that's just not my style and wouldn't get played at my house. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quick play, simple tactical options in how you arrange your pasture.  Fun to mess up other players with negative or spy cows.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Our new quick favorite.  We have too many long games and not enough quick ones.  Also uses a pleasantly surprising amount of strategy for a game about exploding mad cows with land mines. This is one of those rare games where I have yet to win a single game, but I love playing it because it is so silly!  Oh, the Mission Creep card is priceless when you know you are losing!

Update: I have won a few games now, and I seem to have a pretty good strategy - which is to spend the least amount of money as possible.  So far it seems to be working!

Decent enough filler, ok for a few laughs with the right mindset. Gets old fairly fast. Drops to a 3 if played with money. Play with poker chips instead.

For our group, this one was a dud.

Anyway, I don't remember there being any real "game" to this one...it felt very simple/random, and not worthy of a second play.

A fun enough game if I'm in the mood. Great artwork and the traditional English names for the cows gets me every time. I'm not opposed to luck in games; I think it adds tension and levels the playing field. But this game feels more like an activity. Fun with the right group, boring with the wrong group.

I used to own the original "white envelope" edition and now own the deluxe edition.  A number of changes were made between the games, notably in how cities interact with the victory condition.  I understand why the changes were likely made.  They certainly addressed a number of frequent complaints other gamers had about the "swinginess" of the original edition, but I think I still preferred the original to the newer edition.  It was more beer and pretzels which for me seemed to fit better with the theme of mad cows blowing up bombs in the fields of France.

RATING: 8
This game has been a great time killer at work.  Nothing better than looking at a picture of a Cow looking down the barrel of a gun saying "Mrr?" which incidentally is the last thing that goes through a cow's mind after being tipped, or so I am told.

RATING: 7
A game typical of the Good side of Cheapass games: light, funny and quick. Line up mad cows in fields in France and roll a die to blow 'em sky-high. (Kinda reminds me of the Dinoclasm wallet I bought earlier this weekend.) Great WWII-poster-inspired card artwork with a funny name for each and every cow.

One of the best of the Cheapass line, at least as far as I've played. A nice balance between the humor of the concept and the mechanics of the game.  And it's plenty cheap!

Cons: I'm not sure how much possibility there is for any kind of long term strategizing, and depending on your mood, the chaos of play can be either amusing or annoying.  

Haven't bothered playing in ages.

Yet another Cheepass game and you guess it, it was part of that first big order. A triumph of style of substance this game has you pitting you bovine hordes against eachother in an attempt to wipe our your opponants herd using combat cows. Sounds funny, and it is, but the mechanics and gameplay are a bit shallow and it doesn't have much of a reply value in my group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played this once so I don't know how valid my rating is. You can certainly have a lot of fun blowing up those cows. The cards you draw have a pretty big impact on what you can do - but I have not yet developed a strategy so clever play may yet win over card draw. Not a game that is very respectful of cows.

This is the 2012 Kickstarter Version...

I'm not really sure what to think about this game... I managed to get it to the table a few days after it arrived in the mail (3/5/2013). My group seemed to enjoy it although it is fairly random and luck based. The cards that come with the game are very high quality but the rest of the components are crap, this is by no meens a $25 game. If I had seen this in my FLGS and played it before purchase I probably wouldn't have bought the game on a price point vs. componant quality basis.

What an amusing concept. British Mad Cows and French Unexploded Bombs from wartimes. You see how they come together send in the cows to hopefully explode the bombs to help out the towns of France. Money goes in and out of the pot as you purchase cows and events and get paid out for your cows finding bombs. Good Fun. 1 Play.

One of the few early Cheapass games I missed the first time around. We got the new version as a door prize at a con. Reminded us of Guillotine (by one of the co-designers), but quite a bit improved, mostly because of the non-deterministic bomb roll adding some mystery and excitement after the card play. Definitely one of my 9yo's favorite gaming experiences.

RATING: 5
This is a pretty fun game at first, but after several sessions some real weaknesses are evident.

First, although the game is playable by 2-6 players, it plays best with 5 or 6. Fewer than that, and by mid-game, the gameplay tends not to be dynamic enough to feel really fun - or fair.

Second, some of the event cards are fairly overpowered, especially when you hit the midgame. One or two lucky draws by the lead player can be enough to render the game unwinnable for the other players under most circumstances. The distribution for the most powerful event cards is same as the mid-to-low-power cards, which - again - makes it very difficult for players to catch up from the mid-game point onwards.

With a game like this, all that matters is whether or not it lives up to the name.   It ain't about fancy bits or "component quality".   If you are taking it that seriously, then you are not the target audience for this game.  This game is all about cows and explosives.  And that's it.   It's wildy random, but there are still choices to make.  Fast, funny, fun, and ultimately a game that delivers what it promises and nothing more.   (The new version in 2013 actually has some nice production values).

What to do with an abundance of cows infected with Mad Cow disease and a countryside littered with leftover mines from the war?  Kill two birds.. er, cows with one landmine.

This is a silly and entertaining game where you raise up your own heard of cows and send them out in the fields to clear out the leftover minefields and collect rewards from the local towns for doing so.

It's all fun and games until someone blows up a few cows.

How can a game about exploding cows have charm?
Okay, how can it NOT have charm?

Fast, furious, and fun, this game looks like someone attempted to cash in on a quick, portable, "family game" craze that never existed. However, it IS a quick, portable, "family game," that hits beats you don't expect and can make for a shouty, card flinging, infuriating good time.

It does have charm, and it makes you wonder if it could have been re-themed to make it more marketable.

Unexploded Cow is a bit of a random duck shoot- players try to collect the most money, and the biggest set of city points.
Both are accomplished by using Mad cows to 'locate' UXBs- if your cow explodes, on anyone's turn, you get $$, if it explodes in your own field you also collect city points towards winning the working stacks of cash at game end.
Not bad, but as described it feels a bit random to me.

Leftover bombs and mad cows come together as you gain money from using the herd to free the towns from the threat. It's hard to get a balanced start, but what makes the game fun is the rolling: a 6 passes the die to the next player, giving them a chance at success. It's fun, easy to learn, has great production values, balances strategy and random chaos… and you get to do more with cows than just eat 'em or drink the milk. Worth the money as a starter/finishing game.

BIG PLUS: speed of learning, mix of strategy and chaos, all ages
BIG MINUS: uneven start to the game

Unexploded Cows was hilariously fun. The idea is to make your own herd of cows and try to blow them up for money. There’s something freaking awesome about blowing up cartoon cows. ;) It has an ante pot you try to win, so there’s some strategy in how many cows you buy, how many you allow to blow up, how many spies or bad cows you place in the opponent’s herd, etc. If you haven’t played this, you should!

The concept is funnier than the game itself. My friends and I have found that the game becomes more intense if you gradually increase the amount that players put in both the pot and the bank. Overall, a decently designed game. It's best used for killing some time (as well as cows) if you're in a major waiting situation.

I have a first edition that I received as a birthday gift from a friend a few years ago. I do not own many games that have money in them, so I went to the company's website to print out the money file. While there I downloaded a PnP copy of the second edition. I printed that edition on regular copy paper and sleeved it with the first edition cards as backers. Now people are trying to trade Deluxe Editions to me for other games. Funny thing is, I still have not played my first edition since my birthday years ago.

We play this game a lot with friends, great for after dinner fun.

The quality of the components lets it down a bit, we bought power chips instead of using the money tokens.

A lot relies on luck and I would have liked the cards to allow for a bit more strategy.

But it's cows and it's explosions so it's a winner :)

Rubbish design.  Would never voluntarily play again.

It usually takes a little bit of effort to "sell" this to a new player, but this is a fun game that has lots of shifts and turns in it, coupled with amusing cards. A semi-regular at the table and great as a game to bring gamers from other spheres across the borders into boardgaming.

It's one of those standard Euro themes that have been done to death, but if you can get past that, it's a light hearted romp of buying and then blowing up cows. It's just draw cards, play cards and roll a die to see if any blow up, and each cow that blows up earns its owner money, most money wins. There's not too much take-that, it's more about what you can play yourself, but there are cards that move whole herds of cows between players so you can't take any of it seriously. It falls squarely in the time-passer category, aimed at getting a few laughs when played with a fun-loving crowd. And for that, it does its job.

Each player is the commander of a platoon of wild and crazy Mad Cows who have been sent to France to uncover unexploded bombs from WWII.

under old edition:  don't allow players to buy cows on the turn they play Mission Creep.  See http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/26999/item/548620#item548620

Note: the new color edition is functionally different from the old black and white version.  Mission creep is fixed, and low point value cities have money/card bonuses.  But other parts of the balance have fallen apart, and the game is pretty much just going through the motions and seeing who wins.

This game is a not very funny joke. There are many games I'd prefer to play that play in less than 30 minutes. I have no interest in returning to this one.

It seems to me that many of the Cheapass titles are good for a laugh the first time or two, but the actual playability is lacking.  I really like the concept of a game company creating inexpensive, unique games, but they still have to be fun!

To much randomness to be a good game. Since you have unlimited money and unlimited cows can be played each round, it is more a matter of getting the right cows at the right moment...
Cheapass has done better with other games. 

Fun cards, and fun theme though.

It seems that many people are misunderstanding and underestimating this game.  It's great fun and there is a lot more to it than meets the eye.  Possibly people are not playing it right, since the rules are a bit obscure in parts.  i don't see this as a kids game at all.

Cute theme (faced with the problems of mad cow disease and unexploded landmines, they decided to kill two birds with one stone) with some amusing art, but very little game to speak of. Place a cow, roll a die. A waste of time.

[Cheapass 2001 edition] {Animal, beers&pretzels; dice-rolling, utility-cards; optimal 4-6p} Unexploded is a funny filler.  It is very luck dependent (random).  The rule is simple. It is a good game for casual play.

The illustration of cards is funny.

Sold June 2011. It was never going to get played here.

6/25/10 Remember to check out Mechanic options and consider options like "Bids go up as the game goes on" see Mission Creep fix: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/26999/item/548620#item548620


3/1/09 Currently play that game ends when last city claimed or one time through deck, although this seems to happen on nearly the same turn. Also remove all "history repeats" to speed up the game slightly. Recommend drawing 2 cards at END of turn instead of next turn's beginning (not in addition), to also speed up game.

12/08 Underrated game on BGG...especially for the price...humor draws you in, but also lots of tactical choices for creative and devious plays...should be called "Exploding Cow" - that's the fun part!

I wish I could find more games like this!

Cheapass games suck, and there's no real way to get around it.  This one is a little better than some, but still not good.  Few decisions to make, almost entirely luck based, overly simple.  Fans of Munchkin or Killer Bunnies may want to look into this, but anybody else should stay away.  The least they could do is put different art on all of the cards, rather than repeating the same few drawings.  Sorry, if you're going to make the gameplay drivel, then the only thing that's going to draw me is the components.  What?  You say that I have to supply my own components?  Hmm, have you seen my middle finger recently?

Cheapass; Europe. Summer. 1997. You and your most creative friends have discovered two problems with a common solution: Mad Cows in England and Unexploded Bombs in France.You've decided to bring these two powderkegs together just to see what happens. And you wouldn't say "no" to a little money on the side. So round up your herd, march them through France, and set them loose behind the Cordon Rouge. If you're lucky, you'll come home rich before Greenpeace gets hold of you.

This joke gets old after about ten minutes. Game play is chaotic and random (in the bad way) and udderly pointless. :P 

The new edition looks fun thanks to the entertaining art, but again, the joke gets old fast and the game is still the stinker it always was.

Seriously, I'd rather play Munchkin.

There are many nice things to say about this game, but "fun" isn't one of them.

Its got good art, its a small box game, the theme is fantastic, all the cows have unique names, the mechanics are fresh and interesting...

But it wasn't fun for me.

Finally a two-player version of the game that doesn't call for a clunky extra phase or a search through the deck to discard unneeded beans. It plays well and quickly.

While this mostly plays like regular bohnanza, I would say that Duell hinges on both players actively going for the bonus cards to make this better than the standard two player variant. If both players try to complete bonus cards, the forced gifting will be more aggressive and, IMO, more fun.

It has a different feel to regular Bohnanza, but I think regular Bohnanza can't easily be made into a two player version. I like the "purity" of the design for the regular game and I like how Duel is a bit more thinky.

I am very happy I can sorta play Bohnanza at two now plus it's a different flavour of it.

I can see why some folks may like one and not be so keen on the other. Duel is more thinky and not quite as fluid to play, and you don't have the fun of the 3+ player trading. But Duel has more going on in a cool way.

I enjoy the Bohnus cards. It's fun trying to match it up and it keeps you on your toes looking out for it and it's a neat twist that you might give your opponent a card that may help you score a bonus. I like the mind games when deciding what card to offer your opponent and the bluffing is neat too. Very cool game.

I am very happy to have both in the collection. There is a reason why the game is still in print after 20 years. I can't think any any other game I have played that is quite like these.

The only negative for me is that both games feel they run slighly long for what they are, 30 mins would feel more the right length but it's very minor for me because I enjoy these a lot. Oh and the instructions could have clarified a few things. Considering the very simple rules I shouldn't have to look things up in the rules forum.

Bohnanza: The Duel is a great 2 player take on a larger game. While I love the original I really think this brings some things to the table that I'd like to see in the original.

7/7/2017 -- Adding this to the wishlist after playing against Doug last night. I think my wife would like it, which puts it on a higher priority automatically. The climbing element that the designers added to the game creates a wonderful tension that works great in this 2-player game.

Physically fiddly with two hands of cards, one which may never be sorted. I didn't enjoy the pattern matching, which is a big part of the game.

I had played the 2-player variant of the base game, but it was underwhelming. It wasn't fun, and we didn't even finish the game.

There is a two-player variant in the Ladies & Gangsters expansion, but it looked very similar to the two-player variant that I had tried There are "Bean Mafia" AIs that sounded interesting, but I wasn't sure if it was different enough from the variant I played to merit the USD $15 for the expansion. Since Yuan already had that expansion, I didn't bother getting it.

When I asked on reddit about The Duel, the two-player variant of the base game, and the Ladies & Gangsters variant, another redditor said that he preferred Bohnanza: The Duel to either of the other two. He thought this game was more interactive than the base game variant. In the Bean Mafia variant, he said you basically just avoided two bean types, but otherwise felt like the base game variant.

Really enjoyed my first play of this as a filler at a game convention and immediately ordered.  Enjoy traditional Bohnanza with 2P, but this will be a great 2P to add to our collection with the forced offer, bean progression (like Lost Cities) and instant goal cards.

This has become our favourite card game. It's charming, has great length and flow, plus the "gifting" part is a nice variant of the typical trading phase of the regular Bohnanza games.

Is this the best two-player version of Bohnanza? Probably. You have plenty of that hand and tableau management tension that makes the original so great. The trading decisions are more interesting than in the original two-player variant, and the addition of bluffing makes this phase more exciting. However, the offer row and pattern scoring are a bit hinky and the turn flow is more complicated. I just don't think it's possible to make a Bohnanza duel game that is as much fun as the original with 4 players.

RATING: 7
Bean trading for two! This a very surprising variant of one of my favourite group card games. Card holding and cashing in remain basically the same, but planting becomes a bit more complicated to keep players flexible. There's a bit of bluffing if players wish, and a bonus system where players try to match card distributions across both player's fields. Very interesting game, glad to have a two player version of one of my favourites.

45-60m, 2 player. < 5 plays.

Forget all the former attempts to make a 2 player game out of Bohnanza (La Isla Bohnita, Al Cabohne, High Bohn - they didn't work at all) - but with this one Uwe succeeded at last!!! Unimaginable how much fun it brings when you're making your (venomed) gifts to your opponent. And it's really entertaining constantly looking after your bo(h)nus...

Initial impression. Also own for iOS. I like the gifting mechanism. I'm not sure whether there's a bit too much luck with the Bohnus cards. 

Can be used to play regular Bohnanza up to 5p. (RGG edition of regular game includes additional cards for more players; Amigo edition uses the same 104 card deck included in the Duel version.)

The mechanic of offering beans is interesting and has some depth to it. I also like the trade off between hoarding a large number of beans to satisfy patterns vs. harvesting quickly and cashing in on some easy coins. However, the actual process of matching bohnus card is quite fiddly and adds downtime to the game.

Quite tactical and enjoyable game. Gifting works brilliantly since your opponents doesn't know if you are gifting because you have to or you are trying to manipulate them into completing your objective. Other than that the game is very similar to original Bohnanza. Also, I enjoy Bohnanza and you can play that with this edition so it was a plus.

Teljesen jó kétfős változat, a kötelező ajándékozás, illetve az ajándék visszautasítása ajándék felajánlásával érdekes interakciót visz a játékba. A célkártya ötlete nem annyira újszerű, de a megvalósítása rendben van, viszont a szerencse szerepe érzetre nem olyan kicsi. Persze ez egy rövid kártyajáték, ahhoz képest nem rossz a tervezhetőség, kiszámíthatatlanság mértéke. Kicsit annyi csak a bajom az egésszel, hogy amíg az eredeti játékot változó körülmények között is elő lehet kapni, ezt a kétfőssége miatt nem, viszont kettesben nem nem valószínű, hogy a Bohnanza Duellre esik a választás.

Still felt like the original Bohnanza.  Some hard decisions since you can now stack higher # beans on lower # beans, but that means it will likely take more beans in a stack to get to the next coin.  Want to play efficiently.

Overall: a great 2 player game with high levels of direct player-to-player interaction. The entire game is about negotiating with your opponent to help mitigate the effect of luck-of-the-draw and it works beautifully.

Pros:
* Fun!
* Captures the feel of multiplayer Bohnanza.
* Tons of direct player interaction in the form of trading (with the option for bluffing). You also have secret goals and will find yourself frequently trying to manipulate your opponent into satisfying the requirements for your goal.
* As in Kingdom Builder and Carcassonne, the game works just fine whether you play nice or mix in some good natured spite. Example: Even if you could benefit from the "gift" on offer, you can chose not to take it and try to force your opponent to harvest early or change plans to satisfy your secret goal.
* Unlike multiplayer Bohnanza, the game ends after a single pass through the deck so there's no mid-game shuffling.
* Quick setup and cleanup.
* Portable

Cons:
* [Minor] It's a pretty large stack of cards so shuffling can be cumbersome and because it's a set collection game, it's important to shuffle well.
* [Minor] Sleeved cards don't fit back in the box. If you use penny sleeves, they're too wide/tall. If you use premium sleeves, they're too thick.
* [Minor] While I noted it was portable, the game does take up a fair amount of table space.

Loving it so far. Back in 2012, I wrote a comment for "Nile DeLuxor" where I stated "this is what I wanted 2p Bohnanza or Coloretto to be". Well now Bohnanza: Das Duell has regained the throne for what I want 2 player Bohnanza to be. It feels like Bohnanza in that you feel the tension of giving away something that you know your opponent wants vs. having to suffer the negative affects of planting it yourself. On top of that, the Bohnas Goals elevate the game beyond just simply trying for the largest field of matching beans. Really enjoy this one.

Being a huge Bohnanza-Fan, I was sceptical when I heard about this game. I still was unsure after I played the game a couple of times. But after a handful of plays, it turned out, that I REALLY like the offering-mechanis (that replaces the trading of the original game) in combination with the objective cards. I still prefer the original game, but Duell actually makes the game enjoyable with 2!

If you want Bohnanza but only have one other person to play, this is a great game to fill that itch. The gifting mechanic is great as there can be a lot of back and forth until someone bluffs or bites on getting a card they may or may not want.

So my one play did not impress me. I was mainly curious about the gifting/bluffing mechanic that supposedly supplants the trading aspect of Bohnanza. It didn't shine. In our single play, we never had a need to bluff as the costs seem particularly high. Our offers also never extended more than once. I failed to grasp when exactly bluffing is useful. Most of the time, I had cards that I needed to get rid off. So by offering them, my opponent usually either takes it or offers a card back. At this point, unless I absolutely hated the cards, I would generally harvest and plant. 

I believe part of the reason for the lack of tension is that there are three bean fields. Unlike the original two fields plus one more paid field, there three fields really reduced the tension of the gifting as I felt I always had one field available for harvesting.

I will have to try the original rule of only having 2 fields and paying for the third.

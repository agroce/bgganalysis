I'm having trouble getting my head around this one.  Most of my games are slugfests in the middle of the board while waiting to draw the perfect card.  I'm giving this one a rest for the moment but I do look forward to when I pick it up again.

Never really was motivated to play it again.  A bit too clunky for me.  Traded.

RATING: 7
A very comfortable solitaire gaming experience, best suited to competitve play where bluff and agression will impact in eqaul measure.

Quality components but be forewarned of a game board comprising 4 loose cardboard map sections forming a Chess-sized playing field.

A game that hasn't seen me cheering as the action unfolds - unlike the superb mechanics creating the fog and chaos of combat as "Commands & Colors Ancients". Yet, if one can overcome the immense abstraction built into this title - a satisfying time in game will be the result.

There's a lot here to like and certainly some depth to savor over. It's easy to teach and plays fairly quickly. The one thing I'll be watching out for in future plays is with the low number of units it seems fairly easy to track how many cards your opponent has used for some key units and therefore figure out when those units are less of a threat. Also, the leader cards are key and certain placements become safer in the absence of leader cards by your opponent since leader cards are the only way to allow multiple units to attack a single enemy unit. Overall, the game has a similar feel to Memoir '44 with a nice period theme although there isn't much in the way of linear warfare here. But overall this game is a bit of a step up from Memoir '44 and I'd say that's a good thing.

This is not a game for serious wargamers, but at the same time serious wargamers can manage to have some fun with it especially if playing with not experienced players. It is a game that works well as introduction to some basic concepts of wargaming and has a variety of options that makes it playable over time.

I really enjoy tactical games Manoeuvre has fun combat and terrain effects. But I'm fairly divided about how much I like the game. Hand management plays a little bit too big of a role for me, to the point that there can be some crazy extreme swings of luck. The factions are also a bit too imbalanced in my book, although they do offer unique decisions to make when playing each deck (which is nice).

This game is brilliant. I would describe it as half way between chess and command and colours ancients, and the best part of both games at that.

I had some reservations as to how good this would be, but it is a real gem, can't recommend it highly enough. 

After playing at least a dozen games of this now I absoloutely love it. Currently my favourite game.  Only closely approached by Commands and colors ancients and conflict of heroes

Oh I quite like to play with a hand of 6 cards rather than 5, reduces frustration a little :)

Its a low complexity card driven wargame. Feels a bit abstract. I liked how fast it is to setup and play. Has enough depth and tactical decisions. 8 different armies are included. Armies are not balanced. France and Great Britain are superior. Not very satisfied with the components. It is an enjoyable wargame.

RATING: 9
This game is one of the best wargames around, as it is very simple to set up and play. The period covered is Napoleonic warfare, with players selecting one of eight possible nations (Britain, France, Austria, Prussia, Spain, Russia, the United States, and the Ottoman Empire) and battling the unit counters across a board comprised of four map tiles arranged in a 2x2 square. Movement and actions are often dictated by the cards in your hand, of which each nation has a deck of 60 cards, corresponding the the eight units each nation fields, as well as several actions.

Most games can be played in one hour and teaching someone to play is quite easy, as the rules are short and relatively simple. My only complaints would be a lack of either baggies, or a divided tray to hold the counters and card decks, and, the small size of the decks can make them a bit tricky to shuffle. 

Manoeuvre is an amazing game that will delight players with the many options for conflict and play. It is one in a long line of outstanding games by GMT Games.

RATING: 8
Very nice filler with a wargaming theme.

You learn very quickly not to box your units in situations from which they can`t retreat or might get attacked by multiple enemies.

I just don't see much point in having so many different armies in the base game. You really only need France and England.

 Fast and light wargame with many strategic possibilities. It's not so simple as it seems, also many boards and army make this game very replayable. One of my favourites to play with new wargamers.

i think this game finally gave me the experience i had wanted out of memoir 44.  fast setup, simple rules, quick play.  i like the benefits, drawbacks, and even the quality gap between the armies for differing experiences and built-in handicapping.  i think the designer makes a great statement when he says he'd rather play his opponent, not a game system.  i keep having landslide games, though, and it would be nice to have more back-and-forth.

Played 2 quick games French vs Brits and Austrains vs Turks. Good Fun!

On 3rd play have begun to appreciate some of the deeper strategies of this game with use of diagonals as blocking positions and creation of kill zones for the enemy. Elements of Chess, checkers and my old favorite, Campaign.

updated to an 8.

Very long legs.  And if you embrace the "negatives" below as positives, in essence making it an "abstract", then this is easily an 8.

-----

A game I want to like more than 7.  There is a lot to like for my taste.  Abstraction with immersion, unique armies, simplicity leveraged, etc.

The main problem is the decks.  First, they are non orthogonal wrt unit types, so you really need to learn a whole deck to play it right.  Fine if the game was hobby-in-and-of-itself material, but it isn't.  It is more than filler, but it is not rich enough to be its own hobby.

The other problem with the deck is that you go through the whole thing.  So you know a paralyzed-by-no-card unit early will come alive later, at the expense of lively units now.  That is all fine game design wise, but in this case it tends to break the immersion and theme for me.

Still, there is enough good here that in spite of all those negative words, I still rate it a 7.

I finally got to play it and it's much better than I thought. My two or three turns in an abandoned VASSAL game left a poor impression but F2F the game moves along nicely and is much better than I thought.

Fun little game.  Surprised at it's popularity, considering how picky some fans of the era are.  But maybe it is because Eurogamers think that they are playing a wargame.  It seems like it can be a little long when you are stuck not doing much.  Decided it was boring and traded it for some OOP games.

Japan vs Spain (Spanish Victory, this was the first game decided on units destroyed.)

Here's the thing kid, just because you can't attack with a unit doesn't mean you can't THREATEN to attack with him.  They don't call it "Maneovure" for nothin you know.

A fairly light game and a good introduction to wargames in general.  There's a built in handicap system for veterans to give newbies a chance (all armies are NOT created equal).

I've yet to see the play time come close to the "60-90 minutes" as advertised.

First 2 games.  The game has a lot of promise.  The game has pretty simple rules except for the combat part.  The game takes a bit of time getting used to since you can only move 1 unit and initiate one combat per round.  The "slowness" of the game takes getting used to and the fact that you can only actions when you have cards give it a more sluggish feel compared to Eurogames where you can almost always perform actions.  Also the card system mechanic is interesting and much to be explored since the game ends when both players exhaust their deck yet you want to go through your cards to find the cards that you want to use now.  So far this is my pick for the light-wargame niche.  This is much better than Memoir '44 because this game has virtually no setup time, shorter playing time, all balanced scenarios, and so far less luck.  
Initial Rating: 8

RATING: 1
If anyone who was involved in the design of this game is offering a rating, it should be removed; it is hardly objective; let those who pay something for it, and who have no stake in it, rate it.  I see that the system designer, Joe Roush has given it a ten, along with another geek, who has one game listed as owned--this one--which he gives a ten.  This has a less than pleasing odour about it.

For GMT, this is perhaps the poorest set of components I have seen.  Flimsy and cheap--to sell it cheap?--seems to be the order of the day.  It is not a wargame; it is nothing like a wargame.  It is just another card management game with a pasted on war theme.  The units are too few.  The board surprisingly bland.  The card choices too thin (oddly, this matches the physical card quality).  

The only redeming feature will be if it sells well and helps to keep a great game company in business.

Played a few games solo so far, and it is a lot of fun!  It delivers exactly what the designer set out to accomplish- more than an abstract, less than a simulation.  Lots of variety in the armies and terrain tiles, interesting deck management mechanic, fun fog of war elements.  Takes a few turns to a few games to grasp how the deck management works, and to understand and enjoy the endgame mechanic.  Recommend as a light filler that takes some time to finish (hour or so) and is geared to the wargamer.  Also, enough armies and tiles to have multiple games (up to 4) going at once using one copy of the game.

2 player greatness!! This game is unbelievably fun! Be warned, the components aren't that great. But boy ohh boy, the gameplay far outshines that. There is a great deal of strategy here as you have to figure out (based on the army you use) if you should try to eliminate the other army or try to take over areas on their side of the board. Gameplay is very simple card play with dice rolling for combat. I love this game and will always play it if asked. Can't wait to try the expansion!!

Tentative rating.  As many have said, this is really an abstract game with a war theme.  Having said that, the game really lives up to its title - it really is about maneuver and the careful use of specific units to achieve victory.  This one may go up if some wargamers I know like this.  On the other hand, it may go down if it grows repetitive with future plays.  UPDATED:  I had to mark this one down after repeated plays.  It's just repetitive and dull for what should be an exciting and interesting theme.

Solid intro wargame, no doubt! Very quick and easy to learn/explain rules. I love the huge amount of variance available with the terrain as well as all the different armies and most of them are just different enough to make it interesting but not so much so that any one army will have a huge advantage over the other.

Manoeuvre is amazing.  In many ways this is a light wargame, like Memoir, and in many ways it is a fleshed out abstract.  Unlike Memoir, I could play this every day, as the setup time is quick and the control is much tighter.  The balances are devious, and can be countered at every turn by smart play on your opponent's part. Run through your deck to get the cards you need, while possibly hastening the end of the game?  Or take your time, giving your opponent a chance to cycle their deck?  Most of the time, you can only count on seeing any particular card once, so knowing when to hold or throw a card away is key.  Since there are only 5 cards per unit in the deck, you can keep track of your opponents opportunities, although not without some effort.  The armies are asymmetrical, but to how great an extent I can't tell yet.  I usually lose, but I've had games where I came within a point of victory with half the units of my opponent, so you are never out of the running if you play smart.  As far as two-player gaming goes, this is close to the pinnacle.  Well worth the expense if you find it.

Played this 3 times at a local gaming event. My opponent said that he thought the game was benefitting from low expectations, in that people weren't expecting much and then when the game actually works and has some interest, it was sucking them in. I agree, sort of. Manoeuvre isn't flashy, but there *are* clever bits to it, and there is more subtlety than it first appears.

I enjoyed my games of this, but I don't think it's a "buy" for me. It's very abstract, which means it's really playing more in euro-land - and the competition in that space is harsh. Manoeuvre is basically a card management/cycling game, where you need to get the most bang for your card play buck, know when to cycle and when to hold out to try to get card combinations. There is also a clever bit in that when you cash out cards for a big attack, it leaves you vulnerable to counter-attack, which is neat (although somewhat mitigated by the fact that this is a game where you draw and discard at the *beginning* of your turn rather than the end, which has something of a slowdown factor). Anyway, all that's OK, but there just isn't a lot there, the theme doesn't stick much, and it's a touch on the long side with some pacing issues at times ... and then it runs into the buzz-saw of competition from 2-player "euros" like Blue Moon, Race for the Galaxy, Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation, Lost Cities, or the various GIPF games (just to pick a few), where it gets promptly slaughtered. I don't think Manoeuvre is bad, and it will find a niche amongst wargamers, especially to play with younger gamers, but speaking as someone who enjoys both wargames and euros, I don't see this finding a niche in my collection, especially since I own Memoir 44 and C&C: Ancients. Both are longer and a bit more complicated, but both actually feel more historically authentic as well and are a bit better-paced and with somewhat more diverse strategy elements. It's close - I want to like Manoeuvre, and if I had much more gaming time available it would get play - but not quite.

As an addenda, the cardstock for the maps for this game is really too thin. GMT has moved to nicer cardstock for so many of their games, I hardly need to use plexiglass anymore, thank goodness. But the paper-thin maps for Manoeuvre are too easily knocked around, you almost need a specially-cut sheet of plexi for it. Which is not good. These should have been the same stock as the deluxe maps.

While it's certainly not really a wargame, Manoeuvre is a really nice and simple battle game of hand management and tactical maneuvering.  Everything from movement to battle is very simple and enjoyable and I can definitely see the rating going up as I explore all of the different nationalities' decks.  I can really see this appealing to people, such as myself, that enjoy a Memoir '44 depth of wargame.  Also allowed me to coin the phrase "this game is the King's Dragoons!" thanks to the title of one of the British armies.

Well I am not a big wargammer, in fact I could live happy never playing one again. True as that is I still get some pleasure out of them. I own a few wargames (Memoir 44, Battlelore, Axis & Allies, Band of Brothers, Duel of Ages) and try to find games I can play with my son as well as with friends. This game is fun and will play well with my boy. I have played a couple times and enjoy it so far and can see it getting played a few more times. I have a freaky friend who loves wargames and this is one I will play with him.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After one play, I think it is an entertaining light wargame, bordering on abstract. As with most movement-based games, I find the first game really just an exploration of the mechanics. Decision trees are just so dense in movement-based games to really feel like you can jump right in with a strategy. Add to that getting to know the army decks and you're talking about a very uninformed opinion.

That said, I found the cardplay surprisingly intriguing. The choice of flushing your hand to get the right cards and combos versus working with what you've got to maintain game-end control is an interesting tradeoff. The dual victory conditions make the cardplay that much more interesting. The asymetry between attack and defense is interesting. Attack is easier, but the consequences of failure are much greater. Defense is more about making a stand in the appropriate place and trying to ensure that you only need to retreat if (when) you lose, thus drawing your opponent into a poor position.

All this said, I don't see this game rising particularly high on my ratings. For movement-based games, I much prefer luckless abstracts. The luck in this one, which I understand appeals to wargamers as a way of capturing the many uncontrolable aspects of command, just seems to be too much for me to want to invest the time and effort to become profiecient. I'd rather study chess openings.

I just like this game.   It sets up in minutes.  A lot of fun tension as you gather cards and look for opportunities to crush your opponent. I've played four times, and screw up about four rules each time.  Last game we didn't advance after a kill.  Prior to that we combined attack strengths with Volley and Bombardment.  But the games were still lots of fun.   

My sons, ages 8 and 11, will play this with me.   It is going to take me a long time to fully explore each army and learn different tactics.   In my last game I sent the cavalry up the right flank, even though I had no unit cards, because the deck was getting low and I knew they'd show up soon.   Wasting someone who can't retreat is very satisfying.  I'd love to have a steampunk army.

I could play this game five times in a row.

Update: traded, but probably shouldn't have.  Because this took two hours to play and there were lengthy errata, it just sat on my shelf, whispering "two hours, two hours" until I traded it (by mistake) for $25 of netrunner boosters.  Bummer.

Not hugely historical, but what a super little game! Much, much more fun than I'd anticipated. I spent several happy hours just pottering through the card decks to see how the designer had given the nod to the historical armies.

Not only is it an enjoyable 2-player game, it's also possible for multiple players to play several games side-by-side out of just the one box.

RATING: 7
Nicely designed and wonderfully balanced, highly under-appreciated light wargame that captures the flavour of Napoleonic battles very nicely. 

Tactics, card strategy and luck all play equal rolls in the outcome of a battle. The 4x4 oriented any-way maps are a stroke of genius and the game setup mechanics (1st player chooses and sets up map, 2nd player picks nations, 1st player choose nation to play, 2nd player chooses map edges, 1st player sets up, 2nd player sets up, 1st player starts) help balance out any pre-set scenario inbalances you might find other wargames. 

Gameplay is fast, fun, and tense, and this is something you could play every day. After playing Manoeuvre only twice I have to say that the strategies involved—unit cards offer different attack types and strengths even for the same unit, for example—and delightful simplicity of this game make the much more popular Memoir 44 seem naive and simple. 

Highly recommended ... one of a handful of lighter wargames to introduce the genre to non-wargamers.

RATING: 7
I often use this game to introduce people to war games.  The components are well done and the rules are simple.  The four piece maps offer a variety of tactical situations, and the armies really do play differently.  Everyone with whom I have used this game as an introduction to war gaming has enjoyed playing.  It can be frustrating when you can't seem to find the cards you want to take advantage of a weakness, but it works that way for both players.  Generally a fun, if simple game.  My main criticism is that the cards are very small -- but they really have to be in order to fit them all in the box!

Easy to teach (5 minute explanation required), but a lot of things to learn.

A great game, but remember that the forces are unbalanced - make sure you pair the forces appropriately (or, as we do, feel free to handicap the more experienced player by giving him or her a weaker force). Just by way of example, in our last game (playing the weaker Austrians - or was it Prussians? - against the french, even isolating and trapping 3 enemy units I could not pull out the combat advantage to take them, and just lost the game. But it was still great fun!

Just upped this to a 10.  There aren't many games I've played 15 times in one year that aren't fillers that I still ADORE.  Lightish and quick both to setup and play, which fills a nice niche.  Lots of hand management aspects to it since you only have 5 cards and you need cards to attack.  Rules aren't tough to read although a detailed combat example would have been helpful - even though the rules are clear some aren't necessarily intuitive (extra unit cards etc).  (Old comment, left for amusement: After 3 plays in so many weeks (a rarity for us) I upped my rating.  I foresee this getting played a LOT.  It only loses points for having a little bit of a runaway leader issue with the attrition victory, as a player who has lost troops is more likely to draw hands that have nullified cards in it.  This is minor though, I still love it for having an ULTRA-FAST setup and short but meaty playing time. )
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really hits the sweet spot between wargame and Euro.  First play only took about 90 minutes; should be more like an hour subsequently.  The rules are very simple but you do get some interesting decisions to make.

It was a great choice for two old grognards to play late at night when we were kinda zonked.  :)

UPDATE: Played again in a more lucid state of mind, this time 4 players at a table playing 2 battles simultaneously.  It was still a great time, and now I really see how differently the various armies play, so I'm upping my rating to a solid 8.

The only real flaw here is the lack of balance between the strong armies and the weak ones -- unless one player is truly clueless, a weaker army is going to need a lot of help from the dice to win.  I wonder if the decks could've been set up with better balance.

I had such high hopes for this one, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The reviews compared it to Commands and Colors system crossed with Chess, but the only similarity to chess is the size of the board.  It is just as luck ridden as Memoir 44, and about the same complexity level.  However, the game components are a million miles inferior in every way - I mean, what's the idea with the paper thin board?  I believe I would always rather play Memoir than this, so there is no need to keep Manoeuvre in my collection.

Just bought and not played yet, looks interesting.

Update: Just tried it out. Nice little gem of a game. I'm not sure what to classify this as, it's marketed as a wargame but it does have a certain Eurogame feel to it. Rating might well go up with further plays if the different nations do indeed play out differently. I think it's a bit too hard to knock out enemy units, perhaps that's the plan but it would speed up play if it was easier.

Much better second play made me up my rating. Fun game! The only weird thing is that artillery seems to work in reverse. Rather than soften up the defenders before attacking you use it to knock out already flipped units.

Update: Another play lowers the rating again. Simply too slow. You flip a unit, the opponent flip it back and so on. Needs more action and not just collecting full hand combos. Doesn't really feel like a wargame, more of a set collection game so you can hit that enemy unit with a full 5 card combo. Not impressed any more...

Update. Sold it.

Two players (although theoretically eight can play four games at the same time) battle each other in a Napoleonic era battle.  Super light, almost chess-like, wargame where players move their pieces across an 8x8 map, and attempt to eliminate/take territory off the other side.  Cards are used to initiate attacks, or strengthen the attack/defence of the units involved.  There are around 20 special cards in each deck too, allowing the eight nations included to have their own feel.  Very simple rules, interesting card play, and very quick playing time.  Eight (!) decks of cards in the box, along with 24 geo-map tiles to construct the battlefield.   It won't be for everyone, as there isn't a lot of "meat" here, but I found myself really enjoying it.  Good fun.

The rules are simple (although the rulebook stumbles by not  including a single combat example), and the play is fast-paced but the game might be a wee bit long for what it is, although it really quickens up with experience.  There is a good variety of feel between the many different armies that come in the box, which helps.   Maybe not as much variety as say Star Wars: Epic Duels, but still there's some.   There's a decent amount of strategy and hand management, and this game has gotten better with more plays.   It's very unique.

This is a genius design if you ask me. The mixture is a bit historical, a bit abstract, a bit hand management and a bit of dice chucking. Each of these elements is put in at just the right amount to where the game is streamlined and efficient in what it does. This is a game that I think more people should be playing and more attention given. It is a game I want to be playing. My gripes are cosmetic wishing the tiles were thicker and double sided. Also variants to allow more players would be welcome because it has the same issue for me right now as every other two player game which is it never sees table time.

I found this to be a pleasant diversion. I was looking for something light and short with some depth, and this seems to do the criteria justice. I do think it goes on just a tad too long for a game of this weight.

I must admit I don't understand the comparisons to chess at all, other than moving one unit per turn on a 8x8 board. 

The "only one unit moves per turn" rule means that the game can suffer fromn what I call "Gazala 1942 syndrome" where a unit or two ends up at the start line and doesn't get moved for the longest time, because there are always more urgent issues needing attention (just like the Italians in AP's Gazala game). 

The combat resolution is more random than I was expecting based on the "chess" and "abstract" comments. Not knowing what cards your opponent holds provides even more randomness than the dice in many cases. The fact that you can only hold 5 cards at a time means strategies are fairly limited. Still, the game certainly rewards skillful play, so I don't mind the random aspect.

I'm pleased with the production quality overall. My tiles weren't warped- well, barely, but nothing that a couple gentle reverse flexes couldn't fix. The artwork is very nice, the unit art in particular, though I'm not crazy about the ultra simplistic terrain art. With better art on the tiles, I think the game would have created an even bigger splash than it has.

The rules were very well written for the most part. We did encounter a couple ambiguous spots, but nothing major.

Overall, this game reminds me a lot of home made miniautures rules that my friends and I used to dink around with back when we were 10 and 12 years old... and I don't necessary mean that in a bad way. It's kind of nice to have something quick and easy to fall back on when you're in the mood for something wargamey... but not really serious about the time, space, or brainpower commitment. I for one think it's nice to see GMT trying out lighter games like this, Blackbeard, and Conquest of Paradise.

Manoeuvre is like a hybrid between chess and a war-game, and based on a couple of run throughs and one play I'm impressed.  With loads of maps and 8 armies there's lots of variety and it's the kind of game that doesn't bog down with too many rules leaving players free to strategise and play.

I was hoping for a light combat game in the same vein as Summoner Wars.  I guess it is, but Summoner Wars is just infinitely more interesting.  One annoyance I have about this game is that the factions are not balanced with one another.  The designer himself admits to this.  There is a lot I could say about it but it just didn't do it for me.

3th of October 2011: The more I play this game more I like it. It is perfect for what it tries to be, a simple game that is simple to teach and quick to play. Just note that to truly enjoy this game move away from Britannia - France as quickly as possible unless you enjoy a slug-fest.

Original: Good package, but a bit too abstract and still not abstract enough.

RATING: 6
Pretty enjoyable after one play, but the question was raised - is there really all that much strategy here other than setting traps where forces can't retreat?  I would probably prefer action points or something, over a blind hand from a huge deck - it felt like my options were randomly and significantly limited.  Still, fun with dice and I love the inclusion of all the map panels and different armies.  Reminds me of a light wargame crossed with a CCG, with mixed results.  I'm not a CCG fan, so there's part of the problem.

Imaginad un ajedrez en donde el movimiento de tus piezas dependiera de cartas y el resultado de comer a una pieza dependiera de varios dados. Eso es Manoeuvre. Un wargame que se siente abstracto y azaroso. Que en la Guerra no todo es predecible, que admite cierta gestión de mano...pero al fin y al cabo el "comerse a una pieza" sucede tan a menudo que la sensación de azar es demasiado grande. Decepcionante a pesar de lo que prometen la cantidad de ejércitos disponibles.

This is pretty neat!  I haven't gone through all the armies yet, but I can see that the game is flexible enough to allow for interesting confrontations regardless of the matchups.  I like the setup as there are neat choices right there and then.  The terrain will have a significant impact so I'm guessing that with experience, the subtle tactics will shine through.  Nice clean, compact design.  Does perfectly well what it set out to do: fast battles with tactical depth.  I may count this as a Combat Commander follow-up to close out an evening.

RATING: 7
Update:  Played more and have bumped it up.  Great little game you can play with anyone.  At first I was put off by the clunky 'manovering' in the game with only 8 units and the grid boards.  I tended to pick it apart in simulation terms.  However, after several plays all it think about now is the excellent hand management and card play aspects.  It's just plain fun.  You want to hug those stupid leaders when they finally show up to do something!  It has the childlike glee of holding a handful of killer cards and knowing something is going to get hurt...    

As an early rating I'd give it an 7.  I'm sure it will rise as I play it more, the card combos can be really fun.  Unloading all five cards in a combined assault on some poor guy is lots of fun!  I like the Napoleonic theme and the bits are just fine.  The cards are small but sturdy and you get eight decks!  Good effort here and a nice, simple design.  On the down side I think it takes longer than it should.  

I buy light wargames but it's hard to get them played.  It seems like I play Euros or bigger wargames, depending on the group.

Interesting game but too light to maintain my interest long-term. Finally the need to have an appropriate card in hand to initiate an attack with one's own unit felt too artificial.

RATING: 8
Being a great fan of the Command & Colors gaming system, Manoeuvre is positioned in the same category: a 2 player historical wargame that plays within around 1 hour.

But despite preferring the ancient Roman and Greek period to the Napoleonic age, Manoeuvre could possibly be brought to the table more often, for the following reasons: much easier to explain; super fast to setup and to get things back in the box at the end; more asymmetrical play (I tend to prefer asymmetric games where players have to choose different strategies); slightly less luck factor (I enjoy luck, but in moderate bits); possible more tense endgame situation with the last card deck determining the end of day/battle.

The only things that I miss in the box (or in fact in the rules) are the historical scenarios. I know that some non-official scenarios can be found here in the bgg, but I was used to the fantastic C&C official scenarios.

RATING: 7
Part chess, part CDG, part Napoleonics. You play on any 4 4x4 boards so the field changes every game and the armies include the usual suspects: French, Austrain, Russian, British, Prussian and American. The cards generate the number and type of combat dice used and can help with attack, defense, re-supply and leadership, among other things. I played it twice. Each game takes about an hour or so. We played with the 4 map pieces under a sheet of glass so the map warping wasn't a probelm. However, the game could fall between two stools: not enough detail and favor for a grognard but to many rules for a euro. Taken as a filler, it's fun and fast playing.

RATING: 7
Fortunately, Manoeuvre was better than I was expecting, though it is exactly what I was expecting... if that makes sense. I was expecting a game that has a lot of luck: from the cards your draw to the dice you roll. But still I found the experience tense and fascinating and there is still a whole lot of interesting game-stuff going on to make this title very decent. I like that you have the freedom of movement; to jockey your units into position for that hopeful time you draw the right cards. The HQ cards also give you some good flexibility when you need it. The variability in strength and attack/defense of all the units is simple, but clean and makes the game flow very nicely. And of course, the deck differentiation between all the factions is very interesting (though I wish they were all sorta balanced with each other - there are decks that are definitely stronger/weaker than others). Manoeuvre sorta feels like somebody was in love with Stratego as a kid and wondered if they could take the core idea of moving units around on a grid but actually make a more tense and involved game out of it while keeping the complexity to a minimum. In that, the designer totally succeeded! It's also funny how reminiscent of Star Wars: Epic Duels this feels, though I'd take Manoeuvre over that one (Epic Duels is still a fun game to pull out every now and then). Overall, I can't actually think of another game that quite plays like Manoeuvre, and the fact it is simple, tense, easy to play, moves at a great pace and yet feels like your decisions matter (even if lady luck can help/screw you at the best/worst times) I feel like this one has a place in any light wargamers collection!

May 08 - 1 play.  Interesting little game.  A bit 'abstract' as it doesn't relate to any specific battle.  Basically each side plays one of 8 nations in a 'balanced' battle.  I'll have to play more to see if there is enough meat to keep me interested.   It will start at a shaky 7/10.  Likely to go up or down.  Played second game and it was enjoyable, jury is still out.  Beginning to see the depth and differences in the armies, which are subtle at first but become quite profound.

Believed to be 1st edition, counters clipped. Box in good conditions without wear marks. All cards have also been sleeved (the sleeves are worth more than the game!). My experience is that the game is light and enjoyable, but draws a lot on luck (dices & cards). Also, the game did not come with some historical scenarii, even though some are available on BGG.

EDIT: after a few more games, I am on the fence. To keep or not to keep?

An instant classic. What it lacks in realism it makes up for in originality, playability, and a wealth of tactical options and situations. The special decks for each power do a good job of representing the strengths of each military from the Napoleonic Wars and add a lot of period flavor. The addition of the Americans and Turks is a good touch.

You guys that rated this a 10 should really try playing other games.

Definitely overhyped and I'm tempted to knock this down to 6 to counterbalance the exaggeration.  Nevertheless, it is a decent game.  Nothing overly new here.  Battle mechanics similar (although simplified) to games like Upfront, Combat Commander, Battlecry.  The no-diagonals rule makes this abstract and gamey.   No simulation here.  It plays in the style of the Napoleonic period with cannons and calvary as your best friends.

A pleasant surprise. I was all geared up to hate this game owing to its abstract nature, the crappy map tiles, the tiny cards, and my inherent anti-GMT bias ... but instead I came away converted, eager to play again, and scheming for a way to pick up a copy in trade. The rules are accessible, the game features more movement than I anticipated from reading the rules, and the cards provide just the right degree of chaos without bogging things down in special events and exceptions. I thought the game had considerably more period flavor than I had been led to expect. Play time was about perfect for a game of this weight (down to an hour for our second match). In my first game, my British survived a late French surge to win on points (thanks largely to some crappy dice from Le Emperor), while in the second my Russians were shattered by the Prussians after our early cavalry offensive ran out of momentum. I can see where I could entirely enjoy exploring how all the various nationalities fight and interact. Well done.

Cool game.  Seems to be well balanced with simple gameplay mechanics, but with a fair amount of tactics.  Each of the represented forces plays very differently due to the mix of units and cards.

I was a skeptic at first, but a few plays made me a believer in this quick hitting tactical game.  (Note:  I routinely have my ass handed to me, but enjoy the floggings.)

The components are okay (some goood art on the cards and counters) but the map board (which consists of 4 grided pieces assembled to form the playing area) causes some problems during play.  We constantly were pushing the board pieces back together during the game.  Minor gripe - the fun factor of this game far outweighs any negative!  A small piece of plexiglass resolves the issue, but makes transport difficult.  I'm working on a board (gridded to accept the tiles) that will hopefully correct this problem.

New board complete making the physical game experience much better, IMHO.

Next on the list - replacing the cardboard counters with wood pieces.  Two armies complete and working great.  Worth the effort.  Finished the remaining six armies...images coming soon.  **Done**

I'd forgotten I'd put this on a preorder with a distributor while it was out of print, then unexpectedly received it when the GMT reprint arrived, after I'd decided I probably didn't want it.....but now I'm glad I have it. I probably have a broader definition of what makes a wargame than others do and I think this is one, but only barely (the absence of historical scenarios pushes it to the abstract end of the genre). Still, there's a lot more under the bonnet in this one than is first apparent, it presents plenty of tactical challenges, plays quickly and is highly portable. It tends to fill time for me at the end of a session of longer games but I don't think "filler" does it justice. Neat little game.

You get your guys, hope you draw some good cards, stomp around and generally fill up your time with this wargame filler.  I'd rather take back 3 of my previous plays of this and have another play of a longer and better wargame.

RATING: 6
Manoeuvre is a nice, straight-forward, yet highly abstracted light wargame with asymmetrical sides. Between card-play, orthogonal grid movement, dice rolling, and a few terrain features, the game is easy enough to get into (as well as set up/tear down). The inter-play between the two end-game conditions make the card play interesting -- do you work to tear down enemy units or make them retreat out of your territory (or further back into their own)? 

Yet I am not wholly enamoured. While the decks are unique to each faction, the variety of units and how they play isn't as pronounced as in the Command and Colours system however, which is equally as light and accessible. There are other duelling dice-chuckers which feel fresher and more alive than this one that play in the same time-frame, require a similar dose of negotiating terrain, and have a similar weight (e.g., Claustrophobia). Lastly, with respect to the manoeuvring, given how relatively uniform it is, I would almost rather play a proper abstract (or euro-abstract).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Graphics are really bad! (time for a reprint), but the game is good.

At first glance this reminded me a lot of C&C Napoleonics, because of the card-driven nature, the easy terrain features & the basic troop types.
But the differences lie in the details. While not being overly more complex Manoeuvre allows focusing more on tactics simply because you're able to move any one unit you want. And the card value difference is not as high as in C&C.
Also there are much more combo & bluffing opportunities.

The hand-management is still there but it has more intricacies due to the asymetrical decks (each faction has it's own) & the end condition (if the 2nd deck runs out, the game ends). Also you can simply discard your whole hand if you don't like what you have.. gives you more options & doesn't simply leave you with a bad hand.

Lately this game feels more like an abstract to me.. wich isn't bad, but it's not really scratching my war game itch..

Battle Cry meets Chess. A VERY abstract wargame with all the random downsides (card draw, die rolling) and none of the historic interest.

However, the unbalanced armies just dampen my interest: if two players are of similar skills, you have to take matched armies (like British vs French), or you'll have a massacre.  With asymmetrical win conditions, it would have been possible to have all match-ups (like British vs U.S.).

Got to play this with the designer.  Lots of clever innovation.  The card sets are great, and give a somewhat stereotyped view of national power, and attribute them to the armies of the era.  Fast playing in the mold of Frederich, C&C Ancients and Bonaparte at Marengo.  A slightly more innovative combat system (instead of a pseudo crt) and a stronger emphasis on linear warfare would improve the game somewhat.  Still, a fine new light wargame.

I liked Manoeuvre more than I thought - it is abstract with minimal historical content, but it's fun and quick with some subtlety.  Nicely avoids seeming too generic by having the different decks/nations play differently.  

But even though Command and Colors is a completely different experience, the games fill the same niche for me, and I'd usually prefer to play C&C Ancients.

Just received this from a math trade and opened the shrinkwrap.  I'm still recovering from the fumes.  Chinese printing sucks as usual, the ink smells toxic as hell, the cards are small and ultra stiff, but the gameplay looks cool.  Once I get a chance to try it, I'll add something more informative here.

I like it a lot as a light game!
It is just a little bit more random, than i usually like in a wargame!
It captures the feeling that your only 8 pieces is a whole force with diversity in terms of strategy between armies!
With 8 different nations included and many components enough even for tournaments,the game guaranties a lot of replaybility!

RATING: 9
Eight armies. Each army has eight units. Each army has there own cards with their own strategy. Lots of dice. Fairly easy combat rules.

Wipe out an opponents army (five units) or when both decks are exhausted to have more control of your opponents side of the board for a victory point victory.

The board is made up of four squares each a 4x4 grid square with different types of terrain that help to envision the time frame of this game. there are 24 different 4x4 squares which adds up to a whole lot of unique set ups. By the way you can orient the squares in any direction which adds up to too many terrains set ups to calculate.

Good movement rules. Foot soldiers move one square and mounted move two squares.

There is enough in this game to appeal to non wargamers, for many non wargamers do not consider this game to be a true wargame. 

Game set up is quick. Game is easy to pick up and put away.

A nice, nice semi-abstract game that does, if it doesn't fully evoke the Napoleonic theme, give you a better sense than, say, chess, of advancing and retreating armies. Simple enough to learn quickly, the game offers plenty of out-of-the-box matchups in the form of eight armies to put in 1-to-1 combinations. I like the asymmetry of the forces and the fact that at least one just isn't very good by design. I'm not sure this really is going to squeeze down into the 40-60 minutes the rulebook promises, but it's still a lot of fun. It's as much about husbanding limited resources as it is about actually attacking and defending: Lose five+ units, and the game's over. Go through your deck too fast, and your opponent can speed through to the end. The two-ways-to-win aspect creates some good dynamics--you don't want to just retreat and retreat deeper into your side of the board. And do *not* get surrounded.

Some issues: I've only opened two of the decks (the recommended Britain and France). The British cards are totally fine. The French ones are so "bouncy" through curviature that I doubt they'll ever lay flat, and they certainly stack poorly. The boards are on the "bouncy" side as well, but not to a degree that inhibits game play significantly. Would I pay a lot more for better components? Probably not, although I'll be annoyed if I have a bunch of "bendy" decks. Beyond that, I think GMT chose wisely in its price-to-quality ratio. Their main problem here is that it's a crossover game that engenders certain higher expectations in some quarters w/r/t components. My other issue is the amount and location of errors. I presume the rulebook'll get redone, but there are some noticeable problems there as has already been noted on the FAQ. Worse are the card misnamings (affecting the French) and what I think is the confusion regarding the Withdraw card being limited to ambush/assault despite saying it's played in "combat." There's just a certain level of imprecision all around that mars this game enough that it's not going to get its full due, because the gameplay itself is very, very good.

So my wife buys this and wants to give it a try. I hope it will be different than the Command and Colors I loath so much. It is. She plays the Turks, I play the Spanish. She races ahead with her cav - and starts beating up on my infantry. I cant get any cards. I keep tossing and drawing. Eventually she kills an infantry unit. The next turn I pull three of that units cards. HATE THESE TYPES OF GAMES WHERE I CANT DO ANYTHING UNLESS I HAVE A CARD!!!!

Played the game a few times.  I ended up trading it away for the following reasons:  1) it's an abstract game--there's attempt to replicate actual battles, 2) the card play is interesting, but not enough for the game to stand on its own, 3) game play time was longer than I thought it should be.  If I was interested in low counter density Napoleonics, I'd probably try the Victory Point Games "Napoleonic 20" series, and for card play, "Chainmail" by Worthington games which does attempt to use cards in actual medieval battles.

I've played 5 times.  The first four times were the Brits vs. the French.  The fifth one was the Prussians vs. the Americans.

The play of the game is great fun.  I like the slightly wonky abstracted battle sequence.  I am especially pleased to have the interaction of 8 different armies to explore.

I am annoyed by the flimsy maps which are badly curved.  I have plexiglass to put over them, but this inhibits taking this to a friends house for casual play.

Update: Increased rating from 7 -> 8.  After more plays I find this game has more subtlety than expected.  Various strategy and tactics to explore.  Multiple armies in the box offers a good variety of play. Easy to learn, easy to play.  Not sure how much depth or re-playability this game offers.  Game is abstract and theme is thin.  Don't expect a primer on Napoleonic combat from this game.  Game tactics and strategy have little in common with Napoleonic warfare.  While it seems as if I am "damning with faint praise", the game fills the niche of an "easy to learn, quick to play" wargame.(March 2008)

I love a good game of chess, so when I read that Manoeuvre was based on a chessboard layout, and that it was a positional game with a bunch of armies you could choose from I was really excited to play it. Unfortunately, several things stop it from being a great game. First, the tiles are bad. They are ugly and thin. They shift on the table constantly, and they don't make an enjoyable playing surface. Second, the armies are ridiculously unbalanced. You can only really play each army against a few of the others, otherwise the game will result in a blowout. I do enjoy playing it, but I was hoping for a better experience.

Finally! A war game that you can learn in 10 minutes and play in under an hour that actually good enough to want to play over and over again.

Simple, straightforward abstract where you seek to manipulate your 8 units to either destroy five opposing units or own more opponent's territory at the end of the game.  Interesting CDG with a slightly different deck for the 8 different armies.  There definitely seems to be different flavor and styles to the different countries' army decks whether it be in the type of units or the varying amount of certain types of cards.

RATING: 8
Fun and fast family-style wargame as it is fairly abstract, though this grognard enjoys playing a game whenever possible. Not all of the eight armies are completely balanced, but with experience a good game is assured. Multiple boards, armies, and card draws provide nearly limitless replayability. I don't get too competitively worked-up over this one, but I do love to play it.

RATING: 7
Simple to set up and easy to teach.  I can jump right in Manoeuvre within 10 minutes after brief reading of the rules and explanations by someone who had experience with the game before.  The real names of the leaders and units add somewhat to the historical flavor but this is it.  Otherwise, it is quite hard-wired by the deck of the respective sides - French, Russian, British and American. Everything else can be completely random and it is only meant for fun with a sort of competitive degree.  It feels like you are living in a fantasy 18th to 19th century with random generation of the battle map.  Initial force composition of the side is fixed.  The presence and arrival of the leaders can be erratic.  If you see it not as a wargame but a chess with card management, you are pretty up to it and it really delivers what does it intend to do.

RATING: 7
After watching a game (Vassal tutorial), gives me a feeling similar to Memoir'44.

Memoir'44 looks nicer (minis, nicer looking map,…), with a game length which is supposed to be similar.

The setup is lighter than the setup of Memoir'44, though. I don't really mind setting up Memoir'44, though…

The scenarios in Memoir'44 are also a plus. The stats on the cards require some learning, whereas the strength is known, in Memoir'44. This makes Memoir easier to learn and remember (but maybe a little less rich).

Conclusion: I think I will not buy it, it does not look original enough, compared to what I have.

After playing it:

I found the rules too complicated for how the game plays: they contain many cases that don't typically show up in a game: complicated exhaustive checklist of things to do, that actually rarely matter and obscure simple principles)

The game play is a little too simple and flat for my taste: move, maybe attack by rolling dice. Rinse, repeat.

WOW! This game is fantastic. Fun, immersive, challenging decision space, incredibly replayable, very portable, easy to teach, easy to set up. This is an amazing example of elegant design: the whole thing is a war game distilled down to its essence. Simplified terrain, simplified movement, simplified unit activation, simplified combat...and yet the decisions are still compelling and interesting. Every army of the 12 available still feels different, despite each army having 8 units and 60 cards. This is everything I want in a game. The only thing missing is playing with more than 2, but at least there are enough bits available to run several concurrent matches if there are an even number of players. This is a great game, and a great value for the money. Just amazing! This is now a must-have in my collection and I will NEVER part with it again.

I felt being a commander in a completely new battle. I have to study where and when to have combat, wich units to use. In fact there is a lot of choices you have to make because you can only have 5 cards in your hands and they must be enough to attack, to defend, to rally... Quite interesting situation. On top of this, you have to add that you cannot just repeat another Marengo, Austerlitz or a known battle, because every battle here is different!!!  You have no historical battle to get ideas from, but to get inspired everytime you play Manoeuvre. Very challenging game!

Weird little game - ultimately a card game with wargame trappings.  There is indeed a different feel to the various armies but you are so far removed from the history that playing the game actually feels distasteful - if I can't learn any history from it, why am I killing people for fun?  
I haven't had such thoughts for decades, but this kind of pointless near-random game tends to bring them to the surface. (4.1.2011)

9: This is a fun game. It's very aptly named as maneuvering the units is the name of the game. Flanking, advancing in a line, all the good stuff from Napoleonic era is represented. The differences in the different nationalities adds flavor and replayability. The mapboards generate interesting battles; the terrain gives just enough of a bonus without slowing the game down. The card play is difficult and challenging, presenting the player with many choices. Manoeuvre is simply a fast, fun and yet surprisingly deep battle game. Bonus: You can play up to four simultaneous games with the included components! That way no one's left out!

5/23/08: 8 is my tentative rating after one game.  The rules are very easy to learn - my first game, we just skimmed them (my opponent has read them once before, but not played) and was then able to use the reference sheet for the few rules questions I had.The game itself is sort of an abstract wargame; it doesn't simulate Napoleonic combat very well, but that's not the intention.  Rather than a "real" wargame that has a subject, this game has war as more of the theme, and it works beautifully in resulting in a game that scratches a wargamey itch when you're only in the mood for a light game.  Fun, fun game that I look forward to playing many many more times.

Excellent game. The tension of the cardplay, the maneuvering of the pieces, the luck of the dice roll, the simplicity of the rules... it all adds up to a game that I find super enjoyable.

RATING: 5
Played twice. This is a harsh rating, but this game just didn´t appeal to me. It´s not a Napoleonic wargame, and it´s too slow and too random to be a good abstract. I would really need to be persuaded to play this one again. It works mechanics-wise, but I´d much rather play something else.

RATING: 8.5
If I were ever to describe a game as "elegant,"  Manoeuvre would be it.  The abstract nature of the game feels appropriate given the Napoleonic theme.

Though players are at the mercy of their card draws, the game is very deterministic.  Almost every phase of your turn is a tough decision.  With all the different possible board layouts, and army choices, it's very re-playable without even having scenarios to play.

RATING: 8
Simple, abstract, but fun. Despite the die-rolling and card-drawing has somewhat of a chess-like feel due to the importance of, well, maneuver. First game took 90 minutes and I could see that going down with experience. Modular terrain and the differences between nations should help keep the game the fresh.

07/20/13 Played the introductory scenario (French vs. Brits) in two hours. Manoeuvre is an odd duck, from the spelling of its name to its game play. The units are historical, yet the battles are generic abstracts. This detracts from the enjoyment of most historical gamers as it pits unlikely foes like Americans versus Austrians or Spanish verses Russians circa 1812. The game only has one preset scenario, for beginners. All other battles have the "designed by committee" aura as the map tiles are laid out pretty much randomly, and initial unit placement is up to the players as well. The tiny cards are almost impossible to shuffle, though their text is clear. The counters look nice, while the map sections are flimsy with amateurish art. The game aids are clear, and from glancing at the rules they seem fairly well done. The listed one hour play time is a lie, like most GMT time estimates. Bank on twice that long unless one player's dice rolls are heaven sent and end the game quickly. The game does have maneuver and there is strategy in which cards to play from your hand. Yet overall it left me with a feeling of "eh". It has mediocrity written all over it. I'm willing to play it again, though not too often as the game drags.
09/14/13 Played a "regular" game (variable set up, chosen factions); Ottomans vs. Americans. It took (only) 80 minutes mainly because my die rolls and card draws were well above average and I won relatively quickly. My opinion of the game improved as I saw the real game was in the card deck, not the generic board and almost generic units. 
03/08/14 Played another "regular" game; Russians vs. Austrians. It took two hours! My opinion of the game improved a bit more (even though today's game took forever). So I raised my rating from a "5" to a "6". Now I sorta look forward to playing it again to see how the last two nations work out.

8 after 1 play. Fun game, reminiscent of BattleLore with an easier set up and specific cards for battle. Similar end-game with 5 units that must be eliminated. I look forward to more battles.

Update: staying at 8 with two more plays. The play time has gone down significantly with more experience (~90 minutes - 45 minutes). This is a really fun tactical game. I may even like it more than BattleLore (although I haven't really been able to explore it thoroughly).

British V. French. French have won all games thus far. Usually wait for the opponent to overextend a unit or two and then cut off and weaken.

RATING: 5
Seems like an okay light (very light) card wargame. I'm not sure how much skill is involved, as your card draw can really hose you. There is certainly some room for good card plays and attacks, though. If you don't mind the feeling of being mostly at the mercy of a card draw, this game will be enjoyable.

Some of the combat results seem a little out of whack. If you don't have a defensive card, you are screwed. I get the attack limitations, but it seems odd that units don't defend better.

As much as I love wargames and long for some relatively short, light wargames for my travel box, this is not going to fit the bill. I'd much rather play Pocket Battles or even Tank on Tank.

RATING: 4
Very light, quite abstract.  Seems to be more of a card management game than a game of "manoeuvre" warfare on a battlefield.

Game is merely OK... and there is good differentiation between the armies, and some subtleties to play.  

However, given how abstract this game is (this is a "war themed" game, not a "wargame"), there are many other two player euros/light wargames that I'd rather play than Maneouvre, especially given the not so short playing time of 1-2 hrs.

This game is by no means an historically accurate portrayal of Napoleonic Warfare. However, it is a lovely, simple 2 player tactical card-driven wargame which allows for repeated and variable play. 8 nations are represented each with a different profile (Russians are hard to break down), the Turkish have lots of cavalry, the Spanish use more guerilla tactics). The rules are simple and can be taught in a few minutes; solitaire is possible but not as much fun as the real thing. A thoroughly enjoyable Euro-influenced wargame.

What a beautiful game ! Not looks, there ok. I mean gameplay. I've tried pretty much every tabletop battle game around and after reading the minute, petty, detailed rulebooks it's left me somewhat cold. If you want tactical battles this is the real deal. Strangely I played this single player to test the rules and was completely riveted to see the outcome of the battle. Oh 8, yes 8 armies to command =D

Who knew??  Even from the rules online, it looked like a pretty basic Napoleonics game that could have gone wrong.  Mais au contraire!  The simple yet elegant rules and the fascinating cards really make this game a gem.  Armies are very much given their own identities and strength from the units on the board and the cards in the Nation decks.  Gameplay is a mixture of bluff, nuance, controlling strong points, and striking hard where possible.  There are a few counter-intuitive rules niggles, but basically I expect this to be another hit (even a sleeper hit!) for GMT and to be followed by an expansion or three.  Bravo, Jeff Horger!

It's ok - nothing special. Now, call this a gut-instinct rather than something i actually know for a fact, but something about the brou-ha around this game on this site seems pushy and organised. For a fact, I DID NOT find the rules well-written and clear; I found them vague and irritating. The noise made about this game seems disproportionate and I would rather play Spires of the Kremlin and Opertaion Spark and other sadly overlooked sets than this overrated kiddies' game. Sorry, but there it is.

First impression (2 player) : It's a simple wargame and I like how elegant it actually is. You need cards to attack but movement is free but limited.

An abstract wargame that's even more fun and intriguing than I thought it would be.  Although weak in historical accuracy, the game still has the feel of the Napoleonic era.  Very replayable, as  the game comes with a plethora of armies and map tiles...the combinations are almost endless...

For the abstract/quick nature of play that the designer clearly aimed for, I'd say he's hit his mark.  This isn't high strategy or anything, but for a quick wargame it does a good job.  It's easy to learn, which may help introduce people to wargames.

RATING: 9
I don't play chess and am not very familiar with that age-old game, but this basically seemed like an idea to take the concept of chess and, using a 19th-century theme, make this into a fun, simple but challenging, wargame, with the bonus of having 8 separate national armies, each with its own particular ratings. In that regard, I think the game is brilliant. Also, the game is aptly named, as it really is about manoeuvre, and terrain, along with manoeuvre, can play a crucial part in determining who wins. 

The rulebook, except for a few proofreading gaffes, is pretty understandable, although with better editing it could have been clearer, plus text on the cards basically explains how and when cards can be used, and the game itself is terrific. 

I started playing in February of 2011, and it's the first game I've taught myself in a long time that I could hardly wait to get back to in order to finish a game I'd started. Plus, the time it takes to think about and carry out moves simply flew by. I liked this game right away, and although I don't play it often, I really enjoy it every time I do. 

My complexity rating is medium, mainly because I found it hard to get a grip on the scoring rules, plus although I could also rate it light-medium complexity, there are a lot of rules to keep in mind at first. 

My only problem with it is in the packaging, pricing, and the use of small-format cards by the publisher. Given that they used small cards (2 1/2 x 1 3/4") the 12 x 9 box could have easily come in a 6 x 9 size and still fit the components, with the exception of two 8 1/2 x 11, double-sided reference cards. Also, the insert is absolutely worthless and might as well be pitched, which in itself is a waste of cardboard. A well-designed insert could have allowed one to store all the cards and square, thick cardboard playing pieces (8 per 8 armies) in it. The small format cards are difficult to shuffle yet easy to bend, and I don't understand why, given the size of the box, the publisher didn't simply include standard size playing cards. The interchangeable playing board pieces are in color, but on standard coated cardstock. In all, I'm looking at at a game that seems closer to $40 in price than $55.  

Purchased new, February 2011. Raised rating from 8 to 9, April 2015, as the more I play it, the more I like the game. What I eventually did was play all 8 armies against one another, round robin, tracking wins and losses. Along the way, some upsets happen, but I think on the whole the stronger-rated armies will tend to win the most often.

RATING: 10
I must admit I was a bit disappointed when I opened the box on this one. The components, especially the board and the dice, seem cheap, however, luckily, the game itself is grand. 

I bought it due to my interest in the Napoleonic Wars, but it's more like a game of chess than a wargame. Sure, cavalry move faster than infantry and can pursue, but artillery are completely abstracted off the map into unit bombardment cards - if the unit the card refers to is dead, then you can't use the bombardment attack. 

Either side can win by killing enough enemy units, or controlling squares on the enemy side of the board. The gameplay is all about card combos, so with only 5 cards in your hand and 8 units on the board, you are never going to have the right cards to do every possible move. The most powerful combo we have found so far is using leader cards to use adjacent units to support attacking units - this is the surest way to win combat by the 4-1 margin required to auto-eliminate the enemy.

Being obliged to follow up a retreating enemy most of the time can also leave your attacking units exposed to counter-attacks, but then often the defender won't have the cards to attempt this counter-attack either, so there's a bit of push-your-luck here as well. What I did like was that, unlike most card-driven wargames, you don't restock your hand until the start of your next turn, so this may leave you out on a limb if you spend all your cards in your turn and leave nothing to defend yourself with in you opponents turn - this mechanic makes for hard decisions.

I enjoy the speed of the game and the quick set-up and play, so this is an easy 8 (and now a 10 as I get more games in)

The key to enjoying this game is realising that manoeuvre is the most important part and not getting bogged down in combat-this was the biggest initial hurdle for me!

Now I'm playing the game with the express goal of pushing back my opponents and then running rings around them in the hope of gaining additional points in uncontested spaces and it's much improved.

The game is not balanced, but playing the relevant sides against each other provides a realistic result (with the occasional pleasant surprise). So Anglo-Dutch forces vs French is a close fight, Spanish vs French, well just holding off the French long enough is enough to make the Spaniards proud, Austria vs Prussia vs Russia is a free for all (as history pretty much supports).

The decks provide the player with the  military doctrines of the period and the player has to do what he can with whats available.

This is the strength of manoeuvre - a relatively abstract game that provides a 20-30 year period of history to play with, simulating the tactics of the contemporary combatants.

Brilliant game design. Manoeuvre fixes everything I didn't like about Battle Cry. 

The smaller game board is faster to set-up and leads to more unit interaction. The implementation of the leaders is perfect. I like how each unit has its own specific cards, encompassing both infantry and artillery. The inclusion of nine different armies of differing abilities is a masterful stroke for replayability and skill level matching between players.

I love this game. Many players note it has an abstract chess-like feel. After 20 games played, I don't see it that way anymore. I frequently see expanding and collapsing lines, flanking maneuvers and battle fronts rotating just as you would expect in a tactical level combat game.

I can play it with my children. We can complete a game in an hour. All I want now is an American Civil War and a World War II implementation.

This is a great game. The mechanics are refreshingly simple - the challenge lies in using card management and positioning to set up effective attacks. Variation comes from the different armies, which really do demand different play styles, and to a lesser extent from the variable terrain, which provides different positional and tactical opportunities in each board setup.

Manoeuvre is simplistic, relatively fast, engaging, and modular - all within a 19th century wargaming theatre - and that's something that's completely unique in my collection.

The components leave something to be desired, as the cards are small (again), the boards warp, and the chits are basic.  I would have gladly paid more for higher-quality components.  

But a game is not judged entirely on components..

The rules are simple enough, with a few particulars that need to be sorted out.  In short, it's a two player wargame where the modular board is set up fresh every game, and each player commands one of 8 armies. (I'm pretty sure it's 8, or was it more?)

Players first discard and then replenish their cards, move one unit, combat (if they can/wish), and then resupply / reinforce (if they can/wish).  The object of the game is to break through to the enemy's side of the map and hold ground, while commanding 'uncontested' battle areas within your opponent's half.  Alternatively, players can attempt to destroy 5 of the 8 units held by their opponents.

I very much like this game due to its accessiblity, speed, and tactical efforts mixed with the whimsy of dice and the draw of the cards. Each army is unique in its members, as well as the cards that are available.  Some may be stronger with cavalry, some may be stronger with leaders, some may have many more bombardment options available, while some are just plain strong and others are just plain weak.  Either way, there's something for every level and style of wargamer here.

It's not a simulation, so I know that true wargamers will bawk at this title.  It's also very chaotic, so strategists may wish to avoid, but for the rest of us - give it a shot if you are looking for a brief encounter with war.

RATING: 8
A light wargame that should appeal to those who are fans of the C&C series. Hell, if you want something no more difficult than Risk, but offering great game play, this is it. Not perfect but very entertaining.

Note: Though I enjoy C&C Ancients and Battlelore, I play this more often - I can play half a game in the time required to set up either of the C&C games.

RATING: 8
After a solo play it runs pretty smoothly, and is a lot of fun. Quick turns, nice appearance, I can't wait to play this with an actual opponent.

Update: Played twice. It has a very quick set-up time, the rules are pretty easy to learn. The components are good, but getting some plexiglas would improve the board greatly. I like the battlefield tactics, positioning of units becomes important. My first game was about an hour, but my second stretched to two hours, so it can run a bit long. Overall a good light wargame.

A wargame, you say? It's true that I have zero interest in the details of battlefield logistics. But Manoeuvre is highly abstracted (almost to the level of Chess or Stratego) and doesn't attempt to simulate much of anything. It also combines two of my favourite things in games: spatial movement on a shared board and management of a hidden hand of cards. I'm getting more and more tolerant of dice too; there are plenty of ways to manage your odds here and there's nothing quite like the fist-punching drama of rolling a handful of dice for an unlikely kill.

If you like strategic wargames but don't have 8 hour play sessions available, this might be the game you've been waiting for.  Can have a fair amount of luck in when you draw cards, but there is a lot of fun without a lot of time in this game.

RATING: 9
A light wargame - with simple rules but good game play. It fills much the same itch as Command and Colors. 
While it does not cover historical battles,  it does succeed capturing the flavor of the era. 
Each army based on the cards handles different - from the French and British slugfest to Americans having to rely a lot on feint and finesse. Having a limited hand forces you to rely on bluff to hold a line, and the requirement to advance sets the attacker up for a counterattack.
Some good hand management value in the game. The different values for a unit on the unit card combined with the some having bombardment values has you looking to set an opponent up for 1-2 punch.

Good little wargame that might compare a little bit to Memoir'44. The modular board, the random initial placement and number of different country gives it good repleability. There is a litte bit more room to manoeuvre your units than Memoir'44 but your still dependant of your card draw. Two litte anoying thing about the material are the cards. Typical GMT card and the small individual board that warps when you look. Playing time is around 45 minute.

Bon petit jeu de guerre qui se compare un petit peu à Mémoire 44. Le plateau modulaire, le placement aléatoire initiale, le nombre de pays font que le jeu possède une bonne rejouabilité. Il y a un peu plus de jeu pour manoeuvrer ses unité qu'à Mémoire 44 mais vous êtes toujours dépendant de la pige des cartes. Deux choses irritantes dans le matériel de jeu sont les cartes typiquement GMT et les plateaux individuels qui gauchissent à trop les regarder. Le temps de jeu est très bien, soit environ 45 minutes

RATING: 7
This game packs a ton of strategy and thought into a very simple package of components and rules. I think it makes a great filler type war game, although the lines of a Memoir'44, but yet with much quicker setup, more simple rules, and significantly deeper strategy. Hard to imagine that the designer packed so much into so little, but it works out great.

Oh, this game is ok.  Yes, it does have some good strategy ideas.  Yes, the card play is interesting.  I just think there are MUCH BETTER short games out there.  I just does not have a wargame feel to me in the endgame.  Could this replace chess.  YES!  But. . .

08/29/2011: Had not thought about this game until Steve reminded me.  Shows how good the game was.  Rerated from a 7 to 4.  If I want to play chess, I will.  If I want to play a modified form of chess, I will play Dungeon Twister.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating of 7, which I expect will go down.

Pros:

* The game has enough equipment to play four games simultaneously!

* Very compact design: each army comes with only eight units and a deck of 60 cards.

* Game play is far less irritating than Battle Cry/Memoir '44. You can move any unit you like; you're not limited to moving pieces from a certain flank.

* Combat much more streamlined than Battle Cry/Memoir '44.

Cons:

* When it comes to war games, implementation of theme is very important. I find Battle Cry and Memoir '44 more interesting since you're playing on a map that resembles something. In this case, it looks like a chess board with some squares filled with special terrain.

* Attacking is the most irritating part of the game, and what makes Battle Cry/Memoir '44 I think a much better game. In order to make an effective attack you basically must have multiple cards of the same unit you're attacking. Unlike Battle Cry in which you basically have three kinds of cards (left, middle, and right flank), you have eight different kinds of cards, one for each unit. Add this to all the other special cards in the deck and a five-card hand limit -- basically, it's too hard to plan ahead and build a powerful hand. The ability to discard and exchange as many cards as you want at the beginning of each turn somewhat negates this, but then therestri game becomes an exercise in frustration as you spend most of your time discarding and drawing in hopes of a good hand. That particularly annoys me; I want to make meaningful decisions on every turn.

* Because a lot of the game involves combing through the deck to build a good five-card only hand, the game is way too long for what it is.

RATING: 7.5
This is a fun two player game.  The game is easy to play with just enough complexity to cause a person to become addicted.  You start with five cards in your hand and then you place your units no more than two spaces from your board's edge.  Turn sequence is simple.  First you draw up to five cards in your hand.  If you draw a card of a killed unit you discard it THE NEXT TURN (Do not reveal the card to your opponent).  Second is movement (One and only one unit can and has to move with no diagonal movement) Infantry one space calvalry two spaces, no terrain modifiers for movement. Then you attack by revealing only one card.  The defender must now reveal ALL THE CARDS the defender intends to use.  The attacker then adds additional cards.  A leader card is required to use more than one unit to attack.  Dice are rolled, odds determined and results applied.  (Terrain does modify attacks and defense).  Final step (If you have a card) bring your reduced strength unit back to full strength (Use special cards or a card of the reduced  unit to perform this action).  Win by either eliminating five units or controlling (Contested spaces do not count.) more spaces on your opponent's side of the board then he has on yours.  As I said both fun and addicting.  On a special note.  Each country represented has it's own unique strength's and must be played to it's strength.

Very simple with lots of variety here in terms of army choice and terrain... the game is a little too long for a filler and not really meaty enough to scratch your wargame itch, still, it's a good choice for light gaming... great cards, but for the price, the map boards and counters should have been better... my friend made an excellent wooden board with a plexiglass cover to keep the maps from sliding--that makes all the difference

Fantastic little game.  Great fun and different enough then other games of similar weight. Stratigic tension at every turn as players were trying to get the cards they needed or position the units they had. Worth the money I put down on Ebay to track it down!

I think it is small enough to bring backpacking this summer!  We shall see.

Edit: I traded this game away as it plays a bit clunky compared to some entry level war games (C&C, Memoir) and doesn't have enough meat on the bone compared to some medium games.  It fell through the cracks.

Fantastic Napoleonic warfare abstraction. Just in a few simple rules a complex gaming experience is made. Different nacionalities for different approach to the same matter: to win a battle. Of course you do not expect a grand tactical simulation. This one is just an excuse for seting up a fast & fun game to play. Perfect for travelling and introducing anyone to the hobby. No more than 60-70 minutes for any game.

=========================================================

A surprisingly effective and tense abstraction of tactical warfare. We see lines form, flanking maneouvers, exhausted sections of the battlefield, and desperate charges. Really excited about the potential with this one.

I only wish there had been some way to provide prettier, mounted boards. I'd sacrifice some variability in setup for a handsome and functional board.

RATING: 6.5
This is a fun simple wargame using a fixed number of units on each side. Players use cards to launch attacks and recover units who have taken losses. The game play is simple and easy to learn, and the victory conditions provide some challenge with an option to win either through capturing territory or destroying the enemy. Certainly worth playing but there are probably stronger games to do the same thing with historical scenarios.

(6/17/08) - When I initially looked at this game upon its release I was less than not interested in it. After taking the time to read the reviews and investigate the game further I found myself becoming more and more drawn to it. The biggest appeal seems to be the short play time and its way of being an introduction to the wargame genre.

(8/18/08) - [8] - After playing an introductory game and a regular game on VASSAL I find myself very intrigued with this game. Slightly wargame, slightly abstract, all fun. I imagine this rating will increase as I play with more armies and enjoy the vast replayability.

Ein spät entdecktes Juwel (2008): auf einem simplen, schachbrettartig-modularen Spielfeld stehen sich zwei aus nur acht Einheiten bestehende Armeen gegenüber, deren Einsatzmöglichkeiten von einem nationenspezifischen Kartendeck und deren Kampfperformance von Würfeln gesteuert wird. Jede der acht unterschiedlichen Nationen (Preußen, Frankreich, England bis hin zu den USA) verfügt über unterschiedliche Truppen und ein jeweils anders zusammengesetztes Kartendeck; dies ermöglicht das Verteilen differenzierter Handicaps: Anfänger spielen am besten die Franzosen, Fortgeschrittene am ehesten die USA. Ein hervorragendes Einführungs-CoSim, das nach einer Regelerklärung von ca. 10-15 Minuten beginnen kann und in aller Regel nach 45 bis 60 Minuten beendet ist. Nebenbei: Da das Spiel viele Spielbrett-Teile enthält, ist es auch zu viert (2x 1vs.1) oder zu sechs (3x 1vs.1) problemlos spielbar.

I read the good reviews and was looking forward to this one for a while.  Finally got a chance to play it twice at [[Pionek]] in September 2008, and I like it.  My only complaints are:
1. The rules have a few too many unclear fiddly bits that require errata to be sure what is meant.
2. It took longer than I expected.  I hope it will become faster with experience.
It seems in a way like a historical equivalent to Neuroshima Hex: a "wargame" that's really more of a eurogame with a thin theme.  Quite enjoyable.  I want to play more.

2008-11-04: played with a2na, but sadly it's not her cup of tea.  Too explicitly about real historical war, and too much randomness (dice + cards).

[b]Ugh.[/b]  (And I don't mean that in a good way.)

Based on only one play where the leader cards bunched up for both sides . . .

Update -- MUCH better on the second play where I just didn't give a damn about defensive positioning.  The British leaders bunched up AGAIN, but it didn't keep them from winning in a close match against the French.

My opinion of the game has much improved.

The more I play this, the more I like it. There is more to the game than first meets the eye. I'm still working out how different the various armies really are, and to what extent different approaches really are needed for success. However, the fact that such an outwardly simple game is drawing me in in this way is a sign of how fun it is.

I don't agree with the complaints about the components: the mapboards may have been slightly bent, but it is perfectly easy to use them; the boards and counters were thick enough for their purpose. Equally, the rules were sufficiently clear; any uncertain points could easily be cleared by looking at this website or ConsimWorld or through common sense. I don't even have a problem with shuffling the little cards.

RATING: 8
Now after some correct plays I can say that it's randomness isn't something important in the game. I mean You can win even if you have a bad luck. Many people play this game with wrong rules - now I can see its full potential and I like it very much. And it takes exprience to play it very good. I think it's like chess. I played with one guy, 2 times in a row. Spain VS Turkey and then we changed sides: Turkey VS Spain. And... two time I've lost. One 5 killed to zero killed. Second time 1 killed to 5 killed. That guy played this games tens of times. It shows that this game isn't about luck. It's a game about a strategy and tactical movement.

Delightful little game where you do exactly as the name suggests, all in under an hour with minimum complexity. With the deck and troop makeup being so different it also has the legs to make it worthwhile bringing out again and again. I prefer games over simulations, and while I wouldn't want too many games this streamlined, what it lacks in historical scenarios it makes up for in pure gaming fun.

--------------

Update: It just keeps getting better and better. Okay, the whole mechanic is somewhat abstract, but in terms of gaming fun this delivers. I find myself wanting more and with the different ways the decks play on different maps I'm not seeing myself tiring of playing this. Fast, simple and fun.

A superb "light" wargame.  Chess-like in its simplicity and its complexity.  That's a complement.  This has been an instant favourite with the wife and few gamers I've shown.

I swear, if one more person complains about the thickness of the boards or the size of the cards, I'm going to push the big red button and end it all, so help me.

I pledged my cold hard (well, virtual) cash when I first read about Manoeuvre on the P500 list some time ago (has it really been three years?)  I've been looking forward to this quick-playing battle-themed light game set in the early 19th century.

Basically, this is a battle game in the vein of the old American Heritage series. Nobody is going to mistake this for a "real" wargame, but there's more to it than "play a card and move a dude". Actual tactics are involved and some thought will go a long way. And you can't beat the replayability, with all those boards and eight different nationalities to try out with their own quirks.

I have to admit the lustre faded quickly on this one.

RATING: 4
Revised my rating and raised it by a point after a few more recent plays. It's a cute little game.  So long as you block out the Napoleonic window dressing and grasp that you are really playing an abstract, it works fine.  Smooth and quick to play with some thinking involved.  I probably woudln't have bought it had I known it was like this but I've kept it for 2 years and broke it out again for some plays.  I'll keep it. Nice to break up some longer more serious sessions.

Not really a wargame but maybe a good starter for those looking to get into the more intense GMT games.  This is a card driven battle that plays well but is somewhat limited.  The theme will be fine for some but other would probably prefer ancient armies or fantasy.  Having seen only two armies I'm not sure what the other bring to the table.  Another plus is that its not a long game.

While a little abstract, this is a really fun game.  The Asymmetrical countries is very cleverly implemented.  The random boards and different countries make this game highly replayable.

RATING: 7
Awesome 1-2 hour card-driven game. Very tough decisions come up every turn, especially in terms of attack vs. defense, and strategy (holding on to incomplete card combos) vs tactics (trying to draw other cards). Every dice roll is a heart-stopping moment. This is what the Commands & Colors series aspired to be (mechanically, not components-wise). Infinitely re-playable, thanks to the different combinations of game boards, and the uniqueness of each of the 8 nations.

What holds it back? Shitty components (warped paper boards, crappy counters, tiny cards) and the nightfall victory rule. The victory condition makes sense; it's just hard to see who has how many points, and how they are affected by different moves, near the end-game. I use colored beads to make the calculations easier to see and explain to newbies. Still, the bogging down of the game near the end just doesn't fit with the streamlined mechanisms and epic scale of the rest of the game.

UPDATE: I can't believe I missed the importance of board movement in my first play. There's a reason this game is called Manoeuvre, doh. The flanking movements and positioning of units in important spots gives yet another strategic consideration to a game that already features tough decisions by the buckets.

===============

Sold it since the theme isn't immersive enough for me. Perhaps unintentionally, the entirely modular nature of this game makes each situation so interchangeable that an initially strong thematic immersion quickly fades away with repeat plays. Interchangeable tiles give you random maps, generic cards let you command generic units and the possibility of match-ups between nations that never faced each other at the time tends to erase their flags and replace them with generic colors. Manoeuvre is like one of those computer games that offer a "Random Map" option that theoretically offer unlimited replayability. But I'm the kind that wants to play a specific scenario, or recreate the Battle of something.

[3 plays] Cross between chess, a card game, and a simple wargame. Tons of depth of strategy to be explored. Lots of different terrain and nationalities. This adds up to infinite replayability. There's a fair dose of luck, so once you know the rules you can play quickly without getting too bogged down in figuring out the perfect move since the dice will definitely have their say in the result anyway.

Manoeuvre is fun, fast, and the mechanics of movement and combat really works well for this era of warfare. I look forward to experimenting with the best ways to advance and control the field and hand management techniques.

First few plays in and it has been fun. Players place 8 pieces on the 2 x 2 grid boards and move, combat and reinforce these two-stepped units (cards are used to battle etc) in order to either 1) destroy five pieces or 2) Hold out until both card decks run out. Terrain on the board gives cover, attack bonuses etc.

I've experienced different styles of play and a lot of dice luck (not necessarily a bad thing). I'm not a huge fan of the way the nighfall scoring works (leads to annoying VP counting and stalling by trying to wring every last VP from the last few cards).

I'm not sure the different decks & units offer enough variety between them to make me want to play them all. It's hard to peg down this game: if the game goes to attrition victory, it's fun and fast enough. BUT if it drags out into nightfall victory, it tends to run a little long.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Wow, what a great little wargame. Simple, card-driven action depicting non-historical battles between eight different nationalities, and with quick playing time. This might be the perfect light wargame.

I'd hate to call it a true wargame as it felt more like an advanced version of Chess or Stratego.  I certainly don't hate it as much as Combat Commander Europe, but the cards still seem VERY limiting from what little I played of it.  A war-type game that women will play? I've even seen a few of them playing it.

Delightfully designed light tactical wargame.  I really enjoy the interplay of the cards and the combat.  There is some real skill in trying to coordinate enough attacks to be able to eliminate units; wasting too many cards can cause your attacks to be disorganized.  The game has a wonderful back-and-forth flow that creates a narrative.  While there is some luck, it is mitigated by effective cardplay.  I would love to have a copy, as I believe this will become a classic for my collection.

RATING: 7
Feels like M44/C&C:A -- war theme, relatively rules light, dice rolling combat resolution, hand management -- but one step up in depth/complexity. For example, combat resolution is a lot more complicated, with more numbers to add up, 4 types of attacks, and resolution varying based on relative strengths rather than just a simple die roll. Hand management is more interesting as well, since each player has their own unique deck and there is some ability to rapidly cycle through your deck (by discarding cards at the start of your turn). Game play is pretty straightforward and the game should not take too long, which is good in a game where there's so much randomness from rolling dice! I think, though, that there is a lot of room for skillful play (hand mgmt, board positioning) so the better player should usually win. 

I look forward to trying the various nations, in multiple configurations!

Manoeuvre is an abstract game, not a simulation, yet it has a great deal of historical flavor in the unit mix and cards. Each of the 8 armies differs from the others in substantive ways, so there is a great deal of play value as you try different combinations. 

Luck will sometimes determine the outcome, but there are many decision points and a skillful player will win more often than not. The game plays very quickly, and is a great filler because the rules are straightforward and easily retained once learned. I think Manoeuvre will get a lot of play.

Fun and light, plays relatively fast.  I would rate Hold the Line or Clash for a Continent as slightly better and slightly faster to play, but this is a worthy addition to the easy-play wargame realm.  As in Combat Commander, the hand management and card-counting play a significant role in reducing luck and keeping the game from seeming utterly random.

Easy to learn, fun to play, and very replayable.

Manoeuvre was perhaps THE most popular game at Spring '08 GMT Weekend.  

However, I have some reservations about balance as certain nations appear to be too strong or too weak (e.g., US), and my interest has waned.

This is the be all, end all of introductory wargames although it's not really a wargame at all.  It's more of an abstraction than most others, but it's a truly fun game to play.  The mix of hand management combined with the luck of the dice brings some tense and fun moments.  The terrain creates incredible scenarios as players vie for supremacy in one area or another.  I love that you can play a game of Manoeuvre in about an hour including chit chat and messing around.

Based on three plays, I'd have to say this falls somewhere between Command and Colors: Battle Cry and Combat Commander: Europe in fun and complexity. It is not a simulation, but it's a fun game. I've played Battle Cry dozens of times and found it to be the easiest and fastest of the C&C games, and I've played CC:E twice and found it to be difficult to start in terms of finding pacing and tempo (so far, don't care for it much but admit there may be potential after hitting critical mass of playtime).  The first game we played correctly (mostly) on the first try, which took about an hour (which will come down severely next game), and it was a pretty fun experience; the second game took about forty -five minutes, and felt very comfortable. I expect this to get a lot more plays than CC:E.  My suggestion to GMT: make an Introductory Set with four board tiles and two armies (French and British, of course), and sell it for fifteen or twenty bucks.  Then either sell expansions which will slowly build them up to the full set, or just sell the full set.  I think they'd not only make a killing with the twenty-dollar set, but they'd turn a lot of new people onto a very interesting new game.

Plays pretty quickly. The armies definitely have differing feels to them.

I've played twice...as the French vs. the English (which I lost due to ground lost), and as the Ottomans vs. the Austrians (which I won, due to casualties caused).

I've been debating about trying it four players, with two allied armies taking on two allied armies on a 4x2 map.

Love the theme and presentation, but the results of the games often hinge on a low number of low-odds, non-repeatable dice rolls. :( And those dice rolls are often critical (whole units lost or not based on a single roll of 1 or 2 on a d6).

RATING: 9
This is a good solid quick game. It is not a model of Napoleonic warefare except in the grandest sense. I'm not happy with the card size nor the thin nature of the map pieces, but I am admittedly spoiled by the likes of Phalanx games and Eurogames. As far as the standard for wargames (SPI, DG, etc.), its not a lot worse than what you usually get. The rules are solid and pretty error-free for the most part (only a couple of clarifications and minor mistakes on counters and picture in rulebook). The game seems well playtested. 

Positives - The game is a novel idea to mix chess-like board play with cards. The game does feel like a battle. There is enough uncertainty to keep play tense. With components that can be rotated and exchanged, LOTS of maps and with a number of different armies, there is excellent replayability. The graphics look good (though I MUCH prefer the playtest hills posted in the pictures here at BGG).

My 8.5 rating would have been a 9.5 to 10 if the game parts had been more substantial and the cards larger so I could sleeve 'em and to allow easier shuffling. The box the game comes in could repel a tank...wish the maps had been of the same cardboard! 

Edit 3/27/08 - upgrade to 9.  Its a great game, despite the quibble over the production value.

All the simplicity of Memoir '44, minus the cleanness of the C/C system, and the slickness of toy pieces.  Much more historic in look and nature (though I suspect this is only surface, i.e. it is not really historic, it just appears as so), and plays a bit longer than Memoir '44.  It is a very good little game, and gives a much better wargame feel, and does a good job at opening the door to more traditional wargames.

Good 2p wargame. 

It's dead simple for a wargame, yet it is deep. The name really tells what this is all about, and the flow of play is perfect. There is luck in the game, but it is very well managed, near perfect I must admit. The modular map and many armies offer replayability.

The maps are bigger than I'd like, and after a few casualties the armies cannot cover the front. The setting is also putting me off and I'd prefer a campaign system, or more varying battles instead of just the generic open field battle. Right now one mistake can put you in a normal disadvantage, and you couldn't care less about finishing/turning the losing battle.

To sum it up, the game works very well and has both depth and replayability. It needs more scenarios/campaigns, and smaller/different maps to become an excellent game.

Appealing, flexible, and fun; featherweight as wargames go but full of non-obvious tactics and non-trivial decisions. It's also what Myles na gCopaleen called a gory bloody livid bleeding bargain:  your forty bucks buys you eight materially different armies - it'll take you 56 plays to try all the possible matchings once.  It's not a tremendously deep game, but neither is Memoir '44 or Battle-Cry, and this is more fun (and flexible) than either of those.  Its level of abstraction is reminiscent of De Bellis Antiquitatis, and while it's not the game DBA is, you can't get DBA in a box.

Very easy to pick up.  I read up quite thoroughly on the game before playing, and was still surprised by what I got.  Kind of a weird combination of [gameid=9446] and chess.  It's like chess in the abstract movement of your units on the board that slowly get eliminated, but it's like Blue Moon that the game comes with eight (!) different armies, all of which seem very different.  I think this is a wargame for non-grognards, as the things that make this wargamey are encapsulated quite simply in easy charts and clever decks of cards.  Very few exceptions or special rules.

This is an excellent light and quick entry-level wargame.  There are no historical battles to replay but the theme and feel of 18th-19th century warfare is there.  The rules, abilities, and movement of units is very simplified but each nation has its own strengths that need to be considered and played to.  The game is essentially a card hand-management style game with the conflict resolve by dice.  But cards don't just allow for activation of units, they also define the strength and defense the unit.  There's a lot in the box when you consider the number of card decks (480) and plentiful map tiles (24).  Each game will play out different every time, especially since all the armie decks are unique to their nation.  This one's a sleeper you shouldn't miss but beware, if you're looking for great depth and realism regarding Napoleonic era warfare, you won't find it here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A decent game.  Unfortunately for GMT, this is one of those games where their production makes the difference between a really niche game and a more mainstream seller.  It really isn't a war game - it is a combat oriented board game.  With small, slightly warped light cardboard boards, and boring, wargame style pieces, set in 19th Century Europe, its an ok game.  With nicer components and a theme that might grab someone (I happen to like fantasy, but pick a theme that would sell better), it would probably get at least a 1 point boost from me.  Right now, it fits the same spot in the collection as Dungeon Twister, and Dungeon Twister is a much more interesting game.  While there are a lot of armies included in this one, like another commenter, I am skeptical that it really matters all that much which army you take.  The game is likely to feel virtually identical despite the armies you choose.

Different armies battle it out on a grid with obstacles.

Each army has a deck that play to the strength of their units. 

Easy to learn, difficult to master

El único war game (espero que los más puristas no me maten, yo lo considero un war game muy ligerito) en mi ludoteca, se juega en poca más de una hora y deja muy buen sabor de boca.

+ Distant lands.

Didn't really get it I guess on the first try, and havent had the chance to play it since, but I like Nappy period so one day this will get a better look

Muy entretenido y rápido de jugar. No sé si se podrí­a denominar wargame, pero lo importante es que se monta enseguida, tiene una rejugabilidad muy alta, y es muy divertido, ademÃ¡s de darle cierto tono histórico.

RATING: 7.8
Fun game with lots of decisions on how to use the cards. Hard hitting combos and manouevring. Different armies and terrain. Satisfying win conditions.

OK game, a bit long for what it is. Would prefer to dispense with the map-board at this level of abstraction. I think I might prefer something like Pocket Battles to this.

A wargame? Yes and no. The different nationalities and the Napoleonic theme is what makes this game. Apart from this the game has almost nothing to do with Napoleonic warfare. You might just as well have done it for WWII, sci-fi, fantasy or whatever. About as realistic as Titan. And equally fun. If you take it for what it is, it is great.

The best 2-player game ever for me. Tactic, simplicity, war, dice - I love it

Very, very clever. I love playing this with my son. I just wish the cards were bigger.

1/1/12 -- Well, I was wrong.  In the end, the game seemed to be lacking something and, like so many before it, I sent it off into the eBay void in hopes of finding something better.

5/26/07 - Jumped from a 7 to an 8 after 5 or so additional plays.  This game gets quite a lot right, and I wouldn't be surprised to see its popularity steadily increase.

Hmmmm... Rather mediocre first play - not too many surprises came from game play that couldn't be surmised from reading the rules.  Subtleties will have to be uncovered from more plays.
--------------------------
Game looks sort of like the next generation of the Commands & Colors level of 2-player, confrontational games (without the setup time or billions of pieces).  While C&C has so far proven disappointing, I have hopes that this will not be.

Funny and simple but strategy is driven by the luck in drawing the right cards from the deck...

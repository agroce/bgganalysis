App only, my concern is that it probably takes a bit longer to set up for my liking.

Initial rating was 9, but I haven't played it much because I wasn't in the mood to play co-op games lately, so it seems like it's a 7.7 for me.

Game was hard, but gets quite a bit easier once you figure out deck control/building (# of cards).  Fun game, often times visits our table on game night.

Best deck building strategy game I own.  Will have a lot of replay in our group.  I Kickstarted the game and got every bell and whistle.  The FAQ and their answers clarify minutia but the game play is smooth, fun, edge of your seat, cooperative, and unique.  I love every aspect of it.  They came out with a winner.
As an aside - I was shorted 30 or so sleeves as a stretch goal and CMON has already addressed that issue by promising to send out missing parts once order fulfillment is done.

Although I'm not usually a big fan of deck-building, I really like XenoShyft. The first positive impression came from the artwork, which is absolutely amazing. I really enjoy the scary look of the aliens and the Halo-like feel that the troops give me. 

Gameplay-wise instead XenoShyft makes everything right to be a great cooperative game, because it makes you really partecipate with all the other players to what's happening every round. At the same time it puts the apha-player problem out of the equation with the simple mechanism of the face down Hive cards. XenoShyft also introduces some nice tweaks to the genre of deck-building. I like that you get currency every turn so that you can always buy something, but even more I like the fact that, when you buy a card, it's immediately available to you. It's true that, with these changes, the optimization of the "economy" of the deck is not the focus of the game anymore, which probably makes the gameplay not as deep as some people may want it to be. On the other hand in this way the game is very easy to teach and understand, but it also allows the player to concentrate on fighting.

Before the Dreadmire and Immolation expansions I did have one pretty big complaint about the game though. XenoShyft Onslaught, base game only, is WAAAAY too easy. I noticed that some people have the exact opposite opinion and that might be because they have a more limited experience with the game. Instead I consistently beat it, if you don't consider the first plays when I didn't know the system that well. I didn't even lose when playing at "You Ain't Gonna Win" difficulty and in some cases we even completely annihilated the game even at that difficulty. The Hive expansion help a little bit but the game still didn't offer the challenge I wanted from it. That was a huge disappointment.

Fortunately, when the Kickstarter campaign for Dreadmire came along, I saw that this and some other minor dislikes I had about the game were very well addressed in the new release. So I backed it and one year later I can say that I was right. Dreadmire and Immolation bring two new alien races to the table that are considerably more challenging, solving therefore my problem with Xenoshyft and increasing the replay value of the game at the same time. The expansions also came with a new set of unit and item cards for even more variety of experiences.

Before the expansions I liked Xenoshyft. The base game is a fine, well put together product with many strengths. If you include the expansions however, Xenoshyft is one of my favorite games of all time. Now its innovation and exciting game-play is paired with a huge amount of replayability and a couple of worthy and challenging enemies. A great game that I'm really glad to have in my collection!

Rating without the expansions: 7.

I feel like this game deserves far higher than a meager 7 for how much of an absolute BLAST it is to play, even 2P. I'll have to eventually get to why that 7 exists but for now, let's bask in how great this game is and how fun it is to play.

-The ART is amazing. If you like card art, it's almost worth the purchase just to see the dynamic and detailed units.
-The card design fronts are great. As a UI designer myself, I can see they went for an older style that works well for this particular game.
-The backs of cards/boards/etc are a bit bland but that's okay. So are the item card background but it doesn't wear on you for long.
-The Divisions (player classes) are all interesting and diverse.
-The monsters are insanely scary and will mess you up if unprepared.
-The game gets out of the way and lets you just dive in and start playing.
-Something is incredibly satisfying about grenading the living hell out of an entire line of yet-revealed enemies for your friends who love how much you saved their bacon. Or when you start healing everyone like crazy, or handing out guns and armor like candy. Teamwork really is the absolute best feature of Xenoshyft and it makes up most of the reason this is such a great game to play.

The bad:
-After about 2 plays, the enemies are completely predictable. You know in Wave 1 you're going to lose your ass (usually due to luck of what you drew) and the base is going to eat 4 damage per player on average. Wave 2 starts off hard but becomes cakewalk by its third turn. Wave 3 is a complete piss-take of ease all the way through. That means it starts off unfairly and sacky and ends up being easy? I'm not sure how this got past play testing. Our first 2 games were won with zero effort. I actually thought Medic might be broken so we banned it and the next game we won in HALF the time because as a Scientist you just bomb the Hive back into the stone age. I'm seriously not sure what's supposed to be difficult about this game. We rarely even take damage by Wave 3 since we have all the toys. Maybe our teamwork is better than the designers anticipated, I don't know.

-Some of the items are pretty bad, especially the Spark Rifle. Minor nitpick but it hurts replayability in a game I already said has some tough replayability.

-Bosses are ...not. I don't think we've ever come away from a boss encounter very much worse than a normal enemy. Not sure what they were going for here. They're basically just indistinguishable from normal units in that wave most of the time except the tiny increase in numbers and the biohazard symbol.

-Everything in this game is on-rails. It keeps a nice pace for non-gamers or people you're introducing to gaming (and this is a great game for that) but it kills a lot of the tactical fun for veterans who want to strategieze a long-term game plan. Instead, it sort of feels like a tour of setpieces. Your economy is automatically taken care of. Typically your division upgrades scale all your early equipment into late game WHILE your economy increases steadily enough to afford more of it for the same price. That means you usually roll out of control with power. Our last hits of both games were over 30 damage apiece with powers and cards to spare.

-You get Xenosathem (currency) for free at a set amount. That can be nice if you hate ramping an economy manually but it means a huge amount of your possible economy is based on chance. Since you draw up to 6 each turn, but can only "condense" this stuff in later waves than you get it, that means accidentally looping your deck (due to chance, not number of cards drafted) causes all your weak currency to cycle back in. Even a single card changes your economy forever and either helps or screws you. My first game, I couldn't condense my last pile of 3 level-1 currencies into a level-3 currency. Which meant I had significantly less level-6 currency forever. My second game, I got it all in my discard perfectly every wave so I went into each wave with the maximum physically possible and the thinnest deck (since this condeses 3 1s into a 3, and 2 3s into a 6, it thins the deck massively).

-The rulebook assumes you know certain things like units keep damage on them at the end of a turn, because it doesn't tell you at all. It glosses over a lot of things. Some of the things we're doing are pretty creative and also fairly powerful that the rulebook just seems to allow.

-Something a lot of card games get a pass on is shit quality cards. This is because you can solve the problem by sleeving them as you ought to be doing anyway. However, this seems to be a lighter game for all gamer types and not everyone is hardcore enough to sleeve. Xenoshyft has awful grey-core cards (which is 95% of the entire game), terrible plastic damage/power chips which you don't have enough for damage, and lowish quality play boards, some of which are unnecessary. We sleeved our cards, laminated our boards, and immediately replaced the awful plastic counters. If you aren't willing to do that, you'll find this game starts to fall apart rather fast.

Despite the game being on rails, the fast-burn of replayability, low-low component quality, and slightly awkward rulebook, I still recommend Xenoshyft. There was never one second during play that we stopped smiling and having a great time blowing the snot out of aliens. With the megawealth of expansions this game continues to get, replayability is the least of its worries. It can't get higher than a 7 due to the sheer amount of negative qualities, but gets much higher than most people might otherwise put up with for the same traits.

Still going to hope they release a full-blown variant without the hand-holding in the future.

Backed the Kickstarter.
I always feel that I will win each time I play, I think I could if the rest of the team didn't let me down. 
this game is fun. The art work is amazing, and adds to the fun. Will be hitting the table again.

I also picked up the iOS version and its just as much fun. Does annoy me when I hit something that I don't want to use and cant go back to change it.

RATING: 7
A brutal cooperative deck-builder that absolutely rewards multiple plays and card memorization.
A fair warning to the AP-prone, the puzzly – "prepare for all scenarios" style of gameplay can cause this one to drag.
However, as players begin to memorize the reoccurring cards and effects, play eventually begins to move along much more quickly.

While the random enemy deployment and rinse and repeat gameplay may rub some gamers the wrong way, I give this one a solid play recommendation for fans of deck builders and co-ops.

Gorgeous artwork, asymmetrical player powers, and the ability to purchase and deploy cards into other players' lanes makes Xenoshyft a unique offering to the deck-building genre.

For an enjoyable play experience, stick with 2 or 3 players.
Additionally, I recommend adjusting Enemy deployment to reflect the rules introduced in Xenoshyft: Dreadmire.

Love the theme, love the mechanics, and love how much of the game I got for the price. Only CMON game I own but I am glad they decided to not go with miniatures for this one as I always try to bring it with me to my game nights. 

When CMON said they decided to focus on art in replacement of miniatures they did an amazing job. Only con is how such great art is being displayed on hand sized cards. 

There might be issues here and there with the timing of certain things but much of this has been cleared up by designer in the forums with an official FAQ release. 

If I had to limit myself to only one kickstarter project every year, the Xenoshyft line would be an easy choice for me.

After not writing a review for 3+ years, I'm compelled to write a review for this awesome, awesome game.  Note, I played the kickstarter version where my friend had all of the extra goodies.  We played Barracks/Med Bay the first game and Barracks/Armory the second game.  Both losses but incredibly fun.  Can't comment on the expansion divisions, I've heard they're a little broken but can't give my experience on that.  

Components: For a deckbuilding game with little diversification on components needed, there's not much to say here.  The cards were durable and smooth, the individual player lanes were made of tough cardboard, and the game mat used was made of rubber like a mouse pad which was really nice.  For the job, the components were just fine.

Difficulty: Very difficult but very fun.  I see a lot of people complaining about the randomness and how the player's have little opportunity to deviate their luck.  I will agree the game is random.  Like a lot of cooperative games such as Pandemic and Arkham Horror, sometimes the draw of cards can really make you pay.  But I've come to accept that cooperative games like these have mechanics in place for the ultimate "unfair random brutality" that makes for some frightening but extremely exciting events.  

That being said, the player's do have opportunities to tactically play by air-dropping (AKA instant-deploying) troops, using scout drones to switch troops around, using instant abilities such as grenades and pulsar bombs and medkits, using pulsar armor to gather intel, and more.  The best part is that player's can help each other in these situations, too.  Random?  Yes.  Unable to counter?  No.  It's hard but fun!

Strategic Depth: There is a decent amount of strategy in once you get the hang of the game.  Some mechanics are very obvious like burning early militia and rangers to thin your deck and gain more elite troops.  Others are less obvious like knowing when to use stimpack or a stormtrooper's ability.  Choosing what units to field is really cool and gives the player a feeling of specialization -- something I crave in all games.  For a cooperative, randomize game you have enough strategy to satisfy casual players but hardcore "pros" will be dissuaded likely.  Then again, what hardcore pros like cooperative games based on random factors being a large part of the game?

Gameplay:  Overall, it's really exciting.  Building up your deck and diversify your army is fun and rewarding when you have killer combos.  Playing as Barracks and need an "Oh shit, we need help" moment?  Instant-deploy a Defender!  About to lose the game because your hero just got roflstomped by a hydra?  Use the upgraded medic shuttle and prevent all the damage.  

My one complaint is that while players do have the ability to help each other when it's the other's turn, the isolated lanes do feel at times a single-player game turned cooperative for the sake of extra players.  I find that's the number one complaint with cooperative games, though; any of them can inherently be played by a single player, so you have to accept that a cooperative game will have limitations of, well, cooperative play.  If this game could be made to fight a single lane with multiple people then I feel that would be the ultimate success.

Theme/Artwork: Now we're at the bread and butter.  I don't know about all of you, but I really, really care about artwork in a game.  And DAMN does this game DELIVER.  The artwork is SO BADASS.  Excuse me while I go apeshit over how fucking cool this artwork is.  It's your typical sci-fi futuristic military encased in tons of godly awesome armor.  Shit.  Give me more.  The cards depict each character as a supreme badass of the future, ready to plunge their gigantic plasteel boot right through the freaking face of every living GOSH DAMN ALIEN INSECT ON THIS GOD-FORSAKEN PLANET.  The Defender looks like he's ready to wreck shit AND DON'T EVEN THINK I WON'T MENTION THE ORCA.  DAT ORCA.  MAN.  HE'S A BALLER.  On another note, Luke Skywalker would have been gunned down as he pranced to the millenium falcon with Xenoshyft Stormtroopers on his ass.  Have you seen the artwork for these guys?  Like mother truckin BAMFs just causing explosions WHEREVER THEY WALK.  One round, I had 4 Stormtroopers and you know what happened?  Everything died.  Like, instantly.  Mr. Butcher appears ready to slice my entire line apart and you know what happened to him?  He got nuked.  He got nuked HARD.  My Stormtroopers  then used the butcher's own blade arms to pick out the blood, guts, and filth from their boots because they were busy curbstomping every monster on the planet.  

Before I end this glorious depiction of art, I can't go before I talk about the monster (Hive) art.  Oh shit.  Talk about nightmares.  Some of these are flat out TERRIFYING.  Seeing a Gore Mosquito suck the the blood out of those poor troopers is just freaky.  The Havoc?  Have you ever had pants-shitting terror happen to you?  This guy will do it.  Imagine this fucker on your doorstep with a poor, half-eaten trooper grasping you as his lower abdomen is being mawed and digested by a thousand fucking teeth.  This guy will ruin your life.  The monster art isn't like other games where this crazy horror of a beast appears all by its lonesome grazing in a field of grass.  No, at times you see the monster depicted in its element of literally EATING PEOPLE. Now, not all of the art is like this and I wish there were more scenes of war with this frightening enemy, but there's enough to satisfy you.

The art, man.  It's worth the game alone.

Overall: The game is a blast.  The artwork is beyond sick in both pure awe and hideous and sickening depictions.  The tension is there, the build-up is there, and the theme is there.  A lot of people state this game fails in regards to deck-building.  I completely disagree.  No, it's not Dominion, but from my point of view the deck-building is exciting through the vast usage of variability and anticipation of the higher-tiered units.  Knowing that you're about to get an Ajax and buff your entire line is really awesome.  Knowing that you just drew 3 +6 Xenosathem cards and about to unleash hell on everything that lives feels damn good.

If you like cooperative games, you like sci-fi military, you like killing aliens, and you like having a good time with friends as you all huddle and cower in the corner then this game is for you.

Fight for humanity, fight for survival, fight until there is nothing left to fight.  NorTec Corp fights for you.

Initial Impression: The artwork for the cards of this deckbuilder is gorgeous. In particular, I love the images used for the baddies. This game is a cooperative cardgame in which the emphasis is clearly on the COOPERATE. There's no being the hero in this game. All players have to work together, give each other items and personnel, and help clear each others' threats in order to protect the shared base from damage. I very much enjoyed the first phase of the turn, in which tough decisions are made in what to add to your arsenal. After deployment, the baddie resolution phase feels somewhat like it plays itself, with the occassional chance to deploy a card from hand in order to better your odds against the threat directly in front of you. With 3 successive waves, the game ramps up in difficulty until it kicks our butt. In the end I enjoyed my play of this game and would love to try it again in order to see if we can eke out one more wave.

For a game that was hyped as being a challenging co-op experience, I found that while following the rules to the letter, a group of savvy gamers regularly ran through things relatively smoothly. There were ups and downs, but rarely did it feel like we would lose. Interesting art and concepts, but ultimately suffers from the same problem that other co-op games have: Short of a catastrophic series of events due to RNG, you're far more likely than not to win if you know what you're doing.

Really fun game that is a deck builder, but does not feel like a deck builder.  I origionally took it off my buy list as I had enough deck builders with dominion and Legendary.  This game feels differnt enough from those to more than justify getting it.   

It is quite a hard game.  I play is solo, which makes it even harder.  I have played four solo games, and I have lost them all.  The game does feel quite luck based, though many meaningful decisions are made every round.  The set up and break down is no bad, and it is a game I can get on the table and play quickly.  For me, it is very much a keeper.  

The components are a bit flimsy.  The boards are extremely thin, and the cards are thin.  Others have said that the cards have a weird shimmer, but I have not had a problem with that.  I do not like the blue text on some of the cards, which makes them hard to read.

Very awesome co-op deck builder, at the time of writing, only played 3 games and only one of those was a total victory so the difficutly (which is based mostly on Luck) is, I would say, quite right, the 2 loses were almost wins.
2player loss, 3 player loss, 3 player win

I really like the things this deck builder does differently than some others that I also enjoy. I like how playing a card cost nothing, I like how purchasing cards from the "store" goes straight into your hand and not into your discard pile so you can buy cards that fit your needs immediately. I like how every turn you get one resource card given to you for free each round. I like how the low level troops can be (removed from your deck) in later rounds for a discount to buy more advanced troops. I like how in later rounds the resource cards in your discard pile can be traded up for higher value resources automatically). I like how you can deploy cards in your hand into your allies play area to help them, and since the card goes into their discard, you dont have to track whos card belongs to who.

The randomness of the aliens, and the randomness of the available items works very well for the theme of the game I feel. It encourages everyone to work together to fill the gaps in the defensive line as best you can.

So far everyone ive played the game with has very much enjoyed the game, even for the loses!

The art is very slick, I like all of it, The flavor text is usually fun to read. The game rules are pretty simple and easy to teach.

Would rate a 10 but the box is so inadequate, that it actually detracts from my enjoyment of the game. The whole base game fits sleeved into the box, but the extra stuff from kickstarter does not fit, so I had to cut down the insert to be about 1.5 inches shorter so I could put the extra cards standing up in the gaps of the base cards. The cards are not easy to look through to find the cards you need for setup since there are no divider cards. Eventually I got everything to fit in the base box even though the top cover stops about a half inch from closing all the way, it works as long as I dont put anything else on top of it. It is so far the absolute worst box in my gaming collection.

Haven't really been a fan of the co-op deck builder genre yet, but this one was fun.  There are a few rough edges in regards to timing, but the game plays pretty smooth for the most part.  This one is most definitely not easy, so it has the difficulty going for it as well.  I wish there was a little more variety on the bad guys, as it seems like you mostly go through the whole deck.  One I am looking forward to checking out more of.

RATING: 6
It is a fun deck building/tower defence game.  The best of it genre (the only one tho).  It has a great mechanic to it were you have to protect your base from 3 monster waves (3 round each). I mostly play 1 or 2 players, but i like it at 3 player too. 4 is too much and i feel like it is too long.
Pros are that this game give a innovation mixe of different type of game and give you a great theme that match with the game.  The different abilities of the card are great and give your great possible strategies.
Cons are that i know at the end of the 5th or 6th round if i will win or not and it doesn't give me the desired to finish my game, and when i do, it was to predictible.   If you are unlucky and you get bad mix of cards on one of the first turns and a mean combo of hive card, you will loose quickly the game without any chance.  
Their is a lot of math to do in the game to calculate the amount of life vs the amount of damage done and the bonus provide by the bonus items (substraction and adition only tho).  In fact, the game is calculation.

Sometime, I feel like I want to play it and it great, but I don't get it out of my shelf often.

RATING: 2.25
With obvious good cards / bad cards that are good / bad in certain situations that you can't predict, this game is strategically and tactically arbitrary.
It's still tense and thematic, which is good, but it just uses the wrong mechanics. A deck builder should give you options and shouldn't be obvious and arbitrary.

The alien cards can be extremely punishing to certain builds, but not in a fun way.

Mezcla varias mecanicas, deck building, tower defense y combate, para crear un juego cooperativo bastante original. La dificultad tampoco es muy alta y depende mucho de lo que te va saliendo en el mazo de monstruos, y tiene una rejugabilidad alta gracias a los items y enemigos aleatorios, aunque como casi todo lo de cool mini consigue su maximo potencial gracias a los S.G. (nuevos items, jefes, enemigos, heroes, ...)

A combination of deckbuilding and card drafting game that is a bit hard to tame. This game is all about co-op. The game itself is not complicated, but it offers many add-ons in order for the players to survive the attack of the alien (Although I do think that those creatures are the natives and we are the aliens that would invade their planet, though). This game is also about managing your economy well, because if you don't, don't expect to even survive the first round of the second wave. Hard, that's it. It is not recommended to be played with a bunch of newcomers. The game is quite boring, anyway. The suspend was the only one that made me stick on the game. Anyway, it was sold already, though.

Gioco in puro stile Starship Troopers, dove da orde di fanteria disperate si arriverà ad utilizzare droidi giganti e marine ultracorazzati, per difendersi da orde di alieni insettoidi. Xenoshyft Onslaught è un gran bel deckbuilding Cooperativo, dove ogni giocatore deve razionare le proprie carte per mandarle in rinforzo agli altri, oppure a se stesso. Purtroppo trovo il gioco facilissimo in 4 giocatori ma equilibrato in 2-3, per il resto un ottimo cooperativo semplice e che impone ai giocatori di unire le forze trai loro mazzi diversificati.

I was not too sure about this buy, as reviews summoned an image of a very hard to beat game (which I do not really like, being more of a casual gamer). It turned out I made the right decision in buying it after all.

Not having much experience with deck building games, I wanted to increase my collection in that direction and I like how this game allows you to buy cards into your hands for instant use rather than waiting till it comes from your discard pile. Also, exhausting your deck does not cause a penalty. All-in-all, this helps reduce frustration.

There is a limit to the variation in the base game, though. Also, the non-card components are not as sturdy as I like to see them.

This game is a blast. It is very swingy (which only becomes more so by adding in the expansions and KS cards), but always fun.  Sometimes you get wiped early with a combo of bad card draw and tough aliens, but many times you can make yourself very powerful by the end of the game and the last wave is a breeze.  I do wish there was more close-call, or "by-the-skin-of-their-teeth" endings to the game, but it also feels good to look down at your lane and see the forces you've built knowing the last wave doesn't have a chance. So swingy isn't so bad in this game as it would be in others, and there are so many ways to alter or mod your experience and chances! Great thematic and addictive game that plays well 1-4 (solo always gives it a bump!).

Wauw, this is one hell of co-op deck-builder done in the right way. I immensely enjoy playing this one. The flow of the game is so rewarding and the staged difficulty using waves is very smartly designed.

Beware, do not think to play this one as a filler game; it could easily take 2 hours to tackle this monster, but going in with the right expectations makes this game a polished diamond.

Only downside I see is that the replayability is not nearly as great as e.g. Legendary, but the game play is much tighter. When Dreadmire comes out and "fixes" this problem, I could perhaps dethrone Legendary as my #1 deck-builder...

I hate the insert (it is a pain to use).  I hate the graphic design (the fonts are hard to read and unpleasant looking).  I hate the art (it all looks the same... so many pictures of black armor on a dark green background).  I also really am not a fan of the generic dark sci fi theme.

But this game is fun to play.  It has a great interest curve and a lot of power to mitigate against bad draws.  Every round is its own little puzzle to solve, figuring out how to use your various powers to survive.  This has a lot in common with Magic: the Gathering combat (a sure way to my heart), exploiting abilities and combat tricks to get your creatures to trade favorably with the enemy horde.  

Update: Continue to really enjoy the gameplay on this one, but find it is getting repetitive pretty quickly.  It does not help that so many of the items in the base game (the only thing that is randomized) do such similar things.  I hope they find a way to introduce more variety between games in the expansion.  Expect this to get put away soon until that comes out.

Playing solo via iPad with one or three factions. Mostly win.

Two things.

1. I heard that the game lacks cooperation. Nonsense. Xenoshyft is one of the most cooperative games I ever seen. Factions work as one biobulldozer on the battlefield. (If you don't get it - read the rules, please. Carefully!)

2. I heard that the game is impossibly hard. Again, nonsense. It is very challenging. Yet not impossible (at all).
As for me - it has great level of difficulty. You mostly win, but you always know that a few mistakes - and you will go down.

(Maybe the physical version has some crucial differencies with the iPad version, but I doubt that.)

There's a lot to like, but oy vey, that down time. There should be a way for everyone to play simultaneously. It should work well for solitaire play.

Despite the cool variety of cards, I fear that there just isn't that much variety in gameplay. Combine that with the fiddly setup and long play time that make this a main event game, and I don't see myself jonesing to play it more than a handful of times.

Really fun single player card game, but not a lot of staying power.  Keep it one player though because it is the worst kind of co-op: the "everyone do what one guy shouts" kind.

Interesting game - like Thunderstone Advance meets Starship Troopers. Seems like it may be hard to win (our base was overrun by alien bugs in the first round of wave 3 (ouch!)).

Played this twice and loved it, we lost immediately on turn 7 wave 3 as the brutality of the monsters there just wiped us out. We were very unlucky with our placement too. It just seemed like every time we stacked our troops to be unstoppable the alien cards would have some ability to trounce us. 

I so wanted to play a 3rd time but we needed to move on to another game. 

I plan on picking this one up as it was great fun and I'm determined to beat it.

I've changed my view after a few more plays.  This game is too difficult in its current state. For anyone who says this game is easy, you're doing it wrong. Too many plays never getting past wave 7 makes for a drawn out fest of inevitability.

I like hard games, but this is too much...

Coop Deckbuilding is usually something I can't resist to play or even not to buy. I had high hopes in this game too. We played it two times at Essen. I also thought about buying the App. 

But after some time I realised, that I have some problems with that game:
First I don't like the hidden challenges. The random monster effects will screw all your thoughts and plans you made. Some say that you can manage this with the blitz action cards. But usually you just have few of these at hand. This leads to another thing: I couldn't find much cooperation instead a lot of downtime (4 player game) waiting for other player for resolving their struggle with very little and short ways to support this player. 

I also think that - beside the different items you could purchase - the game is rather repetitive and similar each time you face a wave. So I can't see much replayability for me. 

I can't see how you have a critical amount of influence of the gameplay neither your own nor of the other players. It's like watching a die roll - while thinking you will make it because you shook it exactly seven times before you throw the die, that is why the result probably will be ...

This may be the best overall deck-builder (along with Core Worlds), utilizing multiple interacting mechanisms including: card drafting, deck-building (with some interesting twists), resource management, progressive developmental structuring, variable player powers, and a significant spatial/"worker-placement" component as well.  Plus each round is like its own unique mini-game, where you set your defenses (kind of a mini-tableau-building phase) and then play out the battle.

And the new structuring of rounds within each wave laid out in the Dreadmire rules is outstanding, eliminating any need to adjust difficulty levels -- plays beautifully.

Only one game into this, but it seems like it has potential.  I want to play it again right away, so that's a good sign.  Definitely looks to be a challenging game, but I feel like it might have the problem of being easily solved over time.  At which point you will just play it with the same general strategy over and over.  Already starting to think of ways to expand on the game and start creating house rules.

My initial impression of the game being solvable seems accurate.  But even with that being the case this one is still a lot of fun.

Actually I was surprised how much I enjoyed this one as it is a deckbuilder which is not a genre I particularly enjoy, however this one is fully co-operative meaning cards purchased can be played on other players to help them along.

The constant barrage of hive (bad guy) cards gives the whole game a sense of urgency and the early rounds in particular are quite punishing, as more hive show up that you have defenders, excess damage ending up on the base which has a finite number of hit points, lose them all and it is game over.

I really enjoyed this one and the random 'personality' for each player and for the equipment available for purchase means there should be a lot a variability in game play here.

Tried it twice and it was fun. Seems like it will be a bit easy once you understand how good certain effects are.

Reducing base HP is a bit unsatisfactory as a way of increasing difficulty. Harder enemies would be way more fun.

But this brings us to the next problem. Enemies are face down. This means you can't plan everything in advance (good), but it also means that the cards which are a bit more narrow in application won't see play.

But again: We played twice and had fun.

I can see the appeal of this game as "Halo/Aliens meets Dominion", but I have no need for that kind of game. I'm not much for a Halo-themes game, and the set-up time is even higher than Dominion.

This game is extremely difficult.  My son and I have yet to get past wave 7.  Whenever we buy the troops in the final row in wave 7, they just get burned by the one alien that that annihilates the troops with just doing a damage.  The alien's attack power is just so much stronger than the defense of any of the troops even with boosted items.  We will keep plugging away.  When we do finally win, what a glorious day it will be.

Reminds me of Shadowrun: Crossfire but better.  A difficult co-op tower defense game with strong deck building mechanics.  Item abilities are interesting and virtually all of them feel strong.  Role abilities are strong although after three plays I'm not sure they're equally strong.  Works well with two players.  Nice graphic design reminiscent of Mass Effect.  Feels difficult but not unbeatable; after three two player plays, have only been able to get to round 7 of 9.

The game feels like a massive amount of luck with very little mitigation. No matter how you set up your line, the revealed hive cards could easily destroy your strategy; leaving you with little you could do to change the fate of the rest of your troops in the line. The wound and ability counters felt very fiddly; I found we were placing wounds on on troops or hive, then would have to discard the wounded cards and with their wound counters, almost immediately, as the next match-up ended in each card killing each other. There doesn't seem to be much change in gameplay; buy some cards with a little money, set up your line, calculate damages. So I don't see this game having much replayability. Overall I found the game to be a bunch of blind buying & set up followed by calculating random damage.

RATING: 6
Takes a little too long to play for what you get out of it. It has a setup and takedown similar in complexity to the Legendary games, but doesn't quite have the quality of gameplay as those games.

Also, the theme is just a little off for me. The whole "corporate mercenaries exploiting a system and bringing this on themselves" theme makes me less interested in actually winning. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Solid game that takes the deck building mechanics and combines it with tower defense. 

The set up time before the game takes a bit longer than I'd like, but gameplay delivers a tough and exciting challenge. My main issue is that this game is heavily random especially when playing solo. A bad draw of cards or a bad combination of enemies can completely ruin everything in one turn. However, this randomness can sometimes be mitigated aid from other players in coop.

It seems this game really shines at 2 to 3 players (4 has a bit too much downtime during combat resolution IMO).

I'd recommend it for anyone who loves deckbuilding and looking for a real challenge in a coop game.

Solid coop Deckbuilder. I don‘t think there is enough variety in the base game (KS Edition maybe, but not standard Ed.).  The Design‘s replayability solely counts on the fact that the game is hard to beat, not in variety of Troops or Monsters. In the first three rounds you basically can only buy Rangers (and items). There are too few ways to mitigate what or on which position are the monsters in the hive lane. So the reveal effects are always „surprising“ and you have to deal with them. Some you can negate at the cost of discarding a card which is most of the time too expensive to do. Conclusion: OK game for 2-3 plays. Maybe Dreadmire fixes those issues?

Right off the bat we had to look for errata on the way to deal with militia - as fellow BGG users have pointed out, something that comes up *immediately* in the game should probably have been included in the rule book. 

Something else that would be nice to have is a single page cheat sheet of all the purchases that can be made to pass around for the buy phase. It would be a lot easier to say to someone that a particular item isn't for sale yet than to spend five minutes passing cards back and forth to compare effects.

It was a challenging first game and we didn't include the KS expansions or special cards. Wave 1 was easy enough and helped us get used to the mechanics (no boss encounter came up that round). Wave 2 was a bit more intense with a boss encounter and some pretty brutal "normal" cards that began piling up hits on the ship. Wave 3 saw a boss encounter in the first draw, which we defeated quickly and then wound up with encounter after encounter of aliens that did damage to the ship as well as to us. We did not win.

It was fun, and we will definitely play it again.

I liked the game quite a lot, but I just couldn't stand looking at the enemy creatures. Most of them are quite nasty. I think if the game had been themed differently I would have kept it. My other knock is that there is not enough variety in the enemy deck. If you like the game go ahead and get the Hive expansion to remedy this. If you think the game is easy or just right (like me), don't get the other 2 expansions as they just make it easier.

Coolmini, haciendo un deckbuilder sin una sola mini. :p

Como ya digo, es un deckbuilder. cooperativo. hay un pool de cartas comun (basicamente armas y equipo), y 1-4 jugadores tienen que construirse su mazo con sus soldados y equipo, y resistir cada uno a una oleada de aliens. starship troopers style (de hecho viene a ser una fusilada de aquello). los jugadores en conjunto defienden la "base", que es solo un marcador que recibe puntos de daño. si la base llega a 0 antes de que terminen las 9 oleadas, los jugadores pierden. 

El arte es bueno. calidades ok (los marcadores de los jugadores son de carton "caja de cereales"). jugabilidad buena. dificultad bastante alta. 1-2 cagadas y game over. rejugabilidad... consi consá. solo tiene el modo de juego descrito (resiste la horda 9 rondas). el esquema jugable es muy "sota caballo rey"... a alguien que le guste mucho la tematica, se pique y no le importe jugar solo (o encuentre a alguien igual que el) puede que le cuadre jugar varias partidas seguidas. 

yo he jugado 3, con balance de victorias 2-1, y no lo encuentro muy repetible. sinceramente. en cuanto a comprable... en una buena oferta es apetecible, pero a 50pico pavos, particularmente lo encuentro caro. 

es un juego que se le nota, MUCHO, que procede de un KS que trae muchas mas cosas y al que le han metido la tijera a lo bestia para hacer una "caja basica". en resumidas cuentas el juego esta bien, pero en mi opinion para vender a 35, no a 59.

Early plays are promising. The ability to deploy troops and equipment to other players' areas allows for more genuine cooperation than most co-op deckbuilders. 
The variety is deceptively deep--the limited number of troop types is more than offset by the unique player roles and equipment types.

Ok tactical deckbuilder. Not really a strategical game about building card combos and finding synergies. It's more about acquiring troops and gear that can handle different kinds of enemies and their effects. Co-operation is needed when buying and playing cards for maximum effect.

I supported this game on Kickstarter, but wasn't really confident in it.  My wife and I love co-op games, we love deck building games (it is her favorite mechanic), and we both love sci-fi.  It seemed like a no-brainer, but then, so did Sedition Wars.  

After the first few playthroughs, I was still skeptical.  There were some things I liked, but the game seemed brutal.  Survive 9 rounds?  I was lucky when I got passed the 5th round.  

We eventually figured out some strategies that helped us win the game and our winning percentage is a bit more respectable now.  We still struggle at times depending on which equipment and locations we end up with, but we are starting to feel out how to use each one.  We still aren't very good with the Medical stuff.

I enjoy the game though and wish I had picked up some of the extras like the psionic abilities and augmentations.

An amazing Co-op deck builder, where "deck-building" is more of an after thought, and plays more like a "Resource management" game. The game is literally "Starship Troopers" in a box. 

The game is a full co-op game but changes it up more than many others, allowing you to directly support your team mates with items to prevent damage or heal wounded troops to even putting cards directly in their deck. This really makes Xenoshyft shine, cause team work is NECESSARY in this game to win. It is punishing and enemies can literally wipe out your band of troops who you thought were "unkillable"

The rule book can leave a lot to be desired, missing some explanation on certain small details, but nothing major. I also recommend sleeving the cards, they leave a little to be desired compared to other games card quality such as Dominion, Legendary, etc.

I'm very happy this game was kickstarted and extremely happy that CMON is supporting the game with small expansion and a big box standalone, Dreadmire coming out in 2016. Has been a hit with my gaming group, and plan to keep it in my collection for a long time.

Xenoshyft, as of late has run a little stale only due to lack of support the game has. Dreadmire is finally on its way after 18 months. The smaller expansions didn't do the game justice. We don't need anymore tech cards, we want troops dammit!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Surprisingly fast and easy to learn.  The number of cards can be intimidating at first for non-deckbuilders such as myself, but the gist of the game becomes readily apparent after a couple of turns.

Love the visual atmosphere of the game and the feeling of desperately defending a besieged base.

The game suffers here and there in rule clarity.  Certain weapons, if not understood properly, can cause difficulty issues (my group accidentally overpowered the Spark Jumper rifle's "First Strike" ability in our first game, making the last wave of enemies too easy to beat).  Based on the cacophony of players calling for similar clarifications in the forums, I hope CMON compiles a downloadable FAQ to help people out.  That's the only cause for my 8.5 rating.

Have seen complaints that gameplay depends too much on blind luck and not enough on cooperation.  My experience is very different.  While it's difficult to help each other out in the first wave, as everyone scrambles to fill gaps in their defenses, Wave 2 and 3 gave us lots of chances to develop strategies and lend aid to other sectors (e.g., we all had Paratroopers waiting in our hands to play as instants if our lanes were about to be overrun.  Also, as the Med Lab commander, I was constantly purchasing medical cards on the cheap and playing them on other sectors, which in later Waves allowed me to heal my own troops).

Once everyone has the hang of the game, it's easier for everyone to take more actions simultaneously--helpful, since the game can occasionally be difficult to complete in a couple of hours.

Provides lots of conversational fodder later, lots of fun without massive setup or cleanup time.  Highly recommended.  I was a Kickstarter and have the 6-player expansion, though all games have thus far been with 3 players.  Haven't used any of the bonus Kickstarter enemies or Heroes yet, so my review pretty much only takes the core game into account.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (August 2015)

XenoShyft: Onslaught is a cooperative deckbuilding game. What called to me was the awesome theme (Sci-fi Alien attack), one of my favorites but my desire to play the game more times is rather low.

The rules are easy to learn and teach, but the game can be slow with more than two players, so I really prefer to play it this way, otherwise the downtime is way too much for me. The art is very good (as is usual from CMON).

On the positive column, I love that the game come with unique divisions and each player manages one of them. Love the theme and the gameplay is engaging. I like that it features a static market offering making possible to plan and strategize (although the game is eminently tactical).

On the negative column, I feel there is a thematic issue. You are supposed to be defending your base, due to this it makes no sense whatsoever having to buy cards each turn. You are buying them from who? If their lives are in danger why don’t they give you the cards for free? I know it makes no sense mechanically, but if we are under attack I don´t think anyone would sell the only means to survive. Perhaps this was explained wrong to me (I haven’t read the rules yet) or we are mining the resources just in time to “manufacture” the cards or something like that. Still it is a minor issue but as  XenoShyft: Onslaught is a thematic game I think all its theme should make perfect sense within the game. A much larger issue for me is that the game decisions are rather easy and obvious, that is, it is very easy to see and decide which card is the best one to buy with the amount of current resources. I know there are other cards that are better in a given situation but this brings me to the other issue I have with the game. It has too much uncontrollable luck. Every decision you make is blind as you don’t know which cards will appear from the Hive attack. No matter how well prepared you are, there is a Hive combination that will get you killed, so it is luck that decides if you win or lose. I know this luck can be mitigated a bit knowing the Hive cads by heart (or adding more players to the mix), but this is not something I plan to do. I like games in which the decisions aren’t obvious. The game is hard, (as a good CoOp should be), but it isn’t hard because it has hard decisions, it is hard because you are making decisions blind and it is luck that decides your destiny, you can’t predict anything, you are only guessing. 

This luck doesn’t bothers me much in cooperative games, but here it decides almost everything.

Bottom line, what kills the game for me is that it has too much uncontrollable luck plus very easy decisions. I feel I’m wasting my gaming time. I won’t buy it but I’m open to playing it again. It has some novel ideas and it is much better than Legendary. I don’t completely dislike XenoShyft: Onslaught, it seemed like a good idea, but I feels it could have been MUCH better.

2015-05-15 - After one play, I think this is a fun and interesting deck builder. There's a lot of luck involved, especially early in the game, but it becomes much more strategic as the game progresses. Team work is key. You cannot win this game if you aren't helping each other. Looking forward to more plays.

I need to play more (only 2 games so far), but it is promising. It is a challenging co-op that requires some skill and perhaps a little luck to win. The game system is well developed and runs quickly. Density of meaningful decisions is high, even if those decisions aren't terribly deep.

Unlike some other co-op deck builders this one gives the players plenty of tools to help each other which adds a lot to the play experience. 

I look forward to trying this more, hopefully some expansion content will get published. Different wave cards seem necessary.

An interest co-op deck builder that plays as an tower defense game.

I liked the theme and how clear the objective is (dump all you best card if you needed to, as long as you make it pass THE LAST ROUND). 

Two big cons are that the game doesn't seem to scale well, as if the beginning of the game is the hardest and it progressively get easier. The amount of mental math during the later part of the game also annoyed me.(keeping track of cards ability, damage on units, card usable from your hand, buff/debuff etr...)

A brutal co-operative deck builder with an alien theme. Nothing real special for deckbuilder, other than being able to give any card to any player whenever. I found this one dragging a tad too long. Rather just play other better games like this, such as Sentinels of the Multiverse.

XenoShyft combines classic deckbuilding and resource management with fact paced combat and unique "base defense" elements- As the game progresses each player will build up their deck of Troops, Equipment, and Item cards, which they will in turn use to defend their base against incoming enemies in fast-paced and deadly combat.

It is up to the players to work together in order to outlast the horrors awaiting them by coordinating strategy, utilizing the strengths of their unique divisions (Med Bay, Weapons Research, Science Lab, and Armory), and organizing defense tactics to insure no player is caught off guard by surprise attacks.

Note to self: Playable as solitaire. After a video review of onslaught, not sure I really like the theme. The enemy AI deck seems interesting, but coop seems necessary between players, so it might be harder to play as solitaire.

The game is basically a deck builder where you place your troops you wan to use on the board and then you draw X enemy cards and the troops fight each other.

I also don't like how the progression works. The fact that you have 3 waves that affect stuff that you can buy.

While I like that everyone has different abilities and was pretty hyped to try this game as I like deck builders, co-ops, and tower defense, this game kind of fell flat in two of those aspects. 

The co-op part works in that you need to coordinate who is getting what, and playing cards to help other players is very profitable. The game is also pretty hard which is a plus.

The lack of variety of the troops really bugs me, and while there are a lot of different items you can buy, half of them felt pretty similar. It's not like Dominion, where +1 card +2 action plays completely differently from +2 cards + 1 action. Instead, +4 health feels pretty similar to +2 attack (in a roundabout sort of way). The monsters do act differently but you go through a fairly large amount of them each game.

Moreover, besides the lack of interesting cards to deck build, while I like that you can save cards from hand to hand, in other regards the actual deck building mechanisms felt weak. There's only one type of money card and the way they cull themselves feels odd even if it works mechanically, the gaining your cards immediately made the game feel too tactical, the giving each other cards makes it so it never feels like you are building your unique combo, and in general there aren't that many combos that feel unique in general.

I used to like tower defense computer games, but this one just took too long to resolve it's combat. Sure, there are some decisions in the mix of the instant cards, but those decisions don't make up for having to do about 10 combat resolutions per player.

My biggest problem with this game though is the enemies that are incredibly swingy. For example, the ones that resurrect the top troop in your discard pile with increased power and health: this can either whiff completely or create a 9/7 juggernaut that just wrecks you. Sure there are Thief stealing your Gold in Dominion, not getting a good XP start in Thunderstone, etc., but those have more mitigation options, and that you can plan for it. For Thief in Dominion, you do strategies less reliant on money, for Thunderstone, try to get enough money to buy good, expensive cards. For Ghost Stories or Samurai Spirit, non-deckbuilder swingy games I like, you can always play the safer option of getting more resources before you attempt your dice rolls. In Xenoshyft, there seems like there are only a few options to mitigate, and the swingy effects are so varied and frequent that you can't really plan against them. I guess you're just supposed to have so many swingy events happen to you that it balances itself out in the long run?

If it didn't have some of my favorite mechanisms, this game would definitely have quite the poor rating.

I wanted to love this game because a cooperative, science fiction-themed deck builder seems like a perfect fit for us. We ended up not liking it because of how much luck is involved. You lay out the aliens face down and turn them up one at a time. You can't move your men around after they're placed, so once you've set your characters out, the game almost plays itself. There wasn't enough strategy, even with the instants you could play from your hand. Plus, the number of gaps in the instructions for the individual cards and the room for interpretation was frustrating. Not to mention the epically, epically flawed insert.

I had seen video reviewers rave about this, so I was keen to try it. It´s not a bad game, but I wasn´t impressed. The co-op aspect works, as does the theme. But I found the game puzzly and not very exciting, and it could have been more user-friendly: the board barely holds the card stacks, the cards have red text and red numbers on black, there are no tokens for used abilities and no room to tap the cards. Glad I tried before buying.

A fun coop deck-builder with a definite sense of rising tension. The game drags a little bit since each turn is rather long to do all of the combat.

(220515): Impression after two solitaire games.

Xenoshyft is fun. It feels like I'm playing Starcraft or a Starship Troopers game. The game looks really good, it has similar amounts of deckbuilding as Mage Knight does, and as such, doesn't really feel ilke a deckbuilder. I'd say this is as close as I've been to a tower defense boardgame. It's also hard, but feels like it's winnable.

Xenoshyft is about defending your base against 9 waves of aggressors, over 9 rounds. Each round you can purchase troops and items for said troops and populate your defense zone with them. Then the two forces collide and either the aliens are wiped out, or the base suffers damage. This is repeated with increasing stakes for both sides over the duration of the game.

I mean, it's just cool.

Got in a handful of plays at GenCon and then followed up with the app release. Some nice alterations to the standard deckbuilder here- cards bought go in hand, full co-op with the ability to play on other players' characters (which adds those cards to their deck), etc. Difficulty is for real, which is appealing to me as well. Much better than I expected.

One of the best part of the game is the discussion between the players at the start of every round to coordinate their buys so we are all equipped to face the dangers... you can buy troops to deploy in another player lane because they can' afford them in this round for example...

Another great great thing the game provides is the ability of acting while it's another player turn... you can use the powers of some of the troops and items you have your troops equipped with to help the other play fight, or you can use instant items from your hand, like Med Packs or Drones, etc...

So you are always engaged in the game, even when it's another player turn...

This is an excellent co-op game, and if you know me, you know that I'm not usually a fan of co-ops!!

I like Xenoshyft, but I find the theme to be very meh. You have space marines that fight aliens with different weaponry, but I couldn't tell you what my favorite cards are off the top of my head.

Interesting concept and spin on Dominion.  Sadly, really fiddly!  An iPad app version of this would be great fun and remove the detractions facing the player; upkeep and so many options buried across multiple players' tableaus and in their respective hands.

In the end, I personally find that all the moving bitsy parts help push the game length out to a point where I feel it outlasts its welcome.  Disappointingly so.

Deck building game, everyone has special abilities and each player must defeat their own wave of monsters specific to them. Very solitaire based game, not a co-operative effort at all. Should be all players vs a board of monsters, not just each a small wave of monsters. Too long for a deck building game (up to 2 h). Lots of down time as people take their own turn individually. During another players turn it is totally unnecessary to pay attention and very boring if you do (perfect time to have a walk around or get a cider).

Just got it.  Love it!  Cannot wait for expansions.  I have so much fun playing this by myself I don't even care that the one friend I thought would love this isn't very excited by it.  (It turns out, he is not as big as co-op games as I am, and prefers cut throat head to head competition).  I've played single player, and single player playing two hands, and am even going to try playing single player playing three hands, this game is just so damn fun.  I am worried it may grow a little stale, but I suppose nothing stays as fun as it is when it is brand new forever.
Edit: Got a few two player games in, and they are fun, would love to see three or four.  Like the fact I am still being challenged and not winning much, it is getting old seeing so many repeats on the enemies encountered.  I think my biggest want is for the Hive expansion to be here.

Newish purchase, only have played the app.  Seems like a pretty cool game and a unique addition to my deck builder games.

Got this one to the table and it's a pretty cool and intense game to play.  Somehow we managed to squeak in a win with 1 hp on the last 3 rounds.  Definitely was much longer than I was expecting, but even more fun to play in person rather than using the app.  Definitely one of the most unique deck builders I own and one of my favs.

Two players: Ridiculously hard
Four players: More balanced difficulty, but takes too long.

The game also feels like a solitaire game. Each player focuses on their own combat track. Sure, you might help each other out sometimes, but how often does that REALLY happen? Most people will buy what they need themselves and play cards on their own track. Playing with more players also makes this solitaire tendency become more visible. Players just sit and wait for the active player to finish his battle.

This game is way too random and too punishingly difficult for my taste. How well you do is determined to a large degree on which enemies come out and when. You have some mitigation options and having more players to spread the bad luck around helps, but you can still lose fairly easily even while playing very well.
The boss enemies are especially annoying, since they are very powerful and whether they show up at all is random. It seems like this game is more interested in creating "epic" stories than satisfying gameplay. I want a game that I can win if I play well enough.
I do like how cooperative it is. This is the best co-op game I've seen as far as encouraging players to help each other out in meaningful ways. I just wish that the rest of the game worked as well.
Note: I have only played the app version of this game.

This game is HARD. Since I got the game a few months back, I've played 10 or so games and haven't won any game yet. I like the game for the difficulty, but my friends get demoralized by getting annihilated all the time, so we tend to take breaks before trying it again. TEAMWORK is important. You can't just sit there doing your own thing for yourself. If you like this game, I highly recommend the expansions. More variety is always good, and the Hive expansions decrease (and increase) your chance of getting boss monsters, so there's that.

We have played this just once (to date), in July 2015, as one of our gaming group had bought it and wanted to play it. While I'm not particularly into co-ops or so-called "thematic" games, I thought that in essence this was OK and with plenty of interesting decisions (it helps that I like deckbuilding). The biggest problem though, at least in our 4p game, and one which really stops me from being remotely enthusiastic about playing again, was just how immensely long everything took (supposedly it is a 1-hour game, our game took about 2.5 hours, and that was despite losing in the 7th of the 9 rounds!). While greater experience might speed the game up somewhat, it was difficult to see precisely how it could be made much quicker. I can see this working well as a 2p game, or solo, but with 4 it's just way too long for what it is. And I can't say I'd be enthusiastic about trying it 2p either.

After playing this a few times, it's much too random for my taste. The difficulty is intentionally baked to be at a high level otherwise the game loses it's replayability. I believe the theme of this game carries it farther than it should (in terms of rating). I do like the purchase system set into place, but I think there should be more ways for players to offset a string of bad luck. 

Unlike in other good co-op games (like Pandemic), I always feel like I'm getting screwed by bad luck rather than by poor choices on the player's part. It's never clear to me what I should've done to improve the chances for survival. Some of the bugs are clearly "fuck you, base takes damage" no matter what cards. How do you prevent or stop that? You can't. That makes it feel a lot more unfair.

One last thing, don't let the play time on here fool you. On average with 2 experienced players, I clocked in around 90-120 minutes on average with this game.

Despite its level of abstraction, this game feels more like tower defense than other games claiming that mantle.  You encounter waves of enemies, and struggle to keep your units intact between battles.

I also like how money is handled, and it frees the game up to focus on strategy rather than money reinvestment (like most deck builders).  Fresh money is inject each round, money automatically upgrades, there are unlimited buys (and that's not a trap), and prices are low-but varied so there aren't huge cliffs of luck in how your money clumps.  Very well done.

Tactically, the is deceptively simple in two ways.  (1) it is deeper than it first appears, even without expansions and add-ons.  (2) the rulebook misses a lot of corner cases and fails to provide solid formalism, even though the normal cases are simple and well defined.

This is really a solo game in which you may choose to control several characters.  It may be ok 2 player with 2 characters each, but there just isn't enough going on to keep 4 players occupied.

Like many KS games, it's annoying to track down all the mini-expansions and add-ons and promos that really should have been part of the base game.

update:  play the game with the rules from Dreadmire.  The games are nearly identical except for new enemy/ally cards, but the dreadmire rules are are more clearly written and slightly less luck-based.  They two games are perfectly compatible but dreadmire is slightly and distinctly better.  So, get both and use the dreadmire rules.

03-06-2015. I own KS Edition. Rated after 2 solo plays. Xenoshyft is the fist CMoN game I own and is a cooperative game for 1-4 players, In it, you play a bunch of security forces of a mining company killing aliens so the company can mine.

The game, is in contrast to its trappings relatively easy. Each turn follows a similar structure. The aim is to survive 9 rounds of alien onslaught (3 wave 1, 2 wave 2, 3 wave 3). Aliens get progressively more difficult. Aliens are placed on 4 locations in a row front of you, you have 4 locations in front of you to place troops.

1. Get resource card (1 in phase 1, 3 in phase 2, 6 in phase 3.
2 Spend resources to hire new soldiers and buy equipment, which are placed in your hand.
3. Equip and place soldiers in 4 locations in front of you.
4. Combat
Combat is easy, you flip the first alien and resolve any reveal effect if any. Then both the soldier and alien simultanously deal damage. If either one is killed, the empty spot is filled up with the next. This continues until:
1. You kill all aliens. Great! Go to next round. Surviving soldiers remain where they are.
2. All your soldiers are dead. In this case, your base gets damaged. If this ever reduces the HP of the damage to 0, you lose.

I liked the game a lot. While solo, you may not get all the interesting cooperative bits, like playing cards to help your opponent out and the like. But I felt the game was relatively straight forward, has interesting gameplay options and a nice packaging. I like it.

XenoShyft is an interesting tower defense style game that is unfortunately marred by two things:

1) The balance is a bit off - randomness in the card draws can swing the game a LOT, and the equipment/troop cards you can buy vary GREATLY in usefulness.

2) Bookkeeping, bookkeeping, bookkeeping. Like, approaching Sentinels of the Multiverse levels of annoying bookkeeping, except there's a lot more of it because you generally have to do it several times for each enemy.

I don't think it's BAD, but it could be SO much better. Hopefully Dreadmire fixes some of these issues. Also, I have the KS edition and the "hero" and "special equipment" seem to add a LOT of variability to the game. I'm not sure I would recommend it without them.

I really wanted to like this game. I backed in kickstarter. I even got the 5-6 player expansion, which was a mistake since the game would take way way too long with that many people. There are many pros with the game, but the cons far out way the pros.

First off the rules suck. The are simple and easy to follow, but there are so many things not covered in them. The game isn't balanced. There are items that are way better than others. The game can be a lot easier or hard based on your items. This isn't good for a co-op. I don't want one game to be way easy and the next to be supper hard.

This game doesn't supply different modes of difficulty. What an oversight! We've won every game easily. (I've played 4 games at the time of writing this review) The last waves were all easy and a waste of time.

The game can easily get too long with more than one player because you have to wait on them through combat. The play time of 45 min is probably accurate for solo play, but that's it. If it's your first game, you may take as long as an hour per player. If you've all played it a lot you might get that time down to 30 per player. the range should be 45min-3hours. That would be a lot more accurate.

It could have been a better game with just a more detailed rules and balancing fixes.

This game could be really awesome with a fixed second addition, but I doubt that will happen. 4

Solid coop deck builder with an alien theme. Different roles for each player means each person play style is unique in helping the team in a different way. The aliens can be very tough so a victory should be enjoyed. The main downside is that combat can tend to drag by the end of the game as each player has plenty of armor, weapons, and items in hand to use to counteract the enemy attacks or reveal abilities. 

If you like coops, deck builders, and alien themes then this one should be right in your sweet spot.

This is a good game, a tight challenge and has a lot of replayability to try out different tactics and items. The only issue is that this can be tough to bite through for newer players due to rulebook that does not clarify a lot of things. I did end up selling it though, for the game seems to encourage obvious decisions in the mechanics.

It was an alright game: I feel it was difficult to get into as a cooperative game. The theme was good but the game felt varying degrees of restrictive. I think part of the issue was our play style not working with the game well, but the game really didn't offer us a lot to value collaboration.

Xenoshyft is a solid co op card game about starship troopers trying to repel hordes of aliens. It has an easy learning curb but some might get out off by all the modifiers the cards create. The game carries the theme really well and there are lots of opportunities to assist each other as the game progresses.

It isn't quite as fun as Shadowrun:Crossfire, but that is just because you cannot level up your characters from game to game.  However, inside each game, you get a great sense of progression.  Also you get to kill bugs!  

Has a starship troopers feeling to the game.  I love all the different options that you can select for your upgrades and troop selections.  There are so many combinations out there that this game is almost as endless as Shadowrun:Crossfire, but for different reasons.

The best part is selecting what cards you are going to be able to buy from.  It really reminds me of a computer game where you get to choose what to build in your base, weighing their pros and cons versus every other option you have available to you.  That is what makes this game shine.

RATING: 4
Take a deckbuilder, remove all the fun and good parts of a deckbuilding game, combine it with a wildly random co-op with blind resolution mechanics and you have Xeno-whatever-it's-called.  There are too many good games that don't get play time to waste on this.

RATING: 9
Pros: Art is immersive and stunning. Gameplay feels great. Super thematic. And one of the most coop-y games you'll find. If one play tries to alpha dog it, you'll lose. Teamwork is essential.

Cons: Setup time can be long if not organized well ahead of time. Some may find it too punishing.

Final thoughts: Falling in love. 

However, I think Dreadmire's rules will fix the difficulty curve of this game. Either way, terrific game! 

For those that really want a challenge.

XenoShyft works. It doesn't appear to be broken in any way, but it lacks interesting decisions, the downtime from a 4 player game isn't justified by the Pulse Shields and Grenades and the roles essentially script what you'll be doing. I also don't think I learnt anything in my first playthrough that would make my 5th or 10th plays go any differently.

Essentially XS is perfectly mediocre. By Kickstarter standards then it is a success, but I'd have no need to ever come back to this.

RATING: 7
Solid game, though it drags with 4 players. I'd be inclined to play with 3.  2 might be too low, as you'd lose much of the cooperative aspect.

Either way, the estimated time of play is absolutely wrong. An hour for four players isn't likely to happen, IMO.  Based on my one play, I would guess a half hour per player, give or take.

Solid design on this game. You could think on a first glance it has nothing original, but I don't know why, despite a simple look, it has great complexity and a lot of replayability thanks to multiple playstyle and infinite combo possibility (6 factions, with possible 4 players games, that's a lot of possible combinations). Makes it greatly addictive !

I play this one on my Android. Probably one of the best board game port I have seen.

Good job on this one !

I'm not sure what to say about Xenoshyft other than that it feels like a kickstarter game.  The concept and theme are good, but some of the execution is lacking.  The troops are cool and I like that you can trade in the basic troops, but they will always be the same every game.  The items are also pretty cool, but some of them are way better than others (telekinesis for example).  We also played with the kickstarter heroes, which made the game a lot easier.

The enemies are pretty cool, but there is huge variance depending on which enemies show up and when.  Also, you may fight the boss or they may never come out.  

Overall it was a good concept, but way too much unpredictability and not enough replayability.  The different factions are the main variety because the troops are always the same and there aren't that many items to choose from.

Loving deckbuilding games and awesome artwork I bought XenoShyft Onslaught. THe insert are well made and component quality is fine. Not the best  cards used, but still playable. 
What I love is the ability to work and die together. You trade units, help out each other with abilities and so on. Even though it starts easy, it can become quite hard in the end. Hydras which come back, a Virus which takes over your unit or even revives them on the enemy side is just ridiculous. The game doesn't offer much variety and you've seen everything after playing it through a few times. Only variety it offers are the equipment cards.

Tried the app version, liked what I saw and ordered the physical version. Has a nice Starship Troopers feel and plays a bit like Thunderstone, but really coop and good solo play. Additionally it has quite quick play time when played solo. It's mostly a coop castle defense style game, but one where there is a lot of cooperation. I think I will like it for more plays and might even get it to the table with my pals, if only for the theme. But really, the insert is dumb - yes, it fits sleeved cards, but then they get pressed and bent from above. And you can't see what card is in what slot from above without pulling cards out. And no divider. All this combined with the random equipment market makes setup a little fiddly. Since this is fully coop and the solo game is just automatically running the same as if it was played on the table, I will include play counts from the app here.

There's not much unique at first blush, but getting your purchased cards immediately rather than having to wait for your deck to deplete/cycle is a big differentiator and has most impact on the game. There's an urgency here that's not present in other deckbuilders with conveyor belts like Thunderstone or even Legendary Encounters: Alien, because you're fending off [quite a variety of] attacks every turn, with a steadily-increasing difficulty throughout as you handle wave after wave guarding your base. Luckily your own firepower and gadgetry improve throughout as your resources pile up higher and higher, presumably from all the mining going on in the fiction of the game. The art is quite good and the game plays fast. Additionally - and I haven't had a chance to make use of this yet, so I'm not speaking authoritatively - the soldiers and gear you deploy can even be deployed to your [teammate] fellow players' troop tracks. That's pretty cool.

A Sci-Fi themed deck-builder with fantastic art and, unfortunately, mediocre gameplay. CoolMini put this out? Flip and remove, flip and remove, flip and take damage, rinse and repeat.

Thematically, Mechanically, and Cooperatively this game scores high for me.

Production quality is through the roof, I don't think I've seen cards this well produced before in a lot of board games, arguably the best I've ever seen anyway.

Thematically you do get a sense of "These aliens are trying to overrun our base, hold them off!" Tower-Defense like atmosphere as you engage through the game's rounds.

Mechanically I enjoy the concept, it is to me very very fresh and innovative in the board game industry. That being said, I've only played games probably that have been invented past 2k, so I wouldn't know if someone made this before. Nevertheless a refreshing game in the slew of board games that are being pumped out.

Cooperatively this game plays like other cooperative deck builders. You can use your cards to help out the other players. It's a little anticlimactic and I wish there were more to it than what I just said but that's the gist.

Content wise I feel is lacking. I've played this game a total of 4x now, and have won all 4 times, with 2-4 players. Only one of those games were we even close to losing. The game scales well in difficulty but the bosses I feel are a little lacking once you get to the 2nd+3rd tier where troop strength significantly boost. The amount of cards you get, while nice, DEFINITELY need an expansion to boost replayability. As it stands, this game is probably just good enough to teach new friends, but I don't see it being a re-occurrence until something new comes out for it.

Overall I do love the universe it presents itself in, the artwork is top-notch, mechanically fresh, produced extremely well. Just definitely needs more content to that 10 for me.

This is a rare breed, the deckbuilding co-op. It basically plays like the base invasion phase of X-COM, where your hastily gathered group of Space Marines tries to fend off an alien horde, all while being undersupplied and completely lacking intel on the invading monsters. I absolutely love it as a solo game, but it is incredibly difficult. There is enough variance in the starting decks to make all of the early turns incredibly dicey and even after you have powered up a bit, it's quite hard to outpace the invasion and build any predictability into your deck. 

It helps to have two or three players because soldiers and equipment can be shared between decks. That means that a bad hand drawn from one deck can be supplemented by another player who had a little better luck keeping his soldiers alive. It's an awful lot to juggle if you try to run multiple hands as a solo player, but I'm ten games in and have yet to win. I am starting to think multi-player is the only possible way to get over the hump. I'll have to get used to juggling decks because while I think it is a solid solo game, playing with other actual humans is kind of dull. The combat phase is basically a big math and timing puzzle. While those puzzles are super interesting individually, they're also completely non-interactive and boring to watch someone else try to solve. This makes me seriously doubt I'd ever want to play it in a real group.

I was a late Kickstarter backer for XenoShyft and had been following it along from time to time eagerly awaiting its arrival, but Cool Mini or Not doesn’t quite have the kinks worked out of the late backer system yet. While everyone who backed on Kickstarter is getting email updates you’re mostly in the dark. Imagine my surprise when I went to look at the page randomly one day and see it has shipped for a good number of people. I take a look at the pledge manager and see that I need to pay for shipping. I don’t care too much about the cost, but let a guy know, right?

Well, it shows up and I sleeve all of the cards because it’s a deckbuilder and these cards don’t look great, and I’m already thinking of selling it. I setup my first play and start in on it. I draw my six cards and look eagerly at my currency cards and my troops. I buy some more troops and a gun and lay it all down and manage to get through the first wave with no base damage. Then the second wave with no base damage either. Then the third, the fourth, the fifth, etc. The only time the base took damage was the ninth round and it just felt too easy. I posted on the BoardGameGeek forums asking if it was always this easy and everyone said no, it’s typically not. Then I wrangle my wife into trying it out, she looks at the cards and gives it the old college try while trying to suppress her I’d-rather-not look as best as she can (thanks hon!). We lost in the 7th round. Okay, that’s good my first game was a fluke.

However, sitting there after playing it neither of us were all that interested in giving it another shot. There weren’t a ton of decisions and lot of the game is just comparing numbers on your soldiers to the enemies and then deciding when to use your abilities and remaining cards. Admittedly there is a game here and for some folks, they’ll really love it. For us though, it’s mostly an experience of just comparing numbers and removing cards when the number is big enough or too small.

There are some strengths here: a lot of the stuff you want in other deckbuilders is here! You get one more currency card every single round and they get better as you move on. In later rounds you can scrap the cheaper currencies and upgrade to the better currencies at an even trade (e.g. three 1s turn into one 3, and two 3s turn into one 6). You can turn in weak soldiers to get a discount on later soldiers. If you run out of an item card in the offer, just draw a new one! All of these things feel better and they’re things you wanted, but ultimately it’s not what I needed. What I needed was a game that was more than just comparing numbers and hoping the draw didn’t screw me over.

Thankfully there are other folks who want to play and buy this game, I’ve already sold my copy!

This game is terrible, this isn't even a game. You make little to no decisions based off of information you have no clue about. It takes WAY too long with 4 players and is extremely boring.

Co-op tower defense deck building card game protecting the outer planetary base from waves of revealed alien bugs
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
We enjoyed this game for what it is:
A fight against an onslaught of alien bugs.

Think: Starship Troopers.

This game accommodates co-op playing in that cards may be played/deployed to other players, so  what each player has may be beneficial to another player. Each round of play provides opportunity to give cards to another, or assist in a fight.

There is certainly the random luck of drawing cards. However, this is mitigated by the purchase stage, where cards you purchase are put directly into your hand to be used that round rather than in the discard pile, as in other deck-building games.

What I really enjoy though, is that this game is precisely what I had hoped it would be...a continuous, tactical fight against enemies, with the sole goal to keep the base in tact until the end of the 9th round. It is a fun romp into bug-fighting territory, with enough variables to keep the game fresh.

Honestly, I'm not sure which would be more engaging: (a) working through a face-to-face session with a physical copy of the game or (b) all of us simultaneously playing digital versions on our own iPads (solitaire) in the same room.  The latter option sure has a lot less downtime.

Still, not bad for a thinking-outside-the-box deckbuilder.  With aliens.  Though I'm afraid there may be a fixed number of plays before the fun dissipates.

Oh lordy, lordy... this game scratches so many itches I don't know where to begin:

Deckbuilding? Check.
Sci-fi/Horror theme with amazing art?  Check. 
Intense Coop and Solo experience?  Check.
Tower defense?  Check.
Bugs, marines, guns, and explosives?  Check.
Brutal difficulty?  Check.  Well... most of the time.  But occasionally a cake walk.

The randomness of the upgrade/item draws can lead to some combos (or lack thereof) that leads to unusually difficult or easy games.  This issue is prevalent during solo play, and is more balanced in 2P+ as it's not likely for one player to monopolize a single OP card (of which there are several).  Downtime is rather significant with anything more than 3 players - expect a 2 to 3 hour game 4P (if the group wins).  Setup is rather tedious as there are countless stacks of cards you are sorting and searching for (items, troops, etc.)

My major criticisms for a game I enjoy primarily playing solo and occasionally 2P or 3P.

There is much downtime while you watch the other players do their combat.  I found some balancing issues, especially with the Kickstarter cards.  This seems like it would play better as a solo game. The art on the cards is very nice.

If you want a challenge, this is it! It interestingly defies a couple of deckbuilding game tropes (eg cards go directly into your hand when you purchase them; you can keep cards from round to round; money cards 'upgrade' themselves; you can give cards to other players to help them), preventing this from becoming too much of a bland deckbuilder. The art is very intense, which adds to the immersion. There's a wide array of item cards, but it would be nice to have a little more variety in lower level monsters. The game is fun and there's a lot you can do to create your team of X-Com soldiers. Cool game!

A coop that maximizes the cooperative mechanic. Your fellow players desperately need your help, they really are being overrun by alien bugs. That being said you can't help too much, you are also being overrun. It's messy and tension filled and pretty great.

Quite long for what it is. Not a bad deck builder definitely gives off the Starship Trooper vibe. Just really random and often won or lost depending on the 9 random gear cards that are drawn at the beginning.

Very nice deck builder. Unlike Pathfinder Adventure Game the co-op feeling is absolutely there. I like the way combat is resolved, I like the art, there are cool equipement cards (some overpowered? pulsar bomb coming to mind). Only downside is that the game is way too easy. But it's fun.

Xenoshyft is an incredible deck builder with loads of customizable options and unique strategies. Literally my only complaint that it can be a bit swingy, in that you can get ahead of the curve and have no trouble or else get behind the curve and get demolished.

rating for base game only.  The expansions may add a bit to it, but yes I didn't like the randomness of the enemies coming in, and it seemed a bit too hard.  I understand 'too hard' is a relative term, and no one wants to be able to get a over 50% win ratio, but win you lose every time, and it isn't close, either I'm terrible at this type of game, or the game is too hard, or both.  Just not for me.

reminded me of space hulk, which is still hard, but I liked much better

Very neat game, love games that give deck-building a sense of purpose. Completely variable difficulty. Interesting diversity in items. The troops are really neat, and work well.

My only complaint? The box insert has plenty of slots for all the cards, but zero indication of how I'm supposed to use them. Some are thin, some are thick, some are really thick, and nothing seems to fit remotely well. The thickest stack is too small for the widest slot, and too wide for any other slot. Every other game with an insert like that (Dominion, Arctic Scavengers, Legendary) have labels, and the insert was designed on purpose. This seems like they had a card game, needed an insert, took the first one they saw, and said good enough. The insert also has little wells for the impossible-to-pick-up tokens, but I'll never store them there. They're going to live in the little bags, in the wells that seem to be designed to hold two small bags of tokens.

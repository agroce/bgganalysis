Really good 2-player traditional trick-taking card game played mainly in Austria.

I nearly always carry a pack of playing cards with me to be able to play Schnapsen.

Nagy gyerekkori kedvenc, néhány időpontot tudtam csak így utólag beazonosítani, de rengetegszer játszottuk egészen a 80-as évektől napjainkig. (magyar kártya)
Jó játék, de bizonyos rutin felett egysíkú, túl egyértelmű. A 4-est szeretem leginkább, a 2 személyes elég unalmas.

Zweier-Schnapsen is quite a good 2-player trick-taking card game; better than the 3- and 4-player variants. A good player can sometimes win with even a bad hand, and  can maximize their points and minimize the opponent's points from wins and losses alike.

Quick 2-player trick taking game played over multiple hands.

Rules are easy, about the only annoying part is remembering your score (and opponents, and what other cards have been played if necessary).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Really fun, fast-playing and deceptively simple 2-player point-trick, trick-and-draw game, which are both novel concepts to someone like me who grew up playing lots of Euchre.

Great mix of luck and strategy with plenty of tough decision making (should I play this low-valued King or Queen - to trump the trick or slough it off - or save it for a potential high-scoring marriage??).

My kids and I play with a marked up standard deck that has the point values written on them and keep track of our points on a Cribbage board. 

I think it would be almost impossible to play against kids while keeping track of score in our heads. Removing that element really helps level the playing field. 

I almost never close the stock (choose to stop drawing new cards because I think I can win), mostly because I haven't nailed down that part of the strategy enough to use it for myself or to teach it. Which probably reflects negatively on my ability as a card player, but also shows just how deep this game is. After dozens and dozens of plays, there's still another layer of strategy that we haven't even touched.

This has become THE go-to for my 1-on-1 game time with both my 10 year-old and 7 year-old. Briscola was a great intro to point-trick takers for us, but that game falls completely flat in comparison now (though I still want to try it with 5 players).

Schnapsen is a lovely little 2p card game played with only 20 cards with a surprising amount of depth. When we first started playing around the house it was almost a guarantee that a marriage meant victory, but as we've played more the mitigating tactics around handling marriages and the hole left in the holding hands have become (more) clear. At this point no marriage guarantees a hand is won. It's fun to discover more depth to this game as we play more.

Schnapsen is another delightful discovery through the miracle that is BGG.  Where Ninety-Nine fills the need for a great 3 player trick-taking game with trumps, Schnapsen gives two card players a nice alternative to Cribbage, Lost Cities, Gin Rummy and the like.  Some score keeping for beginners might be a good idea until players get comfortable with the card values.

After playing the game versus the computer a few times I taught the game to my wife and we played our first game last evening.  The memory element will take some getting used to...we looked at our tricks to refresh our memories as to how many points we accumulated.  When 3 strong trump are drawn as part of a starting hand reaching 66 points before an opponents gets a single point is very probable.

My Schnapsen cards are simply half of a good pinochile deck and (along with Hive) continues to be a game I always travel with.  It is especially practical during air travel when all you have is that small, tray table.

We play Sixty Six, including 9s.  Very tight game, two distinct phases in each hand where rules change; power and value of cards changes along the way.  Needs a lot of concentration, but gratifying.  I play with my mom, a bridge player, and she likes it a lot.

RATING: 7
An excellent 2-player card game, best played with a German deck to get the authentic experience. As with all trick taking games, there's a high luck factor in which cards you draw, especially for the trumps as suit does not have to be followed for the first half of the game. The need to keep the score in your head rules out any possibility of light-hearted banter, indeed no talking should really be the rule. Sometimes there's little that you can do except play out the hand, but the experience is incredibly more-ish even after a bad hand or two (or three!).

RATING: 7
OOOOOO I knew I'd like this.  Some VERY cool things here.

Push your luck here in Spades (no punn), trying to hold Kings or Queens for Marriages, playing a Marriage before someone closes, playing point cards in 1st phase, holding the low trump before switching it, when to call 66 (and to try and call it before your opponent) and when to close the deck also before your opponent, all juicy stuff and creates good tension. 

Also cool is how cardplay is different in the 2 phases. First phase you do NOT have to follow suit, playing point cards is dangerous, in the 2nd phase (after someone closes) you DO have to follow suit and win tricks when you can as well.  

Another highly overlooked and slightly underrated very good addicting 2 player trick taking game. I prefer playing the tighter game with only 20 cards total, 5 in hand and the Pagat rules. Funny thing here too, while I am an avid houseruler anywhere I deem necessary I don't even think the scoring needs tweaking here at all (for a change). 

[u]UPDATE:[/u]  Played a few more games of this, its a FUN game that you need to focus for while playing (tracking the small amount of cards) but its not the deepest game so don't expect it, more than some for sure (especially only counting 2 player card games) and not as much as a few others. There is a luck factor of course, I don't think its too high for this game and/or for this length (20 minutes).  You can have some dramatic scoring as noted in the rules though, someone can be winning 6-0 only to lose to a wicked come back so luck can be a factor. 

[u]UPDATE[/u] 8 => 7.5 After a whole bunch of games the luck factor is a little higher than I would like but the game is very enjoyable to play. Will always come back to this one.

RATING: 5
A two-player card game of the same general type as Briscola, with all the non-scoring cards ripped out and with some additional wrinkles. Definitely more devious, but I don't get the focus on drawing the king and queen of trumps, and there's a lot of counting of cards and points to determine when to close if you want to play well. As with many traditional card games there's a million variations in the gameplay and scoring details.

(Really I’ve mostly played Sechsundsechzig, which is a German version with a six card hand and with the nines in the deck.) A favorite of mine among two player card games — and the only two player trick taking game I care for at all.  I like the tension behind when to close the stock, and the unusual cardplay without the need to follow suit.  Marriages are a bit weird, though.  (Yes, 6.6 is my real rating, not just a pun on the game’s name.)

Surprising intensity in such a small deck! 66 includes 9s (worth zero) and uses hands of 6 cards, Schapsen omits 9s and uses hands of 5 cards. I have a slight preference for the smaller game, but it's great either way.

A repetitive, luck driven card game. Used to be popular with the working-class of Hungary back during the socialism, who played this mainly in cheap, dodgy pubs for pennies. Only entertaining while drinking with your mates. I used to play this a lot as a young kid (without the booze, of course!) but only because we did not know any better.

First impression: A trick-taking game with some twists. Only 20 cards in deck and you have hand of 5 cards and replenish back to five after every trick. Most of the time you don't have to follow suit and therefore you don't always know what the opponent has in hand. Rules were quite tricky when heard but became clear while playing.

It's a 2 player time-passer trick taking game, similar in spirit to others where you play 1 draw 1, try and remember what's gone, can guess what the other might have picked up yet and play accordingly. Can't be taken too seriously as a result.

March 2015: After playing this for awhile, just realized this is much, much deeper than it appears. When we first started playing, we would rarely close the deck. Now, we do it quite often.

Next stage of strategy is to figure out how to lead big cards early in the game ti better learn of your opponent's hand (rather than holding your good cards back for the end game).


July 2011: This game feels a bit like gambling.

In this game, you could choose to end the game prematurely if you think you could win with the last 5-6 tricks (depending on which variant you're playing). The earlier you "close," the more you're pushing your luck.

Still, the luck factor is huge in this game, but it plays incredibly quickly. I'd definitely play this over Cribbage.

--Sep2010-- Fine little card game; good two-player dynamics.  I've played the 66 rules; including the 9s in the deck.  I can imagine that the version that only uses 10-A is a bit more ferocious.  (Marked "owned" because I now have a nice _William Tell_ deck with which to play:  Thanks, John!)

RATING: 8
An interesting 2 stage point based trick taking game that plays out rather quickly. There can be wild swings of luck but like many other games this is tempered by multiple plays. 
There's an interesting mix of tactics and strategy in deciding when to score points especially in the first half where the game neatly encourages you to hand control to your opponent, as compared to many other games where the focus is all about retaining control. Of course in the second half you have to follow suit and here handing off control can mean the end. 
For the time it takes to play I'm fairly taken with it. The comparisons to cribbage at first seemed out of place but having played a little I can see the similarities coming through; easy to learn, quick to play, some luck but game after game there's that special something here. That rhythm of drawing a cards, playing a card, calling out marriages, counting your points. As social games go this one is worth playing.

Classic 2 handed point trick game from Austria/Germany. There are some rules ambiguities so check the forums. This feels an important niche as there are very few 2 handed card games with this much thinking. ALso important historically for trick/draw concept, so this should be studied just to see something that is probably pretty close to the original ancestor of trick/draw games.

Nice two player trick taking game with an element of counting and memorization. I'd play this if I wanted to drill on my card skills for other games.

UPDATE: After giving the game another try with my wife, I have to say that I enjoyed it much more than I originally did. Perhaps it's because I have more experience with point-trick games (as opposed to eight years ago when I originally tried Sixty-Six). I would gladly play this game now.

A game with an incredibly long history in my family. Have played this in the hundreds across 3 decades. 

Nothing beats this, plenty of beer, and my grinning grandfather at the other end of the table.

The 4 player variant is vicious, and features all the greatness that comes with non-open communication. The better you know your gaming partner in a 2 vs. 2 the more it will pay off.

Be sure to check on the history of the artwork:

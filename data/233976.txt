GAME: Pie Town
RANK: 4882

RATING: 6.5
Probably truly a 5.5 rating, but I'm giving it an extra point for the nice theme (my wife loves it). It also likely plays better at a higher player count. I'd worry that the early game is scripted, and the later game doesn't have super interesting decisions, but I'm still enjoying it.

Was sold to me as a "simplified" Alchemists but didn't quite do the trick.  I found that in our game that there was very little deduction (it is possible to create enough pies that your opponent can't deduce anything, or if they do it is very little that they can't guess by the end of the game).  As for spying, that isn't really deduction and is just peaking at the other person's pie.

On the plus side, the artwork is wonderfully cute and cartoony.  

Alchemists still is super hard to bring to the table because of the long teach and gameplay length, but I certainly wouldn't bring in Pie Town to take its place.

Fun and easy to pick up.  Very light but I really wish that guessing the special recipe was a bigger part of the game.

RATING: 5
Game rules as written are a 5.  Scripted play and uninteresting obvious choices, with much of the deduction and attempting to bake others' pies never bothered with. We play with house rules (about 15 of them, see the variant posts) and it becomes a 7 for us.

Pie Town is amazing! If you are on the fence about this one I can tell you as a fan of worker placement and not such a fan of social deduction, that this game is still a gem. It has a some great mechanics that I haven't seen in many other games and it is easy to pick up yet has a fair amount of depth. It can make a huge difference if someone knows your secret recipe but you can take an action to change it at a penalty. The theme is tight and the components are great. There is a huge amount of trust you must have in your opponents that they have the right combination of ingredients to bake the pies they say they are as they present the ingredients for all to see but they are mixed together so you don't see how they are grouped. This process can be a little finicky and could benefit from player shields. I'd give this game a solid 8 out of 10 pies for coming hot out of the oven without any half-baked ideas. Daniel Fremgen has made a great game and I look forward to seeing more from this new American designer.

Light family game with a charming theme in which players gather ingredients and bake pies to score the most points. Each baker gets to make up a secret pie recipe at the beginning of the game which adds an interesting deduction element to the game. Unfortunately I found that it was too easy to wait until you have all the possible ingredients before baking so that there is no way that opponents can deduce your secret recipe. The art is very colorful and the game comes with really chunky dice to act as your workers. Overall, it's a bit too light for my taste, but it's a nice introduction to worker placement and deduction mechanisms for younger family members.

Interesting theme, but boring decisions. The deduction element extends the game longer than it should. It really outsays its welcome. I was ready for the game to end a half hour before it finally ended.

I (too) simple worker placement game with a hidden point scoring condition.  The fact that it is hidden is important to the game but has only minimal consequences on the score so seems to fail.

There are a couple (OK really only one) theme choice that I don't agree with.  But this is a really fun and quickly lite to medium euro where the minor deduction gives players even more of a reason to pay attention to each other.  Also, there is a nice blend of classic euro worker placement blocking and lite engine building on your own mat.  The selling of pies is my favorite part of the game, it really cranks up the interaction with the players where players have to seel each other's pies or run the risk of not selling any pies at all!

Played only with two players, which was not very compelling. It seemed like there were too limited a number of types of actions, so we both kept doing similar things. There didn’t seem to be any tense decisions to make. Many other worker placement games I would rather play, although the theme is fun and all of the actions make sense thematically (so is easy to quickly understand).

The deduction element is very light. The comparisons to Alchemists are totally off base. This is a completely different game with a totally different style of “deduction.” However, it plays quickly with a lot to think about. How do you manage your workers, upgrades, and baking and selling pies?

"Overall, Pie Town is fun, but I think, ironically, that I wish it had swapped its length with Ex Libris, as Ex Libris is a bit denser, more text-heavy, and harder to learn (in my opinion), whereas this is a light, fun, and upbeat game that's simple and straightfoward but takes a fairly long time to build up its engine. Once you get going, it's fun and heated (even if I'm not convinced the deduction element of it always lands, for me), but those first couple rounds feel like they could be streamlined, and that might be something I try in the future. On the other hand, if you're trying to convince someone to try more Euros (I guess? I don't know if I understand the distinction and I'm not looking to learn so don't @ me.) and want to bring them in with a friendlier theme than "whatever Renaissance thing", this is definitely a very welcoming game. I just wish the round marker were a little bit bigger."

Very good, but the spy aspect is very weak. Discovering a secret recipe should be worth a LOT more than just 4 points.

Deduction element is completely disinteresting. I think people are into this for the theme. No real interesting game here.

love that the workers in this one are dice and you need to control numbers to do certain things. Plays really well and I think it's a neat spin on worker-placements.

Pie Town has some neat elements like variable worker levels but I can't help but feel that the game is too long. While the deduction aspect somewhat fits the theme, I think it felt pasted on and superfluous. And because of that deduction element, the game length increased almost one third. The last three or four rounds were just preparing for the final scoring (deduction) because everything else was already done.

Again, there were some nice things here, but the game length kills this for me. Not enough meaningful decision for the whole 90 minutes.

Dice worker placement game. Light and friendly game about baking pies. You might try and sneak to learn other players secret recipes but mostly you are just baking the pies you can with your actions. Never get to roll the dice though. Very cute game and more meat on the bones than it first appears.

Eh. It is an okay worker-ish placement game where your workers are dice that give bonuses based on how many pips they have. The idea is interesting and the whole "secret recipe" is neat, but ultimately feels a bit tacked on and clumsy in execution. Ultimately, it might be a good game for people new to the genre, but I don't think it has enough depth to be interesting long term.

Good introduction to worker placement games for enthusiast gamers who want to bring new gamers into the world of worker placement Euros.  The theme is great, and the secret recipe element adds a twist to the traditional worker placement that is quirky and unique.  The,atically, this extra guessing of others’ secret recipes integrates a Clue-like deduction mechanism to the game.

I did not expect to like this. It looks like a kid's game with very limited decision making, but holy moly it can get cutthroat! The dice make for an interesting take on worker placement and the strategy around secret pies makes for some funny player interaction. Very solid game.

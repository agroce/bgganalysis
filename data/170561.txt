Backed the kickstarter. Love the art, and since Machi Koro is a top family game for us, it was a must add.

We have played this game a couple of times and it's a HIT in my house hold.
I love the artwork, the domains are my favorite.
The rules are simple and easy to teach. It's roll dice and get resources, and you have to be paying attention to the rolls of others because you might be getting resources on their rolls.
With the gold resource you are either buying Citizens or Domains that help you get more resources.
Or you are using the fight resources to clear out the areas and killing the monsters close by.
Magic resources count as a wild, and can be used with money or shields to help cover the costs.
The way to win is based heavy on the Duke you start with. So the root to winning changes each time you play ( well at least till you have tried them all ).
I think this is a solid game and will get much love in my house and with my friends.
The box is awesome and seems to make set up easy.
The Cards are the only let down but are looking better each time we play.
They came out and became warped but are getting better.

I have only played this once (as a two-player game) but we really enjoyed the experience. If you like Dominion, Catan and Splendour, you'll probably really love this game. Light and fun. The only reason I can't go with a 10 star rating, is because the two player game seemed to last about 15 minutes longer than either of us wanted. Might "adjust" the piles of buyable citizens and remove 2 per stack for another heads up game.

Sort of a median between Machi Koro and Catan, everyone gets to do something on every turn and the mechanics are really intuitive and sensible. Great, colorful artwork, and its ripe for expansions, though the ones I've gotten so far are really small. I do like the idea of 'Events' in place of the normal Exhausted cards so I'll generally use those.

I want to like this. I have only played it solo. I kind of want it to replace Machi Koro or at least takes it's place for a while. The problem is that I am not a huge fan of VP gathering, in most cases. I much prefer the winning condition be a race to complete some objective or set of objectives. We'll see how I like this when I finally get a chance to play it with others.

After first play, I was impressed! 

First off the Game components.
The box is very well designed. Easy set up, and clean up. Its obviously planned to fit all the expansions that will come out for the game, and I will be sure to get those expansions! 
The cards are sturdy and even tho you dont really handle the cards much they will hold up
The 2 dice in the game are custom oversized dice that have the same number font that the cards have on them, and they feel good to hold and roll.
The wooden tokens are a nice upgrade from cardboard tokens which always feel "cheap" in my mind.

Gameplay is straightforward and simple, and there is pleanty of strategy to be thought of. and the nice thing is that when its not your turn you are kept engaged by the game mechanics so the strategy you thought you were going to go for after your turn was over, may have changed by the time its your turn again because you got a luck roll result on your opponents turn.
(more than once I wanted to do something and I was just 1 resource short of doing something but with an lucky off turn roll, I got that resource and could do my awesome plan after all!) so that mechanic is really well implemented.

The art on the cards and the over all look of the game is very pleasing to the eyes and has good table presence. 

Since I only have 1 play, I dont think I can give it a score yet, but I think it will be a high score.

***EDIT***

After a few more plays, Im really liking the game. Its been quick to teach people, and easy for them to pick up the concepts. I had more fun playing with a 3 and 4 player game than I had playing 2 player since the rapid turns make you think very often and dont get much of a chance to interact with players plus your resources are lower in a 2 player game and i found myself not always being able to do 2 actions and having to take the consolation prize of 1 resource. 3 and 4 player makes for more conversation and more "feel good" gameplay.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
My Impressions are based off the PnP that is currently available during the kickstarter.  I found the engine for the game to an interesting take on Thunderstone / Machi Koro.  It doesn't really steal anything from either game, as it felt more like a evolution.  The gameplay is right around the perfect length for what the game is and I also found the artwork throughout to be great!  I do have a few complaints however.  My first one, and the largest complaint is the variability the game offers.  While i know by playing with the PnP, I am missing another hero class per #, but even then I still felt like it needs more heroes.  There for sure isn't enough monsters.  In the PnP, we have all the monster groups, so ya, there needs to be a ton more monster groups.  The Domains were randomized, so you don't see them all per game, which was nice, but there still needs to be more.  This felt a lot like the first Machi koro set... not enough too really show its true colors, it needs more cards!  My initial rating is a 7, but I am excited to see where this one goes.

Update 1 (3/25/15):
------------------------
4p has a bit too much downtime.  It only took about an hour, but it just felt like it dragged on a bit.  Also after 3 games, I am already starting to tire on the monsters / citizens.  This game really needs more cards... :P

While it's best compared to Machi Koro, I find that in our house, it scratches the itch that Catan used to.  If it weren't for the long setup time, we'd bust it out a lot more often.  Always a satisfying experience.

Fantastic game! So much fun to play. Very much like Machi Koro, but it fixes all the problems I have with that game and makes me actually enjoy playing it. In fact, after finishing the first play through, I immediately went and dumped Machi Koro: Bright Lights, Big City into the 'for sale' pile to make room for beautiful Valeria! The game's a blast, every turn you're doing something, it's a little random each time, the cards and great quality and gorgeous, and the insert is FANTASTIC. Love the printed, labeled dividers as well. Very pleased to have received for my birthday!

Only the PnP version (which is missing half the citizens, so no option to customise). Even at this it's a great filler, interesting decisions and you're involved all the time.

** Update, now have premium PnP, all good :)

*** Update, wore out the PnP, now have the commercial release, which is better than the PnP, some domains tweaked, rules tweaked. Big hit with family.

After playing Valeria: Card Kingdoms, I don't think I can justify going back to Machi Koro. I appreciate the simplicity of Machi Koro, but Valeria: Card Kingdoms just takes the idea and amps it up, makes it look cooler, and makes it more fun. I'd definitely recommend this as a style of gateway game as well.

RATING: 6.5
I really, really hated Machi Koro, and was afraid I would hate this as well. I'm happy to say, I like it! I still think it's more lucrative to go for a wide spread of numbers (boring) rather than focus on one particular strategy/card type (fun!), but it's still very fast and fun, and does not have the "I steal one/You steal one" tug-of-war that was such a problem in Machi Koro. 

If I had one complaint, it's that there aren't 5 or 10 denominations of the resources, because counting them up can be tedious every turn, and the multiplier tokens are fiddly and kind of a pain to use.

RATING: 9
Having had this on our gaming radar for some time, we finally broke down and ordered it. Needless to say, it has lived up to the hype.

Initial set-up for the first game took a few minutes, but once staged, the gameplay itself was intuitive and fast. While similar to Machi Koro with the "everyone benefits" mechanic, the execution of it is smooth and the growth in-game is well planned. By the end, we were cheering when certain numbers popped up and gathered a small crowd of curious on-lookers who wanted to join for the next round.

The components (other than the cards as noted below) are top-notch. The punch-board multiplier tokens are some of the thickest I've ever used and the dice are impressively large. Rolling feels more like an event instead of a mechanic. Daily Magic Games also provides organization tab-cards that allow you to separate each card type individually for future games (much like how Dominion has labeled slots in their box). This significantly decreases the hassle of finding "Hills monsters" among your Citizens or confusing Start-Up Knights with Citizen Knights. It's a small touch, but dramatically impacts the set-up for every game beyond the first one. So much so that I am more inclined to reach for this now than I would a game where the first 5-10 minutes is spent separating everything. Additionally, the foam inserts provided ensure components remain secure during transport, but allow for future expansions or sleeving of cards to be added without worry that you'll run out of space.

There is, however, one critical flaw: our copy suffers from the infamous Card Curl. Cards began curving/warping the moment we removed them from the plastic packaging. During set-up of the initial game, we watched as the majority of the cards bent or warped. After the game, we placed them in the proper tab-organizers and packed the foam inserts in tight, but the cards still warped when we checked them the following morning. We'll be contacting DMG regarding that matter.

Despite the ding in card-quality, the game is impressive. It's fun, fast, and furious. The constant player involvement means little to no down-time. Beginners will pick it up quickly while veteran gamers will enjoy the strategy of figuring out which Citizen, Monster, or Domain to pick to maximize results. Between its speed of play, versatility of tactics, and wide appeal to a variety of gamer levels, Valeria Card Kingdoms now sits near the top of our go-to games.

I won this game at International Tabletop Day 2017 in Nashville. I wasn't for sure what I was getting into when I picked it up off the table, but I'm glad I did! This game has been wonderful to play and is beautiful to boot!

First of all, the components for this game is top notch. Wooden tokens for Gold, Magic,  Strength, and Victory Point resources are quality made. The dice that come with the game have some weight to them and feel great to roll. They are slightly larger as well, so they don't really tumble across the table (for those of you without a dice tower). The insert in the box is extremely well done. Daily Magic thought of everything when designing this. There is a place to hold all of the resources, and dividers for the cards to keep them separated by type, and foam as well for further division. This makes setup and break down extremely easy. Also, don't forget to admire all of the art on the cards, seriously, these look great!

The game play is easy to pick up on, and can get complicated when coming up with a strategy to win. You set up with a 4 by 5 grid of stacked cards, 5 cards in each stack. The top row is monster cards, the next two rows are citizen cards, and the last row is dominion cards. While playing the game, you use gold to buy citizen cards (sometimes rewarded by other means) and when you roll the dice, the citizen cards activate to generate more resources for you to spend. Citizen cards can activate on your turn as the active player, or another players turn as a group activation. The goal of the game is to have the most victory points at games end. Please look up other explanations of the game out there if this interests you.

I know that it says best with 3 players, but I've played this consistently with my wife and we've had a great time with two! There is even a solo mode that I haven't tried, but it seems just as fun! If deck builders interest you, I fully recommend looking into this game!

RATING: 8
Played this game waiting for a demo table of another game, ended up buying the game.  Overall, a very tight little game that's very casual (think about Kingsburg or Citadels).  You build your own tableau of cards that act as a target for dice rolls, and use the result of the dice rolls to expand your tableau, kill monsters & take territories.  Takes about 5 minutes to set up.  Game appears to have very good ongoing support.  Game CAN drag if people decide to chase points rather than just kill piles.

After a couple more plays, the trick is to figure out when to stop tableau building and start chasing victory points.  Leave too late, and you're awash in resources but don't have enough opportunities to spend. Too early and your machine isn't running enough to compete.  

5 players is minorly annoying, as we kept forgetting that the 'resting' player shouldn't take resources.

This game was a delightful surprise that we found at a table top con.  From the moment we began playing we fell in love.  The game mechanics are simple deck building, but with a variety of strategies toward victory.  The artwork is gorgeous and all cards and components are high quality.

As in Catan, your tableau will produce different resources depending on the dice rolls. You'll use those resources to acquire cards that tend to advance the goals on your goal card. At times, the game almost plays itself, but it's fun. The added resources and the ability to use multiple numbers on each roll cause me to prefer the game to Machi-Koro.

RATING: 7.7
Simple dice tableau building game, fantasy theme makes it way better than Machi Koro for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game surprised me in how compelling it is, and it totally fired Machi Koro. While you have the usual trope of buying new cards and expanding/deepening your tableau for die rolls, you're also vying for VP cards and special power cards. In addition, you each have a unique endgame VP card which sets you off on somewhat separate paths. These extra elements -- along with the fact it's not as attacky -- make it much more interesting for me.

The cards you acquire have symbols on them. You'll need to collect certain symbols in order to qualify for the special power cards (which are all unique). The VP cards are bought in order from weakest to strongest so you have to decide if it's worth buying some that may unlock better ones for the rest of the table. 

And lastly, there's a mechanism whereby the player last on each turn is "resting." This means they don't get anything from the dice roll that turn. It adds the right amount of uncertainty to the proceedings.

RATING: 7
Machi Koro was too easy, Dice City was too boring.  This is exactly what I wanted Machi Koro to be.  Always involved, always building towards something, always gaining resources.  Not remotely heavy but very enjoyable.

Like Machi Koro, but I enjoyed this more.  My one concern in a multi-player game is the phenomenon of one player uncovering a boss monster for the person after him or her.

RATING: 5.5
Whats interesting/different with this one is EVERYONE benefits from the die roll at the start of each turn, and gathers resources, this quickly leads to a very strange situtation whereby you usually have plenty of gold/strength... way more than the most expensive of the purchasable cards, to the whole game degenerates into a race for the most victory points, which is dissappointing.

Card art is good, and the game itself was enjoyable enough however end game conditions are a little strange and can result in players not getting he same number of turns, thus putting players later in the turn order at a disadvantage.

Great game. It was derived from / inspired by Machi Koro

RATING: 7.2
This deck building game most closely follows Machi Koro with dice determining which cards on the table are activated.  Also the leveled Monsters in Valeria are similar to the leveled Heros in Thunderson, where both are available in order from lowest to highest.

The stunning art work is eye candy and adds to the enjoyment of this game.  The cards are simple and easily understood with symbols a nice size for easy reading.  Players benefit from cards during everyone's turns which keeps players engaged in the game.  The game should move along quickly, lasting less than an hour.  

I like it better than Machi Koro which isn't artistically interesting,  tends to get bogged down with the expansions and all the card text.   So Valeria stands as a very nice, gateway, deck building game.

I am a gamer who loves "heavy" games - this is about as interesting as a "light" game can be. Good if you want a game to play with "light" gamers or young kids. Recommend removing one card from each monster and villager stack to speed up game a little.

I was hoping for a Machi Koro killer, but Valeria was a disappointment. Sad because I really like the illustrations. The Mico is one of my favorite artists.

Valeria is resource madness. More than half of the game time is for dealing out resources. This game needs player boards with resource markers. Why are the domain cards not getting better (and more expensive) like the monsters? Nobody was willing to buy them, instead everybody was hoarding resources.

VCK uses the same main mecanism than Machi-koro (Mini-villes) but IMHO improves it. I really prefer to play VCK than Mini-villes. Games are faster and addons/expansions are well integrated. I like TheMico's illustrations. 
8/10 because it's a geme I will propose and enjoy for 3 or 4 players for less than on hour game. My children (11-14-17 yo) like this game. It's easy to put on the table and fun to play. A good family game with some random but you can control it a bit and try to use your Duke to earn a lot of VPs.

A machi koro spin off game that incorporates monster killing (vp and resources) instead of just tablo building.

The game is less punsihing than machi koro as there are very little take that elements, at least in the base game. The resources also start flowing very quickly because you get procs off each dice and the combined total of both dice, giving you 3 possible resource income values every turn. And if you get no procs, you still get 1 resource of your choice

The game was great when it first came out in pnp and we played it several times. However after 5+ plays now, I'm a bit bored of it because it feels like just going through the mechanics. There aren't enough different combos you can setup to differentiate yourself from another player and most people end up getting 1 of each 1-6 number and then specializing based on what their bonus types are. There is a bit of a cat and mouse going on toward the end with regards to who will get to kill the final boss monster of a stack (you don't want to enable someone else to grab it)

A solid game but a bit light for my taste. I still prefer machi koro for the visceral effects you feel from some of the highs and lows in that game. Play time is similar enough (machi koro is about 45-1h, this game is 30-45)

One play with five players, which I wouldn't recommend due to downtime. Basically a heavier version of Machi Koro, with multiple resources instead of just coins. Set up and tear down seem like it could be a bear, and for me, may not be worth the time/energy for the game you get. Would be happy to play at game night, but not something I would look to add into my collection.

Overall, a very fun game. The dopamine jolt on each player's turn as the dice trigger payouts to other players is awesome, and has a similar feel to being at a craps table. Cha-ching! The mid-game is the most fun, when players have diverged in their Citizen purchases enough for the dice to pay off differently for each player.

The main weakness I find in the design is that the original end-game is probably too long as designed, with players doing little but accumulating obscene amounts of resources to count toward their Duke's win conditions. While it feels good to rake in the resources after building out your tableau, it also feels perfunctory, and there are almost no choices to be made. I simply wish there were something to do with all of those resources that was more interesting.

In theory, buying Domains are where players should use all those end-game resources, but the Domains are often just not interesting enough by the end, and/or don't pay in comparison with the VPs (as resources) needed to buy them. Some structure to the stacking of the Domains might better provide consistent rising action, but that would also require a redesign and rebalancing of the Duke cards.

The Flames & Frost expansion looks like it might address the end-game somewhat with higher-level Domains and Agents. Will have to see.

erster Eindruck Valeria Königreich der Karten:
Gestern kam es an und natürlich haben wir es sofort gespielt - ich habe keine Pile of Shame ;) und was soll ich sagen - die Enttäuschung ist echt groß. Wir spielen echt gern Dominion, Klong, MachiKoro - sprich Spiele wo man Karten zieht, dadurch was aufbaut und wenn das dann noch mit ein wenig Würfelglück ist, wie bei MachiKoro - macht das Spaß.

Valeria fanden wir gestern einfach nur langweilig. Der Grund war, dass es keine emotionalen Momente gab.
1. Man hat soviele Ressourcen, dass man aus allem immer auswählen kann, es gibt nicht's worauf du sparen kannst.
2. Es gibt auch keine Interaktion. Ja, es gibt Gebiete, wo dir ein Mitspieler ein Mana geben muss, aber da man eh genug hat, tut das gar nicht weh. Es schnappt dir auch keiner wirklich ne Karte weg, da gefühlt es egal ist welche Gebiete du kaufst - ob du den Effekt, wie - es kostet ein Mana weniger oder du bekommst ein Mana, wenn du ein Monster erschlägst - total unwichtig erscheint.
Ja am Ende bringen die meisten Ressourcen dann Siegpunkte, aber da man die irgendwie eh anhäuft, ist es am Ende dann nur ein Gezähle.

Bei Dominion lieben wir, wirklich ein krasses Deck zusammen zu stellen, wo man sich freut, wenn man dann so einen richtig guten Zug machen kann
Bei Machi Koro ist es schwer wirklich die 30 Geld zusammen zu bekommen (wobei schwer relativ ist - ist ja auch nur ein familienfreundliches Spiel) - wir finden es toll, dort dem anderen auch was zu klauen und sich zu ärgern.
Bei Klong ist die Gefahr des Drachens da, man kommt manchmal nicht weiter, weil man wieder keine Schritte hat oder oder.

Keine Ahnung wo der Reiz bei Valeria liegt. Es braucht eine Erweiterung, die fies ist? Die mal reinschlägt?

Wir haben auch die kleinen Erweiterungen, da gibt es Ereignisse, das war eine große Hoffnung, wir haben sie durchgelesen - nix Schlimmes, nichts was weh tut und - was wieder ein Mana oder so bringt, ist nichts zum Jubeln.

Sehr sehr schade, denn - die Box ist toll, das Material ist toll, die Grafiken sind toll - und ja, das hat uns geblendet.

Natürlich werden wir nochmal spielen. Wir überlegen, ob wir Regeln modifizieren, z.B. dass wenn der andere dran ist, man nicht auch die Ressourcen bekommt, sondern der andere sich die Ressourcen beim anderen nehmen kann. Irgendso was. Oder es liegen nicht alle Bewohner in der Auslage, sondern es wird gemischt und nachgezogen, es sind immer andere 6 da... keine Ahnung.

Wir hoffen noch ein wenig nur ein winzig wenig Adrenalin zu entzünden. Dmait das Sammeln, was wir lieben auch Spaß macht.

Huch wurde lang ;)

Played at Salt Lake Gaming Con.  Beautiful art.  After the initial explanation, I was really excited for play.  About 1/3 of the way through the first game, suspicion started to creep in that it might actually be really samey, as everyone seemed to be pursuing the same basic strategy.  But then the scores ended up with a pretty broad range of variance.  We played again with a variant where we shuffled the worker decks together so that the ones available for purchase weren't constant, and it felt much more satisfying.  So now I'm back to lukewarm excitement for it.

Basically, this game will live or die on whether it can get out sufficient expansions.  If there were 5 or more different cards for each die roll number, the variance and replayability would be endless.   Not sure it will get enough expansions though.  I wish them luck.

Much better but feels a bit like Catan, with stuff to do, fortunately.
Down time with 3 players was higher than I expected. Might need to add a 30-second timer for players, to be started when all players whose turn it isn't are done getting resources.
(The faces of people in the art... Funny-but-sigh...)
I'd play if asked, but wouldn't push it to the table.
The game might leave my collection at some point.

Good fun, lovely art, easy to play. but takes a bit long for what it is. No real strategy to it but super fun when your numbers come up. Killing monsters feels a bit flawed as you end up purposefully not killing stuff as it would mean the next player gets to kill something better underneath what you just killed.

Roll dice until someone wins. Boring and very luck dependent. I guess that's to be expected for a game this light, but it wasn't even as though it was particularly quick. It could be fun if you just like getting things. The way the monsters work is also frustrating, that you have to go through the weak guys before you can fight the ones you want to, and so there are these weird seating order issues that come up. The worst part though was that the whole game I felt like I was getting nothing done and everyone else was getting all this cool stuff and then I ended up winning. I guess there's nothing strictly speaking wrong with it but I also got absolutely no enjoyment out of playing it.

I've only played this a couple times with 2 players, so that's why it's a 9 and not (likely) a 10, just in case it falls apart with more players.  Basically, if you like Machi Koro, buy this game.  It's a different theme, but it's a better version of Machi Koro.  Same premise, buying cards that trigger effects based on dice rolls.  Except every card can trigger on an opponents turn.  Very little downtime between turns, always something to do.  More to buy than just dice cards.  This was kind of a sleeper hit with my group.

If there's one downside, it takes up a lot of table real estate, but if you liked Machi Koro, you already dealt with that issue.

RATING: 5
Dice roller fest with some runaway leader issues. The cost+ mechanic also enforces some pretty even playstyles which mean you're forced into a set strategy or pay so much more that it really isn't valid anymore.
Art is great.

Avoid high playercounts. Playing with five introduces a really annoying "skipped turn" mechanic. Presumably to avoid bloating you with resources? If so, they failed.
Generally speaking this is a game I'd suggest... three players for.

gameplay is nicely fluid, you pay attention all the time, but what I liked better with machi koro was the very different approaches you had with different purchases - in V:CK i feel every player buys the same stuff which takes a lot away from the sense of building your own "Card Kingdom". Maybe mixing up the standard layout reduces this problem - i will update my comment once we played more. 

superb production value, love the artwork, the dice, the box with the card dividers - but due to the amount of getting and paying with the resources the tokens should have been less flat or they should have added bowls like in Century:Spice Road

Won in a contest from Gameosity. Was very excited to get this. It's a better version of Machi Koro. The way your goal card and the game end conditions function require you to plan certain routes, but not without stifling general gameplay.

Machi Koro with a splash of Lords of Waterdeep lord scoring, also with a better fantasy theme. Players take turns rolling dice, producing resources, and converting them into points. A tried and true method of fun. Players always get at least one resource per turn. After the dice are rolled and in come is received a player has two actions they can do, whether that's defeating monsters, conquering domains, or recruiting citizens.

Kb. 5 db 2 személyes partin vagyunk túl, mindet a játékszabályban javasolt setup-pal játszottuk.
A játék maga ugyebár könnyed kockadobálásból és némi stratégiázásból áll, amit részben a játék elején húzott titkos szereped határoz meg.
Üresjáratok nem nagyon vannak, mivel az ellenfél körében is kapsz bevételt és azt sem árt figyelni, hogy mire megy rá a másik, de ennél több konfrontáció csak elvétve lesz (néhány lappal lehet lopni).
A körök gyorsan pörögnek egymás után, a ráírt 30-45 perc játékidő szerintem reális.
A grafika gyönyörű, a lapok minősége remek, a tárolódoboz szivacsos megoldása kellemes, a játéktér setupja egy kicsit szívás (némi dominion effekt van a lapok kiválogatásánál).
Az árát kicsit soknak találom, de mi nem drága manapság...
Az újrajátszhatósággal sem lesz gond.
Összességében elég pozitív emlékeim vannak, bármikor szívesen játszom egy menetet.

Very enjoyable game. At first it feels like you just roll dice and get resources, but after buying the first card or two you start to see the combinations. If I fight this monster I get these resources, but if I buy this card first I get more. Not saying it is terrible deep. But very enjoyable.

This took a couple of plays to grow on me.  At first (and I still feel this way a bit), it feels like the game plays itself since you get resources on everybody's roll and the citizens cards aren't all that different from each other so it makes it a little harder to specialize.  Your Duke is going to determine what path you take in the game so it can feel a bit like you're on rails.  You'll have way more resources than you need by the end of the game so it's not like you have to keep a close eye on what you're using and when.  With that said, this game is addicting to play.  There's just something about rolling dice, gathering resources, and trying to build a little engine.

I'm always on the lookout for light to medium-ish games that take an hour or less to play with 4 players and make me want to play over and over.  Most of the time, if a game is light, then it's not going to be that fun to play repeatedly.  Valeria is so close to being a keeper.  Just needs more cards - citizens & monsters that mix things up a bit.  Right now, I have to keep from playing it too much so I don't get burnt out on it (what a problem to have!).

Definitely replaced Machi Koro for me.

Update after 6 months (August 2016 - January 2017): It's my 5th most played game over the last 6 months with 16 plays.  Coming in just behind a few of my favorite games - Race for the Galaxy, Roll for the Galaxy, & Kingdom Builder.   Still draws me in and I'm not quite sure what it is about the game that makes me wants to play it.  I don't feel like I'm making any grand decisions, but it's just so satisfying to play.  Will keep playing it and maybe I'll finally figure why the game has a little bit of a hold over me.

Do I think it'll keep racking up plays over the next 6 months?  Probably not at its current rate, but I wouldn't be surprised at another 10 plays.  I can't remember when the expansion comes out, but if it's here before July, then I'll probably reach another 15+ plays by then.  I feel it may end up like Splendor - I'll play it a bunch the first year I own it and then it gets pulled out for a few plays here and there.

2 player game is much better than the solo version, given the game is at essence a race to gain the most points and then end the game, with an economy build up along the way, set collection, and dice roll management.   Reckon it may be better with even more players, but not sure yet if this game is more than the sum of its parts.  7 for 2 player game, may go a little higher.

Great components in the KS version.  Enjoy tableau building generally, but it doesn’t given the interesting variety that race for the galaxy does.  The buildings help with this but aren’t really built until mid-late game.  Hidden roles are nice.  Like the fact that there is minimal downtime and players are always engaged when others are taking turns due to benefiting from dice rolls (same as settlers of catan). Worth a couple more plays to see if will find a home in my collection.

A little too simple.  Way better than Machi Koro.  Setup/teardown is extreme for such an easy game.  I'd still rather play Settlers though probably (or at least a hypothetical better Settlers), but this is a very successful design.  I really need something spatial as a datum I guess.

I like everything about this game, but did not enjoy my only play of it. I won.. by a very large margin, but I am nearly certain that we had the game ending conditions wrong because the game overstayed its welcome by about 45 minutes and we long ran out of resources and needed more than double what is provided.

4/10 I got another chance to play this game. I enjoyed it this time much more than last time and we worked toward the end game conditions so it did not overstay its welcome like last time. Sadly, there are some serious problems with this game.  1st half of the tokens should say x5 and maybe some that say x10, there are never enough resources and they stack like crazy in front of you. Monsters don't work, if you have the duke to kill monsters, you will kill all the little ones, and allow other players to get the quick points by killing the bosses. The dukes are not balanced, some are MUCH better than others. I am sticking with this game being broken, although still fun, I will not buy this one.

This is a really, really neat game of recruiting citizens, fighting monsters and getting domains. On your turn you roll the dice to see which of your citizens activate, you and the other players activate their citizens for each die individually, as well as the total of both dice. Afterwards you get the choice to recruit more citizens, fighting monsters, acquiring a domain or simply taking resources.

Each player is a duke with a secret scoring objective for the end of the game. This could mean you want to focus more on citizens or monsters or domains, or you want to focus on a specific type of icon regardless of whether it appears on citizens or domains.

Recruiting more citizens give you more resources when they activate (if you have more than one citizen of a type you activate all of them for each matching die roll). Acquiring domains will score you some victory points, as well as give you either a one-time bonus or an on-going power for the rest of the game. Fighting monsters will score you some victory points, as well as give you a one-time bonus for defeating it, usually resources, but you may also gain citizens.

I absolutely had a blast with this game, and am very, very happy with this purchase. An additional, not gameplay-related perk is how really well done the insert is, especially with the foam dividers and covers to keep everything in place.

another one that was brought to my attention by Rahdo and Mário back the PnP in the KS and so we played it...

Another one that held pretty well to my expectations, when I saw the video I thought this was a very improved and more interesting version of [b][thing=143884][/thing][/b] and I was right... I really dislike Machi Koro because of the frustrating huge amounts of luck and pretty much no luck mitigation and run-away leader problem.

This one has pretty much the same mechanics but the way it handles the dice makes all the difference and makes it much more interesting, instead of just rolling the dice and resolving the effect of the buildings that match the rolled number, in this game you always roll 2 dice and let's say you roll a 2 and a 4... this means that EVERYONE will activate all their Citizens (if they have more than one) with the #2, all the Citizens with the #4 and all Citizens with #6... so there's not just 1 dice roll result, there's 3 in each player turn and they activate all the matching citizens in all players kingdoms!
Granted that the Active player get the better activation on the Citizens while everyone else gets only the ability on the right of the card that is a weaker ability, but still all the cards activate...

There's also 3 types of cards:
- [u]Citizens[/u] - those are the cards that activate with the dice rolls to give you all things from Gold, Strength and Magic, they are also required for you to acquire the next set of cards

- [u]Domains[/u] - You get these cards by paying the amount of Gold Required but you also have to have the citizens with the matching symbols in your Kingdom to be able to buy the Domain... the Domains grant Victory Points for the end of the game and also give you an immediate special action or a permanent power for the rest of the game

- [u]Monsters[/u] - You can defeat Monsters by using your Strength and Magic... The monsters defeated will be worth VP's in the end of the game and when they are defeated a reward will be given to the player.

Each player also receives 2 Dukes at the start of the game and chooses one and the Dukes will give you extra scoring goals for the end of the game.

The art on the cards is pretty cool...

So making it short, this one is SO MUCH BETTER than Machi Koro it hurts!!

Video Review: https://youtu.be/MEqqiyGWu3c

Valeria is Machi Koro on steroids. The boiled down game is the same, but this is so much more. For a start you always roll two dice and activate cards that have any of the numbers rolled, for example if I roll a 6 and a 3 I would activate any cards I have with the numbers 3, 6 and 9. This change on it's own is genius but Valeria goes further, adding monsters, domains and dukes. Monsters are a great way to get victory points, domains give one shot, or permanent upgrades, and duke are like a secret mission system. 

There is a lot more here and Daily Magic are rapidly becoming one of the most consistent publishers out there.

Fiddly set up that is justified by a more even game experience than Machi Koro, the direct comparison to this game. Unfortunately, the gameplay felt inconsequential, not to imply that it is. Enjoyable, but does not compel me to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Obviously the game involves luck from the roll of the dice, but this is basically Machi Koro for real gamers. The downside is the theme is less welcoming to muggles and the setup takes longer (you don't just shuffle everything together). The event cards and dukes and domain are all great additions and I will always pick this over MK given the choice. MK is the better choice for playing with complete non-gamers though as it's probably the best real game to play with those only experienced in Monopoly.

Pretty fun. Much better than Machi Koro, even though this pretty much blatantly copies the central mechanism. This one just seems to work better, even if the fantasy theme is a bit ho-hum compared to the city building one. About the only sub-par thing about this game is the artwork, which is mediocre at best. It also seems like you always have an abundance of resources and not enough time to use them all, which is a nit pick of mine in these sorts of games. I can see holding onto this for a long time, but they really need to support it with expansions. The base game on its own is probably not going to stick around for more than a handful of plays, but there is a good deal to explore here. Also, I have to give props for the insert and dividers. The storage for this game is one of the best I've seen in awhile.

A simple card game modelled after Machi Koru, but an additional choice you get is to slay a monster. You collect characters numbered 1 through 12, you roll dice on your turn and gain magic/coins/strength. Coins are used to buy buildings called domains, while strength is used to conquer monsters and magic is wild. You also start the game with a hidden duke which gives you bonus points for having certain types of cards at the end of the game. 

I like the simple mechanics of the game. I think it plays best with a maximum of 4 players, as more players leads to a bit more downtime. There is some luck with the dice rolls, so you have to ride that out, and there is a card that lets you steal a monster from someone else once during the game. It's enjoyable to play.

[b]Valeria: Card Kingdoms[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]I'm not really sure what it is about this game, but I can't stop playing Valeria: Card Kingdoms. I have now played all three of the Valeria games (Card Kingdoms, Quest and Villages) and in my opinion this by far the best. Out of the three Card Kingdoms is the only one I consider better than the games they borrow mechanisms from. [i](Card Kingdoms = Machi Koro, Villages = a simple RFtG experience and Quests = Lords of Waterdeep)[/i]. 

Card Kingdoms is similar to Machi Koro in that you roll two dice then activate the card that corresponds with the sum of the two dice. However; you also get to use each individual die value to activate cards. This speeds up the game and makes for a more fun, less frustrating experience. I also much prefer the theme and aesthetic of Valeria, the artwork is amazing.

In my opinion Valeria: Card Kingdoms built on the design ideas of Machi Koro and improved them a hundred fold. Based on the games I typically enjoy I really wasn't expecting to like Card Kingdoms so much, but I'm glad my kids convinced me to get a copy.[/i]

This game has a lot more to it than I originally expected. As you gain gold, strength and/or magic on other player's turns, I found myself cheering for them to roll number that would activate my citizens abilities. The Domain cards can really benefit players, but as they are randomly distributed when you have a chance to buy them can affect the game...but randomness has never bothered me. The only thing that I think could've been improved is the scoring layout/icons on the duke/duchess cards. It was a little confusing to all of us at first and it took some research here on BGG to make sure we were scoring correctly.

Valeria: Card Kingdoms is a direct descendant of Machi Koro--players acquire cards that activate when any makes certain dice rolls.  The cards generally provided resource tokens, which could be used to buy more character cards, fight monsters, or buy buildings (provided you had the requisite symbols on your character cards).  Unlike Machi Koro, two dice are rolled from the beginning, and the number of pips on each of the dice individually, as well as the sum of the pips, determine which cards get activated each turn.  Additionally, players receive hidden goal cards before the game, which encourage the players to follow different strategic paths.  The monster fighting was a bit wonky, as the monster piles were generally ordered in ascending difficulty/reward, but saving up resources was easy, so defeating low-reward monsters was just setting up your opponents to defeat the higher-reward monsters deeper in the stack.  Aside from this quibble, though, I thought this was fairly entertaining, and I'm glad the Machi Koro mechanic is getting more play.  The game also includes a large number of extra cards of all types for a variable setup, which is huge plus--playing the basic setup all the time would definitely get stale.

Much as I appreciated the mechanisms of Machi Koro, I was bored after a couple of plays, not even the expansion could save it. Valeria has the mechanisms of Machi Koro and the theme of Thunderstone  and I enjoy it considerably more than either of those games. Really excellent fun, easy to grasp, always engaging, looking forward to playing it many more times.

Card Kingdoms is a very fun and friendly game. We love that you get resources even when it's not your turn! The reason for the 8 is because there is virtually no Take That, and the fact that since dice are the determining odds, you can have the best strategy and not win.

A lightweight, easy-to-learn card game with a nice dice mechanism reminiscent of Machi Koro. All players are active on every turn, so there's little downtime. It's not strategically deep but it plays quickly enough that it doesn't outstay its welcome. Fans of economic engines will enjoy the way your ability to get things done increases quickly and drastically. My Kickstarter copy is very nicely produced, with fine colorful artwork. (Disclaimer: my own Villages of Valeria design will be published by this company, so perhaps I'm biased. I generally prefer longer, deeper games, but V:CK does pack a lot into a short playtime and I do enjoy it!)

This game is an absolute blast to play. There is excitement on every players turn and not just for the active player. Dice rolls for the excitement, but it really isn't a game of luck as you purchase cards to cover more numbers and can easily calculate the odds of certain numbers coming up. Everyone can feel accomplished in the mass of cards, domains, monsters, and resources they are taking on. It would be a challenge to not feel good playing this game. The artwork, tokens, dice, insert... are all amazing. Impossible not to compare with Machi Koro though. This blows that out of the water. Thanks Machi Koro designers for coming up with the concept initially, but thanks to Valeria Card Kingdoms for doing it better.

RATING: 7
Machi Koro with a generic fantasy theme instead of a genric city-building theme.

However, more stuff triggers each turn, since each die triggers as does the sum.  That makes for a faster pace, a sensation of wealth, and a slightly more interesting variety of probabilities for different cards.  There is minor interaction, but it is pleasing to watch your loot roll in, and you never feel screwed by a bad roll (the way you can in M.K.).  Overall, I enjoyed the game, and it even offered some minor choices.

My first game ended with scores of 68.5 to 69 with very different duke play styles, which bodes well for balance.

RATING: 8
Machi Koro with smart dice and a twist on the market. see, you get paid for the number on die one, the number on die two, and also for their sum. suddenly multiples of the low cards sound better than just banking on the 7. there's also combos and abilities. it's rare to see anyone fall behind and eventually there's a snowball of resources. luckily there is plenty to spend on with monster stacks, helpful provinces, and your secret goal (usually a hero type). even without the expansion there's plenty cards to swap out if you wanted to emphasize a certain economy (gold, fight, magic) or see new monsters, provinces, goals, etc. for a light, rewarding sandbox you can hardly do better. at the end, everyone's pretty pleased with what they've built, even if they got caught up and forgot their goals. solo can be quite fun, as well. highly recommended.

RATING: 9
Huge hit with my gaming group.  I backed this game because I was interested in [thing=143884][/thing] but did not like the broken balance issues.  This one sounded like a pretty cool 'upgrade' of sorts with more things to do, always something on your off-turns, and a little more strategy involved.

Pros:
- Beautiful artwork
- Always something to do, even if it isn't your turn.
- Bad/unlucky rolls will not completely kill your ability to play
- There are different things to do in game, giving you strategy through choices
- Each player has their own end-game goal that you do not necessarily know.  This means that you will not know who truly won until then end, making the game thrilling the whole way through.
- Fantastic box, components, etc.  Lots of thought put into the whole project.
- Game designers stand by their product.  Very responsive and listen to user feedback.

Cons:
- Some batches had card-curling issues.  Mine was one of the batches with that issue. The game creators stand by their product so anyone who ended up with a curling card problem can get a replacement.  I sleeve my cards and card sleeves fixed the problem for me.

I remember enjoying the print and play, but revisting the production version was a bit of disappointment. The game loses resource management aspect mid/late game as it appears that you will always have plenty of resources to buy/kill whatever your heart desiers. As a result, the game becomes who is the lucky person to be able to buy/kill the card that gives a lot of VP.

RATING: 5
Played once with 5P. Valeria plays like a souped-up [thing=143884][/thing], with thematic hints of [thing=53953][/thing]. However, amidst adding the various elements of domains and extra resources, I think Valeria misses out on a few aspects which make games like these tick. 

While the strategic options in Machi Koro are constrained, Valeria doesn't really improve on this. Instead, the cards here lack synergy and players focus more on getting cards which score for their respective lords' bonuses. Another issue is that as players accumulate might, they become reluctant to defeat weaker monsters as that would allow another opponent to swoop in for a higher VP payout. The no-two-identical-actions limit seems to be a painful compromise – understandably, it prevents players with hoarded resources from running away with the game, but it also contributes to the game being stretched. This may be an isolated issue for large groups, but I otherwise remain unimpressed.

Rating based on several plays on the PnP prototype. Basically, this game is everything I wished Machi Koro should be. You're always engaged during other players' turns because cards activates during each and every turn and you have to adjust your plans constantly. 

The theme and the mechanic integrates very well and already shows a lot of potential for expansions introducing new mechanics. 

Backed it and would strongly recommend this game to everyone but the heaviest euro-games fans.

It's sort of a cool blend of Machi Koro and Dominion. We used the basic setup, but there are several other cards available to randomize the game. The basic configuration is:
- 5 domain decks (unique cards, randomly mixed)
- 5 monster piles (different terrain), with stronger monsters at bottom of stacks
- 10 characters (5 types, with appropriate icons)
Players start with a peasant (5) and knight (6) in their tableau. They also get 2 random Duke cards, which specify a different end-game VP reward (for having specific cards/icons in your tableau); choose one to keep secretly, discard the other. 

On your turn, roll 2d6: both single numbers, and the sum, activate for everybody. Each card in your tableau shows a left effect, for the active player, and a right effect, for all other players. Everyone collects stuff (tokens for coins, strength, magic, or VP) according to their own displays. Then the active player takes any 2 actions:
- buy a character with coins (base cost + 1 per other character you already have of that type); add to your display
- fight a monster with strength: there is an immediate benefit, and end-game VP; add to your score pile
- buy a domain for coins (they also have prerequisites for specific combinations of icons in your tableau). Domains give you an immediate and/or ongoing benefit
- take one coin, strength, or magic token
Whenever paying for stuff, you may use Magic as a wild resource (though you must use at least one of the actual resource)

The game ends at the end of the round (even numbers of turns) when either all the monsters are killed, all the domains have been purchased, or 2n piles have been exhausted. Most VP (from tokens, monsters, domains, and Dukes) wins!

I came in dead last, but did enjoy this more than I remember liking Machi Koro. Still, for a roll-dice-and-produce-resources game, I think I'd still prefer good old Settlers of Catan! In Catan, it seems you can play the odds more (since there are 2 dice, always summed, and with a well-known bell curve distribution) AND you can trade to make up for shortfalls. Here, it seems you're at the mercy of the dice more than I prefer?

Played 6/1/2015.  Not sure if it's the final design, so take rating with a grain of salt.  Similar to Machi Koro, but I like this design better.  In the version I played there is still a lot of balance work that needs to be done for Valeria to be a good game.  I also don't care for the hidden goals, and I think any game like this needs more variability in the cards you buy (really looking at you Machi Koro).

Super fun game, think Machi Koro but with fantasy elements and expanded strategies (or a nerdier Catan where the dice are the only random element so you've far more control if you haven't touched Machi Koro). Once you've organized the cards, it's fast setup and tear down and you can ditch the cardboard for a deck box for easy carry. You'll almost always have fun with a round of this game. Only critique/warning is the "Solo play" variant is busted... Any competent player can destroy it with no margin of error. Make sure you're buying as a game to play with friends.

This is a game I was fond of on my initial plays,  then sharply lost interest rather quickly.  The main problem is your scores are primarily duke driven and this seems to trivialize everything else in the game. 

The game ramps up quite quickly and offers a ton of variations in the initial set up.  As far as scaling goes,  I think it is at it's best with 3 players.  Two is ok - while the 4/5 versions seem to produce way too many resources.

Considering this is essentially a card game, the quality of the cards being terrible was an awful oversight. Overall,  the game works - but the duke issue and lack of tension from the glut of resources - ultimately  render it slightly disappointing.

Oct 2017: Imagine my shock when I found this on the "Unloved Games" shelf at my FLGS for 50% off.  What?!  THIS game?  We may not pull it out every weekend now that the new factor has worn off, but it's still a great game!  We've played this with 6 different people now and all have enjoyed it.

Original:
This game was such a hit we played it a second time right away!  I've heard this compared to Dominion, and there are certainly some similarities - but this is so much different you can easily own both.  The artwork on this one is more appealing - gorgeous! - and it feels like there's less downtime between turns.

One of the reasons I love this is the dice-rolling mechanism.  It adds the perfect layer of luck to the game and also an offhanded sort of player interaction.  Even when it's not your turn, you'll be anxiously awaiting the roll of the dice to see which cards you're activating.

The hidden lord cards are a great addition that brings in a Lords of Waterdeep element.  You may think you all have the same objectives - but you probably don't!  Someone might be trying to kill as many monsters as possible while someone else is going for domains.  Another person may strictly be building up Holy and Soldier cards, while someone else is slowly amassing a hoard of resources.  This makes it hard to do much back-stabbing 'take that' because you can never be sure if you're really hurting someone or not.

I also like that your cards are always laying on the table.  It makes it MUCH easier to teach the game to new people when you can see exactly what they have, rather than them feeling like they're showing you their secrets if they have to tell you what's in their hand.  It's not too hard to teach to begin with, but this makes it a game you could easily play with new gamers or children since you can walk them through their turns.

Fantasy empire building card game that plays like a hybrid variant of craps and a tableau builder.  Setup looks similar to a deck builder with two important twists; 1) some stacks have a progression (e.g. monster boss at the bottom) 2) players spend resource tokens (strength, magic, and gold) to defeat monsters and add citizens or domains to their empire tableau. During the harvest, a dice roll will activate some citizens (depending on the dice results) for all players--the first player effects are usually better. Who doesn't like gambling.  Luck advantage can be a factor. This can be mitigated by getting citizens that cover certain dice rolls.  The trick is the tradeoff between spending your limited resources to build your engine and cover the dice odds even though the type or special ability of the card is not in line with your objectives. Takes some time to build the starting stacks at setup. Fun and simple with decent decision weight. The harvest phase keeps everyone engaged.

This is so much better than MK it hurts. 

Great little light game that's easy to teach and is always a ton of fun to play. You roll dice, get ridiculous numbers of resources, and but cards that will get you even more resources next turn. Other players are always involved as everyone activates from the die roll.

Perfect family / kids game.

The setup can be a bit more annoying (think setting up a game of dominion). But other than that there's no reason to go with MK over this.

Want to drown in resources? This game. Building your tableau until you have all the available number roles seems like a no-brainer first four turns. That minor gripe aside, I like this game- the way it looks, the ease of play, the mish-mashing of a few different games. There isn't much strategy here, pick cards that benefit your secret lord scoring, hope the dice are kind for the first four turns. It just seems to scratch an occasional itch

A tableau-building game for 1-5 players and will feel familiar to deck-building fans. The cards you buy can work for you on your turn and on all the other player turns, as well. On your turn, roll two dice and activate citizen cards with the result of each individual die and the sum of both dice. Other players will simultaneously activate their citizen cards based off of the roll. Next, take two actions from the following: slay a monster, recruit a citizen, buy a domain, or take 1 of any resource. The player with the most victory points at the end wins the game.

A little bit more complex as Machi Koro but in the same spirit. Great game.

It's like Machi Koro... except the theme is cooler, the art is better and the game mechanics are vastly more fun... Instead of: get money to get buildings, oops, get nothing this roll!... It's: get Gold/Strength/Magic to build domains, slay monsters and hire citizens, cool, I always get at least something on every roll!... I wanted to love MK and didn't, I love this instead...

Love the idea of a fantasy Machi Koro variant.  

The monster stacks tragically don't affect strategy in any meaningful way.  The art is great but beyond that each creature only varies by size.  Same goes for the Domains.

I've enjoyed this so far but I suspect it's going to seriously lack replay value.

Ez is tetszett, megállapíthatjuk tehát, h egy jól kitalált sorozatról van szó. Ebben a részben nagy szerepet kap egy dobókocka, valamint a Villages of Valeriahoz hasonlóan itt sem unatkozunk a másik játékos körében. A kártyák szépek, a gyűjtögetés jól kitalált, bár egy-egy rossz dobás azért tönkreteheti a stratégiánkat. Ez mondjuk nem öli meg a játékot, hiszen nem is bonyolult és nem is hosszú, valamint az újrajátszási faktor is magas a különböző setupoknak köszönhetően, így úgyis többet fogunk vele játszani.

RATING: 6
A solid 2-player rendition of the original game, with possibly more luck.

Gameplay is similar to Settlers in that you are trying to get resources to build settlements and/or cities for victory points.  You can trade with the other player, or with yourself (3:1 or 2:1 using a port).  Each turn 2 dice are rolled, one for production, and one for events, which more often than not, have a negative effect.  Like Settlers, rolls affect both players.

You need to build roads to be able to build more settlements/cities, settlements are for points, and give access to more resources, and they also allow for the building of other buildings (although there are building restrictions).  Cities are for more points (2 as opposed to 1) and they allow for more buildings to be built, without the restrictions.

There is a commerce token and a soldier token, both of which are worth 1 point, and which both give the owner special abilities (generally extra resources) during event rolls and occasionally card play.  They are similar to longest road and largest army in that they can move from player to player.  Commerce seems a bit overly strong.

There are "take that" cards, which while not too overpowered, can be a bit annoying (similar to rolling a 7 in Settlers).  You also must watch out for the brigand event roll, also similar to rolling a 7 (note that there is no robber per se in this game).  Overall, this is a solid 2-player game, that definitely gives the feel of the original.  Main complaints are that the rulebook is one of the worst I've seen, and the game takes more space to play than most games I own, definitely not good for a "card game".

Good game with two players, though it's a race to get the most villages out and then it's hard to turn around the game if you didn't succed in that. The successor game "Rivals of Catan" is clearly better than this game, though.

This is an enjoyable two player experience. But definitely not for "hardcore gamers." It has a nice soft relaxing feel to it. A good game to spend a couple of hours with. 

**But beware** there is a memorization aspect to this game. You will definitely perform better if you know all the cards and what is possible within each deck.

A decent game, but if dice rolls don't go your way, expect a long and frustrating experience.  As it's a two player only game, cold streaks have a much greater impact on the outcome of the game.  Also, the playing time is a little long for what the game is.

RATING: 6.1
Its ok, and a decent enough distraction if you only have two players, but not as much fun as its big brothers.
Also, it takes up so much room! It requires more space for 2 players than the original needs for 6. Kind of defeats the point of being a card game in my opinion. Well, that and the 3 hour playing time.

I actually enjoy this more than the original Settlers.  A solid two-player game.

That said, there can be a fair amount of direct conflict between players with the use of the arsonist to burn down the other person's buildings, or the black knight to kill off their knights and heroes--so tread carefully when playing with someone who might be less accepting of TAKE THAT! moves.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Despite loving the board game, the card game definitely falls flat.  With only two players, the trade aspect is removed and a number of elements are dumbed down.  The extra buildings are an interesting twist, but one would think that a card game transition with fewer players would not take longer than the board game big brother.

This game might be ok for fans of the original Settlers who want a 2-player experience. In comparison to other card games, say RftG, Dominion or Glory to Rome, this one fares badly. Too long for what it is, little interaction and a bland theme.

STRATEGY

In this card game you and the other player build settlements and cities while exploring the land around you. The player with the most points wins.

To me, the learning curve and the rules are surprisingly imposing. 

Recommended with 2 players (best 2). 90 mins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Rating based on 1 playing. I can see how it might improve later, but that first play was hampered greatly by being unfamiliar with the cards, effects and strategies. Also, it seems like if one person gets a good jump on settlements it can make things pretty one-sided.

RATING: 6
A nice change after getting tired of Settlers. The luck aspect is somewhat reduced - both players always get resources. Feels more like Cities & Knights than base settlers because of all the extra cards and the way your buildings can get destroyed. 
Make sure you have lots of room on the table. It takes up more room than you expect. The box is irritating as it doesn't hold the cards well.

I have mixed feelings about this game. I like the concept and the overall play, but the winner usually seems to be determined far before the end of the game. This may be due to my lack of experience, but the last 15 minutes seem to drag on for whomever is behind.

One of my top five 2-player games. It's a little longer than most good 2-player games but I never notice the length! Great game.

It took me years to get this to the table. When I did, I was 1,000 light years from my Catan phase. 

This left me cold. Kind of boring, and took up too much space. Better games could be played in the time it took for this. 

Will play again with different expansions (since I have that box too), but am unsure whether my opinion will change.

One of the few games I have sold. The couple we sold it to took *hours* to learn the rules and a few hours more to play their first game. But with more plays they are completely hooked and consider it far superior to standard Settlers. My wife and I never got over that initial hump, and I am happy to be rid of it.

Catan Card Game is an excellent 2 person strategy game that maintains stylistic similarties to The Settlers of Catan, while having an entirely different and very enjoyable game play experience.

My father and I both enjoyed the game and would have to play it a few more times to really begin to engage the full strategic depth.  I look foreward to learning this delightful game in more detail.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable yet can be very frustrating depending on the dice rolls. This game started out as an 8. But since discovering other games to play with husband, I've realized that this takes too long for what you end up doing. It can take over an hour to finish. When you keep rolling bad numbers and being attacked it's just too long.

After owning this game for nearly 20 years, I finally broke out to play with Diana last night.  It is quite interesting, and except for trading, it is a better game than base Catan.  (I know that it was the inspiration for many of the Catan expansions that came later.)  My one complaint, though it is a big one is that it dragged a bit in the middle and late game.  We will try a variant that adds a production die to the initial roll and increase the brigand ungarrisonned region count to 9.  I think that should speed things up a bit.

i love the game in theory, but the thing that stops me from wanting to own and play it is the fact that none of the turns feel fluid.  when you're not fiddling, you're bogging on decisions you absolutely have to make like picking a die result that doesn't help your opponent as much or more than you.  normally i don't stress over details but it would just be dumb to not consider that kind of stuff, and this game makes you do that fairly often.  lots of wasted turns, just doesn't feel slick.

This game really reminds me of RFTG and Dominion, though I realize that this came first.  Maybe I'm just not as in tune with CCG culture to compare it to other things.  I enjoyed it, and knowing the Catan mechanics helped in learning the game.  It's much more confrontational than the board game.

Probably my first "serious" game? It certainly shows the wear and tear - the worst condition of any box that I have. It's been an awful long time since I played this, but I rather liked the outward expansion of the game, horizontally and vertically. It's a pity that the settlement-rush is so brokenly powerful, though, seeing as it feeds itself and is a fixed-sum game with your opponent.

RATING: 7
A very good game but too long and heavy for casual gamers.  Don't play on a hard flat surface, it can be annoying having to rotate the cards and pick-up the decks.Personally I prefer Starship Catan for the theme but there is a lot to like with this one.  Counting VP can be tricky, print out the VP player aid available here on the geek.

RATING: 10
An amazing two player game - possibly my favourite. It takes the bones of Settlers proper, and feels like playing Settlers, but has all sorts of new complexities, strategies and choices (I understand it's akin to Settlers with Cities & Knights, but I haven't played that to comment). It is sort of San-Juan-meets-Settlers; San Juan is quicker (two player), but Settlers seems more involving. It really feels like you are creating your domain and watching your empire blossom, instead of the slightly abstract feel of your card-fest San Juan. And, to this end, the artwork on the Settlers cards is simply beautiful.

It always seems tense, exciting and varied. I recommend it to all gaming couples!

If you only have two players available and you just have to get your Catan on, this will fill the void but I would much rather be playing the board game for my fix. This just comes off to me as two-player solitare. Yes, there are the yellow cards to throw at your opponent and you are allowed to trade but it just doesn't make the game feel interactive enough to me.

I enjoy the game.  It has the same aspects I find important to Settlers except for the trading, which is what I believe makes Settlers as good as it is.  But, for a two player game with hand management, city building, resource management and semi deep strategy, this is the way to go.  Takes close to an hour to play, which makes it a longer game than the original Settlers, at least in my house.

Brilliant building and strategy game for 2. A billion possible strategies in the basic game and another few added with the  5 -limited- expansion sets. This is how CCGames should be marketed to have a life after 2 years of money making. Those who say the game is unbalanced with the unpair availability of villages (4 to 5) haven't gotten a clue of how the internal game mechanics work. The kind of resources, gaming cards stats and internal trade is far more important than building that extra village and uncontrolled resources. Also stealing the other player his hand held victory cards, resources and plain destruction of buildings, fleets or knights is proof that you better keep an eye on his cards. Stats: about 30 wins in 50 matches (mostly with the limited 4 villages tactics!)

Revised opinion:  Originally felt it takes too long, but that's only at first.  It still takes a while, but definitely plays faster with experience.  My wife & I play it often enough.  It's fun to play, but also one of those games that rewards rule-memorizers, as the individual cards each form their own little "rule" (like Magic, for example).   It's fun, but probably ultimately depends more on memorization and luck than any other factor.

All of the frustration of Settlers but in a two player format to prolong the misery. The mechanics are okay and it actually feels like regular Settlers in theme; it just wasn't very fun. Trading is minimized as you are in direct competion.

I really, really want to raise my ranking for the SOC card game. I bought it thinking "2 player Catan? Awesome!!!". In reality, the game is mediocre. It takes waaaayyyy too long to play (all 3 of my games have been over 2 hours), it takes a BIG table for all of the cards, and the randomness is amped up even more than the base game. Maybe a couple of the expansions will add to the experience, maybe.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, and deep, and deceptively so, if you like the Catan style ( and really WHO doesn't, all two of you hush) and also like a fair bit of head to head PvP action now and again, then this is for you. IT IS only two player out of the box, but proved itself with the bells going off early on in the first game between my wife and I. We both got it and ran with it, it was a fun time, one we have not repeated, so I think that speaks to the game, we LIKE it,but will rather play Catan (or munchkin Quest) over it MOST days. I am waiting on that snowy OFF day tho, to sit in front of the fire and spread em out again!

RATING: 7
A very strategic card game, and a lot more interesting to me than the original board game.  There isn't much trading going on (not one of my favorite mechanics, anyways), but there's a lot more variety in what you can build, where you can build it.  The expansions look like they'll add lots of fun. 
  
It's probably the most interesting two-player building game, and with the expansions, it's be hard to beat the replay value of this game.  And the most interesting game with the die-production mechanic, I think.  A lot in one small package---even counting the expansions!

I gave my English version to a friend, and picked up the German version along with the nice anniversary tin (although I still like the wooden tokens better than the new detailed plastic figurines).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Solid card game that resembles original Settlers of Catan game.  Play mechanics are a little awkward at first, but become familiar after a few turns.  Wide variety of strategies available to players (guns vs butter; saving vs spending, etc.) helps with replay value - particularly with expansion sets.

I must give credit to Teuber, he did an excellent job converting Settlers of Catan to a two-player game.  He even translated some of the same mistakes!  Yet again, a Catan game suffers from a horrendous balance of resources that limits the strategic possibilities of the game.  Sheep, like in the base game, rarely come up as a resource in the important buildings and developments, while bricks likely form the most important resource.  This means that the dice (which no longer follow a 2d6 distribution) can completely hose someone even more grossly than in basic Settlers despite the guarantee of a resource every roll.  Contributing to this problem, the expedition cards wildly vary in power and oddly enough the good ones often have bricks on them.

Much of the substance of these complaints is mitigated by two players that know the game well, but a few things continue to grate even under this condition.  Certainly, the oft reviled odd number of settlements that allow one player a settlement advantage, and likely the win, falls into this domain.  However, the one mechanism in the game that irritates me is the expedition card stacks.  They form a needlessly irritating subsystem that isn't thematic, can stall the game, and adds a element of memorization that doesn't enhance the game.

Yet for all this, Teuber remains a designer that understands how to construct an engaging game.  The SoC Card Game stands in my mind as the obvious inspiration for later classics like Puerto Rico and San Juan with its wide array of powers and settling theme.  While I like those later interpretations better, SoCCG still impressed for quite a few plays and benefits from the classic Catan resource production.  Unfortunately, since certain buildings obviously exceed other buildings in terms of ability, the game loses much of its appeal after a few plays.  The expansions breathe new life into the game with new buildings and mechanics, but on the whole, I was not fond of them.

This is my all time favorite of the Settlers series.  It is one of the absolute best two-player games out there.  The only drawback (for some maybe) is that the game is never finished in less than two hours.  Personally, I enjoy the game so much that this is a bonus; however it can make finding opponents a little more difficult.  This is one of two card games that my wife will play with me (the other is Hera & Zeus.)

I found this game a bit too long for my taste.  I am too lazy to be intrigued by the memory aspect.  It also requires a large playing surface, and the head-to-head nature waters down the trading.  If you really like Settlers, you might enjoy it but I would suggest other 2-player games.

I think this preserves the spirit of the original while making play radically faster and appealing to people who might want a more interesting experience for 2 players.

This game is the perfect balance between being simple and complicated for me and my girlfriend. She really likes simple games where you can screw over the opponent, and I like complicated games where you're building on something (may that be a cathedral or character).

In Settlers of Catan: The Card Game, your goal is to make a flourishing string of cities and with those earning winning-points. The string of cities you'll place by using cards, in fact the whole game consists of cards, but doesn't really feel like a card game. You will see your improvements and while your empire grows, so will your play area, which is very rewarding.

It's not a long game or a very complicated one. But it's just rewarding enough and just gives just enough gratification to feel like you've actually accomplished something at the end of each game. Great 2 player game!

A great 2-playergame that I love to play. Even if the dice is not your best friend, there's still much you can do to make your opponent suffer as well. Lots of rules and lots of different cards. But if you have played the game once the next time everything will go smoothly. 
Don't forget to get the expansions. They make the game even better.

My wife and I really enjoy this one. Was afraid the "take that" cards would be too harsh and turn her off to the game but she's given as good as she's got. Our games have also ended pretty close each time with about 1-2 point difference in score. Some of the event die rolls are supremely annoying and it feels like forever sometimes before you can get enough resources to build something.

Nice 2 player game, but it takes a long time (2 hours minimum). It's a 2 player solitaire game, with little interaction, except from some "take that" action. You also need lots of room on a table. I made a special card placeholder plank for setting up the piles in the middle for this one. It minimizes the setup time and saves some space on the table.

My problem with it now is that with my dice blue ALWAYS loses. This put me off considerably. Maybe I should replace the D6, with another one?

I have a luxory custom wooden box which hold all expansions (except the Wizard one, which I dislike).

Frankly, I&#039;ve never quite understood what the frenzy about the Siedler of Catan was all about and I understand it even less with regards to the card game. While it is a beautiful game and provides a few hours entertainment all up while learning and experimenting, it is in the end a mere luck fest. One has very little expression of strategy or control and those wonderful dice have as much say in the matter as anything you choose to do or not. Having said that, a high luck quotient is not the mark of a bad game, indeed for some it is the mark of a good game. Personally, if luck is going to play a large role in a game I would like it at least to light hearted a frivolous as well, and I find the entire Siedler of Catan phenomenon riddled with a seriousness that belies the heavy role of luck found in these games. Put simply, not my favourites.

RATING: 8.5
This is one of my wife's favorite two player games.  It runs about 1.5 - 2 hours, and has a nice blend of strategy and luck.  Like the original Settlers, this is a game where you build up your domain from small to large, something that I think my wife really enjoys - seeing her empire grow.  It has some direct conflict, but nothing truly nasty, and there is some strategy in how you build and what you pursue.  Like the original Settlers, though, much of your strategy will be dictated by what the production die gives you.

This is mostly a tactical, as opposed to strategic, game.  Most decisions are short term optimization, rather than game long direction decisions.  The game runs just a little long for being mostly tactical, but is held together by the feeling of building and growing your province.  I think you could easily play a 10 VP game (although this would lessen the importance of red buildings, I think) for a shorter game.    

I like that there is a fixed number of settlements and cities available, and that it is an odd number - guaranteeing that you are not going to have equal setups in the end game.  I like that there is direct conflict, but that it usually involves returning cards to your hand, so it's not devastating, merely inconvenient - this is a relatively nice game.  The conflict is important, and you have to manage it well, but it's not nasty.  I also like that there are counter-cards for all the attack cards, so you can mitigate your opponent's attacks.  I like that there are several ways to win.  I like that you can spend resources to search one of five piles for the card you want - a clever way to give players some control over the card they draw without giving complete control - this also injects a memory element into the game, which some may not like.

I don't like the importance of getting the resource doubling buildings - I think these are overpowered in this game, and can unbalance a long game from the very start - especially if the players do not recognize their importance and look for them early.  I don't like how weak cities are - I keep expecting them to give a production bonus and they don't.  They do open up the opportunity to buy VP buildings, which is very important, but it feels like you lose tempo when you build them, which I don't like.  

Overall, this is an excellent game that my wife really enjoys, and I am happy to play with her at every opportunity.

(> 30 plays) This is a very good game. The downside is: when you are playing against an equally skilled opponent it's kinda long and ends very tight, as both players know their path to victory.

Therefore I'm not playing "vanilla"  Settlers Card Game anymore but play with all the expansions and a DYO deck instead. This way every game has an element of surprise as you don't know what's waiting for you in your opponent's deck. Played this way it is very entertaining and I highly doubt that it will ever get stale.

More data required. I thrifted a copy of this, and was interested to see how it played, but it seems to come from a time of much longer and heavier two player games. The game itself isn't too complex, but it does seem to take about as long as a regular game of catan. I'm not the hugest fan of the dice event mechanic here, but the rest of the game is quite charming. An interesting balance of true Take That style cards and engine building. I have hopes that this will still get a few reps in if I can find the right partner. All in all enjoyable, but feels dated compared to modern two player games. Haven't played the updated "Rivals of Catan" so can't compare them.

03.30.11 This is a great game.  There's always something you can do, and even when the rolls go against you, you can still make progress.

Also, it has a lot of conflict, which makes it unsuitable for playing against my wife, and that is what I want my 2 player games for.

A great 2-player card game with the Settlers theme.

The  luck of the dice can be big factor: getting the resources you need at the right time, or rolling a favorable event can be a huge advantage.

There are some really strong cards and many weaker ones, so it is often important to fish for the good cards (there's an option to look through a card pile to pick any card from it, which also allows you to remember cards on top of the pile - I really like that mechanic.)

There are some aggressive cards, and I often found that the game is more fun if we choose to ignore them. It's probably best to agree in advance on whether to play an aggressive or a peaceful game.

Overall it's a good game, with a few flaws. Some improvements have been made in [gameid=66056].

The Catan card game has it all - building, resource management, exploration.  It is a very rich game, and feels much more like a board game than any other card game I own.  This gets played a lot, but let me tell you, it's not always quick, as a game can easily take 90 min.  We only play until 10 points (11 if we use an expansion), otherwise it would take forever.  Great game, though.

If you own and love Settlers, do yourself a favor and buy this game.  This is a great Settlers fix when you're jonesing for a game and there's only one other player around.  In addition, SoCCG is so good that it inspired the equally impressive Cities & Knights expansion for Settlers.  I'm giving this a 7.5, because it's derivative and lighter on strategy than the original.  However, I have to say that this is a 'must-have' game for Settlers fans and other dedicated boardgamers.

RATING: 3
UPDATE: I've never changed my opinion so much on a game. Catan CG reminds me of what it feels like when to run up a water-slide: just when things might start going...whoops, hosed again. It's way too slow, the screwage isn't fun because it just slows the pace: "Oh I had 8 points, now you've burned my building". The event decks and dice rolls can really screw you. If you get beat to the last settlement, you'll probably lose. I love machine building games, but this thing really shows its age. Good luck catching up when you're a couple of VP's behind; chances are that the lead will just snowball. Why on earth would I play this when RftG, Dominion, etc. are around? I really, really hate this game. If it played in 45 minutes or an hour it might be passable, but as it is I hope to never play it again.

Kind of a weird game. I enjoy it, it gives you plenty to think about. Unfortunately, something about the layout and filling up all the resources while keeping track of everything makes me go foggy-headed and get a tad grumpy/impatient. It plays a little long for a game where you can get so badly screwed by cards (yes even though you can mitigate some of the luck by searching the deck). The player with the better memory will probably win. I find the rules fairly unintuitive as well; I'll have to revisit as I give it more plays. 

It does really have that Settlers 'feel' though. I just wished it was shorter with less nasty screwage and luck in the card draw. I hate "take-that" card play.

My criterion for rating games


http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: Very samey game each time you play it and no sense of theme. 

2) Meaningful/fun decisions.  Only a few decisions to make each turn and primarily have to do with how to spend cards and resources.

3) Player interaction: Quite a bit of player interaction. Lots of attack cards and the interplay of the windmill and knight means you have to keep an eye on what your opponent is doing. Plus getting resources on opponents roll is nice.

4) Components/artwork:  Nice cards and components. Should have included a way to keep score!

5) Game length/complexity:  Complexity provides very little challenge and though the game is not long, it lasts too long for how simplistic it is.

Bottom line: Ok game that I would play again, but not pulling it out on my own. Too simplistic and samey from game to game.

I enjoyed this.  It's straightforward to learn (from the perspective of someone who's played the board game), and the cards are well-designed.  One point is that this game is longer than many other 2-player card games.

I think people come in two flavors, those who like this card game better then the original, and those who don't.  I'm solidly in the card camp.  We found it addictive and fun from the start.  Yet the game get's better as you become more experienced.  Experienced players can overcome hurdles that seem insurmountable in earlier playings, such as having only four settlements, one wheat or ore.  A great game that endures.

A very good two player game.  Arguably superior to the original board game on which it's based.  The box set of expansions adds a welcome amount of variety to the base game. Only drawback is that it runs about 15-20 minutes too long.

Excellent game.  I like this way more than vanilla Catan and probably more than Cities & Knights.  There seem to be a lot more options and decisions to make in this game than in the board games.  It's great to be able to produce on every roll of the dice.

This is a great two player card game, but like Starship Catan, it can be pretty long to come to conclusion.  Captures the feel of Settlers very well, and the expansions add yet more life to this great game.

While an interesting two player experience, the card game doesn't play anything like the board game. It does resemeble Starfarers of Catan, but while the later is better designed and set up, Settlers requires the card to be set up in a specific way that can easily get unwieldy.

This is really an excellent 2-player game that seems to play deeper and sometimes more satisfyingly than its larger brothers.  There's considerably more to track and manage and there is some nice direct conflict. Victory points seesaw back and forth and the game between good players is usually a photo finish.  Very highly recommended.   The heretic in me wants to say this is actually a better game than the board game...it just might be due to the direct competition.

Too many victory points required to win.
The game feels like you are playing double solitare.  The game takes too long.  If this was a game up to 7 VP's it would rate more like an 8.5, as it ihas a good theme and the mechanic is good.  There is not enough player interaction, and the club (taking awat wool and ore comes up way too often.  There are not enough resources produced to allow for trade interaction to occurr.

This doesn't hit the table often. But it is a real good cardgame for two. Especially with the use of one or more expansions.

RATING: 5
Decent cardgame for two, and much better than the boardgame it is derived from. The rules can be fiddly and complex, but these become natural after a while. I've played this quite a number of times when I was still learning the ropes of all these new board and cardgames, but at some point I and my partner simply stopped. The game hasn't been out of the box in (at the time of writing) about 5 years or so, and although I wouldn't mind giving it a go, I'm quite sure it would be for nostalgic reasons only, as there are several problems with this game we no longer accept or take for granted. For one thing, in about half of the cases you can predict in advance which player is going to win just by looking at the amount and diversity of the resources at his disposal. A high number of these guarantees a steady income no matter what number the die lands on, and thus a swift victory. Second issue: even though this game follows a linear distribution to determine who gets which goods, the die can still be a capricious bugger. A good player with bad die throws loses to a good player with good throws, and that began to influence our enthusiasm. Third: related to resources and willful dice, there are not sufficient catch-up mechanisms, save for the windmill, to reign the leader in. The other player can only do so much to counter a runaway leader: usually it is not worth the effort of collecting 'nasty' cards because by the time you are in a position to use them effectively, you cannot build anything when the die is rolled favourably. I remember from my last sessions that we rarely played to completion simply because it was obvious that someone was going to win within the next five to six turns. I'm not quite sure whether that qualifies as a good trait in my book nowadays. 

All in all, it was nice to have met this game's acquaintance, and truth be told, the effect of the raw randomness is rather damped, far more so than is the case in the original game. Playing this game once every while is not overasking, and might even be fun as you work out various tactics and strategies. But to think I actually wanted to give this game an '8' at some point in the past... With hindsight that seems incredible. Then again, most things do in that perspective.

[b]Update[/b] After an incredibly long time I got to play this with SWMBO again. It is so very hard to imagine now that we enjoyed this game so much once upon a time. The comment above remains as-is. There is very little diversity to be had as the game does not support a player winning with less than 4 villages; you simply don't get sufficient resources that way. Searching through decks is an expensive hobby; and an uncooperative die is still an uncooperative die. I stalled at 6 to 7 VP while my partner just kept on going; I did not bother with annoying cards as these did nothing to further my own position, not even by cycling out undesirable cards.

Ignore comparisons to the board game, they're two different entities.  Good 2-player outing with a lot of depth, but doesn't collapse under the weight.  Expansion decks add all sorts of new approaches to scoring, including the rather wacky, but fun, Wizards and Dragons approach.  Use the blank cards in the expansion to make up for the minor flaw issues (not enough garrisons, etc..)

Our first play started too late in the evening for my son and I to finish.  A surprisingly meatier game than I had anticipated.  I agree with comments on the Geek that this is a heavier weight than it's board game cousin.  I enjoyed it, maybe partly because it is just as frustrating as the board game, and again just like the board game, always leaves you with the notion that you can turn this thing around with just the right resources coming your way.  Rating subject to change with more games played.  My second play mirrored my first: needs more time than you expect it to.  Positive reviews from both people I have played it with though.  2008-04: donated to Diabetes Fundraiser

This game is way to long! It's kind of ridiculously for a two player game to last an hour and a half while you steal from each other the entire last half because the first half you can't play those cards. I have played a speed version where you start with your third settlement and rolls two production die. Much more manageable!

RATING: 7.25
This game is far, far better than the original board game in my opinion.  It takes the best parts (racing mechanism, trading, limited resources), but steps it up with a variety of choices.  What to build and what to save up for?  But the randomness of the die roll can be frustrating.  Still, I think it provides a good challenge of deciding how to make the best with what you have.

Although it's not bad, this card game doesn't have the appeal of the original. Being two player makes it much more cutthroat and eliminates a lot of the trading and interaction that makes the original what it is.

Another issue would be the amount of space it requires. Every game I've played has had to be slid around and eventually overran the table (or floorspace).

This hasn't made it to the table in a long time and has been replaced with the Traders & Barbarians two player variant for when I can't find a third and have to play Catan.

Production: Rotating production cards takes 100% of the fun out of collecting resources.  Playing building cards takes 85% of the fun out of building wooden towns and roads.   The art on the cards is wonderful, and the text is clean, but on its own the production just doesn't stand out.  Play: Way too cut-throat for my tastes.  Using arson to destroy each other's buildings makes me feel too unsafe with my city, and the competition for victory points is just too fierce.  Oh, and playing with only one opponent takes 99% of the motivation out of trading.  (1+0+2) (2 plays)

A good 2-player Catan game, with lots of Cities and Knights / Seafarers flavor thrown in for good measure. The focus is different -- building settlements and cities is good, but the special-powered buildings which you can add to them are the real meat of the game, and make it much more interesting. Overstays its welcome somewhat. Not sure how this compares to the newer Catan card games.

Settlers themed Memory.  Broken and useless, unless you actually want to play Memory, but then the other mechanics interfere with it making it something less then Memory.  I formerly had this rated at .01, as it is my most hated game, but BGG seems to have modified the system to make 1 the lowest viable rating.  Of all the myriad games I've played over the years, this is the worst. This game's existence makes me angry.

This one hour long game can be decided in the first 15 minutes... it's mainly a race for settlements as the one with the most will win most of the time, as experienced with about 20 games under our belts. It's a huge flaw in what would otherwise be a great game.

I like the board game and had high hopes for the card game. So far it's been interesting but I feel that the length of each game is a little disproportionate to the level of fun. Much of the game seems to be spent waiting for resources and dreading the wrong dice roll. Both elements exist in the board game, too, but I felt that more players added social elements that help counteract them.

The base card game (Never mind the expansions!) takes me to the limits of what I can tolerate in the "special powers/special properties" genre. Adding cards to and simplifying Puerto Rico produces San Juan, another game that just manages to avoid "special properties" overkill; by comparison, adding cards to and complicating Settlers produces the Catan Card Game.

A good job of porting a board game to a card game.  It truly feels like Settlers, even with some additions/deletions. However, I just got bored with the whole Catan thing. Plus, the whole wood for sheep gets old real fast.

Game mechanics and events are interesting, and also fun to play with the expansion packs.

MUCH more fun IMHO than the original Settlers Of Catan game...

Idea:
Card game version of Settlers of Catan for 2 players.

Mechanism:
Grow your city, get more resourcesfields so that dieroll will produce more often, build useful structures to overcome events and to score points

to who:
This captures well Settlers and at least first image is that this has some real value, possibly addons make it even better. If you like easy to learn games this sounds good. Note that wife likes this too.

This is a very good game that I enjoy even more that the Settlers board game.  It's great when you're looking for a two-player contest that's somewhat deeper and longer than the typical Kosmos game.

This is a pretty good implementation of SoC. On the plus side, it translates SoC into a good 2 player game that basically scratches the same itch. On the negative side, it takes just about as long as the board game to setup and play. This is a huge flaw and it greatly influences how rarely I get to play this game.

The game plays very slow for me. Don't like that too much. Not as enjoyable as the board game. Basically a 2 player solitaire. Very little interaction. If you play it enough, some strategies can be predictable. Boring. I like certain aspects of the card game, but the game lasts way too long that I would prefer using my time playing something else because I quicky lose am interest.

Never tried the expansions. Maybe trying the expansions will change my opinion on Settlers of Catan Card game, but I highly doubt it.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

I don't plan to play Settlers of Catan Card Game any time soon. Game is too long fot what it gives you. Would of thought it would play faster.

Fair.  The original [i]Settlers[/i] is one of the great games of the modern era, and realistically is the game in the Top 50 with the best shot at being played 50 years from now.

This one removes the most interesting thing about the board game -- trading -- in favor of focusing almost entirely on development with a new hand management and memory aspect put in.  As a result it makes it quite dry, calculating, and a lot less fun than the rambunctious trading and building of its big brother.    Takes about as long as the board game and [b]more[/b] table space.  Jeez.  There's better two-player games out there.

RATING: 4
This is a decent card game with somewhat of a CCG feel to it with it's resource management and interaction with your opponent.  The reason why this decent card game is rated low is that it takes up a tremendous amount of table space.  In addition to that the game is very long for a card game.  The bottom line is that it may be a decent card game, but there are many better options than this.  In fact you could probably play a number of these better games in the time it would take you to finish one play of this.

An interesting two player version of Settlers of Catan.  While my wife and I enjoy playing this game, it is important to realize that it is NOT Settlers of Catan for two players.  It has a much more solitare feel to it and there really is no reason to trade and so while that element is in the game, it doesn't really work.  The game can also last a very long time for a two player game.

Even if lacking some interaction it is a great game with lots of options to choose from, especially when you play with one or two expansions.

I bought this for my wife, and she enjoys it, but unfortunately I don't much.  It lacks the best part of regular Settlers - namely, the trading - while retaining all of the annoying luck.  The card drafting mechanic is somewhat interesting - I enjoyed my first few games - but in the end the strategy is ruined by the luck.  The game can also be frustratingly long.  If I am going to put in that much time and calculating thought I would rather play a real strategy game - like Caylus, which we both enjoy.

Decent two-player game - easy to learn but it wears thin after a while.  I think I'm thoroughly bored with it now.  It takes too long for what it is.  Expansions add to replay-ability.

Finally got to play this once after a couple of interrupted attempts, and didn't really like it.  You know when you're a kid and you really want to play a certain game, but nobody will play with you, so you take it out of the box and mess around with the pieces and pretend you're playing the game?  That's what this feels like.  A weak compensation for when you really feel like playing Settlers, but only have two people.  Rather than fool with this, I'd prefer to either find a 3rd person, or just suck it up, forget about Settlers, and play one of the many good games for 2 people.

Es para 2 jugadores y aunque en teorí­a son partidas de 75 minutos, en la práctica se va a 2h mí­nimo. cada jugador debe crear su propio principado con aldeas,  ciudades y diferentes edificios que construímos gracias a las materias que vamos obteniendo al tirar el dado. es muy importante desarrollar bien los campos de producción, y para ello los exploradores son fundamentales; los duplicadores de producción son muy buenos y ya si los "combas" con el mercado adecuado tendrás muchas opciones de victoria. Dominar el caballero y el molino durante la partida es importante para sacar beneficio, independientemente del punto de victoria que te aportan. Mira tu ciudad pero no descuides la del otro; el primero en conseguir 12 puntos gana.
PARTIDAS:
06-04-2008 Pi y Gato en nuestra primera partida.Mi juego destructivo a base de bandidos, espías y pirómanos no es eficaz frente a la altísima producción de Pilar. Me gana, casi sin darme cuenta 12-8.

One of the better two-player card games, a more "gamer" game. 
Negatives: 1. starts slow; 2. overly long game (2 hours); 3. significant down-time and little interaction during opponent's turn; 4. card counting/memorizing required to play well; 5. fiddly.  
Positives: 1. CCG like qualities; 2. scope for deeper strategic play than most other card games.  
A good variant that improves and speeds up the game is the "[thread=4306]extra-production die[/thread]" variant, where two production dice are rolled each turn (this is preferable to shortening the game to 10VPs, which eliminates the fun of city development).  Another alternative is the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/3136/free-city-variant]Free City variant[/url].

Also owned: [gameid=2915] - Improves the card game for dedicated players looking for more variety.

The game was reworked and improved as [gameid=66056] in 2010.  Ideas for playing the original game with Rivals of Catan rules for shorter game [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/8096263#8096263]here[/url].

I don't usually rate after only 1 play but I'm not sure I want to play this again.  I could never get the resources I needed, my card draws were crap, and my wife just kept destroying and stealing everything I would build or collect.  I eventually got so far behind it was hopeless.  A very long and frustrating experience with a runaway leader problem and no fun at all.

I want to hope that it is not always like this, but it seems that the combination of this much luck and this much direct confrontation can allow for a pretty unbalanced and unpleasant game.

Willing to try again.....maybe.

2nd play (6 years later, hah!):
We played "nicely" this game, but there still appears to be a runaway leader problem.  Once the momentum is going it seems hard to stop.  Upgraded to 5 stars.

(2-player) This game could be fun, but it takes way too long and there's so little payoff for the effort.  Cards that can only be used at specific phases of the game are frustrating, and keeping track of the victory points would drive an accountant mad. Feh!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Whilst this works as a 2-player game, it seemed very long (we stopped after 2 hours only on about 8 VPs each). It totally lacks the 2d6 probability aspect and therefore lucky dice rolls make a big difference. I see this as a major flaw in the game and detracts from it as a Settlers game. I would have prefered a design which used probability and so rewarded the player that built towards that. Other than that, the events and action cards are well-balanaced, but there was a distinct bias against trading. Also, the role of gold was not explained properly. Try before you buy is my recomendation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a solid game, and fills in nicely if you have 2 people hungry for Settlers action.  Now that we've all left Settlers behind for 100,000 other Eurogames, that is less of a recommendation than it used to be!  I would no longer really consider playing this game without using the expansions--otherwise, as far as I can tell, the best thing to do is to search all of the card stacks for the Mint until you find it (or until you determine your opponent has it--if they then get the 3rd river tile, concede!).

This is our favorite card game for quite a long time. The game mechanics, some hazard due to the dice, expansions (official and non-official ones) give it a great replayability.

A small but lengthy card game, that is very luck driven. (Dice determine what resources you acquire). I've played this about 6 times, and feel it's starting to get a bit stale. There isn't much need for human interaction, as there is no compelling reason to engage in trades. What interaction you do get, is from playing "take that" cards on your opponent. Not a bad game, but rather something to pull out every once in a while when you've played everything else to death. See my review for a few more details.

* Played 10+ times. Middleweight strategy. Dull dull dull. Nice artwork can't redeem this one. It is very repetitive. The strategy for this game seems set in stone: build Abbey, build Garrison, build Doubler, build buildings. I never build knights because they never seem to justify the expense of building. // Slight improvement of this game. It does have great graphics, and a friend suggested a rule to make the game more interesting: Instead of 5 decks (which allows you to find the cards you want each time), have one large deck and only allow searches thru 6 cards. This FORCES players to take different strtegies each time they play. If this variant works, I expect my rating will rise to a 6 or 7. // Rating now a NINE! (up from 4 then 7) with all rules as normal except I use the "MegaDeck Variant" [o-m]

RATING: 6.8
Just for 2.  I prefer the board game to the card game.  With just 2 players, trades and bargaining doesn't make as much sense due to lack of energy in negotiations. About the only time I would want to play this again is on a trip--the travel game of the Settlers of Catan board game just has too many small, small pieces.  Too fiddly.  So, I would take the card game instead.

Pretty faithful conversion of Settlers to a card game. The focus is different, concentrating on developing your settlements and cities rather than occupying the best spots on the board, and, being for two players only, it is also a bit more cut-throat as it includes various cards for direct conflict.

The dice usually aren't quite as decisive as in the board game because both players usually get resources on every roll. The concepts of the original are still very much visible, though.

It´s easy to explain, easy to play and doesn´t take to long.

Wheneven you think the game gets dull, you can use one of the additional decks.

Trading doesn´t appear to work as well with this cardgame as it does in Catan the boardgame. Probably because the cardgame can only be played by two players.

An interesting game.  After three plays (over a year!), I find I still don't yet have a feel of tactics and strategy, but I think with regular play it might turn into a more than reasonable longer two player game.  Am liking it more with each play, so recent increase in my rating (18/12/08).  Update: Just not a game I would play compared to others.  I just think its too long for what i is; and a single dice roll has no distribution (unlike the 2 die roll in the original game), so I always feel its more luck orientated.  Im sure it isnt, but I just dont want to play it again and again to find out, especially as there is now an updated version of the game out - rating decrease from 7 to 5 (27/12/10). So, I purchased the Rivals of Catan, which makes this game almost irrelevant (it's actually stored inside the rivals box!) (29/11/11) UPDATE 3SF 4.382 Jan17

A rather clever card game that holds true to the original Catan theme with expansions adding just enough variety to keep my interest.

Catan Card Game was replaced by the newer "The Rivals for Catan" in 2010, although I am at a loss as to why Mayfair Games bothered to mess with this already good game.

Very good two-player version of Settlers of Catan. Honestly, the card game is better than the original game, in my opinion, which is usually not the case with "The Card Game" versions of any game. Unfortunately, the game tends to be a bit longer than it should reasonably be.

My wife and I enjoy playing standard Settlers so much we got this game about 5 years ago to allow the same sort of fun hopefully to two players.  It didn't translate.  We played it twice and put it away forever.  Maybe it's time for us to rediscover it.
UPDATE: After five years on the shelf we tried it for two games over two nights.  We are ready to put this back in rotation!  The game is long for us so we like to play to 10 points often.  You really need to set aside some time for this one (we wait till the little one is in bed.)  The game has improved drastically with play and now I won%u2019t let go of it.
  We like the game every time we play.  We now have the expansion and will probably spend less time playing this original "as is"

Picked up my copy while visiting my parents in the Detroit, MI area at a FLGS.  After five games, one of them actually ending with a player reaching 12 points, I am absolutely resolving never to play this game past 10 points.  It seem a bit too long to get to 12, and by then the action cards are largely dried up.  Our game basically came down to a die roll at that point.

A good 2-person translation of Settlers of Catan, using cards.

This rating would be higher, except that it's a little too long and involved for my spouse, making it not ideal for my purposes as a two player game. I was hoping this game would be a great "spouse" game, but it hasn't worked out that way.
[I recently played against someone other than my spouse and found I enjoyed the game a lot, though it does run long.]

We eventually discovered the card game version of Catan and began playing it instead of the full version of the game when it was just me and my wife.  We eventually discovered the broken strategy of Scout, Iron/Wheat, then double production, and we began to play it less.  It is still a fun game, and we may play it if we are camping for its small footprint and nostalgia, but the winner will still probably come down to whoever plays the Scout card first.

Good game, one of the few games my wife likes to play (on occasion, she much rather play Taiwanese Mahjong though), good game with a large element of luck.  Games take awhile to finish, but it doesn't seem too long when you are having so much fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
More strategic than the original boardgame but still a bit random. Easy-to-grasp rules, nice graphics and smooth gameplay. The only downside is the playing time - 60 minutes at least (with experienced players). And at the end of the play the cards take a huge amount of space on the table. I mean HUGE.

But I like it nevertheless.

RATING: 8.5
Great 2P game!  

An important lesson (that took me a while to learn) is to often spend 2 resources to search a stack instead of relying on the luck of the draw.

It's long, but I don't tend to notice the time flying by.  However, I also like to play with a secondary (smaller) resource die.  It allows one extra resource in a matching field or, if the dice match, any field.  This gets things rolling much quicker.

I use clear glass counters on the fields instead of rotating the cards.  It's quicker, easier to read, and it doesn't wear out the cards.

We love this game tournament style.  It may seem like two player solitaire, but we get very competitive with it.  There is quite a bit of luck with the reliance on dice rolls.  But the challenge in the game is managing the risk and resources better than the other player.

First impressions after reading the rules: wow, that's way too complicated! During the game, I have to refer to the rulebook at almost every turn, to know what does what, and my bad memory doesn't help. 2+ hours of that don't feel that great I'm afraid. Maybe if I could remember all the rules, it could be a quick and fun game...

RATING: 6
Tends to drag on, but is a bit deeper than the board game (without expansions at least). It's fun to play when there's only two of you.

We did have to introduce a house rule where the one card that trades gold 1:1 is put outside the deck and each player can build one each (like the university in the expansion), because matches would devolve into constantly scouting/trying to take over that card from the other player. Not sure if that was just our metagame or the card really is that powerful, but it wasn't much fun.

Not a bad card game version of Settlers.  We mistakenly started playing it without the rule that you *discard* action cards once played.

I love how similar it is to the original Catan boardgame but shrinks it down for 2 player sessions.

One of the better games for two players.  It doesn't really play anything like Settlers, though, so if you're a fan of Settlers, don't automatically assume you'll like the card game.

I would like to play this again to give it another shot. The cards (and rolls) were very unbalanced (in my favor), and made the game seem very unfair. I liked the game itself, and I found it significantly different from the original board game. However, unlike San Juan > Puerto Rico, I actually found the card game a little more complex (just slightly). If I were teaching a new player, I would choose the original game before this one. After another play, my feelings haven't changed much. I like it, but it just seems too long, and often unbalanced.

People are often trying to come up with 2 player variants for the board game, but really, they should just be playing this.

RATING: N/A
It wouldn't be fair to rate this without playing it, but I was disappointed in the sense of expectations, as it was recommended for my wife and I to play this as being, in essence, a 2 player version of SoC. But reading through the rules it was clear that it's a pretty big departure from that in many respects.  She doesn't like the whole idea of variants and expansions and all that... Once she learns a game she wants to play it that way.  I was of course expecting this to be at least somewhat different... being only with cards, of course... but it was a bit much to wrap my head around, so I didn't even bother for us to try to play it and resold it right away.  We're actually very happy with a certain 2 player variant for the original SoC, so we'll stick with that.  Also, I was hoping this could be something we might be able to more easily play in our RV as we travel a lot, but as it turns out, you need just as much if not more table space to lay everything out as you do with the board game.  So anyway, I'm sure it's probably a great game on its own, but it's just not for me and the Mrs.

I was looking forward to The Settlers of Catan Card Game as a good game to play with my wife, but I was sorely disappointed.  It suffers from various large flaws:

- the gold resource is useless
I traded it away and don't want to play it again.

I like this a good deal.  The basic game is compelling and reasonably fast.  The expansions seem to add some variety without a lot of rules.  movement of cards and board-like gameplay make this not feel like a "card game" to me.

Follow-up:
Still really enjoying it.  Expansions don't seem to radically change game thus far so they don't seem to be a must have.  Good value in base game and good solid quality game.  More fun than Settlers, but only 2 players.

Final review:
We played this 20 times or so, and really lost interest in the long run.  It's the random elements of Catan, with less strategy and a less convincing visual element.

A card game themed for Catan.

We find resources determined by a dice roll (albeit the distribution is always the same at first), the brigands, the knights, road, settlements and cities, etc.

Some original bits: the square shaped cards that we rotate as counters.

RATING: 6
Should be more fun than it is; it seems very important to spend resources to search for that one card that will make a difference, which kind of defies my logic.

Auch für dieses kleine Kartenspiel gibt es empfehlenswerte Erweiterungen.

Used to play 3 to 4 consecutive game marathons when we first got this.  Games take 60-90 minutes and the early game play is very slow.  Lots of luck in this game- dice rolls, random cards, etc, but you can build a strategy around the cards you have.  There are better games out there and this game hardly hits the table anymore.

Unlike regular Catan, in this game it is incredibly difficult to see resources.  You have a hard time calculating the total number of resources when the bandit strikes.  You also have a hard time remembering what resources you get, once you start expanding.  This will inevitably lead to someone forgetting to do something resource-based, which in turn leads to a giant advantage or disadvantage.

The only time you should play this game is when you want to get upset at one of two people, either yourself or your opponent, but you don't want to know ahead of time who you want to be upset at.

First played this on Jan 19th 2007.  If you are looking for a quick to learn, fast play two player game, this is not it.  I read the ~20 page rule book and was a bit concerned then.  Explaining it to my wife was a bit confusing as I refered back to the rulebook during our first gameplay.  True it has some similarities to Settlers, however that's where it ends.  It has cards and a few tokens, so it's compact to take with you, however there are so many options, you could play this many times and not be the same game.  We both had experience with Settlers however it didn't seem to click for my wife as she agreed to play it one more time, however she didn't like it.  In short, this seemed like an overly complicated game for a two player game what you were getting.  On the flip side, you have a game that once you know how to play, can get fun and different each time you play.

Innovative in its day, now tired and lacking. Love the period, the artwork, and the theme of growing crops. Rotating the cards was ingenious. The doubler cards, like Mills for Grain, are not and suffer. Road tiles are lame. Here's a game that needs to be updated, changed, rewritten from head to toe. Having placemats like Puerto Rico would be a plus.  Starship Catan is a better evolution as well. But really, it's one of the few games from 1996 that anyone remembers anymore.

Got excited about the refresh. But it's still just okay.

Rated for both gameplay and sentimental value. How proud I was, beating my father in this for the first time! I think my parents played it a lot before my sister and I demanded their constant attention and they were happy to reintroduce it once we were old enough. The game is clever, tactical, bt also luck-based. I think it's beautiful, too and some of the knights' descriptions are a running gag among us. A faw seems to be that whoever has one more village tends to win.

Being able to play Settlers with two is wonderful. The cards make the game very easy to transport with you on vacations and go at it. The mechanics worked very well for me.

My sister had this to say about the game, "This game feels more like Catan than Settlers." Hah! I laughed at her for ages for that. She meant to say "than Carcassonne" and for some reason thought it was the Carcassonne card game.

The Settlers of Catan experience in a 2-player card game version. Like the Settlers of Catan boardgame, the card game often suffers because of its high luck factor and the mechanism for determining the end of the game (games can often drag on interminably). While the card game lacks the trading element of the original multi-player version, it does introduce the extra dimension of card management. This makes the card game sufficiently different to be worth trying even if you are jaded by the boardgame.

This game captures a lot of the mechanics and feel of Settlers, but in cardgame format.  Great when you want your Settlers fix when there are only two people to play.  I'd rather play the board game though, as the main problem with this game is the "runaway train" effect of the leader... you just can't catch up.  Either that or I'm just exceedingly unlucky at the die rolls...

Based on two plays- My wife and I really enjoyed this and would likely play again.  However, the game was a bit too long for its mechanics and seemed to drag badly in the middle.  I really don't mind longer games as long as there is enough going on to keep it interesting.  While in the endgame there was plenty going on to sustain the game- its starts out very slow and drags through the middle.  I'd rather play several shorter games of comparable depth- Jambo, Odin's Ravens, etc. than spend the time required to play this often.

RATING: 7.5
It doesn't shine during the first contact.  But the more you play it, more you appreciate it.  Still, it sometimes shows the signs which can discourage you during the first play like dragging a bit. 

By accident I found a very nice house rule.  Generally, I'm the enemy of house rules, but this one works GREAT: allow building city expansions (red ones) next to the settlements.  I've been implementing it in every game since my discovery.  It makes the game faster, more varied and more exciting.

Basic game might get repetitive and that's why I strongly recommend all available expansions.  They make the game more varied and just better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great option for when you can only get 1 other player.  Momentum is very different from Settlers (board game), meaning that we spend a lot more time planning than actively playing.  Less interaction and does require a lot of space.  That being said i thouroughly enjoy playing.
#fantastic suggestion from another player is to add a second production die (doubling the resources gained and speeding up the momentum)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
initial rating

I'm really surprised no one has made the correlation yet to MTG here. This to me, is like Settlers of Catan with Cities & Knights added to it and also some elements of mtg thrown in re: variable player powers, 2 person card game, etc. This is a great option for a 2 person Catan game for people who want a little more strategy and don't mind a somewhat deeper longer type game, although it can be easily shortened re: VP's. Although this game loses some of it's original magic (hehe) re tension on the board with more players and it plays somewhat differently, it gains in other areas like strategic options and it still has several paths to Victory. 

Update: 10 VP's is the way to go, 12 would be WAY too long. Rated dropped a little as I had it a little high for what it is I think but we really like this one.

NOTE: Anyone thinking of buying this must be accepting of the "take that" effect, it can be maddening and fun at the same time. Like its bigger brother, the dice can spoil a good game sometimes but usually it evens out. We like this game quite a bit and the expansions will add tons of life to it.

update: 8 => 7 too long and fiddly to play on weeknights making it harder to get to table and less desirable

update: => traded. Too many newer games that get played before this ever will, I still think its a decent game, there are just better options for 2 players and ~45 minutes in our collection like rftg etc

I almost forgot I played this a number of years ago, maybe I'm being harsh but I think a key element to Catan is the negotiation, and as a 2 player game of course it's not in there.  I didn't feel it was "Settlers, only with 2" and I didn't feel as though the game was that great as a seperate "not like Settlers at all" game. So I give it a "Meh" rating, as I won't go out of my way to play this game ever again.

RATING: 6
A successful 2p incarnation of its parent game. It recasts the familiar Catan elements (resources, roads, settlements, cities, etc.) very well, and the mechanic of rotating cards to track resources is effective. It adds some robust direct interaction that was lacking in the base game, including some powerful "Take that!" cards. This is not a quiet, friendly game of developing your principality more efficiently than your opponent. The cards drive you to punish each other at every opportunity. While this constant back-and-forth dynamic adds  welcome suspense and tension, it makes the game run a bit too long. It can feel dry at times, but it offers some satisfying moments along the way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great 2 player version of the Settlers of Catan game. Adding the various card abilities makes this more interesting than the basic game, although I feel that playing to 12 points makes the game tend to go on a bit long. A great small game to take with you when travelling :-)

RATING: 10
The first time I played this game a couple years ago I was unimpressed.  I recently gave it another chance and I am glad I did because now its one of my favorites.  It has all the moving parts, strategies, and combinations of a CCG that I like without all the messy deckbuilding stuff. The only negative is that its not the most "approachable" game because skillful play really necessitates that you have a pretty good working knowledge of all the cards - but thats the price you pay when you have a game with a lot of depth.

UPDATE: I have raised my rating to a 10.  This game has great replayability for me and lots of paths to victory.  My favorite expansion is Barbarians and Traders.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Seeing some information on the revamp of this game reminded me of how disappointing it is in a lot of ways.

My major complaints: too long and feels like luck can still be too much a factor at the very start and then the very end.  

The reason for the length is a couple:

1) if people have played before often they'll try to wait for certain cards.  Add that to looking through a card stack it gets painful.  (let's say people decide to race for the scout card and keep burning gold.  at least every other turn you can have someone looking completely through a pile)
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very good game, though one that I'm not tempted to play much at all. Only drawback is that many cards sit in your hand too long, either because they are too specific (many of the "counter" event cards), or because you simply aren't able to build them (mainly city cards, at the beginning). Other than that, very good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I can't say what it is about the game that makes me want to play it. It just looks cool. The actual gameplay is okay, a bit draggy (might be that playing to 10 VP might be better) and it takes A LOT of space.

In comparison, I like Starship Catan so much more, but looking at the art and the square cards, I just always feel like I want to play it.

Dentro de los juegos ligeros, de cartas para dos personas, este es uno de mis favoritos. Un juego muy completo, que dura entre una y dos horas, y que asegura piques y ganas de revancha cuando pierdes, y una satisfacciÃ³n general cuando ganas.

Como la mayorÃ­a de juegos sencillos de cartas, (Se parece un poco al San Juan), no hay que abusar de el, ya que puede acabar siendo monÃ³tono.

RATING: 8
A fun 2 player game. Can run a bit long though but game length can be determined by assigning a lower victory point goal. Shares some similarities with Starship Catan and naturally the full sized SoC. Lots of differnet cards like events, special action cards that help you or hinder your opponent, and special buildings you can build, and so on. Uses two types of luck (card draw and die roll) to determine what events happen, what regions produce trade goods, and what cards you get.

Fun game where you tap cards to accumulate resources. I've read about the new version and I think I prefer this one - there is no need to nerf the game by removing attack cards. We play with 2 production die, and increase the Brigand to 9 and the cost for digging into a stack to 3; double rolls (5,5 or 6,6 etc.) mean x,x+1 so two fives become (5 and 6).

Fun little game.  Not quite as good as San Juan if you're looking for a 2-player card game that's easy to learn.  (SJ also has the advantage of allowing for more players, and it serves as a nice intro for novice gamers to the concepts of Puerto Rico.  Settlers of Catan is a fun game, but it's too easy to benefit from an intro).  If they're just two of us playing, we'll usually play 2-player Settlers instead of this card game. EDIT: reduced a point...too many better games; don't have any desire to play this again.

I think you have to play SoC first, which is something I neglected to do (usually it's my wife and I, so finding a 3 or 4 is tough some days).  The experience was just overall very frustrating, and the overall goal, while clear, seemed a bit unrealistic.  It was almost an anticlimax when it was over.  And I say that having won the game.

Played without expansions.

Boring.

Felt like we were just putting cards down.  

No interaction.

Drug on.

Almost no conflict.

Boring.

Will try with expansions at some point, but without, *yawn*. Will probably try the Starship Catan first though.

I think this game would be just as much fun solitaire as 2-player, cause you don't even need an opponent.  Sure you can attempt to kill his/her knights, or burn his buildings, but how repetitive and simplistic is that.

I really don't see the replay value in this one, just not very deep.

In the end, felt like I had just piled up a bunch of cards.  This opinion probably comes from playing Magic: The Gathering, which I find many times more enjoyable.

I would recommend Carcassonne: The Castle over this (2 player, same price, much more interaction).

A great two player card game that only suffers from two major problems.  The length, at nearly 2 hours, can prove a deterrent.  Also, when the die rolls aren't going your way, the game can become frustrating and very repetitive.

A card game with the same basic theme as Settlers, but that feels a lot different.  Particularly, this is a more complicated (and usually longer) game that introduces hand-management and a memory component to replace the spatial element lost from the board game.  Overall, it's a lot of fun and pretty challenging, and my wife and I enjoy it a lot.

Fun, but apt to drag at times. You do NOT need to have the most settlements to win. The expansions seem to have detracted from the game, and our interest in playing it slips and slips. We bought it for Xmas 2003, and by January 2005, my rating for it has gone from 8 to 7 to 6, and my wife hasn't mentioned it in week or months (we play games several times a week). When someone posted a journal about this game's going rate on Ebay, I was tempted... but we have the German edition because, as I have said elsewhere, my wife married an idiot. (This was a BGGM purchase soon after we discovered this site.)

Most likely you'll be thinking if the card game version of Settlers is as good as the board game. Well, I would say the possible strategies and tactics are varied and interesting. Also, the game is slightly less luck driven and has a lot of interesting mechanisms and conflict in between players, but lacks something: The great socialising aspect of the original. This doesn't surprise me at all, as I can't see how a trading game can work with just two players.

Given that, it's almost impossible to tell if you'll like this one solely based on your feelings towards the original. Both games seem to share a lot: the resources are the same, you still build roads, settlers, cities and all, but all the negotiations and trade are gone. When you are learning to play, you'll find a lot of familiar things, but after several turns you soon discover that it's a different experience.

But, is it a good game? For me, the answer is yes: the 5 piles from which the buildings are and how all the draws/discards are handled not only is unique, but also reduces luck drastically and opens a lot of strategies. The offensive cards are very nasty and powerful, which shoots the conflict and the "take that" feeling a lot. The main flaw is the length: reducing it by 30 minutes would have been great.

All in all, a good game for two players that is fun and, while not too deep, definitely interesting, but maybe a wee bit too long.

Played this over and over again. A big plus is that the gf adores it! Not been into the expansions yet, no need, the basic game keeps us going for now. Only drawback she mentioned once, which is the same with the settlers boardgame: Once you fall back a little, it's hard to catch up again. The person getting the most villages first is usually the one to win (when we play anyways). -> The strong only get stronger. In the end though, when both players win some, lose some, it's all fun and games and it's never stopped us from bringing it out.

This review covers the expansions as well: Very unique. To say playing this game is satisfying is an understatement. It takes the genre and places you in the story line but also challenges you with strategy and logical thought. It's still resource management but without the emphasis on that factor that the board game has.

At the beginning the game looked very promising, but while playing, it turned out to be very one sided. Though both of us had not played the game in this century, when I got ahead, it was pretty much clear that I had won the game after half an hour and there was little chance of a comeback. It dragged on for almost another hour though, until I had finally secured victory, which felt too drawn out. Overall the theme of the game is nice, but I prefer games for more than two players. Also I have better 2 player card games in my collection which I would rather play.

Comments after a solo play against myself (and losing).

It does not seems to be a bad game, I like the mechanics in general and it will probably get better with the expansion. There is a few things that annoys me which is probably only a problem I have.

The board is a visual mess. I am color blind and I am really not a visual person. So First rotating the card to keep track of resources was completely confusing. I was mixing up values. So I rapidly used glass beads over the cards. Much more convenient.

But also since you can have multiple cards of the same resources, it becomes somehow hard to analyze which resources you had available. In the catan original game, all your resources are in your hand. So it's easy to know what you have. Here they are scattered on the board.

The second problem is the memory aspect. You could in theory memorize which card is located in which stack so that when you draw a card, you draw or search from the right stack. This is something I cannot do (short memory), which might strongly disadvantage me.

Finally, I ended up losing against myself, it was horrible. By trying to use arsonist against my opponent, I rolled a 6 and end up losing my mint. It took me around 10 turns before being able to build it back. The robber was really annoying because even you have a garrison, the resources are not protected, they just don't count to exceed 7.

I never had a chance to get the windmill, I occasionally got the horse. Near the end my opponent built and harbor with 3 fleets, which game him 2-3 times more windmill than I had. So don't even think about it anymore. Then I got all my knights returned to my hand which then got discarded, which is a "don't event think about it either". I ended the game at 10 VP, because it was already too long, and had no chance to catch up. 

I am not sure if you can catch up as easily in this game as in the real catan board game.

This is a medium fun card game, with medium strategy and medium cards, and medium length (okay it's too long, about an hour and a half).  It's not a "bad" card game, and not a "great" card game; I'd say it's a "medium" card game.  

We would play more if it were shorter: the last game we played I was so RELIEVED to end the darn thing.  The beginning was fun, but it really dragged at the end, and we only played to 10 instead of the recommended 12 points.  I also didn't get to play many buildings, unfortunately they just don't seem "that" helpful, it's better to just "race" for the settlements and cities and I didn't have a chance to do much else; but I have to play it more to really know for sure.

I'm not certain about the replayability of the basic game but all the expansions help spice it up some.

Due to our disappointing experience with the original [GAMEID=13] boardgame, it was a long time before we took a chance with the card game.  This was a big mistake, since this has turned out to be one of our favorites.  

Overall, it feels like a more meaty version of [GAMEID=8217], and it's probably good that we started with that first.  It has the building special cards aspects of [GAMEID=8217].  It also has the resource manipulation feel of [GAMEID=12002].  Not only is there a race through the deck to build special buildings, but you also have to manage your different resources as well.

The different paths to victory balance the game much more than the straightforward resoure gathering of the board game.  You can build up your armies to take the knight token.  Or you can build up your trade buildings to take the commerce token.  If you're behind in resources, you can play action cards to catch up.  The relatively small hand size also ensures that the player with more resources can't do everything---if he loads his hands with knights, the other player can load up on action cards or commerce buildings, so cardplay becomes important.  Unlike the board game, there's less of a "rich get richer" feeling in the card game since there's so many more options for each player to come back.  As a result, even the directly aggressive cards like the Black Knight or the Arsonist don't feel as vicious.

[GAMEID=8217] is probably the cleaner game and the better design.  It's much shorter and more elegant with a design simplicity.  [GAMEID=278] is much longer and with many more rules and cards.  Still, we've had many more magical "aha!" moments in this game.  [i]"Remember the time you played [i]two[/i] Black Knights in a row and I countered with the [i]two[/i] Herb Woman?"  "Remember when I played an arsonist but then I rolled a six so I burned down my own building?"[/i]  We've had a lot of fun with this game.

Very beautiful game and fun to play but ... there are some flaws. It takes too long (Too many victory points) and if you're unlucky you can end up waiting for the other to win for a long time.
The villages in the game are a bit broken meaning that for a game that hasn't got a 4 to 5 ratio between the players, the winner will be known very soon in the game with a lot of frustration for the loser as a result.
They say the expansions make the game better but can't back that up as I don't owe them.

Very slow and frustrating. I usually like some luck, but luck plays a huge part in the game. We're constantly starved for more resources just waiting around. I hate the encouragement to memorize the cards in the stacks in the middle.

I have to say that this one was alot better than I thought it would be. There's a good effort to make this feel like Settlers, while still remaining it's own game. I have yet to try my expansions with it, but I know the game will only get better with subsequent plays.

An interesting variant on the Settlers theme.  I find it to be much more satisfying than regular Settlers (which I refuse to play without Cities and Knights).  There is still a die rolling factor, but without the bell curve and with each player starting with every resource, it is highly minimized.  The deck draw system takes getting used to, but the deck build is interesting enough to make for some good thinking.

After a few plays, I'm still not sure how I feel about this game.  The last couple of games were runaway victories and very boring and methodical, as I was behind the power curve from the beginning and had no hope of catching up.  My wife loves it, though, and we'll keep playing it for awhile and then add some expansion decks to spice it up. 

*7/16/06* Played again and got destroyed 12-5.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong!

*4/6/09*  I taught my 11 year old daughter this game, and it's now her favorite.  It's our game of choice when we're hanging out at Barnes and Noble.

Very fortunate Christmas present. After a few games, I still can't decide whether it has Medium or Medium heavy gameplay weight. However, I'm absolutely sure that both me and my wife love to play it.

I liked this game a lot, until I played it with my wife and she got very mad at me for using a tactic that was very aggressive and interfered with her ability to advance her game.  Ever since I have shied away from it.  I am now reluctant to play a game that allows for those kind of highly disruptive tactics to be successful with the wrong gaming partner.  Would like to try it again in future.

It has nothing to do with the original SoC. It's a good game if you add the expansions and play with the tourneament rules. The basic game is quite random. There's a lot of luck and a memory element. Quite long for a 2-palyer game.

Im Siedler-Kartenspiel baut jeder Spieler an seinem eigenen Fürstentum. 
Neben den Karten, mit denen man Erweiterungen bauen kann, gibt es viele weitere Karten, die im Laufe des Spieles ausgelegt werden: Aktionskarten, die Sonderrechte einräumen, Ereigniskarten, Gebiets- oder Stadtausbauten.
Bei jedem Zug eines Spielers wird wie im Siedler-Brettspiel gewürfelt: Der eine Würfel zeigt an, welche der Landschaften Ertrag abwirft, der andere führt zu Ereignissen.

Settlers meets Magic: the Gathering. Took me a few games before I really liked it but now I think it&#039;s great. Drawback: this always takes us at least 90 minutes but two hours is more usual. If it were shorter, rating would be at least a 9.
Update 10 years later: it's still fun, but showing its age. Take-that effects and randomness can cause progress to come to a halt.

Although I'm not a Catan fan, this card variant for 2 players is really good. It doesn't feel as a "commercially interesting card variant", but rather as a different game with the same thematic ideas behind it.

Although this was a very good conversion of the original game into a two-player card game, it has not aged particularly well. A lot of the later game depends on initial die rolls, and such a big influence of luck does not fit well with the play time of 45+ minutes. Nevertheless, I'll probably play this one every now and then.
Played 50+ times.

Very strategic and more complex than the boardgame. It takes a while to get the hang of it. My first games lasted way longer than 90 minutes.

If you expect a relaxed evening on Catan, beware! This game is viscous. With direct confrontation, take-that cards, etc., it exposes a hard edge that the board game does not have. Another mood-changing factor is that trading almost never occurs. It just doesn't make sense to even conceit the slightest advantage to you opponent (through win-win deals).

Captures the feel of the Settlers boardgame pretty well, and works better than the 2-player variants of the boardgame that I've tried.

As of 09/05/10 I've played one game of the 1998 Mayfair edition, and twelve games of the 2006 Mayfair edition (eight of those were in conjunction with the set of expansions). Its longer than the board game, but richer. There is not as much human interaction as the board game, yet there is enough to satisfy me. Trading is permitted, but in all those games I think I've only done it about three times total. Its seems to me to be a *great* disadvantage to the inactive player 95% of the time. For a card game it does take up a great deal of table space.

A very fun 2 players game.  One has to make certain the other player don't get too far ahead....in that case, the game is over before it can finish with the VP.

When the same number of settlement is involved on each side, it's a cool game. 

It can run a bit long in the tooth though.  Usually, when a player is so far in advance that it is almost too much to cope with, it's best to call it quit and play another game.

Somewhat interesting game. I'm having trouble seeing it as a Catan variant, but in a way having played Catan makes it a little bit easier to understand some of the mechanics. Quite some rules to learn, I think I'll need another play or two to completely know how it works.

Rating based on a few plays.  I like it a lot for what it is.  It doesn't feel too long even though it lasts longer than I think it should.  It's a simple idea that works well and does have a similar but deeper feel to Settlers.  Could easily see this going up with more plays.

Le jeu Colons de Catane est désormais mondialement célèbre. Le jeu de cartes pour 2 joueurs Colons de Catane en est une adaptation.

Il reprend les grands thèmes de son grand frère : gestion des ressources avec un jet de dé, développement de colonie, construction de nouveaux villages, etc.

L'apport des cartes permet une plus grande variété dans les choix stratégiques et demande une attention et une gestion plus fines.

Si le hasard est toujours présent, les décisions des deux joueurs pèsent lourd dans la balance et la réflexion prime !

I was pleasantly surprised by the gameplay offered by the Catan Card Game, as it seems to have a similar feel to the original Settlers game, but adds considerable depth and enjoyment for 2-players.  My gaming group is sorely lacking in 2-player games, so I'm quite excited to have one as solid as this one.  There's still plenty of luck with dice rolls and card draws, but there's many more choices you can take to improve your position.  We immediately felt comfortable with the gameplay and the different cards, and our games have been very enjoyable thus far.  I think this is one that we'll be pulling out quite frequently when we only have two players.

Bought this because I love Settlers, but the rules are so complex I nearly burst a vein. This is coming from a twelve-year Magic: the Gathering player! At some point I'll have to revisit this and try it out. A much more complex game than standard Settlers.

RATING: 2
Ugh and Yuck. 
The player who is able to build the most towns, ALWAYS wins. And that fact is entirely based on luck. I don't mind luck in my games, but this is too much. The number of towns is odd, so either player will get left behind in the game early and not be able to recover. Removing a town from the game didn't help: in those games, the player who "completed" his town number first (entirely based on luck) always won. Furthermore, the different strategies / paths to victory are a farce. Regardless of what kind of path you choose, which cards you use, what abilities you play, the amount of points it all results to is always the same and equal. As such, in the end, the Settlers Card Game is all and only about who gets the head start with the most resources, and then sits out for the win.
It's really a pity though, since the base mechanics of the game are quite nice, and this [i]could[/i] all work if and only if there were some sort of fixed production, some sort of actual variation in the results of strategies....alas, no more for me.

This is my favorite 2 player game. It lacks some of the interaction and confrontation of the board game, but I don't consider that a negative, here. Most of the interaction is through trading resources. No one is going to be blocking your roads or settlements or otherwise trying to sabatage you personally, so it is a good couples game.

Ugh. I can see the game taking forever to complete. This wouldn't be so bad if the game was involving, but really most turns consist of rolling dice, and passing. I really hate the "negative" cards that can remove cards from the game. Oops, put that big building that just cost you 6 ressources back in your hand! Sucker...
I would enjoy such a lightweight, random game with a playtime of about 20-30 mins. As it stands... why not just play Magic with pre-built starters?

RATING: 7
Card-based Catan works well because all of the cards fit together quite nicely and there's enough different types of cards (a ton if you include expansions) to warrant replay.  Problem for me is that it's a 90-minute game and there are other, meatier games that could be played instead.  I'd still like to explore it more though as there seems to be multiple paths to victory worth exploring.

The deck building variant where both players need the whole game is very good. It lowers the luck aspect since only you get to draw from your deck, and the low number of cards means that there are no junk cards. (You also get to pick you starting hand.) In this way, you can really play different strategies; I have tried, e.g., gold and fleets.

This may be the game that becomes my Carcassonne - and by that I mean the game I use as a gateway to euro games when I'm trying to nudge friends in that direction.  

I resisted joining the Settlers cult following for years because of the hype I suppose. That and the fact that some of the people I know who play, only ever play Settlers.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how enjoyable it is.

I've somehow avoided drinking the Settlers Kool Aid, shhh... don't tell the others. ;-)

One play.  Fumbled through the game learning what the different cards do.  We actually only played to 8 VPs, which was a good idea I think as it did take a while to complete.  I've read about people constantly paying to look for "that one card" they need; we didn't do any of that, simply playing from what we were dealt.  We'll have to each look through the card list before our next game to try and get more into the meaty strategies.

A társasjáték 2 személyes kártya verziója. 
A nyersanyag termelés itt is kockákkal történik a táblás verzióhoz hasonlóan. Nyersanyagaink segítségével utakat, falukat, városokat és különböző épületeket építünk, lovagokat fogadunk fel, flottákat szervezünk, termőföldeket vásárolunk; akció kártyák kijátszásával szerzünk előnyt magunknak, vagy hátráltatjuk az ellenfelünket. A játékot a legtöbb győzelmi pontot elérő játékos nyeri. A pontok legnagyobb része a felépített épületeinkből származik.
Nagyon szép és hangulatos jó minőségű kártyák. Soknak tűnik az a kártya mennyiség, amit a dobozzal kapunk, azonban nekem mégis úgy tűnt egy pár játék után, mintha a partik ismétlődnének; ugyanazok a lapok kerültek a kezembe, ugyanazokat az épületeket építettem meg. Ez persze a kiegészítőkkel orvosolható.

Strategic depth, manageable length, various paths to victory - a lot to like here.  I enjoy the game quite a bit, but somehow my enthusiasm to play it again has waned a little over time.  I disagree with the comments about it being "broken" - I don't find that to be true at all.  If anything it's the Garrisons that attract our early efforts, and one player definitely will come out on the short end there - but no way that's a game-breaker.  The first two-player card game that really grabbed my Significant Other & made me believe I might escape from the classic fate of the lone geek soloing Third Reich in the basement!

Almost every possible game element is in this game: theme, fun, competition, strategy, memory, luck, push your luck, bluffing, optimize your engine, card combos and take that.

You can play agressive, defensive, neutral.

Only flaw: sometimes a run away leader. But close games of this cardgame deserve a 11 for gaming experience.

After more than  10 years still enjoying this game combined with the expansions!

Not a big fan of Settlers (5) in the first place, this game manages to take a turn for the worse: it retains the most annoying feature of the parent game (the luck) while disposing of the best (the trading). And clocking in at 90+ minutes? No thanks. Gave it a decent shot. [7 plays]

For fans of Catan this is a good 2-player experience that usually results in the players racing for that final City to gain an advantage or securing the bonus points for commerce or the greatest Knight.

The expansion with it's 5 additional card sets add the game some much needed longevity after 20 odd plays but for me Starship Catan is still the best stand alone game of the two.

More Catan woohoo! Got some kind of anniversary edition with slots for all expansions. Damn what a nice box that was. Just like with the board game, I was blown away by the fact you could build something, receive resources for it, and then build more stuff! Like srsly rlly?! It had some very mean cards in it though.

Suburbia is probably the better game though if I want to build something and receive more stuff doing so. Simpler and less reliant on luck. Also less table space.

Basically, it's a 2-player game where it's damn hard to build anything at all... and most of your opponent's abilities involve wrecking what you've built. Tis game has broken up more marriages than... errr... someone who breaks up marriages. 

Play it with a friend if you have to play it at all.

[b]Catan Card Game[/b] - Slovenian Edition (1st 2005)

2 players

Countless plays. An enjoyable tactical card game for 2 players. Very in-your-face game play. (GF hates when I play the attack action cards against her. But hey, it´s legal, they are there to play!) Simple rules. 

Entirely different from the original Catan board game, with which it shares only some aspects.

Decent Depth, solitaire aspect not as bad as you think.  Lots of memory required.  Accurately captures feel of Catan in play, though strategies different than settlers.  Was physically exhausted after self learning game with friend, but was a great experience.  Feel that strategies are starting to form after 4 plays.  We&#039;ll see how it stands up to repeat play.

Oh, and for reference that game is a space hog!  Get a big table, and will chew up 1-1.5 hours.  Reccomended!

The 90 minute duration is fine with me;  I find it makes the game more tense, and victory more satisfying.  It doesn't wear out its welcome before the end, like some other games of similar length do.

Great light-ish (bridging on gateway) two-player card game. Far better than Settlers of Catan, as the luck is far more tolerable. There is no way to get screwed when your numbers never come up, as you are going to produce something every turn no matter what. If only it supported more than two players..

Febuary 24th, 2007:
Raised from 8 to 9. This must have been an accident - it's the best game ever churned out of the Catan bandwagon. Although luck is moderate with the dice rolls and card draws, and the start is a race for the extra settlement, it's still a wonderful game that lasts just long enough for its pleasure value. I highly suggest this.

September 15th, 2007:
Raised form 9 to 10. A masterpiece of a game, very skillful, with a moderate amount of luck - easily one of the best games ever, and it does the Catan franchise proud.

Wife likes it, therefore I like it.

The expansions boost my score - the core game is a bit limited. Only thing that is disconcerting is our games are always close. Like 1 or 2 turns from victory. Which tells me all of us are of comparable skill, or it's really a game of random luck. Not sure. Regardless, still fun.

RATING: 3
I both love and hate this game. Fundamentally, it's a very beautiful and fun game. But so much depends on the die roll to determine production, that it can be difficult to plan to far ahead. That means you often sit around waiting for the other play to figure out what they're doing. And if you had a little bit of bad luck, you might spend quite a bit of the game sitting around waiting.
Although I like the way the resources are handled, especially the restrictions and strategies that result, it can be difficult to keep track of how many of each resource you have. Which, in turn, can slow down game play.
Two of the three times I have played have been extraordinarily frustrating with a combination of bad luck, good opponent and lots of time spent waiting. At the same time, I enjoy the game. Hrmm.

RATING: 5
(I own a Finnish edition)
The game has a lot of similarities with original Catan. Problem for me in this card game is that it actually takes more table space than board game AND my both games have taken 2+ hours which means it plays longer than some 4-player catan games. There is quite a bit of text on the cards but most of them are clear. Once you know the basic mechanics the game is easy to play. Rulebook has a good look-up for cards making card check ups pretty fast but some of the texts there should be on cards in the first place(!). End game feels a bit slow as it can take a while to collect resources for those last points to full 12 points. 

It might be good idea to play for a shorter game but then there might be too much luck. Even now game feels to have too much of it already (and the kind that is annoying).

Un simpatico gioco di carte. Non semplicissimo da spiegare e forse poco avvincente ma le meccaniche girano bene e c'è buona interazione. Esistono inoltre diverse espansioni, cosa rara per un gioco di carte per due giocatori, che consiglio però solo dopo un po' di partite al base visto che secondo me servono solo per non rendere le partite troppo ripetitive ma non regalano molte modifiche salienti. Spesso le partite risultano lunghette.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
No big deal in terms of tactics, I'd have preferred the memory aspect not to be present, and painfully lacking in variety, to the extent where only a few games won't really provide anything new. It's still a good time-waster which doesn't require too much brain-power, but seems to be seriously lacking in longevity and the luck factor can lead to an unavoidable runaway leader on many games.

Loved to play this one instead of the "real" Catan, as the 3rd player was usually lacking. After playing the normal Catan a few times again, I almost like the card game even better now.

Good 2 player. Only problem is the length which can make it feel a bit boring. Runs at least 75 min and up. Use a modified start that can shave off at least 30min. Both players start with and additional road and settlement with a city on top of that,along with 2 random resources to go with the city, then you only need to get another 8 more points, and you can use every card right away.

A wonderful two player spin-off of the original Settlers game.  This game is perfect for backpacking trips, since it's basically two squat decks, two wooden tokens, and two wooden dice.  My wife and I took it to Europe with us and played it almost every night, as well as on some of the train rides.  If you do expand a lot though, you kind have to be creative about the edge of the table and where you expand to.

[Rating with the explained house rules: 9]

Those who expect a nice friendly game for everyone will be surprised to realise how aggressively it can be played. In some ways its far better than the original Settlers, because it takes considerably more skill. I prefer playing with the revised rules, since the first generation rules allowed some unnecessarily nasty and destructive moves (e.g. "arsonist", immediately followed by "Spy"). Luck helps you win this game, but skill is more important.

Both the "basic" and the turnament rules have its appeal, though ironically, I believe "basic rules" with shared decks require a higher level of concentration and make the game more brutal because of the sometimes hard fights for key cards.

The cards fropm the basic set are tendencially stronger than those included in the expansions.

[b]RECOMMENDED HOUSE RULES[/b] including all expansions: 
- Start with one city and one settlement - otherwise the game starts very very slowly; it also increases replayablity and adds huge strategical options
- Ignore the mill symbol for the first 2 turns
- Apply the revised rules of 2003 (weakened spy and other stuff)

[b]HOUSE RULES[/b] currently under consideration:
- a player who is 2 or more VP in the lead is forbidden to play aggression cards
- start with 2 settlements and one city. Landscapes are randomly drawn. 14 VPs
- initial card limit 4

My experience with this game has seriously had its ups and downs. On occasion I have had a lot of fun. But truth be told, any fun that has been had has been at the expense of the other player's misfortune, and such schadenfreude is a double-edged sword, so I tended to pull this game out either with some trepidation, or when I forget how painful it can be to be locked out by bad luck.

Although I found the boardgame has its place as a seminal design that kick-started a reeling board game industry, I never quite found it interesting enough to buy. But somehow the idea of the game seems to work better, for my taste, as a card game. It seems to move or flow faster with cards, so I prefer it over the original version. 

Even so, overall it still plays rather slowly; however, there's a lot to consider, which seems to be the point of it all. I've played it head-to-head, and except for one lingering question about 'commerce points,' I like it a lot and think it a solid design.

was disapointed by this game. it feels too long for what it delivers. there are some variants that supposedly shorten gametime and make it faster. maybe i will try that out if the next games feel equally slow.

Kind of a dealbreaker for me is the artwork of this game:
the artwork, if one could call it that really doesn't click for me. some of the cards have nice non-cg artwork but the cg-ish 3D-buildings and roads really bother me. the buildings all look the same somehow and it just doesn't mesh well with handpainted art of the game.

Oh man! This is in the top 3 of the "games my wife will ask to play" list, alongside Galaxy Truckers and Race for the Galaxy. The core game is terrific and continues to be our favorite. The card game expansions are great and I looove them, but she feels like they just make the game more complicated, not necessarily better or different.

Lots of good choices, lots of room to improve as a player (this is an important criteria for me -- I hate games that you can't really master). The opening 1/3 of the game is usually pretty dull and the final 1/3 of the game is usually pretty gripping. Doesn't punish poor early play, although if you don't have your act together by the middle third, you'll spend the rest of the game watching yourself lose hard.

The card game is much more involved than the board game.  It is still a very good game, but not quite as much fun to play since there is less player interaction.

(Based on one solo play):

What I like:
- The system as a whole works pretty well
- Far more fun than Catan itself
- Portable (although it takes a lot of table space)

What I don't like:
- The 15-17 attack/defense cards, one attack event, and the events that take stuff away
- The memory element is silly and out of place
- It probably is longer than it should be--there can be several turns in a row where you can't do anything
- Takes a fair amount of table space

I think Rivals is better, but not by a whole lot. Variants to speed up the game would probably help.

pretty lame... was quite a disapointment. The resource mannagement can get very messy, and the trading, which is what Catan is all about, is completely useless in this game.

This is a game that grows on you. I like the grow and expand kind of games and I dont need a lot of interaction. This works well for two, even if randomness has more to do with the outcome than skill. I have made an adaptation for 3-4 players, but havent had a chance to test it yet.

Very good 2 player game i.m.o. -- there's plenty of strategy involved, much more than in the Catan boardgame which always leaves me fuming at the dice (might as well play Snakes and Ladders). In this variant, there are many more factors that influence the outcome, which makes the game interesting for us. Wife hates the boardgame, b.t.w. and likes this a great deal.

A very good attempt at making settlers compatible for two.  My wife loves it.  My only gripe is it takes too long (usually 1.25 - 1.5 hrs), and I think some of the action cards are too nasty/powerful (ie: spend resources that took 5 turns in order to build a building, and then your opponent burns it down with an arsonist by spending one or two resources in looking through the draw stack).  This game does add some cool concepts that regular settlers does not have.

A solid game with little mechanical relation to its big board-game brother... which is only a good thing in my book, because I consider Catan a terrible game.

Luck comes into play a little more than I'd like, due to dice rolls still being the source of production, but there are many ways to mitigate that luck, and in general the most efficient player wins.  Far from perfect, but quite fun.

12/11/05: broke it out again after a couple of years to see what the game was about, and decided it was a waste. New version is apparently coming out soon, we'll see.

OWN Dec/02: GREAT 2-player game, but it HAS to be played with 2 gamers.  If someone's only half into it, it wouldn't be good.  I really enjoy the multiple strategies that can be employed, and then just enough luck in the mix to maybe foil those plans (or your opponent's).  Lots of nice artwork, and gameplay is reasonable (1 hr) after a few games to get familiar with the cards.

Too difficult, compared to the original Settlers of Catan. And, in my opinion, a card game should be a real card game, this one needs a big table and it is actually a board game.
----
After a few plays I understood that the rules are just very bad written, but the game is not that difficult after all. A match could be a little bit shorter, and there is not a big strategy, a lot of luck and absolutely weak trading, that was the biggest winning point of the original game. Building still gives a lot of satisfaction, but that's all. Increased the score from 5 to 5.5.

After two plays, I'm intrigued by this game. Things I like are the interesting interactions between cards and the degree of control you have over your hand.

Hopefully a bit more experience will eliminate some of the downtime.

A mixed bag for me – some games seem really long and cutting down the VP to win drastically decreases strategy with the red buildings.

I really enjoy having a Settlers experience on this zoomed in, individual person and building scale.   Quite a fun time.  It is a bit like playing solitaire in a race with another person (with the occasional "take that" card build in) but I don't really mind that much.  I'm looking forward to finding a second person who owns this and the expansion so we may use the advanced create-a-deck options.

RATING: 5
The first of many X: the Card Game spin-offs, but unlike its followers, it's significantly more complicated than the board game that inspired it and at least as long. That seems an odd decision. We called our game at 10VP because it had already gone on for over an hour and we were tired. I'm sure it would speed up with repeat plays, but I don't think it'd ever be the slick 30 minutes that would compete with modern tableau games like RFTG and Innovation.

There are some nice things about the game, and Teuber gets credit for anticipating the whole card tableau genre. But I don't like the fact that roads are nothing but an additional cost to a settlement rather than an important entity in their own right, and I don't think it was necessary to have three separate largest-army style contests. I also don't care for the fact that you could gain a large advantage from a strong memory.

Captures much of the feel of settlers in a 2 player form. You build a tableau using familiar settlers objects, settlements, cities, resource hexes which I like how they do double duty as a marker and the location.

Quite a good game. Contrary to some players, have found that trading does rarely occur, but usually only after the initial settlements are all gone. Loses out to other games mainly due to its slightly longer playtime (only 1 to 1.5 hours yes, but that could be a game of Goa or Mr. Jack) and lack of scalability.

08/09/2007: For some reason, I suck at this game. However, that doesn't stop me from having loads of fun. A fantastic 2-player game with simply more options to build than the standard Settlers of Catan game. Luck plays much less of a role here, as a dose of bad luck can be mitigated with intelligent use of the cards in hand. A must-have!

27/10/2007: Lowered rating from 8.5 to 7.5, due to the seemingly overpowered Garrison building in the base game. Requires the Expansion set to make this game more balanced, IMO.

25/12/2007: Upped rating from 7.5 to 8.5. Found that the powerful Garrison can be overcome, though it isn't easy.

Nem lenne rossz játék, sőt a Catan táblásjáték ismeretében talán nagyobb lenne az élvezeti értéke is, de sajnos elég kiegyensúlyozatlannak találtuk.

Az egyik játékos hamar előnyhöz tud jutni, amiben elég nagy szerepe van a szerencsének is. Ezt követően még súlyos tízpercek telnek el a játék végéig, ami elég bosszantó tud lenni.

Lehet, hogy csak mi fogtuk ki két alkalommal is a rossz szerencsetényezőt és a játék valójában jobban kiegyenlítettebb, de nem hiszem, hogy - főleg a rossz emlékeknek köszönhetően - valamikor a közeljövőben elővennénk.

Whereas the board game of Catan didn't do it for me I've thouroughly enjoyed its two-player card-based incarnation.
It's nice to build your project, trying to get those much needed recources and seeing both your own and your opponent's projects grow. There is not much in the way of actual conflict but there definitely is tension in the game.

In recent years it has gotten less playtime, but for me it is always an option when it is time for a two-player game.

You know, it's weird. I distinctly remember playing this game, mostly with my friend Steve, and I also remember bringing it to my new house a number of years back and I don't remember (and there is in fact no record of) trading it away. But it seems to have vanished. As a result, the only logical conclusion is that I was abducted by curiously human looking aliens. To pass the time while their more erudite friends did pointless surgeries and hovered enigmatically around the table I was on, some of the aliens grabbed a random game from my shelf and played it. They chose this game and they loved it [i]so much[/i] that they took it with them back to Ceti Omega IV. Thus why it no longer appears to be in my possession, makes sense, right? I mean, I'm not saying it was aliens... but it was aliens.

The Catan Card Game was pretty fun, if I remember rightly, and I understand a newer updated version was released sometime in the last few years. It is, without question, the best way to have a Catan-like experience with two people as [i]actual[/i] Catan played with two is about as exciting as sitting through a two-hour economics lecture by Ben Stein.

One of the better two-player games i played. When your girlfrined isn't into long tactical games this is the game to play with her. Too bad trading never seems to happen, you're playing solely for yourself, although some of the expansions change this.

RATING: 6
This game seems broken to me. The player that gets his first third town always wins (the other has to make do with only two). Also I'm often frustrated. Luck (the dice roll) is pretty significant in this game and it suffers from runaway leader if you'd ask me.

The cards are difficult to manage on a slick tabletop (especially given the large layout). Luck has too great an influence, which will turn off most adults. And the rules are too complex for kids.

In general, I like the original Settlers board game but dislike nearly all expansions and spin-offs. They all suffer from the flaws of the original (mainly it's too random) but exacerbate them by lasting longer and being more complex, without giving you any more real control over the outcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
I love the idea of this game.  Its alot of fun building up your empire.  The only draw back I see is that the game seems to lend itself to "steamrolling".  What is steamrolling?  When someone gets an advantage, they tend to get more and more powerful.  It has a snowball effect in which one player gets stronger and stronger while the other keeps getting beat up on.  Its not fun to be the one that gets trampled :(.  It's especially frustrating in a 2 player game - because there is only one target to play the black knight, arsonist, etc on.

Rarely is it a close victory when my wife and I play against each other, which often leads to frustration which isnt a good thing when your wife is involved ;)  There have been some games where things were close until the end, and the game was great fun.  That seems to be the exception to the rule, however.  Often you can tell the winner by midgame.

I think this game is almost better than Catan. And since you can't play Catan two players (Well, Some rules allow for it, but it really just doesn't work.) this is really the best adition to any Catan fans. Don't have enough people for a game of Catan? Then break out the card game!

I was surprised that this retained some of the feeling of the board game. I expected it to be totally different -- and it's very different, but it definitely feels like a part of the Catan "universe."

RATING: 5
Good adaptation of the boardgame, though I am not sure to what end: it doesn't occupy a smaller table space or take less time to play than the board game! There seems to be less tension as there is only one person to race against for the critical settlement or knight bonus. However on the plaus side, the game definitely works, is not too complex and quite good for family play. San Juan implements a similar idea more elegantly by realizing that the random card draw means you don't need additional dice randomness.

When you really want some Settlers but only have two, this is a decent alternative.  If you realize you need to pay some resources early to look through the stacks and remember where some important items are, the game is a little more strategic.  I need to play it again with that in mind from the beginning to see if my rating moves up at all.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

RATING: 9
Perhaps one of the top 3 best 2 player games ever devised.  The Settlers Card game is a hit because you build your little settlement, while keeping an eye on the other player's, so players who like competition but not a lot of conflict (like my wife) get to be clever (in card play) and shrewd (in managing their resources) in trying to outwit the other.  This the game that rekindled my love for games as an adult -- that's high praise.

Played this A LOT when wife & I were first married.  Got to be fairly quick and was fun.  We got to be fairly ruthless burning each others buildings down and taking what the other player needed to build a city or particular building.

Expansion added a bunch of options, but we never got through them all.

I have several other 2-player-only games now, but this one is still worth pulling out and throwing into the mix.

Part of the Kosmos two-player series.  SoC-CG is a two-player game based on the hugely successful Settlers of Catan board game.  Gone is the trading and also gone is the full frontal player interaction but the card game still reminds one of the board game and can be considered a great game in itself.  Each player controls one principality that begins small: just two towns and one road linking them. This initial road also serves as a small player aid, it contains quick info about how the game plays. The goal of the game is to build your principality in terms of towns and cities, merchant fleets, armies and public works. You also have to survive various unforeseen events like fires and civil wars but you get some help from development cards, fruitful years and the like.

= Het kaartspel.

OMSCHRIJVING: Handels- en resourcemanagement kaartspel.
2 spelers strijden tegen elkaar om de grootste kolonisatiemacht uit te bouwen in Catan. Dit doen ze door het bouwen van wegen, dorpen, steden en een hele reeks belangrijke gebouwen. Hiervoor hebben ze vele grondstoffen nodig, die ze verkrijgen door dobbelsteenworpen, actiekaarten, onderhandelingen met de tegenspeler, enz.

I really enjoy this game. Owning and playing the expansions is a must to change the theme and play style. I enjoy that this is not just multiplayer solitaire. The attack cards and competition over the Knight & Commerce tokens brings much appreciated competitiveness that would be absent in a game that you're otherwise trying to maximize your efficiencies while minimizing losses. I do really enjoy building my civilization (and there are many ways to do it, especially with the expansions) and fighting with my opponent over resources & victory points.

The game can run a little long sometimes. You can also be occasionally subject to bad die rolls and card draws that may sour your enjoyment of the game. Usually these are rare and I feel two experienced players have nearly equal odds of winning.

2006 Plays = 31

Tournament cards I like:
---------------------------------------------------------
Green/Settlement Buildings:

Garrison - a must have for first turn
Abbey - good starting card for hand size and resources
---------------------------------------------------------
Red/City Building:

Aqueduct - makes cities immune to Plague 
Town Hall - cost less to search for cards
Church - protection from Civil War
Library - hold 1 more card
Harbor - needed for other cards
Mint - good for trading gold
Merchant Guild - good for holding the Windmill Token
The Colossus of Catan - 2 points
---------------------------------------------------------
Actions:

Scout - get the regions you want
Alchemist - set value of the production dice
Arsonist - nasty building killing attack
---------------------------------------------------------
Knights:

Falk the Fair - 1 - 5  Good at tournamant but bad at token
Karl the Strong - 7 - 1 Good at token but bad at tournament 
Hagden the Sinister - 1 - 2  A knight you can play turn one

Events:

Productive Year - great with Garrisons
Progress - Good with other cards

--11Sept2004--  This was my first purchase of a recent designer game after about 20 years with minimal gaming activity.  It's still a good game even with a bunch of competition in the closet.  The 9 year old likes it, too.
--May2012-- Returning to the game after many years away, it's rather slow (by modern standards) without much of the reward of a longer game.  _Union v Central_ is preferable.

Coming late to the thread, but, as an Ameritrash gamer, I'd say that the two games are thematically similar, but, otherwise, almost entirely different. If you're a gamer who loves adding improvements to his villages and cities, with the occasional "take that" card, play the card game. If you prefer light Eurogames with placement mechanics and negotiation, stick to the boardgame.

Fairly pleasant way to while away a little time. Thanks to all the 'tutor' effects, I never really feel like I'm doing the right thing while playing this game. I've never had anyone I played this game with either particularly like it or particularly dislike it, and that's right about where I fall, too.

After a few plays, this game is very nearly as good as the base game. It is heaver, and players looking for something as easy as the base game will be disappointed. Still, it changes a lot of the interaction from trading to confrontation. I love how I don't feel like I'm playing a neutered version of Catan. This game is a must-own for Catan fans who only ever have one other opponent.

*Edit* Still a great game, but surpassed by Rivals for Catan, basically an improvement in every way to this great system.

We played this game and all of its expansions several times. Usually the person who got 5 villages will win the game (he can build 3 cities, the other person only 2). This has been improved by the new "Rivals for Catan" card game. (adi)
We had two copies of this game, we did sell one on ebay.

Good value for what's included, which is a reasonably engaging 2 player variant on the Settlers theme. What is truly amazing is the amount of space this game can take up - far more than even 6 player Catan, more in fact than War of the Ring or even Arkham plus - in fact only Sorcerer's Cave in my collection takes up more playing space...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An almost perfect 2 player card game. Before I go into detail, one thing:

TRY TO GET THE OLD VERSION - 'RIVALS FOR CATAN' IS SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE.

Basically, the only thing that this game lacks is actualy interaction with your opponent, it's more of a 'single player race' kind of game where you are trying to build a good kingdom faster than your opponent with not a lot of interaction between the two of you.
But apart from that (or if you actually like that), it's almost perfect.

Husband and I both like this game but don't play very often. One reason: it's often loaned out. We've been introducing our friends (most of whom think boardgame=monopoly) to the Settlers of Catan board game and they all love it. And since we usually play with one other couple at a time, at the end of the evening, we often end up loaning out the card game to them, telling them it's quite different from what we just played, but knowing that if they do learn it, they will be that much closer to being ready to play the Cities & Knights expansion with us without being totally overwhelmed the first time! : )

Other reason we don't play very often: I usually win. : )

Az esemeny kartyak abszolut nem zavartak, azok maximum a nyersanyagaidra lehetnek rossz hatassal. A jatekostarsam hibajanak vetette fel a jatek hosszat es igy visszagondolva igaza van. A jatek elejen azt gondoltuk, hogy a vegefele be fog gyorsulni de nem igy tortent, volt par kor amikor csak vegetaltunk (lehet jobban kikene hasznalni azt a lehetoseget, hogy 2 nyersanyag befizeteseert kivalaszthatsz egy kartyat barmelyik huzopaklibol).

WOW, better than I thought it would be.  Fiddly and takes up space but I like it better than San Juan as a 2 player game.  A fun game, with some depth, and a board game feel, yet portable, how cool is that?  The expansions really add some more player interaction and make this game great.  I just wish you could add more players and the game had a smaller foot print.  Lame packaging, we ditched the box for a smaller Rubbermaid container that holds everything and still fits in a coat pocket.  

UPDATE:  With the expansions adding increased player interaction, new buildings, and new units, this has become our favorite 2 player game for my wife and I.  We also added another base deck to play with 3 or 4 players.

A decent 2-player adaptation of Settlers. Has some very clever and fun mechanics. I love how the military aspect of the game is abstracted into tournaments, the knight token, and the occasional Conflict event card. Some of the cards are just unbalanced (the Mint, Scouts, Collossus of Catan). While not as luck-based as regular settlers (a single d6 for resources instead of 2), it really suffers from runaway winner syndrome. I've played it too much or I'd probably rate it a 6.

This extremely strategic, deep, complex card game bears little resemblance to the board game other than superficially. It is LONG, so not really a filler so much as something you and your friend will be running parallel to another group playing a big-box board game. There are TONS of buildings, knights, events, etc. so it is much more complicated than the board game. IMHO, this is much more of a gamer's game than the original and not-too-great for family-oriented play.

RATING: 6
The city-building aspect is appealing, and I especially like some of the ideas in the expansions, but is still a little too much like two-player solitaire.  Also, the game can cover a lot of table space and get fiddly...  But I'm finding that the more I play it, the better it gets.

  The mechanics capture the feel of Catan.  I also like the addition of buildings, but some of the action cards are very aggressive and those really drag the game down.  My wife, who loves Catan, just did not like this game so we traded it at her request.

RATING: 7.5
A great, easy to play civilization-building game that uses cards and dice.  Only for 2-players.  You need the expansion sets to really get the most out of this.  A game that sees a fair amount of table time.  Why?  

1.  Simple, quick to teach, quick to set up.
2.  Satisfying to build a little society.
3.  Well-balanced gameplay.
4.  Generally not combative, which appeals to many non-gamers (such as my wife).

The biggest con, which is damning, is that there is little strategy to the game.  The decisions you make just don't seem to make much of a difference.  This is in contrast to "real" Catan where your decisions (esp. regarding map development) really matter.  But great for a relaxing, casual gaming session with a non-competitive gaming partner.

UPDATE:  also purchased the recent Rivals of Catan redo.  Better than the original, if only because things have tightened up a bit and the game runs shorter.

2 plays - Initial observation:

[+] the good stuff
Much more theme than any 2 player euro I've played. It creates a strong narrative of developing your little county. Stronger narrative than original SoC (closer to Cities and Knights)

[-] the bad stuff
In the first play we avoided take that cards, but they are very strong and avoiding to play them can cost you the game. So in the second game with more take that cards we discover they basically prolong a game a bit over the welcomed limit.   

EDIT: it drags. rating down.

RATING: 8
2 or 3 plays. I think this is among the best of the card games based on board games. It is, however, very much its "own" game that requires different thoughts and actions than its parent game. Requires a big table and a good memory to keep track of all the different abilities you've got going.

Traded for it then traded it away and traded for it again!

The gameplay requires a massive amount of tablespace and it does use some core Settlers mechanics. Yet somehow the game doesn't excite and is a dry race to see who wins.

The rotating of cards to record values of goods is interesting but adds to the overall messiness of the game.

Régóta szerettem volna kipróbálni a Catan kártyát, mert nagyon sok helyen jókat olvastam róla, egyedül a hossza volt hibájának felróva. Ha logikusan végiggondolom és a Catanhoz mérem, akkor jogos is a dolog. Tényleg nem rossz játék, de nagyon hosszú. Viszont ilyen sok társasélmény után már sajnos teljesen máshogy látok egy ilyen játékot. Óriási szerencsefaktora van sajnos a játéknak és így a hossza miatt nem igazán érzem, hogy bármikor is szívesen leülnék hozzá. A kockák is zavaróak lehetnek, de azt mondom ezt még el lehet fogadni, hisz erről szól a Catan, viszont a lapok szerencsefaktorával együtt már nagyon zavaró. A játék nagyon interaktív, nagyon sok gondoszkodó lap van egymás ellen, aki az ilyet szereti mindenképpen próbálja ki. A játékosok egy vízszintes falu-város területet építenek fölöttük-alattuk termelő területekkel. Ezek a kockák által dobottak szerint termelnek. A falukhoz-városokhoz lehet kártyákat rendelni, amik különböző módon segíthetnek nekünk. A játék 12 pontig megy és azonnal vége, ez kicsit zavaró lehet, de ez talán a legkisebb gondom a játékkal. Tehát nagy szerencsefaktor és viszonylag hosszú játékidő, ezek egyáltalán nem teszik vonzóvá számomra, de mégis azt mondom, párok, főleg ha szeretik a táblás változatot érdemes kipróbálniuk, hátha beválik.

This is a fun game to watch unfold.  It has an epic quality that is rather surprising in a card game, but the catch is that it takes a long time.  I'm not sure that there is any overwhelming clever play in the game, just your standard Catan aspect where if you roll the resources and events that you need you will succeed, if not you will most likely lose.  That said there is enough flexibility in the gameplay here to make a yearly playing entertaining.

A very interesting 2 player game. So many interesting choices to make on the later turns and yet the turns go by quickly. I like how all the cards interact with each other and how you're building a little collection of roads and cities. There can be a lot of frustration with the randomness of the resources (based on a die roll) but that's fairly standard settlers stuff.

A rare occurance for the card game off-shoot to trump its board game origins...but it does. Just more elegant and engaging. Sure there are dice rolls but easier to stay in control and keep your options open. Very good but not great. Starship Catan wins in an arm wrestling match.

I really like this game; unfortunately, can't get the wife to play 'cause it has dice (and dice hate her)!! Otherwise, it's a great version of Settlers. The biggest problem is that it takes longer to play than the standard game. On the other hand, there are a lot of cool expansions to try out!

RATING: 6.5
For me a better variant of Settlers of Catan. It's not that long and it's really a straight forward game. Easy to learn. And it maintains the high luck factor of the board game. Still a bit too much luck involved in the game for my tastes. But I actually like to play this one from time to time.

Came in with high hopes, left feeling a bit flat.  Overly long for just two players, and as many people have said the runaway leader problem is a serious issue.  I need some more plays to really solidify this opinion, but I'm not feeling inclined to pursue one -- if I'm in the right mood and someone suggests, I'll give it another whirl.

As a two-player game for people who LOVE Settlers, however, the SoC CG is definitely recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rotating the cards is a good way to track everything.  It's fun, but...the original Settlers is vastly superior.  It's tighter in nearly every facet.  The card game is a nice idea but takes too long and just doesn't provide the excitement of the original.

One of my most played games, most of them during college, when my girlfriend and I would played it almost daily, sometimes twice. Sees a lot less table time now, mostly because of its relative length and complexity compared with many other two-player games (having jobs and kids doesn't help).

This is always a hit for me. I really like this game when you only are two to play. 
It's multi-dimensional, it has a random character with the dice and card drawing, you can choose so many strategies to get to your desired victory points.
Only the knights are a throwback as they don't do much, cost a lot and get destroyed too quickly. 
Wonderful expansions for this game as well!

Very good 2-player game, with a lot of interaction and a room for some planning. After one play I'm looking for more.

Edit: Many plays later I must admit that my and my wife's interest in this game is waning. Rolling for resources become boring, looking for correct upgrades become troublesome… Still I think this is great design, through I think that [gameid=91534] is equally or even better incarnation of original Settlers in simplified and minimized form.

[Mayfair 06 edition] Obviously, Klaus does not want to just port Settlers of Catan directly to card game by pasting the theme and mechanics. Compared to SoC, there are some novel elements in this card game: limited resources per region, city enhancement, event die and action cards.

It is a nice 2p card game, which accommodates both strategic and tactical options.  There are enough player interaction in the game with the action cards and tokens.  Clever resources management and expansion is important to win this game.  Hand management is also important.  A player shall spend to search through decks to build up a useful hand early.  A typical game runs longer than an hour, which is long for my wife. 

SoC card game has a fair amount of luck.  Clever play can control the luck.  Finding ways to increase production per turn is the key element of winning.  Usually, if a player is hindered by luck, it'd probably be due to their bad moves in previous rounds.

The cards are nicely made: good card quality and nice graphics. However, it's somewhat fiddly to lay the cards on a table.

This game can go on a little for a 2 player card game. I was hoping for something more San Juan-esque, but we have had games of this stretch on for 2 hours or more. While this was initially an exciting prospect, we now find it rarely hits the table of an evening precisely for that reason. Traded away in June 2014. Likely will not play this again.

RATING: N/A
Haven't played this enough to know for sure, but I might prefer 2-player Anno 1503 to this.  The dice don't feel random until midway through the game, and by that time you've got a lot of control over what happens.  Need to have a strategic vision of your victory by the time you reach 5VP.   Contrast with Jambo which is purely tactical (and also a very good game).  I like playing just to 10VP since that takes a good amount of time as it is.

Wanted a new 2 player game to play on a camping trip that traveled well. Bought this on the recommendation of a store owner ... even bought the expansion right up front. Gave it an honest try, with many plays on that trip, but in the end it was a total snooze fest. Little or no player interaction, it was like playing solitaire with someone sitting opposite you playing their own game. I’ll try to keep an open mind about other Euro games, but my one and only impression isn’t a good one.

I want the new version and the expansions.  My old one has a lot of wear and tear.  But whenever I'm buying games, other things always look shinier.

03 DEC 2010 - This game is a little long for what it is BUT - it's so engaging that you never notice. The variant to help speed it up a bit (start with an extra town and roll the dice twice - I think) knocks off an hour or so (but still ends up being fairly long) Will be interesting to see if the new version shortens the game up without sacrificing gameplay.

RATING: 9
This is one of my earliest "eurogames" that I bought and I really love the pacing of the game.  You are in an hour-long duel with your opponent to create the most profitable dominion.  It has trade mechanics, as you would expect along with random events and action cards that prevent every turn from feeling the same.

I have tried to get into the second edition, Rivals of Catan, but that left me cold.  For whatever faults were perceived in this edition, it still retains magic for me.  Also, it has a unique game play feel that is unlike other (great) games on the market.

If you can pick up a copy, do.  Be warn, *all* the rules are important (i.e. you cannot play an action card until *both* players have 3VP, etc.).  I promise, your time spent learning the few corner cases will be rewarded.

A decent 2-player version of Catan.  I like the way they rotate the cards to store resources and I like a lot of the buildings, but the attack cards seem too powerful and the defense cards are too specific in that you would need to stock your whole hand with defense cards to defend against all attacks.  When I play I remove all of the attack cards, but that leaves the game a little dry.

Surprisingly complex & longish for a 2-player version of a light euro family game, and even when compared to other games in the Kosmos 2-p, series.

I found this game incredibly frustrating on first play.  The beauty of traditional Settlers was its relative  simplicity.  This game has so much to know (how can a first timer possibly be expected to read all the cards in a stack so frequently?) and so much information to track, it retained none of the flavour that made traditional Settlers so great.

I feel I have given this a slightly low rating.  

It is a good game, but it seems to be too long.  I also can't tell if production is too slow.  Another die certainly speeds up the game, but then it feels like the balance and build-up are thrown off.

Somehow it just misses for me.

This should also be my ultimate medium-heavy travel game as it is extremely portable.  However, it has a HUGE footprint.  So large that I really can only play this at home.

The whole thing barely misses for me, but I refuse to get rid of it as I like the idea of it and I like the card art.

Update: still don't play it, still keep it. To get played it needs to find a place as a travel game, but that footprint!




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 2


Overall - 3

RATING: 8
Revised up from 8 to 9, then back to 8.  Has held up well to numerous plays -- many different paths to victory to be explored, and we haven't even broken out the expansions yet.  I most definitely don't buy into the common criticisms here -- imbalanced early production (there is always a way to make things work), player with 5th settlement always wins (maybe somewhat more than 50/50, but not dominant), runaway leader (only about 5% of the time in my expereince).  See my review for more details.

All that said, it has now been well over a year since this got a play.  I still like the game, but there are a bunch of others that have superceded it for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
One play, really tough one for more to rank.  It feels like a Faiduitti, with random, chaos, and take that fun.  It just runs a bit too long for what it has to offer.  Its a good bit of fun, but the die rolls, the take that, and the chaos makes it seem like the game should be at least 15 minutes shorter.  I could be using my two player time to play something with a bit more meat.  Having said that, the synergizing of buildings and developments is a great way to spend that time.  Its a game I enjoy more while I'm playing, but I'd almost never reach for it when deciding what to play.   There are so many great, and really good 2 players games, that these good ones will fall by the wayside.

Catan Card Game is, in many ways, similar to its older brother: players roll a for to gather resources, trade wood for sheep and things like this, build roads in order to create more villages as to get more resources. The goal is to be the first to reach 12 points - villages, towns, having the most mill icons, the stronger knights, and several other buildings are worth points. There are direct attacks, events, and in the base box comes a nice lot of expansions. There are plenty to be please in here.

However, I wasn't as much pleased as I thought I would, due to the several positive comments people I play with have given to it. I found it problematic - not due to the random way resources are gathered, as this happens in a better way than in regular Catan, since both sides already have contact with all of them, and the variation is from 1 to 6 (1d6), instead of 2 to 12. One big problem I felt was the snowball effect: the weaker player tends to be kept in this position, since the other can gather more resources with more villages and towns, which will allow for more buildings and persons, which will give the player in front more points, and maybe the control of the mill and the knight tokens, which will give more resources. You got the picture.

Yet, this is situational, thus the main issue is duration: there isn't truly enough in the game for it to last 90 minutes (often usual for a 12 points game). There is the possibility of playing to 7, but this mess with the natural development of the game and even the already questionable balance.

In spite of its shortcomings, Catan Card Game is superior to its older brother, giving more control to the players over its destiny, as well as more options and interactions. 

Overall, Catan Card Game didn't pleased me much, and with so many good options for 2 players, it is quite surpassed. I don't see myself playing it again - still, I wouldn't mind playing it occasionally.

Hmmm, I just said to myself that San Juan is the best 2 player game available, but now I have to think about that. This game isn't as versatile with different people, but it is the perfect game for my wife and me, so it comes out on top for us.

Takes the simple yet reliable mechanic of Settlers, minimizes luck because both people have relatively the same production, and then adds strategic depth and replayability in the many many cards. There are so many different approaches! We usually have 1 or 2 favorites but some times you find yourself reacting to something your opponent does with a new and exciting approach. Way fun.

I like this game a LOT. It should be noted though that the uneven number of settlements means that there will always be a player that gets less resources for the rest of the game. I fear that this is a make the strong stronger make the weak weaker mechanic, and dropped my rating slightly. Scouts are possibly a bit powerful early game as well, as theres a major luck factor as to whether you get one in your hand or pick one up early even. But as usual, my complaints here are minor ones, and this game still gets a solid 7.9 from me. Its great that its 2 player as well!

I was not really impressed with my first playing some 6 years ago. I reacquired this game because I primarily wanted to see if my gf would love it. She did. However, we omitted playing the yellow deck where all the backstabbing and attacking occurs. I feel the game is lost a little without these cards. It feel very solitarire-esque. Nevertheless, it may be better with the upgraded decks and expansions. As it stands, I will play this game sporadically.

Not sure what replayability will be like, but after 2 games we're loving this! Nicely involved, feel like you're building your little empire. Rather a lot of 'take that' cards which we're not really keen on and so haven't really explored yet - it remains to be seen whether that aspect tempers our enjoyment. 

update: have been playing this a lot! The 'take that' cards are not too difficult to recover from and so far replayability hasn't suffered (@ 10 plays).  

update: don't get this to the table as much as it deserves because it is quite long for what it is.

Card game re-implementation of Settlers Of Catan for 2 players. Uses some of the ideas from the original Settlers but this is essentially a unique game. Rotation of the resource cards is a clever mechanic to keep track of collected resources. Played several times over a summer trip in 2004 but haven't revisited since. We found the game ok, but nowhere near as special as Settlers. Game length is also fairly significant for a card game (1-2 hours). Decided to trade - traded along with expansion for "Tsuro" at Montreal Mathtrade February 2009.

My wife and I love this game.  Lots of ways to win.  Very versatile with the expansions.  We've got the game down to about an hour.  edit: changing my rating to a ten.  We play with the expansions and we build our own deck ala the tournament rules.  We own two copies of each.  The game also worked as a four player game.  See my session report here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/2810309#2810309

Edit: added the Artisans & Benefactors deck.  Now even better!  300 plus cards make choosing your tournament deck very difficult!

RATING: 7
Great approximation of Settlers.  Trading is allowed but unlikely in this 2 player game.  A new mechanism is event cards which usually can be used to attack your opponent or counter an attack by your opponent.  Cards are played in 3 columns.  Settlements are built in the center row alternating with roads.  Resource cards are played on each corner of a settlement.  Knights and special buildings are built above and below the settlements. Settlements can be upgraded to Cities which allow up to 2 buildings to be built above and 2 buildings below.  Dice are rolled to determine resource payouts and special events.  Goal is to get 12 victory points.  A great game which I would rate higher but is just a bit longer than it should be.

A good game, but without the opportunity to trade with other players (the card game is for 2 players) Catan becomes less interesting.

I felt like (other than making stupid moves) the winner was the one who best guessed which special event came up on the dice.  Maybe with more play I'd see some more depth to it, but after 3-5 plays I felt like it was a little bit too balanced

It has nothing to do with the original SoC. It's a good game if you add the expansions and play with the tourneament rules. The basic game is quite random. There's a lot of luck and a memory element. Quite long for a 2-palyer game.

RATING: 8
I may be overrating this since it was the first "heavier" board game I played and thus has a ton of nostalgia value for me.

This is very different from the original Catan. It keeps the resource acquisition mechanic but throws out the original's area control and trading in favor of more complex spatial building mechanics and card deck sorting. It feels a little bit like a German city building video game (the Settlers, Anno) which is probably why it resonated with me at the time. The card art which depicts buildings from a kind of isometric angle reinforces this.

There are a few flaws in this game of course, like the overpowered action cards and the random resource mechanic often making things drag but overall it's a fun time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rated after 3 games after two different opponents. I think is a quite good two player game, but not a good game in general. And there is something wrong with the tournament and marketplace events, they seem to be reversed. After all, the game is a little bit too long compared to it's content, at least with our experience level.

This is the game that started Euromadness for me.  I had started reading about these kooky games on the geek back in the day and my comic book store had the card game so I bought it and talked the wife into playing it.  We enjoyed it very much, but once the bug hit I quickly moved on to other games.  This one hasn't been played in quite a bit.  Shame really.  I'll have to try and get it back into rotation.

I prefer Catan Card game over its board game grandpappy.  Much easier to get to the table (less players required) and set-up/tear down.  I enjoy chucking dangerously gigantic dice and spinning cards around much more than I should.  Catan Card game is far from perfect, but I forgive its sins for the fun factor alone... I'd much rather play this than plain old, vanilla Catan.

A nice game that uses elements of Settlers but  seems like it could more aptly be compared to Magic: The Gathering, just less confrontational/more focused on building your own thing, so I guess comparable to San Juan? But more complex, so not as good unless you like Settlers and want something that takes the mechanic in a new direction.  I guess the advantage over SJ is that it has deck construction (ah, yes!), but in order to do that each player needs to own a copy of the base game and the expansions... I would rate the game WITH deck construction a solid 7, but considering it takes each player ponying up $40 to accomplish this I'd say it isn't worth it.

Klaus Teuber; In this unique card game, each player acquires resources from the lands surrounding their cities and can spend those resources on new cities, roads, knights, and civic improvements. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points (necessary to win the game) or both. Action cards, drawn from the same decks as city improvements and knights have more direct and temporary effects and serve to mix things up a bit. Belongs to the Catan Series and is part of the Kosmos two-player series; Expanded by: The Settlers of Catan Card Game Expansions (The Mayfair collected box of expansions), Barbarians & Traders, Handel & Wandel, Künstler & Wohltäter, Politik & Intrige, Ritter & Händler, Zauberer & Drachen, Wissenschaft & Fortschritt, Das Turnier-Set

RATING: 5
Aside from the uses of the special cards and the commerce tile, this really IS like playing multiplayer solitaire.  There's not much room for player interaction, since I can't see the need to want to trade goods in a 2-player game.  If you both know what each other needs, then there's really no point, and it falls to who gets the necessary resources first.  It's not a bad game, but I'd rather playe regular Settlers.

Excellent game and addition to the settlers series. The only downside for me, is that a run of unlucky dice throws early in the game, one side getting a lot more wood and brick throw can mean that one can be in the situation where you can never catch the leader. For this reason we have a house rule which means that both sets of sources have identical dice throws at the start of the game

Not the same game at all as Settlers the board game, but a good translation of the same world.

I have the expansion, but havne't played it enough to know whether it improves.

My entry into the board/cardgame world. I find the card game more tactical than the vanilla board game where the luck factor is higher. The card and the board game play very different, however the theme and game development feel very much the same. UPDATE: With the release of San Juan, this game has fallen off a bit because the play time is too long. San Juan has an equally challenging level but can be played in 30 minutes. Still, a highly recommended game.

An interesting 2-player variant of the Catan classic. As a card game it's pretty innovative with its square, rotatable cards to keep track of resource stores. It can be a pretty solitaire affair, but you get beautiful images of settlements and cities before you to feel like an accomplished builder. If you want Catan and only have 2 players, this is your best option.

Se trata del catan de cartas para 2 personas. Me gusta muchisimo, se trata de un juego perfecto para solo dos personas. Tiene puntos en comun con el original de tablero, pero se distancia bastante de este en cuanto al funcionamiento. 
No puedes acumular mas de 3 materias primas en tu terreno, lo que cambia bastante el modo de juego. Tambien las acciones que puedes interponer en cualquier momento, una vez que entre ambos jugadores sumen 7 puntos. 
Para mi es toda una delicia de juego. El unico problema es que no lo puedes llevar a cualquier lado porque, aunq la caja sea relativamente pequeña, el montaje de cartas ocupa lo suyo.

A classic 2p game. I love this game so much: it has flavor, engine building, a race feel, an exploration feel, and some limited direct interaction where there are things you can build that you know almost definitely won't get destroyed and other things that are less permanent (like knights). It feels meaty and winning is worth something (ie. it's not just a count-up at the end of a set number of phases).  Haven't yet tried Rivals of Catan but I am interested to do so.

This one is my favorite of all the games I own and know. Beautiful cards, great resources system, flawless gameplay. But careful!!! This game changes your personality !!! After a few games you will notice you are not playing just for the fun anymore. Highly competitive and it has lots of luck. With the expansions you mitigate this more. Never forget to search the decks,... NEVER.

It has dice and I still like it!!! I even prefer it to the board game version. I like to play and to think about possible expansions :). Playing with my wife is such a great fun!

After a while I downgraded the rating ... it takes a bit too much time and space for a little two player game. Then after few more plays I upgraded it back again as this is one of the few games that my wife often requests to play and games are tense and enjoyable most of the time (some odd games when one side is demolished does happen though).

An interesting, fast and well-designed for 2-4 player card game, which is rare, with easy rules. Catan card game is one of the few!!!

My favorite 2 player game because there are so many ways to win.  This never gets stale to me.  Length is the only issue as there is nothing "filler" about this game when two experienced players go ore to ore.  Even with fast play, games stretch to over an hour.

I really like it. I'd play this in the middle of the day inbetween routes with my friend Chad. I like that you will get a resource every single turn, no matter what, so long as you can store it. I thought that was a pretty good innovation.

(Trade Interest: medium) seems to be a little long and table-space consuming, and the rules were somewhat confusing.  but it did have the flavor of the settlers main game. want english version

Bardzo dobra gra karciana! Rewelacyjnie oddaje klimat planszowych Osadników. Dużo interakcji. IMHO lepsza niż planszówka. Po kilku grach zauważam, że ma jednak pewne wady :( główna to chyba efekt kuli śnieżnej, jeśli na początku gry nie zacznie się szybko zbierać surowców (bo np. kosci nie podejdą) to potem cieżko jest dogonić drugiego gracza.

Very good card game! You can feel great climate of Settlers board game. Quite a bit of randomness and a lot of interaction. IMHO better than the board game. Has some issues though, the main being the snowball effect. If you don't collect resources at the beginning of the game (i.e. because of the dices), it'll be very diffcult to catch up with the other player.

OK, why do people say that this game takes too long?  Even with rules uncertainty, my wife and I played our first game of this in about an hour.  Although it was kind of apparent who was going to win halfway through.  Once you get behind, it seems as though it would be difficult to catch up.  We'll see if this is a problem with repeated plays.

This is a good game in which unfortunately luck is too heavy. Once you manage to get ahead thanks to a lucky roll, you've won, as it's almost impossible to regain the advantage. With the expansions it's much better.

Quite a lot of different ways to score, which makes it diverse and balanced. I think it's better than the board game by the mechanics and strategic possibilities.

--One of our first post-wedding purchases.

A great two player game.  I have had dice thrown at me for being mean playing this one...

My biggest complaint is that it takes about an hour to play even if you are experienced.  For this reason, I would say San Juan gets played more.  In that same vein, I think the card combinations are a little more difficult to use in this vs. San Juan.

The two player card game has more replay value than the classic board game. This is largely due to the various expansion themes, of course, but even the basic game is solid, relaxed and satisfying.

For those of you who like Settlers, and don't know any good two-player variants.  The knight cards don't seem particularly balanced, but the buildings add a lot of strategy to a good 2-player game.  Doesn't see much time on my table, but that's because I'm usually playing one of its older brothers with a group.

A régi klasszikus kétfős változata, mely mai szemmel kicsit idejétmúltnak tűnik. Egyáltalán nem rossz játék, - sőt, kifejezetten ötletes dolgok vannak benne - de sokkal jobb és pörgősebb játékokat találni már erre a létszámra.

After 2+ Plays: Not nearly as good as its big brother.  I like most of the game (though I'm no so big on the memory aspect), but it just drags on too long.

It's a game that can't miss in a collection of a real board gamer! only one bug, the fortune play a important part, if you don't find the right card... you can only stay and look you "enemy" win.

Acquistato oggi 31 maggio 2017 in negozio Città del Sole ben fornito. Preso dall'entusiasmo per i coloni di catan classico, adesso ho voluto acquistare questa versione a due giocatori dopo aver visto qualche tutorial in rete. Spero di provarlo presto. Giugno 2017, provata una partita. Reputo Catan classico più bello, questo è una variante a due, ma credo che posso cercare altro nella mia collezione per giochi a due giocatori meno farraginosi. (7 wonders duel).

I thought it was a frustrating experience. Building cards and then having them removed either by another player or by an event is not enjoyable. It happened too many times in our game. This in addition to poor die rolls at various stages meant fewer resources making progress even more of a problem.

After playing several times I managed to remember every rule. The game itself takes time, you may screw up your playmate if you feel like (I never do, so I usually don't use a couple of cards), and you need to move your memory to remember which pile is good enough to draw from.

01/27/08 - To describe this game as clever would be an understatement, IMNSHO.  I really think it is a phenomenal translation of the board game into a two player affair.  I'm a bit sad that the internal art does not match the cover's - I think that would have added a lot to the game's atmosphere.  In any event, this game is definitely recommended by me for a non-violent, relatively short, 2 player game.

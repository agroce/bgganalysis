RATING: 7.45
First impressions:  There is a lot to love about this game.  Incredible artwork and phenomenal integration of theme and history.

Solid game mechanics and some very well-thought-out design choices. For example, the end-of-turn mandatory dividends action accentuates the press-your-luck mechanic of mining.  It simply is not possible to have every possible combination of resources, so when one shift at a mine reveals a production card with resources that match those held in hand, but which produces less copper than other cards known to be in the production deck, it makes for a compelling choice between settling for the lower known amount or risking walking away and potentially drawing cards on future shifts that don't match the resources held in hand.  

Some would view this aspect to make the game more luck than strategy, perhaps, but the game incorporates other features to mitigate the luck component, such as the take-claim and complete-claim aspects of production, as well as the player-specific company specializations (which potentially provides additional incentive to take certain lower-valued cards if they match the specialization because they may yield additional points at game end).

The poor rock placement mechanic is also a very well-designed strategic component, particularly in eras 2 and 3 when shaft houses and hoist houses (powered or unpowered) really increase the number of placement options for poor rock.

I wouldn't hesitate to use Copper Country as an "introductory" Euro (particularly given the ease with which the game can be modified to remove the impact of local businesses and the century events, though I didn't find that the inclusion of those elements make the game particularly more challenging or hard to grasp), but at the same time, I think Copper Country provides for a much richer strategic gameplay that can keep people interested who might feel as though they have otherwise grown out of introductory Euros.  

I look forward to trying the game with a full four players to see how it holds up.

EDITED:  I generally retain all of my positive comments above about the design.  On further plays, my only criticism is that it seems to play a bit long for what it is.  I think for its strategic depth it really would be great to keep it within 60-90 minutes, but I've found it generally runs longer than that.  The designers did include features to self-adjust the starting/ending points of the game, but we really enjoy the full arc of the game, from the initial stages of rudimentary mining to the late game with powered shaft houses and hoist houses at full operation.  Part of the problem might just be that we've had new players at the table for several of the plays of this, which has slowed down the turn order a bit.

Habe das Spiel schon fast ein Jahr. Jetzt erstmals gespielt -zu zweit-. 

Das Spiel hat so lange gelegen, weil die Spielregel optisch abschreckend wirkt. Beschäftigt man sich aber richtig damit, erschließt sich alles viel leichter, als gedacht. Bei all den Einzelheiten kann einem -wie bei uns- beim ersten Spiel schon mal das ein oder andere Regeldetail durchgehen, es gibt aber andererseits keine (ernsthafte) Frage, die die Regel nicht beantwortet; es gibt sogar ein Stichwortverzeichnis.

Thematisch befasst sich das Spiel mit dem Kupferbergbau in Nord-Michigan von etwa 1840 bis 1920. Die Geschichte des dortigen Kupferbergbaus wird in neun farblich gekennzeichneten Abschnitten im Regelheft beschrieben, geschrieben vom Vater eines der Spielautoren, der Professor u.a. für Bergbaugeschichte an der Technischen Universität Michigan war. Sehr interessant, hilft dabei, so manche Spielmechanik in ihrer thematischen Einordnung besser zu verstehen. Der Text auf den meisten Karten ist dem Thema des Spiels gewidmet, spieltechnisch nicht bedeutsam, für mich aber dennoch wertvoll, weil mich die Thematik eines Spiels mindestens so interessiert, wie die Spielmechanik, die für mich ohne thematischen Hintergrund blutleer ist. Einige Karten (Ereigniskarten, lokale Geschäfte, Ära-Karten) und das Spielertableau sowie die Aktions-Referenzkarte haben spielrelevanten Text; Übersetzungen dazu gibts in den nächsten Tagen auf BGG. (Regelübersetzung folgt etwas später.)

Spielmechanisch eine Mischung aus Aktionen, die unabhängig vom Arbeitereinsatz gespielt werden (Management-Aktionen), z.B. Bauen, und solchen, die Einsatz von Arbeitern (äh Bergmännern) erfordern (Arbeiter-Aktionen) z.B. Kupfer fördern. Zum Fördern von Kupfer benötigt man je nach Ära 2-4, oder auch 6, Ressourcen, die man durch beide Aktionsarten auf unterschiedliche Weise erlangen kann. Insgesamt gibt es 6 mögliche Management- und 4 mögliche Arbeiteraktionen, wovon man in jedem Spielzug 2 bezw. 1 spielt. Man hat nur 5 Arbeiterfiguren, die über Aktionen ins Spiel gebracht werden, nach getaner Arbeit erst einmal erschöpft sind, oder, schlimmer noch, Unruhe stiften oder auf dem Friedhof landen. Unruhestifter kann man durch Verhandeln wieder ins Boot holen, "Verstorbene" gehen -thematisch eher unglücklich- einen etwas sonderbaren Weg: Sie können über Zuwanderung als Unruhestifter wieder zurückgeholt werden (Zombies?). Erschöpfte Arbeiter geruhen zumeist erst am Zahltag (das ist eine Arbeiter-Aktion), sich wieder arbeitsfähig zu melden.

Insgesamt ein vielfältiges, sehr interessantes thematisches Spiel, das sich erstaunlich gut zu zweit spielen lässt. Für mich 8/10 Punkten bei BGG.

So, I just played the game.  I'll be quick with my review.
Pro: Very good theme, very strong art, and some well thought out mechanisms.

Con: The game sacrifices some enjoyability to thoroughly reflect the theme.  The strongest problem is the lack of mitigating relationship for third and fourth players.  Given the tight nature of the board, third and fourth players are at a significant disadvantage, but there is literally no mechanic in the game to afford those players any sort of protection.  Fourth player always plays last, and will generally have less options then first, second and third.  I played a significantly long game tonight, and again found that as the fourth player I did everything right (which other players adopted after I was done doing my actions) and yet they could capitalize much better off of their actions because of the pace of space degradation.

I also am not a fan of the random deck draw.  By the third era, it is hit or miss whats on top, and sacrificing an action to prospect is a significant loss in tempo.  This seems like it could have been avoided, but I think avoiding it might have ruined the random feel of mining in the 19th century.  

I would probably use the game to teach a class about Michigan History, but I do not believe I will be playing it any more as a choice.

After a recent play I've edited my rating and comments.

Pros:
1. The artwork is beautiful.
2. The component quality is high.
3. The mechanics (card drafting, set collecting, and influencing the mine sites) are solid and work well with the theme.
4. The theme works great. Era 1 is wide open but you have the feeling of wasting resources on lower point copper (VP), then in Era 2-3 you have much more power but the board is full and finding a site with opportunity left becomes a real challenge.
5. Scoring is simple, yet for the most part hidden. No need to whip out a calculator, pen, paper and 10 minutes for figure out the score.
6. There's a more difficult side to the board!

Cons:
1. Era 1 drags on a bit too long
2. I've not played a game which lasts less than about 100 minutes (not including setup-takedown). The game really should not be any longer than 1.5 hrs.

Edit: just had a 90 min game, and it felt good.

3. The claim of variable player powers is a stretch...each player has a certain set they can go after for more points, but not variable "powers."
4. Later in the game the board can get busy and takes some time to really figure out where to build hoist houses and shaft houses.

This is a mid-weight euro that puts an emphasis on risk management. A bad draw (which can be mitigated in a few ways) can result in the loss of a miner which may take several turns to get them back. However, if you anticipate disaster coming you can avoid it or make it work for you.

It's not a dry Euro by any means, but it does lack that great gaming moment that the best games have. The selling point to this game is the great blend of theme, mechanics and the evolving board.

Edit: I havent played this in a long time, and dont have a huge urge to play it more than once or twice a year. It works as a game, but if it werent for the them and ties to the designers I'd pass on this game. Glad I have it though, it is nice looking. Down from 8 to 6.5. Some neat things going on here, but not quite as polished as it could be. Lacking another depth of play to keep this coming to the table.

I just simply cannot get over how well themed this game is and how every little action you do in the game matches the theme perfectly. Every action and reaction you take just fits and I cannot wait to introduce this game to as many people as possible. 

It's a deep game, but I have so much fun playing it thanks to the theme that I don't even care if I lose.

Wow.  So much done right - theme, bits, multiple levels of complexity, compact box, etc.  Really, congrats guys.

My issue is the randomness.  It feels like the game can turn on a multi-shift turn where death happens on the 2nd or 3rd shift, so no chance to mitigate, even if you prospect twice.

For me the game was too long for it to turn on serendipity.

Variant idea: Given the company bonus, how about keeping the three ages of mines in three piles, so just Age 1 in the first Age, two piles in the second one, and three in the third, so you can target either low risk, medium risk, or high risk sites?  In a five shift turn (shaft + hoist + 1 rock), you might do low, low, medium, medium, high.  Rather than getting hit with high, high, done.

RATING: 6
Strong theme, excellent, excellent artwork. Mechanically, not that interesting, unfortunately.

At heart, the game is a game of collecting cards in different suits and spending them to get VP cards. There's a lot of chrome on top of that, but not enough to disguise the central mechanism. To make matters worse, the VP cards you aspire to gain are drawn randomly from a face-down deck, so you better hope the icons on it match the cards you have in your hand. Oh, you got what you wanted, that's 6 VP. I, however, got a rockfall worth 1 VP, and a freak fire killed my miner.

The theme, the historic detail, and the graphics in general makes the game look very promising. Mechanically, the game doesn't quite get there, though. It does a lot of things right, but the central mechanism of draw-a-card-hope-it's-something-good lets it down.

Copper country has an interesting, unique theme, and some pretty atypical mechanics.  I'm not so thrilled with the gameplay unfortunately.  The main mechanic is collecting symbols on capital cards to hopefully match with the random draws from the production deck.  There are several sort of interesting ways to mitigate this randomness so it's not quite so bad but the mechanic isn't very interactive and seems to make the game into mostly a push-your-luck sort of affair.  The map and the dumping of poor rock across the board is the interactive part of the game and is more interesting.  Could rise or fall a point with repeat plays.

This is a very well done game considering this is a new company.  Yes it has one small element borrowed from ticket to ride, but it really is such a small part of the overall game.  This is very enjoyable, extremely thematic for a euro, and fairly easy to teach.

Interesting idea for a game, I wanted to like this as I enjoy other mining themed games. Sadly, Copper Country is not good. 

Decent components, hideous artwork, and poorly developed game ideas. This is a random mess disguised as a Euro style game.

I played a prototype of Copper Country twice. The basic mechanics of the game are well implemented and thought out. There is a lot of positioning that you do in the game as you try to block each other off and prevent your opponent from performing optimal digs, which I enjoy. You can either reposition your miners or use miners in unfavorable positions to gather resources, so while blocking is important, it doesn't feel too debilitating.

I like the idea of the businesses giving special abilities and events triggering twice per game in order to add some variability and change up game play from play to play. It definitely felt like the businesses changed the relative value of different actions and had an impact on the way I wanted to play going forward.

The first time I was a bit frustrated with the randomness in the production cards, and skeptical of the end game scoring. The first era dragged on, and I just could not find any worthwhile production cards. At the beginning of the game, everyone is given a particular resource that they want on their production cards in their copper pile. At the end of the game, whoever has the most of their specced resource gets points equal to the number of that resource they have in their copper pile. The issue I had was that I felt like that would determine the winner too often by whoever was luckier in getting more favorable production cards for their spec. I also had some quibbles with the relative values of some of the management actions, as I felt that some were too expensive to do early in the game.

The second time I played they changed the production cards, which was a vast improvement. Instead of having cards that were just awful or were horrible for someone without a claim, they made them more like different kinds of opportunities. The new card set offered more choices, and allowed more room for skillful play. In addition, they also effectively eliminated the possibility of the first era dragging out for a long time.

The way this worked also diluted the end game scoring enough that it didn't bother me anymore, although this might partially be due to playing with more players (4 instead of 3). If someone wanted to use actions to improve their chances at the bonus, they could do that, but it was a small enough number of points in our game that it wasn't a big factor in winning. 

In addition, they changed the management actions in a way that solved my problems with them. The action options felt much more open and less constrained.

Overall I think Copper Country is a solid game, I just prefer more focus on variable player powers or prioritizing different types of investments. I'm happy to play with someone if they want to play Copper Country, but I doubt I'll suggest it.

I originally backed this game for the theme alone. As a college student (many years ago) I lived in the Copper Country.  I have never lost interest in the place and it's fantastic history.  I was reading a book about the history of the Copper Country (called "Hollowed Ground" by retired History Professor Larry Lankton) when I saw the Rahdo demonstration of "Copper Country". My reaction was sort of "who would make a board game about the Copper Country". Then I thought, "what a good idea for an economic game". I backed it almost immediately on KS, just for the theme... and as it turns out one of the designers is Larry Lankton's son. So I would say I'm a bit biased towards the game just because of the theme.

Now that I actually have the game and have played it, this is very good game.  It's a worker placement game with card/hand management and area control.  Whereas some worker placement games are accused of having a "pasted on theme", "Copper Country" manages to both accurately simulate this industry and still be a fun and competitive game. The designers focused the game on a few basic mechanics and themes. Typical economic game mainstays like cash and stock ownership are not included in this game. The player uses workers to produce copper.  As mine sites are worked, the sites become more difficult to mine as "poor rock" is added to the site. This simulates the mines being depleted and having to be deeper. Also the use of "poor rock" is the game timer.  Players have to deal with worker death in the mines, labor strife, bad weather and other actual realities of the time. Players make a couple "Management decisions" each turn, which can include building structures that reduce some of the labor strife and mining deaths, and later on structures can be built to make the mining more efficient.  During the "Labor" action the actual mining is done. The rules are fairly straightforward and easy to learn and teach. The player mats or "ledgers" summarize the important rules so a player doesn't have to remember or look-up these rules. A beginning player can be up to speed quickly, making strategic decisions and plans almost immediately. Instead of trying to understand a bunch of convoluted rules and mechanics (as the experienced players are winning the game).  There's some head-to-head competition as mining territories overlap. Scoring is very simple, this is not a "point salad" game requiring a little pad to add up the score.  The players simply add-up the amount of copper their company has mined plus the amount of "resource symbols" used that match the particular companies resource specialty. (For example the Copper Range Companies Resource Specialty is "Labor".) Luck is not much of a factor in "Copper Country" and generally winning the game will require efficient management of your workers and mine sites and planning ahead a few turns. The game is also quite educational if you read the cards.

[KS] One of my first KS picks. Admirable for the art and the extensive historical research underlying it, it's definitely a theme-first creation. Mostly a set collection game with some area control, it's a bit fiddly (too many cards, too much shuffling and some ungainly pieces) and has some convoluted mechanics to increase production that seem in some respects to have been introduced solely to increase player interaction (which is otherwise minimal). It's not a bad game - it's just not great.

Copper mining in the upper Michigan peninsula. Area exploration and hope you aren't into poor rock. Buy cards from the capital deck or production cards for set collection of equipment and actions.

This is an excellent game, and I really like the two player element.

Interaction comes from blocking / controlling areas on the board, second guessing player moves and obstructing them.

I like the era cards that affect the game in different ways, providing variability in gameplay.

One game in, two player.  Really interesting game.  I'm curious how four players would work.  The board would get really cramped and you'd have to claw for any points you get.

Comes in 2 versions; easy mode and advanced mode. Only ever played the easy mode.  Its alright, match card icons with cards in your hand but also account for poor rock reducing the number of shifts you get.  Its alright game, probably not going to keep mine though.

Ingenious combination of an euro with a pure economic game. Worthy of its top 5 ranking. A bit too forgiving in my opinion and (real) interactions are limited to the auction phase... Which is still a good level of interactions!

A excellent game, very tense with a simple and deep rule. One of the best "Eurogame".
A lot of good expensions are available.

The situations are tense, choices are important, and I keep getting totally hosed. This is a great game that plays well with almost any number of players. I love the tension in every little decision.

Wow... very fun to play! Even though I only played a 2p game and everyone and their mothers on BGG hate it. The rating could only improve.

EDIT: I've finally played a 3p game. WOW! Way better than 2p (even though I liked it). Heavily strategic.

I played a 6 player game on the quebec map and the map was terrible. Me and another player was the only 2 player able to trigger the step 2. We could have just profit of this few turn before triggering it.

The France map look good.

Other then that it is the same game as powergrid. So Get power grid instead :)

French version of Power Grid with a Quebec and France map.  There is a lot of calculation in this game.  Wish I had more friends who like that.  This version can be play from 2 to 6 player but it's probably best with 4 or 5 player.

(Multizone, Février 2012) La journée du Game Summit 
C'est un bon jeu. Mais avec le recul, ce ne peut pas être mon jeu préféré. Je le trouve très calculatoire et un jeu où on est toujours en train d'optimiser notre argent pour s'acheter des ressources et pour se payer les meilleurs chemins d'électricité à moindre coût devient drainant à la longue. C'est un jeu qui peut devenir long. C'est un jeu également favoris en tournoi compétitif où les uns, entraînés plusieurs dizaines de fois, rivalisent avec leur stratégie optimale avec d'autres qui se sont entraînés également plusieurs fois. Cela devient un jeu pour moi qui manque d'interractions entre les joueurs. On est tous occupés à optimiser notre propre stratégie dans notre coin. C'est un jeu qui est quand même apprécié par mon entourage, donc je le garde quand même.

Basically the same game as Power Grid, so I will assign it the same rating.

The preference given to the green power plants can be really annoying, as in our game they ended up occupying a big chunk of the market, kicking out a bunch of the higher-producing plants.

I also think the two low-cost connection cities (Montréal and Québec) are really interesting.  It is very attractive to build there, but in a 4 or 5 player game you could get stuck there, having to pay really high connection costs to get out.  And while it's easy to plunk down 4 houses at once, you would probably pay for it in the long term as well on the resource market.

[LUP 22-Sep-2009] So there we were at Monde de Jue in Paris on 20th September and I see my precious at not one but two stands.  It had to be mine and it was.

Yes I am a Power Grid completist, I admitted that a long time ago ;)

I really find the "metropolis" cities a very interesting concept.  The cheap buy-in with the risk of being blocked from getting out makes for interesting tactics.

RATING: 8
Clever bidding and scoring points with your breaks on. That is what you need to do to win this game. 
The theme makes this game unique, and the nicely balanced game mechanisms make this game fun. Players that get behind can recover during the game, because they get lots of advantages. That makes that the winner is only known in the end of the game and keeps the game exciting till the very last round. 
Only minus is the length of the game. 

Minus: 1 (not interesting with 2 players) - 3 (duration)

Great game, as for all Power Grid games.  I love all the little subtilities each variant brings to an overall game that doesn't gets old the more it gets played.

One small nitpicking though is the Quebec map.  Visually separating Montreal and Quebec and putting them in a small section apart from the rest of the map is a big mistake IMHO.  Particularly since the map is the most empty of ALL the Power Grid map to date, including Brazil/Spain.

This is a 'shill' rating, because it's my only means of saying 'screw this stupid system' where there are multiple entries of the same game. That's what we have 'versions' for.

This is the exact same GAME as Funkenschlag / Power Grid / Hoogspanning / whatever it's called in different languages.

The only difference is one side of the map. If you know Funkenschlag / Power Grid you know that there are loads of maps available. Including the one included here.

I love Funkenschlag, it's one of my favorite games. I'll edit my rating when the games is merged back again to where it belongs.

Dato che il gioco non cambia, considero questo come un voto alla mappa della regione del Quebec. 
Regione difficile con una variante centrali ecologica che spesso si dimentica. Un gioco dove la vicinanza di molte grandi città fa sì che si creino molti imbuti. O si rimane imbottigliati dagli altri o si è liberi in regioni con costi di connessione proibitivi. Assieme all'Italia, forse una delle mappe più complesse dell'intera serie: da non proporre a giocatori occasionali.

I thought that I would not like Power Grid after my first play because the math was a little boring (I love math, but not so much in games).  But after a few plays, the math becomes automatic and a rich play experience envelops. It is enjoying to watch players change their strategy from game to game with regards to the auctions and pacing of the cities.  New players are a little scared to buy plants so the price will be low in these games, but as players develop, the plants change in value in the player's perspective as the hydro plant prices are driven higher.

I love Power Grid, but I prefer Mégawatts.  France and Québec maps are a lot different, the former stressing nuclear power plants and the later ecological power plants.  Quebec map has also a lot of free connections making it more strategic.  The feeling is quite different from one map to the other, contrarely to the standard USA/Germany maps that look more or less the same.

Rating after one play. 

I like many things in this design: The very well implemented resource market, the plant auctions where you stay the auctioner until you buy something, the leader catch up dynamics, the overall balance of the game and the theme. 

On the other side, I was a bit disappointed with the ending in my first play since I pretty much knew that I had won after the last resource market phase. The total game time is also way over my prefered limit of 60-75 minutes. It suffers from the same affliction than Le Havre for me; it's an awesome game with simple efficient mechanics, it's just too darn long. I would play again if asked since I really enjoyed the game.

See Power Grid.  Our three player game featured an intense resource battle and that may have to do with the number of players.  A fun map just like all the other expansions.

I wouldn't call it an Empire of the Sun lite game or an Empire of the Sun starter game.  The rules are mostly there.  A few have been stripped out (India, War in Europe, Progress of the War), while others have been added (Strategic Map, Fleet Trains). 

I like the new things -- especially the strategic map -- added and it shows that the system is robust enough to handle topics such as this.  In the end, I think I like Empire of the Sun better because it felt like a richer experience to me.

It also could be because I don't really understand the strategy and risks of this game.  Either it's too abstract or maybe I do understand it, but I can't shake loose of Empire of the Sun to see how it could possibly work (ex: why would the Japanese waste his time in Shanghi instead of pulling the garrison units away to use elsewhere?  There's no Political Will at stake and no B-29 bases to worry about.)  I was lucky that I had somebody teach me EotS.   I used what I learned to create help guides and strategy dos and don'ts about EotS.  I wish such a thing existed for this one in order to understand the big picture.

This is a more accessible game based on Mark Herman's Empire of the Sun.  This is based on a pre-WWII confrontation between the US and Japan, where bi-planes were in use and carriers were in their infancy.  As such, this focuses much more on surface fleet engagements, which is cool.  The main problem I think the game has is it is heavily weighted toward the Japanese player.  I have not seen, nor heard of anyone having much success playing as the US.  If it could be balanced more, it would be excellent.

RATING: 7.6
Great reimplementation with flavorful variations over the original. Much simpler in scope and straightforward than EotS although strategy is not that simple. Playable in a couple of hours. EotS light! Probably good for a new player intro but only for the mechanics.

Rules editing is passable and play aids could be much better.

EotS light. Not on rules, just fewer units and a faster game. It fills a niche for me. Rulebook is a bit messy and, as such, will be hard to crack without some familiarity with EotS.

Although based on Empire of the Sun, it's totally it's own thing. The different dynamics with AZOI at range 1 rather than 2 and much lower ground strength requires a novel approach to amphibious assaults and fleet actions.

Rating is more a reflection of my inability to grasp game concepts than anything wrong with it in particular (trying to use the BGG how much do you want to play it scale here.) I imagine it would go up, substantially, if things started to click.

RATING: 8
There are a few typos / errata, but getting beyond that this might be the best magazine game I have ever played. This is a great way into Empire of the Sun as it presents you with a simpler board situation and card deck but at its core many of the same dilemmas and trade offs. The greater accessibility in some respects makes me prefer it at this stage.

While this could be a great starting point to kind of ease into Empire of the Sun, it is in no way just a "watered down version". This is really a good game. It is a great study of pre ww2 war plans and should be played and looked at as such.

RATING: 8
A very interesting "Empire of the Sun lite".  The Japanese try to take the Philippines, Guam, and Shanghai as quickly as possible, and then bog down and hammer the US Navy forces that try to cross the Pacific in leaps and hops.  The vulnerability and lower firepower of the Japanese is balanced by the difficulties of crossing an ocean and need to retake all their losses in a short length of time for the Americans.

Great way to get into Empire of the Sun (and still filling on its own). A very good, compact game. Excellent for club nite: takes a fun hours, rules are very good and puts you right in the middle of the fight quickly.

EotS for beginners. 

It is certainly not so rich as EotS but it plays quickly and is not so big brain burner for this alone it is great game.

Also I want to use it to learn few new players EotS system.

RATING: 4.7
I have rated it using my school guidelines...

Understanding (game engine, realism of the decision making, how much the game capture the general feel of the period): 85

Depth of Knowledge (accuracy of the nut and bolts...): 15.

The Japanese order of battle is more or less fantasy. The rating of the BBs is bogus. How You can rate the Nagato and Mutsu (16" gun armed) identically to the Fuso and Yamashiro (14"). There are problems with two battleships having two steps counters and single battleships the same. Hiei was not operational in the time frame of the scenario (she was a training ships with reduced armament) she get confused with the Kirishima.  The Akagi was in refit during the 1932-1933 time frame. The Refit ended in December 1932. And the ship was not declared operations until April 1933. She was again under reconstruction in 35-36 (extensive one, going from three flight decks to one). The Kaga was similarly out of service between June 1934 and November 1935. We are also talking of the original 3 decks Carriers with problematic flight arrangements and reduced complement of planes, it is dubious they have the same rating of Saratoga and Lexington. There are similar problems also with US battleships... also the USS Langley... she was a carrier in the timeframe of the first scenario and in October 1935 she was sent to the yard for reconstruction as seaplane tender... the game got her presence completely wrong. 

Structure (Rules, graphics): 40. 

The rules are a mess with a lot of reference to Empire of the Sun (including tables set up for EOTS and with notes for used in Plan Orange), there are several contradictory rules, errors in the cards, and it is not even specified when to reshuffle the deck. The artwork is unispiring and wrong. Ships silhouettes refers to the WW2 era (no cage masts on the US BB, after reconstruction Japanese BB, Kaga and Akagi in their single deck configuration), Air units icons  undifferentiated between each other.

Total Score: 46.6 rounded for BGG at 4.7; frankly put a fail for an experienced design team...

The game is quite ok and a good starter for Empire of the Sun. On my oppinion, if you first have played EotS its not that interesting, because you have much fewer possibilities.

I was one of the playtesters for this. I had some "Empire of the Sun" experience when I played "Plan Orange," but not a lot.

I don't think Plan Orange is easier than "Empire of the Sun," but I do think it's more accessible. The rules are mostly the same, but there are fewer pieces and fewer air units to worry about Air Zone of Influence for. The overall strategic picture is more straightforward and, as Mark Herman points out in one of his articles about the game, the political picture is simplified because it isn't a global conflict.

So, not simpler as much as more manageable. I like both games alot. And Plan Orange has airships ...

Once you get your head around the rules and rulebook, this is a great game. It has a wonderful flow through the mechanics that leaves one free to think about strategy and operations rather than rules procedures. It really is a great game and encouraged me to try the original game. A great way to learn the system and have fun in preparation for the second world war pacific war game.

Fantastic project, I can't wait to get it on the table. The reduction in airpower alone (we're still in the battleship age) should be fascinating.

As a side note, the C3i issue (#29) that this appears in is nothing short of spectacular!

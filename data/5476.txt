Played the full 50 hour game out twice.  One of my favorite games in the 90s.  Still a great game and system.  My favorite in the TSR GBOTCW System.

Fascinating historical study and beautiful map for the time when it was created.  it can be surpassed now by superior tech and art, but the rules... while slow, gave me a great appreciation for the terrain, tactics, situation experienced at Antietam.  I regret having gottne rid of this one and would have liked to have played it fully through.

Played over three days in August '07 - Opponent (General Lee) provided the game. Little Mac let the side down as usual. Just once I want to see the Army of the Potomac all move off at the same time!

"Great Battles of the American Civil War" series games are among my all time favorites.

RATING: 4
The SPI/TSR "Great Battles of the American Civil War" series was marred by the rule that allows regiments to divide their fire (then sum their fire with other regiments).  This rule alone makes the series essentially unplayable (or at least a bookkeeping nightmare of epic proportions).  On the bright side you can play these old games (with some tweaking) using the newer GMT rules.  Although still complicated, the GMT rules make the game much more playable.

Antietam at regimental level! what more can be said! detailed game with mechanics to hamstring the Union forces by forcing McClellan's caution on the Union player. the only down side to this game are the hideous graphics TSR used on the map.

RATING: 8.6
Fun,very fun, especially the following: Hooker's attack in the cornfields, the stubborn confederate defence, the overshoot artillery rule,the pull chit for US corps activation..etc..Fun,fun,fun.

The pastel color printing on the counters is terrible to look at, makes some unit symbols difficult to identify, and is often misaligned but aside from that, this game is what you would expect from the 7th Volume of the original SPI / TSR Great Battles of the American Civil War series.

RATING: 6
Play tested this monster in the 70's, so kind of biased. Either the Gamer's or GMT systems do Civil War better, but I will never forget the time I sent Stuart in a cavalry charge into the flank of Dana'a brigade to route the First Corps. Too bad RHB changed the rules after this :-(

A part of the venerable GBACW system, this game covers my favorite Civil War battle.  It moves fairly well, and works well.  The McClellan is an idiot factor is handled in this game by using activation chits.  I have seen Union forces sitting around picking flowers for most of the day due to bad draws, and I have seen the entire Yankee army coming at me at once.  Overall a solid game.

The game was very busy at this level.  There was a lot of units on the board and it made the game almost unplayable.  I did like Hooker's Attack at the beginning of the battle.  Burnside's Bridge was a good place to see what happened as well.  It is good, but not as good as Cedar Mountain, or Pea Ridge.

A truly monster game, very detailed, and better than 'Terrible Swift Sword' IMHO.  This uses Berg's Civil War rules system. What an idiot McC was!

Liked to play with five, two Confederate and three Union players. Slow to start multiplayer for full interaction, but once corps start to commit, the shells start to fly.

Currently playing this game after a 30+ year hiatus. The change in scale to 50 men per strength point results in some large stacks with inevitable toppling. Very long playing time.

A good game covering one of my favorite Civil War topics. But given the time needed to play, not likely to be seen on my table very often.

The Battle of Antietam.  After playing a few rounds of this game you'll feel like you had actually participated in a forced road march.  For American Civil War diehards only.

RATING: 7
A good GBACW game, although I still prefer Sharpsburg. I've only played the two scenarios which involve the Cornfield and they are both very good but I'll still play Sharpsburg for the campaign. There needs to be a Burnside Bridge scenario but the quality of the two cornfield scenarios make up for that oversight.

The old SPI editions were all we had back then, and seemed tolerable until you thought about them.  The new GMT versions are preferable.

Masterpiece concerning one of the most dramatic clashes in the American civil war. No one should miss this, especially anyone interested in the evolution of Confederate doctrines and engineering about artillery and small arms fire

A very good game. Lots of excitement, and plenty of action. Flow of the game is closer to TSS than Bloody April, and it has the feel of excitement. Only down side is activation of Union units is frustrating for the Union commander, and scary for the Rebel side. But it does work!

Large grand tactical game. You really have to like this type of game to get through it - I can only remember a couple of times I was able to, and I do like these sorts of games. It took most of three weekends for me and a buddy to play the first time.

While I like this game- especially the release chit pull system for the Union Corps - the map always struck me as fairly ugly, and I really wished the counters would have been done in the style of TSS 2nd ed.

Dug this out from my loft late last year and am playing it one evening a week with a friend of mine. We're on our 3rd 'grand battle' game and the first 2 were conceded by the Union player. The Confederates have the advantage of knowing that they won't be facing the entire Union Army at once. Hooker's I Corps, unless quickly supported by Mansfield's XII Corps; is isolated and open to a Confederate counter attack. It's a really good game

Smaller regiments at Antietam forces a slight scale change that can lead to some tall stacks and aching backs!  Still hard to resist........

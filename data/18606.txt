Got the chance to open up a box. Wow!! I did spend an hour or so just by reading and browsing through the booklets and the nice little equipment...

As far as I can understand the mechanics, I would start to prefer it over my long lasting favorite "Airwar"!

Review from prior to joining team as third designer (2012).  

ASL goes airborne.  Been playing around with this one since LBW was working with Tony Valle with a demo set from '01.  It's come a long way from there, and the massively detailed flight system has moved into a state of elegance not seen before by any simulation of air combat on the tabletop.  Awaiting the actual print with open arms!

"Jet noise, the sound of freedom"

I admit, I've been a wannabe pilot since I was very young. I spent 5 years in the ATC (Air Training Corps, now the Royal Australian Air Force Cadets) and as soon as I saw this game I knew it was a 'Must Have'.

RATING: 8
My rating of 8 is simultaneously too high and far too low. The game itself is a 10+, but the product is more like a 6 or 7 because of flaws in the tutorial and rulebook. If you are interested in close combat between jet fighters and want to explore real-world tactics this game is absolutely indispensible. The level of detail AND fidelity is unprecedented, and breakthrough play aids and game mechanisms lay bare the real dynamics of jet combat.

The main caveat is that unless you live near one of the game's fanatics you will probably need to spend significant time online learning the game because of the flaws in the tutorial provided. It's also not for the casual gamer; some may wish for a faster-paced game, such as Air Superiority or The Speed of Heat. It's worth noting some differences between those games and this one. BoP obsoletes J. D. Webster's classics for its fully-consistent 3-D modeling and sound physics foundation, providing the only boardgame capable of illustrating air combat maneuvering in full detail. But don't chuck your copies of the older games just yet. The scale and level of detail make large engagements impractical in BoP, and if you're interested in BVR combat or any air/ground interactions BoP is not your game.

Truly innovative use of nomographs to replace what could easily be a small handbook of charts and tables.  The result is a bona-fide simulation of air combat in the jet age.

Would rate higher if the rulebook and tutorial were completely rewritten.  Even better, a DVD of basic flight maneuvers, and how to understand the PHAD (Pitch, Heading, Attitude Display).  If you want to enjoy the game, find someone to teach you face-to-face.

I was only in one teaching session, so a provisional rating as I have not played enough to know the game. But this is a truly amazing piece of work that has to be experienced to be believed. Does it capture the feel jet combat on paper? Others say it does and I am in no position to dispute them. I can only say that I would like to play more and find out.

Probably the most realistic modern air combat game you will ever play. And the most complex, by far.

Perfectly fine game, but ultimately a game designed by engineers, for engineers. Unfortunately, I'm not an engineer. I never did wrap my head completely around the rules, even with the designers (super nice guys, btw) and other experts holding my hand for several days at a convention.

Just not for me.

RATING: 9
Probably the most detailed and physically accurate jet-on-jet simulation available for table play. The flight model and aircraft controls are truly unique and give an amazingly visceral feel for dogfighting for a board game. The graphics are gorgeous. As with most air-to-air games, however, this one can get a bit tweaky; but with a little practice--and the game comes with an excellent guided tutorial--it's a blast. 

So pick up a copy 'n kick the tires and light the fires.

This game is more than a simple dogfight game, it is a real simulation game.
The learning phase is quite important and it will take some time to be able to fly few maneuvers. But all the way, the sensations are incredible and you will definitely feel as a real novice pilot at school when you will try to get your instructor in your sight.
Advised to all fly-simulation addicts.

An amazingly detailed and comprehensive look at air combat.  Finally a game that correctly models an aircraft's flight rather than trying to force aircraft movement into a specific hex-march across the game map.

Rules are intimidating at first, but get easier after some hands-on playthrough.

The best air game I've played.  However, tutorial is next to useless for learning the flow of the game.  It is great for learning the tools, but keeps them too out of context.  Rules are not good for learning game either.  

Recommend that one go through the tutorial and play with the tools, then play through a game using the rulebook step by step.  It takes some time but does come together.

The Emperor Has No Clothes

Never has a game that has been so aligned with my interets turned into such a disappointment.  Never have I invested so much into a game (cross-country travel and solitaire training) and been rewarded with nothing but regret.

First, I can say that it is impossible to play this game correctly without personal instruction from a designer/developer or an inner-circle player.  The rulebook is simply too high-level and the tutorial is either incomplete (non-gun combat, sensors, etc.) or has errors (movement).  It should also be said that even the inner-circle has disagreements over rule concepts and that non-published updates/errata have a factor on how the inner circle plays.

Second, the designer admitted that play balance is not a major design consideration and scenario design is aimed at the inner circle, not the incoming player that may be confused by complicated situations.  It should be stated here that it is assumed that the player understands the major implications of certain technology implementations over the years; there are game-changing situations that may not be apparent to a player that will result in nearly instant loss-of-game decisions.

Finally, and this is the real killer, it takes even world-class players of this game more than one hour to complete a turn.  A turn represents 6s; unless you are using modern face-shot IRMs, positioning for a kill-shot will take 6-12 turns.  So, you make a bad judgement at the start of the game and it will take 10 hours to realize it; not fun.

The F2F games I have played:

hop 1:  the designer shot down my wingman, I ran away.
hop 2:  I blacked-out evading a missile, no meaningful action.
hop 3:  I had a lucky shot and killed a plane, the developer blacked out and was shot down by the designer, I ran way.
hop 4:  no meaningful actions.
hop 5:  no meaningful actions.
hop 6:  play versus bots resulted in a kill, scenario won, but not setup correctly by scenario designer.
hop 7:  wingman and I shot-down by missiles that were a full generation ahead of our armament.
hop 8:  no meaningful actions.

Not exactly a field-of-dreams.  Each one of these battles was 4-8 hours; my record is 2:1.

I will say that many of the published scenarios seem more interesting than the games I ended up playing at the conventions, and one of the games I played had 30 minute turns.  Given an interesting and balanced scenario with all of the players committed to 30 minute turns, I could see this game being fun.  However, the inner circle doesn't seem to value to this, and no one I know is interested in putting in the time to learn it.

A particular poison I noticed with this game is that modern combat is more fascinating than historical combat to the inner circle.  The problem with this is that rating non-combat-tested weapons is a complete guess, or based on "access to information that can't be revealed".  Modern technology is exceptionally deadly, and understanding how deadly this is is not something that will be apparent to a new player until they are dead.  Becoming dead in this manner might take a 4-8 hour game session.  I don't think this is very entertaining.  

Based on my experience with this game, I am re-evaluating how I rate air combat games.  While I have dissed low-complexity games like CY6 in the past, I have to say that chrome does not necessarily result in more realistic outcomes, and there is alot to be said for a fun and memorable outcome, over an analytical exercise that results in headaches for all involved.

Includes Airborne Alert, Fighter Sweep, and RAG #1 expansions.

An excellent if complex game. I think once the living rules come out with all the corrections, index and proper organization this may well go up to a 10 in my book. Not for the feint of heart, but any serious airgrog must get this.

My only complaint is the rule books are not great. Having two rulebooks is a personal hate of mine, I would have rather had one comprehensive one and then a seperate quickstart rules later, but ultimately it isn't too bad, although no index hurts it.

There's something about a Nomograph....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The first tactical air combat jet game to get the physics correctly built in. Everytime I playtest, I marvel at the unique and clever nomograph system used to boil the actual aerodynamics down the simple act of laying rulers across a graph and marking with a pen. Brilliant and relatively easy to use once one gets used to it.

Not for the faint of heart though - its Air War done right, but with such attention to detail that the game can crawl when all the sensor and spotting rules are layered in. Still, if you want a game that models the physics down to the point where burning off a 1000 pounds of gas or dropping a bomb makes a difference in performance, this game does, and its that amazingly accurate.

Ratings Bump now that it was published...Phil's artwork and efforts are fantastic. Some rules streamlining occurred in final playtest. 

One final comment - This game only models the knife fight in the phone booth aspect of air combat. Long range missile duels and air to ground strikes are not its venue, for that - I think Air Strike and Speed of Heat still have something to offer!

Played through the tutorial and *loved* it.  A very smooth system with amazing play-aids to ensure everything can be found and performed easily.  The potential for expansion with new aircraft and weapons systems is a huge plus.  But the learning process is hindered by a disturbing number of errors and typos in the tutorial and rule books; definitely not what you want when trying to learn a game like this on your own.  Really needs errata provided soon.  On the plus side, the Yahoo group is very helpful and queries are answered swiftly and in a friendly manner.

RATING: 9
"This game is as revolutionary as Thomas Paine and Leon Trotsky inventing the atomic bomb and using it to overthrow Louis XVI while listening to a recording of "Revolution" performed by Prince and the Revolution on the very first prototype iPod."

Well, maybe the guy who said that about Birds of Prey was being hyperbolic, but this is a nifty piece of game design, with a remarkable number of innovations combined to make a system that very realistically portrays a notoriously difficult subject to simulate, yet does it in a way that is very playable, fun, and immersive--the planes feel like they are flying, more than in any dogfight game I have played before.  (And they, and the other components, look great doing it.)  I hope that people will not be scared off by the unfamiliar-looking playaids and will give the game a try long enough to find out that for most players it all starts making sense in fairly short order.

(According to the BGG rating criteria I should make this a 10, since I play BoP every chance I get, but the rush to publish the game led to a rules set that is solid at its core but still would benefit from some refinement around the edges.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Slick, pretty high-fidelity game about close-in jet air combat: the "knife-fight."  A lot of complexity under the hood, but remarkably streamlined through clever playaids.  Rulebook and tutorial could stand better organization and proofreading IMO; I suspect that trying to pick the game up "solo" without online access to the developers or players would be difficult and confusing.  Happily, questions are promptly answered on a couple of online forums.

The king of high fidelity air warfare. Leaves everything else of its kind standing still on the ground, chocks and plugs inserted. End of. 

This is the thinking man's dogfight, where you have the time to analyse the situation and act accordingly. It lends itself to the deeper analysis and understanding of its subject matter (Top Gun-like debriefs).

This game has the most innovative mechanisms I have seen in the genre, in the form of graphical calculators (Nomographs); A game this detailed and chromed shouldn't be this easy -and entertaining- to play, but it is, thanks especially to the nomo's distilling time consuming math down to drawing two lines on a graphic, and reading where the lines cross. Fidelity is king: burn off 100 lbs of JP-5, or launch a missile, and your performance changes.

Maneuvering and Orientation is driven by the PHAD, a projection of the full 360-degree sphere around the plane onto a number of hex-circles, where the vector of the plane is represented (by nose-, canopy- and right wingtip-components).

Hexmap and vertical movement is similarly elegant and detailed: movement isn't hex-by-hex, but distills movement down to the result of the move in 3 dimensions, giving some very detailed results, not possible with traditional 6 or 12-directional hex-by-hex movement.

As the final chrome, planes are represented by boxes, which are placed on blocks with a 30/60 degree cut in them (Tilt blocks - see the gallery for examples), which allows a precise representation in 3 dimensions - further helping visualisation of the battlespace.

Two slight caveats:
BoP is all about the knife fight in the phonebooth at, and after the merge, when the walls of missiles have been fired, and the survivors are left, and that's all well and good, but I *would* have liked the game to include the initial phases (detection, BFM and BVR exchanges) of the fight, too. 

BoP is somewhat let down by its rules, which are difficult to dechipher - hopefully the second edition rules (currently in the works) should address this problem, letting BoP shine as the gem it truly is

RATING: 9
This game is astounding.  I've been following its development since 1995, wishing for a game that could model dogfighting with enough accuracy to try out the tactics in Shaw's "Fighter Combat."  BoP appears to do this, which is mind bending in and of itself.  But what's more impressive is that it accomplishes it with a system that's playable and addictively fun. 

I found play to be slow-going at first but much faster after a few games.

I didn't think I'd like the box minis but they're actually really great.

Most elegant system ever to simulate modern dogfighting. Unfortunately the rules are incomplete and the initiative system doesn't work well. So if you don't register to the yahoo group and get information there you won't be able to play the game. Which is bad because the flight model REALLY teaches you the physics of air combat. So waiting to see if the 2nd version of the rules will turn into what this game deserves: the best aerial wargame.

Extremely complex and not for the faint of heart. Like the Saganami Island Tactical Simulator, I found that the rule books left somewhat to be desired.

For me, this is really a tale of two games. Bear in mind that I typically don't like games that are this complex, so I suspect I am not the market this game is trying to attract. That said, this is a clever piece of game design. Unlike the old SPI Air War which was complex and boring, with Birds of Prey you at least understand the rationale behind what you are doing. In fact, if I were wanting to teach someone how to fly a real plane, this would make a decent tutorial on how to do it. However, for me, that is the problem with BoP.

I do NOT have an interest in learning how to fly a real plane and so what appears to those who do as interesting and innovative appears mind-numbingly complex to me. Too many times when I played this, I kept asking myself "Am I doing this right"? Sadly, the rulebook does a poor job of reassuring you that you are doing it right or helping you to understand what you did wrong.

It is not a bad game. In fact, if you are really into this topic, I cannot think of a better game. I'm just not into the topic to appreciate what it has to offer.

RATING: 6
Ok, the first session wasn't really a game but a trial of keeping the plane in the air. It really needs VERY much interest to get somebody to play this. The number of different difficult tables is enormous and maintaining the plane in the air requires a lot of brain activity.

There clearly is potential in this game given that both (or all) the players are really motivated. I'd like to give this a proper try even though it may require ´many hours spent reading the tutorial book...

Interesting. Messy but interesting.

Takes a lot of time to figure out each move. Gunfire and missile attacks are fast and deadly once you get round to them. A lot more detailed than other dogfight games. Would be nice to see the Rafael, Eurofighter, F22 and F35. Even the relatively old Tornado is absent. Maybe there are numbers they aren't privvy to yet. Not a pound for air to ground, helicopter, SAM nor AAA.

This took forever to get on the table. Now that it has seen the light of play, it's amazing. So much detail, so much air combat action...

The learning curve is steep for the first few turns; it takes a bit to figure out the procedures and play-aids. Playing with an experienced player really helps, although the planned 2.0 edition will hopefully be written in a more accesssible way. Once learning is out of the way, the hard and fun and awesome part is actually flying your plane in a simulated fight. :)

[From incomplete playtesting attempt] A marvel at what it attempts: manually solved flight simulation and combat - using innovative nomograms and vector maps for 3D angles. Even simulates explicitly pilot's physiology, vision, G-strain and fatigue. Still too complex-for-the-result for the mere intro-grognard that I am. 99% of heavy gamers I know would prefer just a real-time PC flight sim, plus the theory exposition (energy, drags etc.) where understanding from this system is better.

Being a HUGE fan of Whistling Death, I thought for sure I'd love this one...and it is quite good.  After playing it at a convention a few years ago and really enjoying it, I plunked down the money for a copy for myself...and have yet to play it again.  The graphs while easing some of the play complexity, are a HUGE impediment to teaching anyone not already super enthusiastic.  They literally just look so complicated that a potential opponent's eye will almost immediately glaze over.

I've got it reluctantly up for trade, but really if someone has a ready and willing opponent, it'll do much better in their hands :)

A very slick mechanism to handle the 3D movement, and especially orientation.  The innovative PHAD is the key to giving a true pilot's eye-view of the battle.  Playing this game has also improved my play of other air combat games.

The use of "box miniatures" is also a nice innovation that reduces the amount of information that one has to ask from the other players during a game.  The only data that isn't directly visible on the map is the speed.  Other air games often have you asking for a lot of additional information when planning a move.

Also, I recently met somebody that could also be interested in trying this.

Please Note: the Standard Edition would do just fine

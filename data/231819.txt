RATING: N/A
The 2player version of Captain Sonar is less frantic (good), but also felt significantly more zero-sum (bad?).  It's much easier to know exactly where your opponent is, and simply math out how to hit them with a torpedo before they hit you, as silencing to sneak around uses the same energy that you need to land a hit.

Neat game, would play again, but would not need to own.

Played once, it was fun, but I don’t know how much game there actually is in here. I’ve shied away from the full Captain Sonar just because 8 players is hard, and because some of the roles seemed a bit thin - Like the various C&C Epic Games, it seems like some players are going to get the short end of the engagement stick. But I’m curious to try it now, to see if maybe you could compress the roles a bit and play with 6 which would be more manageable.

While I get why this is a neat game, and why others enjoy it, it combines two things that I really hate in games:

- Deduction where the emphasis is on note taking. This game is largely about taking good notes, both as to where your opponents might think you are, and where you think your opponent can be. I just don't find these type of note-taking deduction games to be fun.

- Abstract strategy. The game is also largely an abstract strategy game about outmaneuvering your opponent, which is another game element that I never find enjoyable.

Just like some games combine two great things like chocolate and peanut butter, this game combines piss and vinegar for me. I absolutely acknowledge that this game will be awesome for many people, and I even admire the game design; it's just not for me.

It's Interesting on the first play, what with one teammate moving the ship and the other trying to home in on the opponents' ship, but subsequent plays feel too much like those that have gone before.

Less interesting than Captain Sonar due to it's scope, but it does a good job of delivering the theme on a smaller scale. The game is less tense than it's big brother, in fact I think most other hidden movement games pack more punch, but it makes up for it with a super quick play time. Even though this is a fine game, if you can I'd stick to Captain Sonar.

A thinky and tense game of bluff and deduction for two teams of two players each. Be careful of assuming that this is just the turn-based mode of [thing=171131][/thing] &mdash; CS's turn-based mode is for learning; this one is intended for real play.

Similarly, don't expect CS's concepts and rules (which are intended for real-time use) to map directly to Sonar. Treat Sonar as a clean slate and relearn the (short and simple) rules from scratch to avoid frustration.

Not feeling this one.  I haven’t trield Captain Sonar and hoped this would be a decent family version alternative that can be played with 2 or 4.  It’s OK, but in my experiences, the turns get bogged down and it feels more frustrating than fun.  I’m sure CS is worlds better with the real time aspect.  Going on the trade/sell pile.

I'm not opposed to the idea of crafting a simpler Captain Sonar for those who lacked the constitution for its admittedly stressful onslaught of suffocating emotions. Sonar, though, takes it a little too far. Turn-based is fine, fewer players is fine. But the emphasis on zone-based torpedoes transforms it into a game of lurking alongside arbitrary zone lines, while the stripped-down silence engines and surfacing make it less about the hunt and into, well, a very light navigational deduction game with some resource management elements. Captain Sonar was an event; this is merely okay.

First play impression: this improves on Captain Sonar while retaining one of the biggest flaws.

The biggest improvement is the player count. I only got to play Captain Sonar once because I always had too many or too few people. Sonar is really a four-player-only game, and that is perfect. There are only two roles here: the captain and radio operator. The captain charts the course, chooses which action to take and keeps up with energy, while the radio operator tries to track down the opposing sub.

The only problem here is also the biggest problem with the older game: the game can go on indefinitely. When your opponent uses the Silence action to keep their movement hidden then you can usually narrow down their position to two spots. You could move in and fire a torpedo, but there would be a 50/50 chance of hitting them. If you miss, they can use Silence again to throw you off and keep the 50/50 cycle going. Although this game will generally play faster than Captain Sonar, players could choose to keep stalling. It just feels like there should be some sort of built-in timer on the game, like if no damage has been done after X amount of turns the game ends.

Other than that, the game is fun. It's tense and brain-burny and there's nothing quite like it other than Captain Sonar.

This game takes battle ship to a new level. Two teams take turns maneuvering submarines around a board trying to sink each other. This simplified version of Captain Sonar works better at the lower player counts.

Great to have a lighter version of Capt. Sonar that you can play with just two.  Better than Battleship, and easier to digest than its predecessor.

Single play, not sure on this one. Definitely much more simple than I was expecting in comparison to "Captain Sonar". I will update rating as my opinion settles in.

GAME: Baptism By Fire: The Battle of Kasserine
RANK: 4991
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The Battalion Combat Series (BCS) brings some thoughtful ideas to the World War 2 table. Notably, it looks to emphasise how combat in the era was a combined arms effort, not simply an odds ratio calculation. And supply is no longer a bean-counting exercise, as in OCS, but a factor in determining the command-control resilience of formations.

As a system, I found a period of headscratching was required, but afterwards it becomes quite straightforward. Combat resolution is easy; it's co-ordinating the actions of multiple units during a fomation activation that's difficult, although ultimately very satisfying.

Kasserine, as depicted in this game, has long empty roads and relatively few units. In that sense it has a very convincing wide-open North Africa feel. And the playtime is reasonable - the full game is 10 turns and I reckon turns are generally playable in an hour.

My concern after playing one shorter scenario as well as the full campaign is that the Allies have relatively little counterplay in them. The Axis have all the fun, all the big hitter units and even a secret objective determined mid-way through the game. The Allies seem pretty much a punchbag with very little to get excited about. So I have a suspicion this particular game may fall flat for one of the players in an opposed game. But I found it perfectly enjoyable solo and will happily play again.

Battalion Combat Series, game 2
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.2
This game is the perfect intro to the BCS system. Few units and formations, easy MSR, almost no possibility for mixing and fronts crearly defined. The burden of the attack is on the Axis and for this motive, that side has to be taken by the more experienced player. The Allied are a punching ball but don't underestimate their strenght points, This game system is a Dean Essig creature, so the defence must be pro-active if it wants to succeed, counter-attack isolated german units, cut his supply network, engage his armor at -1 for exchanging steps. Try to hold ground but units are more important.
I've played as Axis and Allies and had a lot of fun with both.

Screen and PC retreat rules need modification. Manageable over a weekend, especially with a group. Allows to you think in terms of planning rather than ratf*cking force ratios for a column shift.

Very nice game system with some good new concepts. There are a few things that I think are a bit strange (like the MSR of both sides can cross eachother) but these are very minor and don't break the game at all.

I'm just learning this game.  It treats armor and infantry completely differently -- armor is not just strong, fast infantry.  The system makes sense, but takes some learning if you're used to other games.

Excellent "intro" into this great series where I really hope to see many new titles in the future. The way units and formations interact is brilliant. Being a solitaire gamer this game is absolutely superb as you try to do the very best for each and every formation as you activate it regardless of side. The SNAFU roll is "realistic" and really adds to the suspense and tension. For solitaire play I can really recommend using the system for activation where you put all formations in a cup and the randomly draw 3. The side that draws most formations choose which to activate among those 2 or 3 ( and the rest back to the cup)

This is a brilliant introduction to the Battalion Combat Series.  Small unit count with lots of room to maneuver mean that every unit placement and small action can be important.  There are a number of aspects that work quite differently from OCS or anything else, and these can take a couple of playings to wrap your head around; but once you do, it all works really well together.

The activation rules, coupled with weather, mean that every game is going to play quite differently.  Folks who really like to "solve" a game for the perfect approach should probably stay away.   But if you like infinite replay value, this is pretty close.

Haven't played it enough to know how well balanced it is, but the victory conditions would make that easy to tweak.  Yes, the Allies are getting their head handed to them, but the Germans have a lot of ground to cover in order to win, and limited armor with which to do it.  The Allies also cannot just sit back and defend.  If they don't threaten German supply lines and lateral LOC, they are probably making it too easy for the Germans.

Finally, at this level, the difference between armor and infantry is shown very nicely.  Combat is an interesting puzzle, totally unlike any other game system I've seen.

Real innovations that work in rules. Beauty of board games is you can "take it or leave it.." with every rule. In this case mix and match BCS rules with OCS rules. But many of the tweaks in the BCS rules are very smart so will be using them.

Hex = 1 mile
Units are battalions (a BCS Battalion Combat Series game)
Time = one day 
sounds good scale to me.

Baptism by Fire (Battalion Combat System game 2) has the typical ultra-clear Dean Essig rules and the solid, easy-on-the eyes materials that are standard at Gamers/MMP.  The victory conditions are exceptionally well tuned, allowing real cliff-hangers all the way to game's end.  The rule crib sheet was a nice touch.  

The system plays well and yields a fluid, rather see-saw battle without straying into chaos.  The logistics/SNAFU and Command Radius rules do a good job of keeping units of a formation together at the operational level while allowing them to maneuver at the battalion level.

Full 10-turn campaign plays out in a long day

Game 2 in the Battalion Combat Series.  Game 1 (Last Blitzkrieg) is outstanding.  This is much smaller, and a very different setting.  The wide open spaces combined with narrow mountain passes make for a swirling game of attack and counter attack.

Much more free-wheeling than Last Blitzkrieg, and really just as good.  It gets a slightly lower rating for two reasons:  LB is an awesome achievement given its size, and as the first game in the BCS it gets bonus points for novelty!

Just received today (4/6/17). Just first impressions of components: the updated series rulebook is glossy (or semi gloss, not certain), which some won't like, but it *is* in color - normally that doesn't matter much to me, but the series rules has an extensive example of play which is almost impossible to follow in black and white, so color is nice here. I love the maps. The counters for the units themselves only take up about a half counter sheet (total ally and axis), and the markers take up the remaining sheet and a half, so this looks as approachable as this series will get. I love Last Blitzkrieg, but the campaign is a traditional monster. This is one of my favorite recent systems, this is a great place to buy in to it.

Will play soon, maybe even tonight.

Update
Quite Demanding, lot of things to remember. 
What follows if which type of unit enters which type of ZOC is very differentiated.
Handling of supply lines is also not easy.
I think extensive graphical playaids (instead of the crib notes, which have not much value as the rules have to be consulted anyway) would be helpfull, like the OCS supply line graphics, but also for the different types of ZOC/combat scenarios.
Put it aside to go for something with more common concepts, coming back another day.

*****
Game System looks great.
Would have prefered to have the artillery as formation-invidividual counters on the map, not with much less abstracted rules (they could be beamable like the combat trains), but to have the complete OOB shown on map.

Since I don't have the space or time to play The Last Blitzkrieg, this is one that I am looking forward to playing. I'm still limited to the one-map scenarios but at least I can play the two-map campaign at our monthly game club.

Update: Just got this yesterday. Since I live in a small apartment, this is the perfect sized game for me to play. Since there are so few battalion-level wargames out there, I'm really looking forward to learning this one.

Love it.  Takes a while to get accustomed to mechanics but simulates command and control and supply very well through the SNAFU and Combat Train mechanics.  Much less counter density vs. Last Blitzkrieg and a more interesting situation IMHO.  Very fun game with a lot of room to maneuver.  Perfect scale for the Kasserine battle.

A great introduction to a fantastic system.  I don't have LB, but this has far less formations making it much easier to learn and to complete a scenario in a reasonable time.

I love the BCS system and this game being smaller than it predecessor will make it more accessible.I would say this is a must buy for anyone who enjoys hex and counter war games.

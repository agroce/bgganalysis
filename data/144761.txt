Fun family game. The rules paddle lasted all of three turns. I used the PDF files from BGG and glued them to quarter inch birch plywood. Works great now.

It fell flat with my gaming buddies, but that's OK. I will hold onto it for the sake of family gatherings.

RATING: 7
Quick, easy to explain, and fun. Not much to it, but that's the beauty of it. I have added extra components to make the game work with 10 players (additional cards, cubes etc.) The gameplay remains the same at that level (functionally) but the chaos of all those players reaching for the cups is too much! I can see why this was restricted to 6 for the real game.

RATING: 6
3 plays / 4,5 players

like: fast, chaotic auction. two different strategies (collect items or flags)
dislike: very competitive, people can get angry at one another for blocking

overall: fun, crazy game if taken lightly. with people's hands getting in the way, the game can have a few "cry fouls" and cubes get thrown.

A quick, fun-ish auction game.  Very little (if any) strategy.  Auctions tend to be furious if not quick and grisly.  Likely plays best with alcohol as an end of the night fiasco.

1st play: The game played very quickly and was an interesting take on a set collection/monopoly game. I like the fast pace of the auctions and the frenzy associated with the bidding. I don't like that the game takes 7 rounds so it's impossible to have an even number of start-player turns.

No 2nd play: opted not to bother playing when I had the chance.

Not really a game. It's probably better described as a painful exercise in observation and trickery.  I suppose this makes it party game material for some groups.  Another turn-off is that it can result in physical injury and/or damaged game pieces if players act aggressively or without restraint.

Great little auction game with a player-controlled time element.  Great feel of tension, especially in the later rounds.  Overly-aggressive players might end up damaging the placard that is used to end the bidding for each round.  I see lots of replay possibilities, especially because the dynamics of the game depend on the make up of the players.  Cool game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
About as simple and stripped down as you can get for a fun, quick auction game!

Players simply bid for cards in real time, by dropping cubes (which are money in the game) near the cards they would like.  The auctioneer for the round must count down from 10 at whatever speed he likes while people bid.  Once the count hits zero, bidding stops and the players see who one what.

Cards won by the players are used to form sets, which the players can cash in for more money, and most money wins.

Overall, a pretty good filler if you need a quick auction fix!

This is a fun game when the mood strikes, but I found it oddly less raucous than the rules would suggest. Perhaps I just haven't played it in the right environment yet, but I just didn't find us shouting and laughing ala Pit, etc.

But, the variance in countdown speed is the heart of the game, and is most definitely funny and engaging.

If the idea of a real-time auction party game sounds appealing to you, you will probably like this game. There are no surprises here. People will fall into two camps with a game like this: either things like having your bidding cubes knocked out of your hand by the hands of other players who are rushing in to bid will frustrate you, or it will amuse you and feel like the entire point. If you fall into the latter camp, this is the game for you!

Fair warning, there's a couple rules that you'll have to agree on as a group, as they're probably intentionally ambiguous so players can choose how "seriously" to take the game - when a countdown reaches zero, do you stop bidding immediately? Or are you allowed try and sneak in a few more cubes before the paddle falls?

Though I'm not super enamored with the game (yet?), it's nice to have a party game that feels sufficiently different.

I'm generally not afraid of lighter games, and I'm always looking for very accessible titles that can help rope in the non-gamer or lighter gamer. This game caught my attention for that very reason.

It's pretty good... frantic real-time auction where you're dropping cubes in cups to make your bid. But there's just a few things that strike me as a bit lukewarm. The set collection seems very tacked on. You collect types (cars, comics, baseball cards) or countries (USA, Germany, China, etc.) but the result feels a bit forced. Baseball cards from Germany? Really? 

I'd happily play this again, but I don't think I need to own it. It's the type of game that I'd get a few plays out of but then it would likely just sit on my shelf staring at me. Given the game's price point, I'll pass for now unless I can pick it up on the cheap.

P.S. -- expect someone to bend the paddle handle in your first game.

Excellent auction game.  LOVE placing, throwing, and dumping cubes into the cups.  Brilliant!  The card art is fine, but the graphic design/layout could use some improvement.  Bidding as the auctioneer felt a bit awkward.  Bidding, counting down and dropping the paddle took increased coordination, but was still fun.  I felt like I needed a couple seconds to peruse the new card offerings and compare them to my current holdings before the 10 second count down started.  But having that time pressure certainly adds to the fun.  Outbidding other players in itself is inherently fun.  This game is... FUN.

Components: Everything exactly as it should be. Some of the items are difficult to distinguish in the moment, but perhaps that's the point.

Experience: Fun, simple auctions. Not being able to count exactly leads to overbidding and underbidding and lots of surprises.

RATING: 3
got a cheap copy of the game during an amazon pre-christmas sale (20-25$? something like that... so i can't complain about the price). 
The components are quite terrible though. the art on the cards is awful and i can't believe it passed the first playtest. (edit: the art and graphic design is bad because it isn't functional. I found it very difficult to keep track of which cards belong to which sets etc). Otherwise what you get is a load of cubes (useful for some of my own little game design projects so that is okay).

The gameplay is too chaotic. It's too difficult to keep track of what is going on and everything just degenerates into chaos.
where have i dropped cubes? Can i even drop cubes where i want to without pushing other player's hands away?
From the go people were complaining about foul play: Auctioneers counting down too fast or too slow (it's almost impossible to do the count down in a controlled manor while you're also trying to throw your cubes in a cup and keep track of what other players are doing), people pushing other player's hands away and trying to cover cups with their hands etc...  terrible. Just too chaotic.
Well, actually it's fun for a single play, but interestingly not a single player at the table wanted to play even just a second round of the game...  EVER AGAIN!

I'd recommend just about any timed dexterity game you already have over this. Because that is essentially what it is:
A dexterity game with a count down/timer disguised as an auction game.

It just doesn't work.

The real time auction element is quite nice, and may lead to me getting and playing this game more in the future.  The only downside I saw was in the jostle of hands around the bidding cups bid cubes often went flying, sometimes into wrong cups.  While hilarious, that would wear thin if you truly wanted something and physically couldn't make the bid for it.  Good stuff, though.

RATING: 5
It's a pretty fun real time bidding game. A little repetitive, but a nice high energy way to either start or finish a night of games.

If you want to play this two player, set the cups up in front of the box lid to catch any strays and throw your cubes in. Makes for a fun dexterity variant and adds back a lot of the lost tension for having so few players.

Going, Going, GONE! is a real time auction game. There are 5 cups and each has a card next to it which you are bidding for. You have 10 seconds to get your bids in by dropping cubes into the cups.

 This sounds exciting and is exciting. But it has two drawbacks: firstly the 'ebay effect' takes hold and people hold back their bid to the last 2 seconds when everyone manically piles in. Secondly, everyone manically piling in causes the cups to fall over and deposit their contents all over the table. Some DIY system of glueing the cups to a base needs to be done to make this properly playable. 

A good idea which doesn't quite work.

Too chaotic for my liking. But on hindsight, the variation in pace allows for some bit of strategy making.

I think the idea with this set-collection auction game is that there are few rules and the players are supposed to make their own fun from the proceedings.  However, there are such few rules in this game that it's almost not a game at all and I don't think it's worthy of a boxed release.  I think children would love the chaotic nature of the game, and the fact that each player gets to be the auctioneer throughout the game, but there's nothing here to keep me interested.

Initial Rating: 3.0 (February 2017)

When I bought Going, Going, GONE!  I was pretty sure the game was going to be fun! However I’m sorely disappointed.

The rules are pretty easy. You can teach them under 2 minutes. Playtime is around 20 minutes (its best feature).

The art is cool but the game´s components are regular, moreover, it is a very expensive game for what comes in the box.

There are almost no decisions within the game and the few you make are, glaringly, obvious. There is no game here.

Going, Going, GONE! is a party game but no one had any fun playing it. 

Bottom line, Going, Going, GONE! Is a miss for me. All the players really disliked it and I expected way more from the game, in fact, it is almost not a game. I will sell my copy ASAP if I can if I can´t I will give it away. I´m surprised Stronghold Games published the game as it is. Awful game.

A novel auction game where players get to toss cubes in cups until a paddle is slammed down. Don't take this game too serious. It's meant as a light and fun party game, and only works if approached so. This game costs way more then I would be willing to pay for some: cups, basic wooden cubes, over sized box [i]just[/i] to fit a fragile paddle and [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1787899/going-going-gone?size=medium]cards[/url] with lousy artwork and iconography that is hard to distinguish during the frantic chaos of the game.

Good filler material, quick, animated, and fun.

Not sure about replayability here, as it think it could get rather samey after a few plays.  Also, the components, while functional, are not really well designed and feel cheap.  Also, the box size is pretty sucky for what is in it.

RATING: 8
A fun mechanism for bidding and quick play time make this a lot of fun to play. The game itself is a lot of fun, which is why I put it at an 8. 

But there are quite a few other issues I have, so I'll put the whining below.

1. The price - the game is a complete rip-off at its current price point. It really should be around $20 tops. I think the game has lost a lot of potential players simply by pricing itself way out of the normal range.

2. The box size - the box is gigantic, SO much bigger than it needs to be. The paddle is sort of useful, but completely flimsy. It will not hold up to people trying to sneak their hand in for a last second bid. Not only is the box too big, but it's not even square! It's a completely nonstandard size that is simply annoying.

3. The artwork/publicity for the game author is annoying. I'm all for putting the designer's name on the box, but the way that the author's name and likeness is plastered all over the box bothers me. I also dislike when games advertise other games. Tasty Minstrel Games is a common offender but Stronghold is also doing this here and it makes me not want to support them as a company.

If I was to take my other issues into consideration in the rating I would put the game at a 6, averaging game play (8) with other issues (4). But that doesn't seem completely fair to the game, so I'll leave it at 8 for now.

This was exactly what I was hoping it would be for 6 players.  Fun, loud, exciting.  But there is some strategy here... if you over bid for an item because you are caught up in the moment you will not win.  Taking the cards no one seems to go for with a cube or two makes a big difference.

Interesting auction game where players count down at a constant rate and players bid by tossing chips into cups. The player with the most chips gets the good.  There are multiple sets you can make with goods and countries.  A unique auction party game that is pretty light. Not one I would buy though.  If another friend owned it I would play.

Worth getting BUT th e price is too darn high. 

The nature of the auction seems very fun and wild. Kind of like pit. 

ALTERNATIVELY:
Make 49 cards on Artscow.  Perhaps up the sets to 64 (8 sets of 8)
Use 5 plastic cups from party city
Get 240 cubes (40 in each of 6 colors) or more for or more players. Perhaps up to 8 or 10. Then this'll really shine as a party game. 


Luck based variant: keep 1 of the cards in the auction upside down. 

More interaction variant: allow card trading. Maybe for cubes?

Party, party, partying. Scott Nicholson is very well known for his videoreviews. Once in a while Scott also makes games. And he likes to be original, also when he designs a game.

Playing this game lets you drop cubes in little cups, trying to get the majority in certain cups. Each cup corresponds to a number of cards you can win. Sets of cards give you new cubes, and eventually points. 

Not a bad party game but way overpriced.

Minus: 3 (replayability) - 5 - 7 (theme?) - 8 - 10

Players bid on 5 simultaneous 10-second auctions hoping to collect sets to sell off. Fast, furious and fun. You just need to hit the hands of that one player that keeps a fistful of cubes right above the cup. The last 2-seconds of each auction seem to have the most action and is also where you can make some pretty awful bids under the pressure.

Was trying to position itself as a party game with a brain and can perhaps succeed as such, but strategy board game enthusiasts are probably in for a bad ride.

For starters, the high price point (apparently due to the sturdiness of the urine cups) would be acceptable - the game being frantic and prone to take a beating - if the other main component, the paddle, was not laughably fragile. Also ugly artwork is ugly.

This would matter less if the gameplay was top notch. And while the heart of the design is there, the lack of polishing gets noticed immediately. To begin with, the intentionally vague ruling doesn't acknowledge gaming etiquette issues, especially in the case of physical contact that may become a bit brutal under the hurry of the timer. Then since any individual card can be immediately sold for 2 cubes, there is no incentive for each player to put fewer than 2 leftover cubes (4 if two cards) in each unattended cup, making a fiddly task semi-mandatory during the countdown and showing how poorly the scoring was designed.

Last but not least, the tiebreaker is dull and unfair: you go clockwise from the auctionneer, which changes every turn. The problem is that there are 3-5 players but 7 turns, meaning that some players will be the auctioneer (or next to them) more often and gain a significant advantage from the start. Perhaps there is an elegant solution to this main problem - and the game encourages more than any other house ruling - but I haven't found it yet and frankly fixing the product shouldn't be my job as a customer.

The components of this game are just OK. Transparent cups to be able to see what’s inside, big wooden cubes and a paddle whose handle will eventually break (you can still use it though).

It's a fast, frantic, and most important, fun auction filler all about dexterity and quickness. The rules are very simple and elegant, but the resulting game is very solid. I think it shines most when throwing cubes one by one not invading the "aerial space" of the cups.

It’s not the kind of games you want to play over and over, but one game from time time feels really fun. The most negative aspect is its high price.

Now having played this game for three consecutive summers in my board games summer class, I can say that it starts to wear a little thin.  The novelty of fast or slow count-downs for the auction is fun the first few times, but the game starts to feel "samey". It's still fun for a few rounds, then it goes back in the box not to be played again by the same group.  My middle schoolers have never asked to play it again after the first sitting.

RATING: 6
A stupid game that can be fun when played in the right spirit. Each card has a picture and a flag. You want to collect sets of either. The more you get in a set, the more each card in that set is worth. The problem (for you) comes when the "car" card you want has the "german" flag on it that an opponent wants. Let the bidding begin. And the bidding mechanism is the star of the show. While someone counts down from 10 to 0, people drop their bids into the cups beside the cards they want. Which becomes somewhat frantic when you're outbid and time's running out (you have 10 seconds remember) and you must immediately decide whether to outbid or not, and there's hands and bids flying everywhere, then suddenly it's stopped and no one has any idea what they've won or not until it's now assessed in the cool cold light of day. There's more downtime between auctions then you'd think is appropriate because there's numerous ways for players to sort their cards to maximise their profit, with the decision each round being to trade in a set now (because you need the money to bid with the next round) or wait to add to your set later. That part wasn't nearly as much fun as the auction. Which can be slowish or lightning fast or anywhere between depending on the whim of each start player in turn, which can make for some general hilarity when it's sped up. It's some decent fun for 20 mins, but not one you can pull out regularly due to the semi-randomness of what's won/lost induced by accidental bidding in all the frantic-ness under time pressure. It's more for novelty's sake, the occasional need for something different.

Fun for a play or two but loses all of its charm after that. And charm was all it had in the first place. I suppose it might be possible to still enjoy this if you are drunk, but you won't be able to find the cubes the next day. Oh, and the artwork is absolutely atrocious. A company advertising their own games on components that are actually part of the game is disgusting.

1 play - This fast-paced auction game brings an element of tension not found in many board game auctions: speed. There simply isn’t time to do a carful evaluation of the value of all sets on the table. My play ended up being more of a throw-cubes-around-and-see-what-happens affair, but for that, I enjoyed it. The game certainly has entry-level appeal which I believe is what Scott was going for. Happy to play again.

How we played we were literally dropping bucks from shoulder height into the cups, with our arms getting in each other's ways, and many cases of missing the cups, bouncing out of the cups, or even knocking other people's bucks out of the cups. I think the actual intent is that you 'drop' the bucks by just reaching over to the cup and dropping it in at its mouth, but honestly the way we played, which was pretty terrible, was far more fun. Overall I've played a few auction games, and this one doesn't do anything for me.

A crazy game of trying to be the player who's showering most cubes into whatever plastic cups on the table are associated with tokens you want to collect.

It has a nice mechanism where you can sacrifice some points to increase your cubes (and therefore your chance to score later).

The best players will be the ones who can rapidly put marginally more cubes than other players into the appropriate cups. It takes a frantic form of dexterity to get it right. If bursts of speed, where you all do that together at the same time and your hands are bumping into each otehrs', sounds like fun you'll probably like it. It will go stale after a while, though, unlike the best party/dexterity games (Loopin' Chewie etc).

I want to rate it more than a 5 but I can't. As much as I respect its energy and streamlined design, there's little to playing it and I generally can't be bothered.

Also it is a bit annoying how a lot of the little playing cubes end up on the floor and under cupboards etc.

I really enjoyed this real-time bidding game.  The mechanic of the dealer determining how fast to count down from 10 really made it quite fun as it changed from dealer to dealer.

Played in under 30 minutes and was very enjoyable throughout.

Real time auction game where you throw your currency into plastic cups corresponding to cards while an auctioneer counts down. At zero the auctioneer covers the cups with a giant paddle.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an entertaining activity if also very brainless.  The idea is novel, have an auction game where players are on a clock and don't have time to think through and make the most optimal decisions.

And that's exactly what happens.  The game is played by setting out auction cards around 5 cups.  The cards show an item and a country on them.  You are trying to collect sets of one or the other to make more money, the player with the most money at the end wins.  Each round an auctioneer counts down from 10 as fast or slow as they want (as long as they keep pace) and then covers the cups.

This way players often way overpay for cards and get outbid for things they thought they bid enough for, especially when the auctioneer is counting quickly.  I've noticed that the strategy tends to be when the auctioneer counts slowly to wait until he gets to 3 or less before dropping any cubes in the cups anyway.

The nature of this game drains almost any strategy from it.  It really is just frantically throwing cubes in cups with just the most general idea of what you need and how much you probably need to bid.  This is fine for a few minutes with a large group of players but if you are really looking for an experience that takes some thought, probably look elsewhere.  More activity than game I'd say (although admittedly a fun activity for a once in a while play).

Bizarre simultaneous auction where players drop money-cubes into 5 cups, representing bids for 5 offers, in order to collect sets of cards which can be traded for more money.

It works well enough in theory and is frustratingly close to being playable. While I am not the target audience for real-time party auction games, this one loses points for going beyond being simply frenetic; players are jostling, getting in the way and quite likely to knock money into the wrong cups. It's especially painful for the auctioneer, who is expected to count down evenly while also bidding.

It's a clever idea but I never want to play it again.

Also, hideous components and unbelievably overpriced.

Really just not very fun, and waaaay overpriced for what you get (some cubes, five plastic cups, and 49 cards). We only got it because it was on sale for $23 and thought it might be worth trying. The game is usually around $33 online, and just to put that into perspective, you could get Seasons, Stone Age, Power Grid, Pandemic, or any number of great games with a lot more stuff for that price or less.

Not only that, but the game has a bad runaway leader snowball effect. If somebody gets a good set of cards early they can turn that into a lot more money and then keep buying cards to keep the other players from being able to get sets. This game will soon be going, going, gone from my collection.

Sold.

Great design with very simple components, there's nothing funnier that someone spending half their money without realising that no one put any other cubes in that cup. Also a brilliant game for making up your own stupid variant, I'm a particular fan of the throwing cubes version because of the amount of ridiculous combos of cards that people end up buying by accident.

Yikes. I played this game once, and, hopefully, never again. As a fellow reviewer, I respect Scott Nicholson very much, but I feel that many other reviewers are giving this game a pass based purely out of that respect.

This is barely a game. The designer relies on the players to make up their own rules as they go, which is a bit futile, since there's not enough here to make a good game. Frantically throwing cubes into cups sounds like something a bunch of kids do when they're bored. That does not constitute a good party game for adults. Especially when 20% of the game is just picking up the cubes that people drop and figuring out who actually acquired each card. Exciting!

Plus, the artwork is hideous (who puts their company's games into the artwork of another one of their games?), and the auction sign-thingie is cheap and will break right away. It's pretty essential to the game; maybe spend some extra time and effort getting it right?

Going, going, gone from my table forever.

Chaotic, fast-paced game. Really enjoyable. The auctioneer changes every round and can set the pace of the countdown, so one minute it's a race to throw cubes into any cup and the next it's a sedate and more tactical affair. I love this game but it has to be played with people who enjoy a bit of chaos and interaction. 

I've played with 3 and 4 players and it's better with 4. It might be a bit frustrating with 6 as there are only 5 lots to be auctioned every round but there are only 7 rounds in total and the game is often over in 15-20 minutes.

reminds me in this way of Cash and Guns: a good chaotic change of pace after a tile placing / cube pushing fest.  Guaranteed laughs and can lead to some judgement calls on sloppy cube drops, but lighten up and have some fun!

So much excitement! I got a chance to play the big version at BGG CON, and it was a blast.  After seeing the drinking game variant in action also, I had to go out and get the game myself.  It's great, manic fun.

It's not going to be a regular at your game night any time soon, but it's a great game to take with you to a party.

I like games with a simple ruleset, where the heart of the game comes from how the players interact with each other, and this is one of those kinds of games.  Auctions happen in real time with cubes that you drop into cups, and the auctioneer sets the pace of the auction while also participating in the auction.  Incentives are driven by how you sell back sets of cards, and your limited funds (if you're running out of cubes, you might have to sell back something you were hoping to keep longer for a larger payout), and it has a nice feel.

My main problem is the components of the game, and the large price tag for the components you get.  You get a deck of cards, some wooden cubes, a large "board" to stop the auctions, and five plastic cups, for an MSRP of $50.  It's ridiculous, especially when you consider that the board will easily begin to show wear within just a handful of games.

This one is pure silliness. Players have money which is represented by small wooden cubes and they use this money to bid on cards, all in an effort to collect sets. These sets are turned in for even more money (cubes). The twist is that the auctions happen in real time, in a period of roughly 10 seconds. You bid by throwing your cubes into a cup, each cup assigned to a random card or two. After a 10 count has been completed, whomever has the most cubes in each cup gets the cards assigned to that cup.

This ends up being a dexterity game, with some players trying to block the cups, while others try to slam dunk and some even try to throw fistfuls of cubes at the cups in hope of winning something. It's really ,really dumb.

And surprisingly amusing, certainly well worth having to kill a little time between heavies.

I'm a huge fan of Scott's work in the board gaming community.  Unfortunately, at my group's table, this game devolves into a chaotic frenzy of hands crashing into the center of the table and wood cubes splashing everywhere and and over-zealous auctioneer with a clumsy and forceful hand spilling all the auction cups.

A basic set collection game with bidding to try and win things to add to your sets. It's very light and fast, so it's good for when you don't want to explain rules. It doesn't see much play time.

Hilerous fun auction game. You throw your bid in cups before the time runs out. The one with most cubes in a cup wins the bid. Great fun.

Fun concept, but hard to determine what is and what isn't cheating. When is your hand in the way, and when are you just dropping cubes in a cup? 
Entertaining, but don't like the design of the object cards.

RATING: 4
BGG's wisdom says it's best at 2, and I agree, if nothing else than for what management of other player's positions you can accomplish compared to the 3 and 4p games. The disaster element of it is interesting, but ultimately forgettable. The best thing about it is the spacial element when firing off effects or building stuff. For that alone, it's worth a few plays, but nothing really made me come back to it over some of Georges' other offerings.

RATING: 7.5
It's a card game set in the same universe as Troyes, but despite the same artwork (and iconography....), and similar themes (red- military, white- clergy, yellow- peasant), it's a very different game, which is a good thing.  This is more different than San Juan is to Puerto Rico, with both games being very good (this and Troyes) in their own right.

Now that said, it is a card game, so luck of the draw can be a significant factor.  Gameplay runs like this: at the start of your turn, you can optionally build a card from your hand (requires money), and your area to build is limited to a 3x3 grid.  You can overbuild buildings, but this is not always the best play.  Then you take an action, using workers: 1) get money, 2) draw a card, 3) fight an event, 4) use a building.  The game ends when a certain number of events have been triggered and at least one player has built 2 prestige buildings AND their 3x3 grid is completed.  Keep in mind that the length of the game is variable and players can try to rush to the finish or not.

Points are scored by: 1) built buildings, 2) prestige buildings (and these score for the owner and all other players, although other players score at a lower level), 3) events that you have defeated.  The game appears to scale well 2-4, and plays very well as a relatively quick and portable 2er.  Definitely a very good follow up to Troyes.

I'd have given this a score of 7 otherwise, because it's quite accessible and hints at having depth, though I've only played it once. The score of 8 results from the short playing time and short rules: Easy to teach, fast to play.

EDIT: Rated down to a 7 now because the rulebook could have been structured better. The oversight is mainly my fault, but for having played this before, I had kind of a hard time going through the rules for a newbie to the game.

Really interesting game. I bought it very soon after I learned how to play.

I can't quite put my finger on it yet, but there is something very bland about the mechanics in this game. I'm not obsessed with theme but I wish it was more present in this game. I love the artwork, etc, but I have yet to feel totally invested in my medieval district/tableau.

I've written more negative than positive, which hides the fact that I remain fascinated by this game and really enjoy playing it. I can't wait to try Troyes now.

I was doing demos of Tounay at Origins and ended up playing it 9 times in total. The rules were a hard cold read for me without the components and even with, it took a couple of plays to get a good feel for it. (I am very much a player that needs a good run through to get the rules of something though, so it may not be hard to grasp for someone who enjoys reading rules. Reading through rules of new games is usually my husband's job.)
 
Pay attention to the bold print under the end of game play. I had someone else point out to me after playing Tournay a few times I was ending the game wrong because I overlooked the bold print below that stated the conditions of the end game. It could have been written more clearly I think without the bold print below. I would be interested to play with the advanced rules now that I have the base game and iconography down.

The relation to Troyes is strong with this one. Troyes does it better though. Tournay is probably one of those games that probably benefits from repeat plays. 

I wasn't really sure why my actions meant what they did, or how I could chain together effects into combos. Because of the card drawing mechanic it's difficult to come up with a strategy. The game becomes tactical at that point. 

None of this is bad, just it's competing for table time with games that are better at the same types of thinking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It feels like a card version of Troyes. It is a little bit different, but overwall the feel is similar. If this game lasted fewer than Troyes, I would justify playing Tournay, but the game length is just the same, and Troyes have so much more game in the box that I would rarely recommend this one.

For me Tournay sits in the shadow of its elder brother, Troyes.  I found Troyes innovative in its use of dice and satisfyingly complex in the way its different mechanisms slot together.  I'm not really in the market for a simplified re-make which, to a large extent, is what Tournay is.  Tournay does bring new elements in tableau building and in the significance of some spatial relations.  Otherwise, it's a familiar story of card combos and efficiency. Despite the criticisms, I think it's an OK game.

I liked Troyes' artwork and I like it again here.  If the icons in Troyes were sometimes headscratchers, Tournay's contrive to be equally opaque.  Production quality is fine.

Really interesting and a lot of fun. I enjoy the engine-building and the fact that you can, to a degree, choose a strategy early on and pursue it (more easily than you can in say RftG which has a similar feel). The race to the end gets pretty tense and it is exciting to see your plans come to fruition. 

Play with the advanced rules! 

I love the art for this game. Components are good quality. The iconography is intuitive and the card reference in the back of the rule book makes a good player aid if photocopied and given to other players.

I need to spend more time with the game to get acquainted with the strategies and the cards. Right now, it feels like a solid - though not extraordinary - tableau builder. It feels like you never have quite enough time to pull off mega-combos, but maybe that's the point.

A wonderful game in which you are building city districts of a Belgian city out of both buildings and characters which have powers and can influence other cards. I love the 'Events' that can challenge you or reward you, and also the variation in play when you use the 'expansion' cards or not. Thinky stuff, really impressive, it's no Troyes but a nice, slightly lighter alternative.

Initial - very tentative - rating, based on two 2-player game. Interesting gameplay; swift, though it can feel like a slog due to setbacks caused by events. Feels rather 'devoid of emotion', but not unappealing. Like the thematic fit with Troyes, for all that this is an entirely different game. Still uncertain how luck-based the game is. There's definitely more happening than you can influence... Invites more plays, though, which for the moment means I'm positive.
The symbology is not always very clear, and definitely doesn't feel intuitive.

Although I have a lot of sympathy for this small Belgian publisher, this game will probably never be played again on my table. A game from 30' to 60' took us more then 2 hours. An evening of discussions about rules is not my cup of tea. The rulebook is clear, the playeraids aren't. Secondly, there goes too much time in studying the cards you choose, this gave the game a lot of downtime and it's too complex to look for your own actions.

This game gives you the same, "Ah ha" moment that Troyes does when you get about 30-40% through, and figure out exactly what you're going. Not as meaty as Troyes, but a better introduction to the style of game for newcomers imo. In no way a gateway. Every game is tight, and contingent on how well you score from other players bonuses and keep them from scoring on yours.

Another good game (but not great) set in the universe of Troyes, one of my favorite games. In Tournay, you add cards to your hand from 9 different face down piles (belonging to 3 different colors). You acquire cards by adding workers of the correct color equal to the level of the deck you are taking from. The catch is you can "borrow" other players workers by paying them. Cards are then added to your tableau, which is a 3X3 square. There are locations that give you actions if you place the correct worker on them, characters that give bonuses to all cards in the same row or column (which adds a nice spatial element) or VP generating cards. You can build on top of other cards. Also, there are nasty events that are triggered when certain cards are found. They can cause you to lose coins, lay down workers, etc. Events can be fought by paying money and/or workers. They are then added to your hand as ramparts. Ramparts can be discarded to stop a future bad event from targeting you. Easy, right? It really is, but the rulebook is rather obtuse in describing the game. Also, there is a level of symbology that rival RFTG here, so be prepared to check the player aid about 10,000 times. This is fun, though and I would play it if asked.

Troyes is to Tournay as Puerto Rico is to San Juan.  That's pretty close, though I think PR and SJ are probably a bit more similar than Troyes and Tournay.  Tournay is a decent game and works well as a tableau building card game style of these games.

After three plays, I feel pretty confident that this is a pretty good game I'd play more but not one I'll ever latch onto.

You really need 2 to 3 games for getting a thought for the good and effective card combinations in your city quarter. For two or three turns at start, use level I cards! They are cheap and you get speed in the game when you build fast 3 cards in your quarter. Unusual game style and feeling. Played now the full version, where you start with 9 Denars and only one of each meeple type.
I wouldn´t it compare to Troyes, it should be better compared to St.Petersburg or London. Only recommended for expierenced players, grounded for the many symbols you must keep in mind. Nice gift: the expansion cards are also included.

I bought Tournay because I heard it was similar to Race for the Galaxy, one of my favorite games.

It is not quite as good nor varied, but it is a lot fun. It's fairly short, involves a spatial element which I appreciate, and has a decent amount of variety.

The symbology isn't as intuitive as RftG, but isn't as bad as I heard it was

Looks like Troyes and icons on the cards are almost as disturbing as in Troyes as well. Game flows pretty smoothly though and there's definitely more depth in the game that can be seen during the first play. I also would have liked to see more points in the game in general (I would have liked to see more in my side of the table as well but that's a different story) - now we saw scores between 15-20 points and that's not much of an achievement in a game that lasts for 45-60 minutes.

I'm eager to give it another go and hopefully pretty quickly so that the rules and cards we managed to figure out are still clearly in my mind.

RATING: 8.5
Awesome reimplementation of already awesome game. I've only played two-player, but it really shines as a two-player game. The game changes dramatically depending on which color you focus on (yellow=money, red=warfare, white=diversity and combo-making). The game also rewards repeated plays, as you learn which cards are in which decks. Sometimes you hope that the town criers never come out, sometimes you really want them to to capitalize on their bonuses. It's such an interesting and diverse gamespace that this tiny game, which can fit inside a single large deckbox, has dozens and dozens of satisfying plays in it.

There is a significant issue with the iconography, which is so obtuse and ridiculous that it often generates peals of laughter when players try to figure them out by themselves. Unfortunately, this can also frequently lead to the misinterpretation of card powers, which can cause serious frustration because players play a whole game thinking a card can do something it can't. I really think this could have been a big hit if Pearl and Z-Man had just produced different-language editions of this game, with text on the cards; as it is, this will not probably appeal to many people. Too bad, because it's awesome!

Like all variable-power/card driven games, this takes a lot of referring to the rules/reference sheet to work out what's what.  The problem, on first play at least, was that it goes on for the whole game.  That's probably the main reason the game seems rather slow, and rather too long.  As ever, further plays should speed up (though it's hard to see us hitting the 60 mins on the box) and I suspect that would improve my experience of the game and my rating, though it's possibly that further play would confirm my suspicion that it's a tad too random, particularly when it comes to end-game scoring.

This was one of the games from this year's Essen Spiel for which I had high, high hopes. In fact, I have a pre-order coming from overseas whenever [company=12884][/company] gets their production problems fixed. After playing at LobsterTrap, however, I am likely to cancel my order.

I am generally not a fan of Tableau games.  Nor am I a fan of simple combinatorial games. [thing=105037][/thing] is, of course, both.  Perhaps I was simply expecting too much in thinking that the designers of [thing=73439][/thing] (which somehow made buckets of dice palatable in a Euro game) could recreate that magic in a tableau card game.  If I were likely to play such a game, I suppose I would continue to explore [thing=28143][/thing], which I rate a mere [BGCOLOR=#9999FF][b][COLOR=#9999FF]_[/COLOR]6[COLOR=#9999FF]_[/COLOR][/b][/BGCOLOR]. [thing=105037][/thing] does nothing to threaten that preference.

There is a slight spatial element to the game, reminiscent of last year's [thing=66362][/thing].  As some of you may know all-too-well, I disliked that game, and the similarities consequently left an unpleasant taste in my mouth that might not be fully [thing=105037][/thing]'s fault.  Nonethless, the best parts of the the game were really just simplified cute pushing exercises, which we are already all-too-familiar with in this hobby. 

At the end of the day, I simply see no spark here that would make me want to dive back into the game. It is ultimately yet-another title in a gaming genre that I do not enjoy. It lacks that certain special something needed, for me at least, to explore the game further. I am inclined to give it a [b][BGCOLOR=#ff66cc][COLOR=#ff66cc][size=5].[/size][/COLOR]4[size=7].[/size]5[COLOR=#ff66cc][size=5].[/size][/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/b].

It's a neat little exercise in how to exploit your area and to get points off the final buildings with two downsides.

Hunting for the buildings or characters that will really pay off for you may never happen. You may just never draw them. Making strategy in this game a question of lucky draws. Not ideal. So, more of a tactical game, which is rough considering the level three buildings pay off strategy not tactics. This is a tension that is very luck based.

Nothing exciting happens in this game. It's a game of inches. I gain an inch here, and inch there, oh look the game is over. In a game where you inch your way to something cool (like your farm in Agricola), that can work, but the end of this game is just count up your points. You haven't built anything.

Interesting game, but much lighter than Troyes and undoubtedly inferior. It plays too slow, e.g. draft white I, draft white I, build, get more money, build, refresh workers, combo; in 5 rounds and supposing you drafted a combo.
I have concerns about the drafting mechanism, maybe introduces too much luck in an essentially strategic game. Specially with the 3rd level prestige buildings.

It is a good hand-management game, but not the quintessential card game full of awesomeness (as Glory to Rome is)

Quite a decent card game. But there are some sharp corners to the rules. To the point that if I forget them (which I am wont to do), I feel nonplussed about going back and figuring them out again. It's one of those games with cards that do zillions of things. Kind of like Troyes (but very different), except that now there are many more cards to consult the reference to see exactly what they mean. It needs to be played often enough that the tax of doing that is a fairly low overhead, but sadly I have not been able to play it that frequently. It's not a great "once in a blue moon" game.

This is a gem. 

Finally picked it up 3 or 4 days ago after humming and hawing for 2 to 3 years, played a dozen or so 2p games already (I think I've sneaked a win twice). First game was a bit of wash but from second play on when we had a feel for the rules and the cards it has been superb. 2p "long" games take about 30 to 40 minutes.

Really highly recommended but be sure to download one of the text files from BGG that describes all the cards, really smooths things out. 

Liked Troyes, but Tournay is the better of the 2 IMHO.

It has been my experience that if I like a boardgame, I tend to dislike the cardgame; and vice versa. I didn’t really like Troyes, which I consider to be too much trouble for what it is eventually worth. So when Tournay came out, I trusted in past experience and put the game on my radar. Now I [i]know[/i] that Tournay isn’t really Troyes—The Cardgame; it’s more like a game in the Troyes-universe, to coin some popular buzz anno 2011. What did genuinely attract me to this title was the fact that it featured tableau building not unlike Glen More which I liked quite a lot.

Tournay has a lot of things going against it, the worst of which is rules complexity. There are lots of tiny little details and icons which kinda make sense after a while, but before that they're just a pain. Having someone around to explain the rules is a big plus. Only once you begin to get comfortable can you start thinking about strategies and tactics and the like. The cards offer a lot of variability it would seem, and a big part of it all is joining them up in your little tableau engine. Most of them appear to be useful one way or the other. But the real business is in lining them up for the important VP countdown of level 3-buildings. Here too something odd occurs: these buildings count for all players, and this necessitates keeping tabs on your opponents and their plans and possibilities. It's far from easy to do this to any meaningful extent, and that's assuming that it [i]can[/i] be done to any meaningful extent. At this moment in my play count I'm only just becoming sufficiently proficient to simply play cards and not think about them much. Now is really the time that Tournay will show what it's made of.

It only took about a game or ten to get there. That is as far as regular boardgames are concerned a long time indeed. Given that Tournay managed to get this far, after a disastrous start at the Spiel it was presented, I'm giving it a generous rate.

I like this better than Troyes. (which it has very little in common with). Not only is it easier to pronounce, but it's quick and has a lot of fun cards.
Getting the extra pawns is a little problematic, though. If you get the right cards early on, you're at a big advantage. The advanced variant fixes it a little, but it just turns into an early race for pawns, then the game.
Even with that problem, I like the game.

End-game scoring is quite unbalanced. This one is nothing like Troyes, its predecessor (well, except for the artwork). This one forces players to use all three color types (red, white, yellow) and adds a spatial element in buildings on a 3x3 grid. There is no central shared board, so you have to look at each player's individual tableau in order to see what they have, which slows down play considerably. Overall, I will not recommend this game.

I think I am going to like this game. First of two initial games at one sitting was a mess. Second game it clicked within a few turns. The trouble I found was learning a new system of iconography for the cards. This coupled with understanding the tableau of the city you are building (3x3 grid). It's a lot to take it. So I think the third game and onward will be far more rewarding when playing.

My complaints about Tournay are similar to my ones about Barons; while there are some interesting ideas involved in it, the game is simply just not dense enough in meaningful decisions and to work for me as a complex card game. There are the sorts of things that I normally like in games, combos to build and meaningful spatial elements, but neither the combos or the spatial elements were engaging enough for me to want to play the game again. 

As a caveat, I will note that my single play of this game had a fairly large rules error, and that playing it again with that rules issue again may prove to raise my rating. However, even with that error in mind, I doubt this one would go much higher than a 6 for me. There just is not enough going on for it to be something I am going to purposefully seek out plays.

Players are trying to acquire an engine of cards, which represent buildings and people, in a 3x3 square, themed in medieval Tournay.  Takes a lot of familiar elements from Troyes - especially the meeples that can be used out of your opponent's pools - and thankfully, it's a much faster experience.  Probably a fine game, but these days there is so many "fine" games, that this one doesn't pop out from the crowd.

It's Troyes without the dice.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, since this card game version should move along nicely.   Recalling workers requires an action, and that seems to be all the rage these days.   While Troyes might be the better game on a technical level, this one is less AP-prone and quicker which are definite advantages.  So it's hard to say if one is really better than the other.

Review of Playability: [thread=733711][/thread]

My review doesn't really talk about the game, so I'll do that here.  Tournay is a tableau based worker placement game.  It includes an expansion and has two modes of play: Advanced and Normal.  I strongly recommend Advanced as per my review.  What makes Tournay different?  Well, the spacial element in where you place your buildings in your tableau can matter based on characters you add to your tableau.  In addition to that, workers that you place are stuck where they are until you use one of your precious actions to retrieve them.  There is very little downtime in this game when you understand what the card iconography means.  A turn simply consists of optionally playing a card and doing one action.  It shares a lot of elements with Troyes as I've also indicated in my review to the point that I would almost call this Troyes the card game.  Basically a faster, less complex version of Troyes.

This type of game is not my cup of tea, but Tournay is not unenjoyable - I prefer it to some other games of the type, like Agricola for example.

The 'type' is a game that can't be played well until one knows what all the cards do and mean, and while I understand this journey is precisely what some people enjoy, I find it rude for a game to demand multiple plays just so I can understand the components.  I don't get to game all that often, so I can't accept a game that demands multiple plays to get to strategy step 1.  I want a game, not a job.

Despite numerous annoying graphic design flaws and mechanical design fiddliness, this is an excellent tableau-building card game with fresh ideas, an open feel, and elements uncommon to the its genre. I've played it a lot on BGA.

Tactics aren't just about blocking or denial, and the strategy isn't just about pivoting between income and VP, or comboing for VP. The spatial activations are fresh, and the (usually oppressive) event cards distinguish Tournay from a typical tableau builder. I really like the strategic interaction of the differential-VP scoring.

The "board" is comically unnecessary and the iconography fairly bad:
* art is prioritised over clarity
* the arrow looks like a greater-than sign
* "gain money from event card" looks like gain money
* "all other players" icon for scoring is inconsistent with "all players" icon on the Courthouse
and the references explain arbitrary icon phrases rather than the component icons.

Worse, the rules are annoyingly fiddly (I have read through all 8 pages of rules forum posts):
* Two kinds of draw action
* Two kinds of draw effect on cards (the normal draw actions, which is either of the two above, and a draw-two-cards action that is different)
* Hand limit of 4 cards
* Two kinds of event cards (one with increasing cost, but no indication thereof)
* Limit of 12VP per prestige building, with no indication on the card
* Ability to build duplicates of level I and II buildings, but not level III, with no indication on the cards
* Game-end trigger: on the start player's turn, two players have built out their city, or one player has and there have been enough Town Criers
* Final simultaneous build
* It's completely unclear that you can pay with covered-over cards

These make the game a nightmare to teach cleanly.

I discovered Tournay in February 2012 in a 3 players game. As a fan of Troyes, i told myself that i had to try it, even if the games have nothing in common except their artwork universe. The verdict was definitive. I did not like the game: i found it very mechanical and super dry.

Most recently, as i made my wishlist for Essen 2013, i read some very interesting things about Bruxelles 1893, the next Pearl Games. This brought me Tournay to my mind again. Why Troyes's publisher took the risk of publishing a game like Tournay the year after Troyes (i mean in term of weight/positioning/segmentation) ? I certainly missed something and judged it a little too hastily.

I decided to buy the game before my holidays. After 7 games in 12 days, my opinion has changed dramatically, to the point of considering Tournay as one of the best card/combo game of my library. Why?

1) the game has an excellent interest/playing time ratio: it is a race and this prevents from playing the same martingale for hours while allowing players to develop their strategy.

2) the straightforwardness of the gameplay: only 1 action to choose from 5 quick and simple actions. This minimizes the waiting time between rounds and helps to keep involved. It also reinforces the feeling of race and makes the game very dynamic.

3) everything is a matter of timing and decision.
- when to draw ? where ? why ? draw early at level III to guide your strategy ? build a money engine ? build a draw engine ?
- fight against events and defend yourselves with walls ?
- stack yours cards for more points vs. rush the endgame ?

4) false sense of randomness and lack of control. This is perhaps the most virulent grip i had about Tournay (at least for 2 and 3 players configurations).
- the draw mechanic allow one to rationalize his choice given the knowledge of the decks compositions (each color has a purpose, cards in 2 copies, the first card is visible...)
- it is possible to counter a player with Ballista to defend your city. Sure, this will slow your development down but it is a matter of choice and priorities. Hence decision.
- a building does not come out or it was built by another player ? There is always the solution to get the Bridge/Road/Port.
- not enough manpower ? there is always the solution to hire opponent's workers.

I find now that luck is finely tuned and, oddly, is necessary to control the game. This is a game that requires to give it time, to insist, to play games in row in order to enjoy all its flavors.

Essen 2011 (1 game experience): If you think that if you like Troyes you will like Tournay, think again! After the fantastic Troyes this surely came as a big disappointment for me. Contrary to the first there is hardly any chance to develop a strategy.
Since you cannot use your fellow players' played out cards but only your own (well, with one tine exception) you are srewed if you lack the ones, out of which you can make good combinations.

Works well enough, but I don't really think I could play this repeatedly as I don't see how to play better. I don't like the fact that scoring cards are present twice in each level 3 deck. You get to pick these cards relatively late in the game and they can go totally against your strategy, so if you draw twice the same card and it doesn't work for you, you pretty much lost a very expensive turn... (Yup, happened to me. ;))

Couple of very interesting mechanics though, and play goes very smoothly.

Very underestimated here at BGG, IMO. I've played this at www.boardgamearena.com and have enjoyed it each time.

It's a card/tableu game (e.g. Race for the Galaxy, Seasons, Rome, etc.), which means each player must put down, in front of them, cards (representing buildings and persons) paying them by different methods (mostly coins). The goal is to develop a good combination of cards to score the maximum amount of prestige (victory points).

I'm waiting for my copy to arrive these days!

Tournay is a fairly uninspired attempt to cash in on the success of Troyes last year if you ask me. You buy cards, you play cards to your city district, and you use your workers to activate those buildings in order to optimise resource allocation and/or score points. In between there is a lot of idle time when your workers run out, when events damage your buildings and delay your plans, or when you simply don't draw any useful cards. To properly exploit card combinations you need to know the deck and get a little lucky, and the events add another hardly plannable factor. Meh!

This game has a few problems:
- Its mechanisms are quite unique - it takes a play or two to get used to them.
- Definitely the icons/ player aids which take a play or two to get used to them as well.
- You need a few plays logged to really understand all the prestige scoring options and ways to get the final victory points.

The most important point that holds this game back in my opinion:

- The multiple configurations the game comes with. Don't get me wrong this really improves  variability and long term playability - still it is a barrier to learn the game.

At a first glance, apart from the mechanisms and icons it looks like a fairly straight forward and simple game if you play the basic game and without the expansion cards. The basic game (starting with 2 meeples/ no option to hire new meeples apart from some card abilities) really is not that interesting - I can say: "OK then simply play the "advanced" version right from the start." I am not really sure about this: The basic game is considerably shorter and you can get used to the mechanisms and icons in about half the time of an advanced game.

After this first hurdle comes the next (for some at least):
If you're only playing with the non-expansion cards, the game is almost without any interaction but still a very nice multiplayer solitaire engine builder experience that plays in an hour. Nothing too special or to write home about, just a solid card game with some interesting twists.
Real player interaction (attacking other players directly, using more of their abilities, stealing money from them) really comes with the expansion cards. Once they are fully introduced, you're playing this game to its full potential and you can see the real beauty of interactive cards and the support of so many different play styles in just a small set of cards this game offers.

But to get to that point, it really takes commitment and a few plays - it's definitely not for the Cult of the New croud that might get over the first hurdle (playing the advanced game) but then either be overwhelmed by too many options and cards because they mixed all of the expansion and base cards or missing player interaction because they only used the base cards.

Love the artwork and the simple gameplay form. Wasn't a big fan of this designer team's last game, Troyes, but Tournay is a nice take on card drafting and worker placement. A nice, lean system, that was quite enjoyable to play. With that being said, if any game screams for a complete dump of the symbol system, here it is. I get using symbols can be efficient. But I also understand it's a cost-cutter for international versions. The functional mechanics for each card can get complex enough that the symbol system is just a place-card for looking the shit up in the rulebook. So boo on that. Plus, the rulebook has plain mistakes, spelling errors, etc. no excuse for that stuff out of a professional game design team. This game is an '8,', but the terrible symbol system denotes it one spot.

There may be a good game hidden away behind the confusing iconography. However, the game just never seems to kick in as players are constantly having to check each (beautifully illustrated) cards abilities.
The tableau building option at first appears interesting, but isn't that flexible  and tends to send players down a very narrow path of focusing on a particular colour of card.

I will stick with Troyes.

The buzz: "Don't expect Troyes and you'll love it."

The reality: This is wearing all of Troyes' clothes, so any confusion there is hardly the player's fault. It features the same artist AND the same red/white/yellow division of military/religious/civil cards AND the same three-level card play AND the same shared negative events AND the same "pay to steal opponent resources" trick AND...

Anyway. I'm hanging on to this in case I do get the chance to play it when I'm not thinking about Troyes at all. But be aware that it will remind you of Troyes every step of the way and yet not (in my experience) satisfy a player who likes being reminded of Troyes.

I like this game probably more than it deserves but the card interactions, the press your luck with drawing cards/triggering events, and the interactions between players, to me, creates a very engaging and tense experience.

As mentioned loads of places, the iconography can be a bit obtuse to dig your way through, but the Z-Man version of the game provides a very good player aid and it becomes more intuitive and smooth as time goes on.

Fun game, not as great as it's father (Troyes), but still a decent one.

I have yet to use the extra cards for experienced players to see if my rating will go up or down. Right now it's somewhat new and interesting, but I already have a bad feeling about the replayabilty when it comes to the starting cards.

This one falls pretty flat for me. For some, it will scratch the eurogame itch when you only have an hour or less to spare. But for me, that puts this in the same category as 51st State or Targi, both of which I personally prefer.

Tournay is blessed and cursed with being a card-game version of its older sibling Troyes. It is blessed with the lateral attention that might trickle down from its eldest peer (alongside all the other well-regarded Euro games on which Xavier George has worked); however, it is also cursed by the expectations that it is at once similar yet meaningfully different. Short story is: it's significantly different -- Tournay is not Troyes (even if it is set with similar art, workers, end-game goals, events, Euroglyphics, etc). However, Tournay defines itself with its interesting card-based tableau-building (instead of dice-management): making the game about creating spatially-dependent productive synergies and being tactically responsive throughout. The events also come about randomly (once in each deck of 10 cards), so one can do some planning towards them or can bait them on through digging through decks, or even work to avoid them altogether by digging through already event-ed decks. These differences makes the whole game pop in a meaningful way reminding that Tournay is not its older brother Troyes.

I liked this SO much better than its similar-looking cousin.  It's a card-combo game, which is the sort of thing I usually enjoy. Each of the three types of cards tends to feed into other cards of the same type, which can lead you to paint yourself into a corner. Still not sure I am a fan of the scoring system. (1 play)

Tournay has neat mechanics. I loathe the fact that the cards are have a hard to read font and they also have symbology that in not intuitive--my buddy's copy has a binder player aid that describes what each card does. This player reference must be constantly grabbed and referenced. That is bad, time consuming, not fun. Also, my second play was a two player game. I enjoyed the game much more with three players. So this is actually a good game that would be better with repeated plays and an existing understanding what the cards do. Having to constantly read the card effects reference for every card is a HUGE drag.

I'm surprised I don't hear more about this game. It is a very nice compliment to Troyes. I appreciate how it maintains the feel of Troyes with totally different mechanics and I like the little bit of spatial reasoning with the tableau building. For me, it sits in a sweet spot of length and weight games in my collection along with San Juan, Targi, Jambo, Innovation, Guildhall, All Creatures, etc to provide a nice, shorter, more casual game night with my wife. Maybe that's the problem - it's nice but not amazing.

Best with four players. Player turns move quickly. Middling player interaction by the middle of the game. Troublesome symbols (a bit like Troyes). Need regular play to get familiar with the cards.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (January 2014)

Very reminiscent of Troyes, in fact, this is the reason I bought the game. I really like it. The rules are very easy to teach, however the icons make the game go slow until all the players understand them (it comes with great players aids, but the icons are uninspired and confusing at first). The gameplay offers some interesting decisions (Do I go for civil, religious or military?, Do I need more money etc.) in a short timeframe. It has some randomness in the drawing of the cards, however I feel I can react to it so it doesn’t bother me (but I´m not completely sure about this). The art is great, and Tourney flows relatively quickly once you understand the icons. 

For now, I don’t have anything bad to say about the game and I want to play again soon. I still enjoy Troyes more than Tournay.

Current Rating: 6.5
[hr]
After more plays I can say I have had fun with some Tournay games while others have been very boring. The rulebook is confusing in some instances and it is definitively at its best as a 2 player game. I want to play with the advanced mode soon as I think it reduces the luck of the cards when recruiting new meeples of any color.

Still I like it a lot and plan to play it soon again.

Current Rating: 6.5

Rating (originally 5) removed as it seems we were playing with a significant rules error which greatly detracted from the experience.  Will try this title again with correct rules.

Edit:  I've finally played with the correct game end condition.  It's better to be sure, with a proper narrative arc.  I'm still not that into it though, to be honest.  I'm surprised to find that the simple dice math and division of Troyes is a substantial part of the game's appeal for me, and a game that is like Troyes in some ways but doesn't have that mathiness falls flat.

I knew I would love this game before I ever played it. And I do, very much. It is really a great game. Ames however, hated it. She won, but she said it feels like a "I don't know what to do" mechanic just like Troyes. I think she just let the similar art and feel rule her opinion, cause she really hates Troyes another game I adore and don't get to play ever.

Somebody has thrown the elements of Troyes up in the air but they didn't assemble correctly again and the dice got lost. While Pearl Games' premier game was a fine-tuned positive surprise, Tournay left me with the impression that the pressure on Pearl for developing a succesful second game was to high and they ran into a dead end. It could be inexperience with the game but in our play the pacing was off, especially in regard to the external attacks and the end game timing. It's nice that they have reused the great art scheme from Troyes but I'll stay with the big brother.

Best with 2-3 players, nice fast playing Euro with some interaction and scoring objectives that benefit other players. Love card based tableau builders like this.

From the designer of Troyes, this little card game shares the artwork style and theme of Troyes but the gameplay is of course very different. The spatial element of the tableau of cards you are building (a 3x3 grid) is really nice, every card you build either has effects based on neighbouring cards or are worker placement spots that you and other players can use for their effects. Really cool little game.

This game is AWFUL the first time you encounter the card symbols especially if no-one has printed off one of the card inventories.  Working fromn the symbols alone leaves far too much room for interpretation - we spent more time discussing what a card meant than we did playing the game.  Second time around was better because we had someone who reckoned he knew what every card meant and the other 2 of us chose not to argue with him!

This game really shines with 4 players and the "advanced" rules. If you have played and thought that the decisions were not that interesting, play it again with 4 people and the "advanced" rules!

For some the learning curve might be a bit steep, because of the icons. But once you get the semantics, you can start building nice combos.

Even though this game is lighter than Troyes, I don't think this is Troyes light. In the same way that RTFG isn't Puerto Rico light.

It's Troyes enough to grab me right away, but still very much a game of its own, so having Troyes in your collection is no excuse for not getting this.

Well... the first try was an interesting experience: we didn't play it to the end, because the used symbols were too difficult to understand. All the time went just for trying to understand what was the effects of the cards. This one needs a better rules or at least you need to go through all the cards to makes things easier. We'll see in the future is this going to be good or bad game.

I was pretty sure I'm going to like Tournay more than I like Troyes (which is not a bad game but its core dice mechanism feels a bit broken, even though all the rest of the game tries to fix it). And it's just what I expected. Lots of ideas common with Troyes but the game is rather different. I like it, even though it can be called JASE (in every second game you buy cards for your display to use them, activate your men etc.) so there are lots of games using more or less the same elements. Still it's a nice one, although the rules could have been written more clear.

Pretty good card based game.  You are building a village on a 3x3 gird of cards, with different cards having adjacency interactions and a worker placement component for activating those cards for effects.  The art is from the same artist as Troyes but those are otherwise completely unrelated games.  It's a fast gamer game with good depth that's significantly different from all the RftG clones out there.  This is the game "Baron" should have been.  Certainly worth a try.

After two plays, I have discovered that I have no idea how to do well with this game.  However, there is plenty of interesting decisions to make that keep me wanting to come back and revisit the title.  This is a card game that is all about combinations so playing several times and getting familiar with the cards and combos will generally be advisable in order to play well.  I still much prefer Troyes over this title, but Tournay will play much more quickly (1 hour) and I find that trying to put together effective combinations in my 3x3 town grid to be quite interesting.  One needs to find a fine balance between drawing cards, income, and moving on to prestige buildings (which grant lots of points to the person who builds it and less points to everyone else).

I enjoy this game a lot. The big complaint is the iconography. I got over it, but it is definitely something that gets in the way of teaching the game.

Seems boring and random at the beginning of the game, and is also confusing due to all the symbols.  But, after you build a critical nucleus of complimentary cards, you start to develop a strategy and it starts to become fun.  The perspective art is incompatible with the medieval diapered art style -- it could have been a lot more attractive with better art.

Excellent game. Combines Tableau Building and Worker Placement with a dash of Crisis Management. This game is way underrated as everyone was expecting Troyes the Card Game.

A strong mid-weight Euro disguised as a card game. Players have their own worker placement board and build up the board to gain more actions. There's a lot to think about and plenty of player interaction especially since you can pay them to use their actions. Additionally there are events that come into play play to keep you on your toes.

First play was very rough. The symbology here is worse than Race for the Galaxy and that is not hyperbole. I found Race fairly straightforward, honestly, but I had to look up every single card in Tournay and its expansion. I'd definitely like to play again with some knowledge of the cards, which I suspect will cut playtime in half, and in that case I will enjoy it. Worth a second play, anyway.

Perhaps I was one of many [b][GameID=73439][/b] fanboys who was expecting the card game version of that game and that prejudiced me against this title (they shouldn't have made the artwork identical to [b][GameID=73439][/b] then).  I gave it a few chances and just found it to be yet another card tableau building game with difficult to follow symbols and a strategy heavily reliant on finding just the right combos of cards to make things work.  Unfortunately, this section of my profile is littered with those types of games (I'm looking at you, [b][GameID=28143][/b]!) so this game's fate was all but sealed.

and it's another hit!! It was called a "Mini-Troyes" but it's different and good enough on it's own... it's a great great game that I played HORRIBLY!!! 

The mechanics are simple but the choices are many... and the Events are harsh!!!

The combo making machine is gigantic and it's pretty cool to try to make them work

And it's also a pretty fast game... it can be played in 30 minutes!!

It has everything to be a huge hit and I have the feeling it flies a little to under the radar of most gamers... a game that deserves more attention without a doubt!

The main issue with the game are the symbols on the cards, for a good-fast card game to work it has to be intuitive. Tournay is not. New players will always play poorly. Players that know the cards and their combos-effects may enjoy the game at full capacity, but i'm not always in the mood to play such an abstract concept.

I find this an awkward and unusual game, less intuitive than the similarly themed Troyes, and the artwork on the cards is confusing and unsightly whereas Troyes is quite beautiful. That said, it's like no other card game and I think it will grow on me.

UPDATE: The basic game is really only good for learning the mechanics; it's rather dull. I'm finding Tournay a more interesting game with fewer citizens at the start and with the extra cards in the deck.

That said, still not a patch on Troyes. The game resembles Spyrium, another game based on a 3x3 card grid, in that its cards are completely flavourless engines for gaining deniers, actions, etc. -- By contrast, the cards for Troyes have character: they do quirky, interesting things (like the Diplomat, who allows you to deal with disasters on multiple fronts as long as you have enough Influence; or the Templar, who transforms a solitary white cube into a military juggernaut).

FURTHER UPDATE: Yeah, don't think I'll play this again.

This is a fun game with some interesting choices, even though there is nothing really groundbreaking about how it plays. I like the mechanic of player-specific worker placement locations that the game offers. I also appreciate the fact that my wife and I followed very different strategies but ended up with similar scores, so that seems to indicate the game should be well-balanced.

The art is pretty distinctive, and I like it quite a bit.

Tournay combines the building of card combinations with the use of meeples to restrict which cards may be drawn and which cards may be placed. This cannot hide the fact that each players builds his or her own tableau, causing the game to be too much of a solitaire puzzle exercise.

I love Troyes a lot, but this is not Troyes. 

Disregarding any thematic similarity and treat it as a new title, the basic framework is actually pretty good using the advanced rule. The choice is interesting, particularly when you place them, paying your opponent for his worker when you really need to use an action, and calling them back.

It's the cards that seems to hold it back. Luck in the cards is an issue, though it is one I can stand. The lack of variety is what kills it. The cards just aren't interesting. 

The game isn't bad, the tableau building and worker placement aspect is done pretty neatly. The cards are the problem.

UPDATE - After playing this for 20+ times in BGA, I've raised its rating slightly. It's much deeper than I thought, but the lack of variety makes the game less replayable. New cards can definitely help, though.

From the designers of Troyes, is a card game. You start the game with red, yellow and white workers. You can draw cards with them or earn money. Players are playing cards down into a 3 X 3 grid to earn VPs. When you draw cards from a deck, town criers can activate events, which can be beneficial or bad. 

The game ends when someone fills their district with 9 cards and enogh prestige buildings. 

It's a fun game, and rating likely to rise with more plays.

What a fascinating and delightful game. 
Bundles together many elements I enjoy: card drafting, tableau building, and worker placement. 

The art style is what caught my eye originally!

Woefully, a poorly designed iconography and not-that-helpful player aid held this back from gaining public ground upon release. If you take the time to learn it though (three games or so) you’ll find a tidy little game that holds skill and chance in a balance. Seriously; we play this about every two to three meet ups in my one gaming group.

First impression (4 players): I really like the graphical style of this game (and Troyes). This time the game was a bit more to my liking as I wasn't that impressed by Troyes in general. There were some annoying features here like how the timing of town criers can really mess your game and in general I'm not that big fan of these games were knowing what sort of cards there are available makes pretty big difference. Especially here were there is 9 different piles to choose from and you must plan a bit ahead when going for level 3 cards where the big points are.

Game where the player creates a point engine by combining different buildings and characters. Nothing new so far... The twist here is that there is another variable: the spatial layout. The layout in which you place your cards has a meaning, and it is a very important one!
Healthy dose of interaction since it is possible to use other players meeples and buildings. The length of the game is not known at the start, which brings in an interesting factor of not knowing exactly how much time you have left to fine-tune your point engine.
Great artwork.

Taking Troyes and making a more palatable (to me) card game version. Turns are quick as you gradually use up your meeples to do only one thing each turn - acquire cards, get money, etc. Use the money to put out more cards, use meeples to activate them. And there's lots of different powers to find combos in, and that's the name of the game. Find the combos that generate more meeples and money - your engine - and then search for and get out the big VP scoring cards for the end. The good news is that it's the same feel as Troyes but done in probably half the time, and probably at half the retail cost as well. And while there can be some meeple stealing, it didn't feel nearly as frustrating as I found it in Troyes, so the whole thing feels more enjoyable. Having said that, it's fiddly because turns are so incremental, and having explored it and seeing its potential, I'm still not that enthused about exploring its potential, seeing just another card-combo-tableau type game which is done more elegantly in games like San Juan, Race For The Galaxy and the like.

Tournay is a card game that's thematically and artistically similar to its predecessor, Troyes.  Here, players are trying to play cards to their personal 3x3 grid; these cards generally provide either action spaces for workers or bonuses for using nearby action spaces.  Like in Troyes, you can pay other players for temporary use of their workers, which may or may not interfere with their plans.  There are also event cards that mess with players in various ways at random points in the game (the event cards are laid out so you can see them coming); these events can be defeated but are immediately replaced with another event.  Finally, there are big buildings that provide lots of end-game points--like in Troyes, they designate one thing to be scored for all of the players (but double for the player that has the building).  Even though card drawing was generally two-pick-one, I found that luck of the draw played a big part in this game.  It was often difficult to find cards that worked in a particular situation.  Additionally, since you don't know what end-game buildings you or others will have until the very end of the game, it's really hard to know what you're working toward.

Card game version of Troyes. Card drafting (no dice this time) and for combo/engine building. Plays well with 2, supports multiple strategies and has varied play through. Poor iconography to determine how each card functions In the similar vein of Race for the Galaxy, San Juan, but we happen to favor the medieval city narrative/theme.

This is a really fun card game by the makers of Troyes. In fact, as you can see, the art is of the same style. It has a lot of similar properties, but it's dice-less and focuses more on building a nice tableau and using your workers to activate the cards. I played this 2 player, which definitely felt like a sweet spot for it. I'll try it with more, but I'm keeping it because of the superb 2 player experience. One issue was that the game is similar enough in style to Troyes, that my friend says playing the game just reminded him of how he wants to play more Troyes. It may have been better for them to go with a different looking theme, so that the two games might not be so closely compared.

This is a weird one. It has a very short rulebook, your turns are simple and short, and you can use other players' meeples as a weapon, so it's not just a game of "you build your city and I build mine; meet back here in 45 minutes and we'll compare scores." The spatial effects rely on a compact grid, so you're not overwhelmed with choices on your turn. The game moves along briskly, there are a few levers to pull, and you get the satisfaction of watching your city grow and be staffed with the usual melange of Medieval artisans and privileged white people, if you're into that sort of thing. There's a bit of lookahead with the events and how to plan for them (if at all).

However, this game does suffer from Indistinguishable Tableau Syndrome, a very common Euro condition whereby each player's individual play area looks surprisingly the same as everyone else's. In Tournay's case, everyone will have a 3x3 grid in front of them; figuring out whose is "Better" also involves interpreting icons that are positively [i]dreadful[/i], only this time they're upside down. I only play this every few months, but even at that pace, no one ever internalizes the icons. Odds are excellent that you'll be passing the player aid around every time you play it to figure out what the buildings do. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Similarities to Troyes in that you balance between civil, religious and military, that you have events to deal with and that the strategy adjusts depending on which cards come out on the next draw.

Currently prefer this to Troyes when choosing between the two. Plays faster and it's lighter, yet with the same level of interest (for me anyway). Also does a good job of  maintaining the medieval theme. Troyes-Lite.

The game works well, but I feel that there is too much luck in the building card draws, especially given how short the game is -- there isn't much chance for luck to average out, and you don't really have control over what kind of engine you build.  You just draw some cards and use whatever synergy you find.  The game is somewhat pleasing, but ultimately forgettable.

Played the first game through BGA. I was a bit lost with the rules and becoming familiarized with the UI. Will wait for my physical copy for a proper game and then I shall rate.

Played two more times back to back and it cracked my top 10. It has a shot at becoming possibly my favorite card game ever.. A spot that is currently held by Greed. This game has it all, great mechanics, artwork, interaction, puzzles, combinations, pacing, reasonable lenght and it plays wonderful with 2. I love the similarities to Troyes and yet how it is a totally different experience at the same time. There are a lot of cards so replay value is high, the events are like Troyes and they affect everyone so there's a quasi cooperative element to resolving them. I especially like how the event card is given to the person that resolves it, and becomes a Rampart to be later built to defend one's self from future nasty events (and each is 1pt at the end of the game). I don't feel like any gameplay element is wasted, everything has a progressive feel to it so it all connects. I also love the spatial element of placing your cards so that combinations can be created based on that. I like that unlike Troyes, the endgame goals benefit the carrier a bit more. So if you achieve your personal goal, you're awarded more pts than the rest. I think that makes more sense than how it works in Troyes imo. Personally I don't have a problem with the iconography, I enjoy language independent games and tbh, it just takes a couple of sessions to synchronize yourself with that. 


Sold because I scratch the same itch with Troyes and I want to diversify my collection with a varied assortment of Themes.

I'd like to say that the multitude of icons didn't faze me, but they did a bit. I'd like to say that I enjoyed this as much as Troyes, but I can't. There seemed so much to like about this game in theory - quick turns, simple mechanism of payment and activation, multiple action cards, etc. The reality was that it felt like the game was decided by the luck of the card draw. You feel like you're being pushed down a certain path to go heavy in buying into a certain card category and then ploughing through the level three cards to find the big ten point scoring card. And here's where you have to stop and compare it to the inevitable Troyes, with it's multitude of meaty meaningful decisions, versus this with it's good common sense placement decisions with only a little room for clever play.

Once you get the basics going I'd delve into the advanced rules (buying workers for five deniers), and the expansion (replacing the one fleur-de-lis cards with the more interactive two fleur-de-lis cards). Now you'll be thinking twice about specialising if someone other than you has the Lordship. Seriously, the card balance in this game is crazy.

A perfectly fine game overall that suffers sadly from standing in the shadow of its big brother. When it comes down to it I'd rather just play Troyes.

An interesting little card game. The box says 2-4 players, but my early experiences are telling me that this game plays MUCH better with two players.  With three players it was much too hard to pay attention to what the two other players were doing to try and time the purchase of a meeple, etc...

Update: this just doesn't hold up.  Far less interesting than I first thought....5.25, take it or leave it

Scratches the same itch as Race for the Galaxy, plays in about the same time frame, has about the same level of complexity, and is just as good a game. Mechanically Tournay reminds me a little of The Manhattan Project, but it has faster turns and less downtime. Solid game.

Finally got to play this and it was pretty good.  It isn't going to replace Troyes any time soon, but it scratches a slightly different itch.  Using other people's workers isn't as punishing as it is to buy other people's dice in Troyes.  It's also ironic that I think this game relies on luck (of the draw) more than Troyes, which uses dice.  A fun game that moves quickly around the table once players get the hang of it.  The iconography isn't bad for the most part, but there are some that are tricky and the rules are good for the most part, but the explanation of the icons isn't as clear as it could be.  Looking forward to playing it again.

Card, Worker Placement. Actually, it's not so much worker placement as using the workers as currency, in three colors. The art direction and theme definitely shows the strong connection to Troyes, and there are some related mechanisms (event cards, buying someone else's worker), but the gameplay is rather different.

There is enjoyment in building up your district with synergies between your buildings and personalities, and I'd happily play this, but don't feel like I need to own it.

A Troyes nem túl jó élménye után nagyon vártam a folytatást, ami persze teljesen más játék, de tudtam a kockanélkülisége miatt biztosan jobbra számíthatok. Így is lett a Tournay egy teljesen rendben levő játék. Háromfajta emberünkkel tudunk különböző akciókat végrehajtani a tábla nélküli kártyás játékban. Háromfajta háromszintű lapok vásárlásával és használatáról szól a játék. Ezek a lapok vagy épületek, amelyekre embert küldve tudunk valamit kapni vagy személyek, akik a sorukban és oszlopunkban levő lapok aktiválásakor nyújtanak számunkra valamit. A lapokat is embereke segítségével tudjuk megvenni, mégpedig kettőt húzva és egyet választva. Itt jön be a szerencse szerepe, ami nem kicsi, de közel sem olyan vészes, mint az elődben. A kockás játékok mindig is a kedvenceim voltak, de Troyes-Tournay esetében egyértelműen a kocka nélküli tetszik jobban. Lehet benne a másik bábuját, épületét is használni, ami alapvetően erős konfliktusforrás, de mégsem vészes. Nem egetrengető játék a Tournay, de van benne egyediség és nem is túl hosszú, ketten is jól játszható. Korrekt darab.

I like Tournay much more than I thought I would. Turns out that this card game is a pretty deep Euro that begs for a replay. While the icons take some time to get your head around, once you learn the language, it rolls. The action selection / resource management of the citizens is refreshing. Many thoughtful decisions and beautiful artwork to boot.

I want to like this, being a fan of the original game. The iconography is a bit to overcome initially and the gameplay is overly long, although maybe the standard version maybe be so bad.

Update after 2 more 2-player games
Works well with two, and plays in only about 20 minutes! Next, we'll have to try the expansion cards out!

----
1 play, 4er

There are a lot of icons, and a lot going on here -- but once you're familiar with the graphics it should play well. I quite enjoyed it; going to have to put it high on our list for the prize table (but in the end, not as high as Edo; anyway, it was gone by the time we were called so the decision was easy!).

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
There are 3 sets of cards (yellow, red, white) in 3 groups (I, II, III); also, a set of black event cards. There are always 3 face-up event cards, most of which are bad. Players start with 2 meeples in 3 colors (yellow, red, white), placed on their Plaza card.

On your turn:
- first, may play a card from hand to your display (3x3 grid) by paying the appropriate cost (some combination of coins, meeples, cards, etc). May play a card on top of another of the same color; if different color, discard older card. 
- then take one action:
... draw a card; move 1-3 meeples off Plaza card to draw level I-III card; may pay others 2 coins to use their worker(s). If you draw the event card of that deck, place a coin on each event card, then trigger all event cards once/coin
... activate a building card by moving a meeple from your Plaza to the building card (max 1 Meeple/building); cards do a variety of things like give you coins, recruit an additional meeple, use someone else's card, etc.
... combat an event by paying the cost (usually 1 Meeple, 1 coin, +1/coin on the card; or, 2 meeples) shown; take the card as a reward. Later, when events trigger, may play this from hand to cancel an event for you.
... reactivate all workers: return them all to your Plaza, and remove all markers from building cards

The game ends at the start of the Start Player's turn if 2+ players have all 9 cards in their display; OR if only 1 player has, but at least n-1 Town Crier cards have been revealed. Everyone then gets to play one final card (paying normal costs). Earn VPs for all cards in display, and for all Event cards you've combated. Most VP wins!

I have a few issues with this game. First of all it's very tough to me to understand all the symbols on the cards. I mean, the player aid helps but it still is quite difficult for me to get the feeling of each card when playing the game. Of course that with more plays this feeling will disapear but that's another issue. I don't think that this game, as it is, is prepared to get a lot of plays. It has a replayability problem in my opinion. Maybe the intention is to make expansions. 
The production values are very good. I louve the artwork as I do in Troyes but to me the game should have been diferently considered. They shouldn't be this much related graphically concerning IMO. They are different games and the confusion shouldn't exist because it doesn't bring anything good to Troyes which is a so much better game!
It has some elements from Troyes of course but also from other games so the comparison only makes sense because of the publisher and the artwork. 
I find Tournay, now that I've played it again, somehow repetitive and boring. It still is a good card game and one of the best around, specially multi player, but still not good enough for me to compare it to Troyes.

Slightly lumpy and lack lustre WP/card draft/own tableau game.

Draft cards, activate them, Line them up in ways to cross activate. Nothing can be done without workers and or money. Aim is to grab VP buildings that benefit you more than other players. Small amount of take that with the events. Very typical WP type decisions. Have only played with 2 and whilst 3 or4 might be interesting it would involve more time than I would want to spend playing this game.

Still not sure whether this is a good game or simply a very decent one. In any case, I'm still looking forward to my next play after 4 plays.

This reminded me most of Caylus Magna Carta, except that you have your own grid for buildings to build and use. The learning curve is quite steep. The rules are quite fiddly and you need to know the prestige buildings for a halfway decent strategy. On the other hand, there is plenty of room to pursue different strategies, even with just the base game. Replayability seems enough for at least 20 games.

So for now, I'm settling on 'good'.

Tournay is to Troyes as San Juan is to Puerto Rico -- a card game simplification/translation of the parent boardgame. Appropriately enough, the closest game I've played to Tournay is probably Race for the Galaxy, son of San Juan, which has a similar combination of confusing iconography, tableau-building and random card selection. The tableau-building is substantially more interesting here, however, with strategic implications for position as well as composition; cards are placed in a 3x3 grid, with character cards giving bonuses to cards placed in the same row or column.

Amongst the other innovations in the game is that that card-selection is more controlled -- instead of a purely random draw, cards are drafted from nine piles in three colours and three cost brackets. Level III cards are high-scoring prestige buildings. This provides enough randomization to keep players from knowing precisely what they will draw, but more control than Race, where the best you can do to target a specific card is increase the number that you draw. The major downside is that players need to know the contents of each pile to judge where to draft, which increases the chances that early plays will either be unsatisfyingly random or require lengthy perusals of card reference sheets (not included).

The events from Troyes are also included, randomly triggered by special cards in each draft pile and also on purpose by particularly cruel players. They can be fought for points, defense against future events and in some cases money. As with Troyes, this provides an interesting semi-cooperative element that can, in some circumstances, seem to "pick on" a player pursuing a particular strategy.

Alexandre Roche's artwork is again spectacular.

At 60 minutes it's a great, short game, and as players have control of the game clock I imagine it will almost always be done in under that time -- with experience. The guy who taught it to me said that his first play took three hours, partly because of the unclear rulebook, and that's too long. Even 90 minutes is pushing it for a game this tactical.

I think it's a solid design that I'd love to play a few hundred more times... but I think it really needs that sort of repeated play to shine, and unless it gets a solid online or AI implementation, I'm never going to be able to give it that level of attention.

An interesting game that pulls many of its moves from the standard Euro playbook. You need to purchase buildings and place them into your tableau. You use workers to activate those buildings to gather additional resources and generate victory points. The snowball effect is in full force, and I'd write this off as a boring retread if it wasn't so solidly designed. The addition of negative event cards that trigger randomly and threaten all players at almost all times are just enough to set you on edge. Your workers can be hired out by other players (without your permission). Some of the buildings are quite powerful, but there are other buildings with which you can retaliate. And more than anything, the game moves along at a refreshingly brisk pace.

My biggest complaint, and it's a big one, is the language independent iconography. It's a disaster. There are so many icons that it makes Race for the Galaxy blush. We had to look up almost every card on a chart. Even the player aids were useless because they were just as indecipherable as the cards. This game would be an order of magnitude better with a localized version -- that's how much of a pain the icons were.

Tournay isn't going to win any awards for innovation, but it's a solid entry into the category. As I've only played once, I wonder if I'll like this game more or less with repeat plays. I'd surely like to find out.

I find this to be a really well executed little euro game, that plays quickly and has a ton of tactical and strategic depth. And yes, I like it more than Troyes, mostly because you can sift through a limited pool of cards, all of which are available. Sure, you might not get exactly what you were looking for, but if you are game enough and well enough prepared for potential disasters, you can keep digging. I like the different possible actions you can choose, the flow and speed of the game and of course coloured 'occupational' meeples (such a good idea and in so many good euros!)

After knowing Troyes I had high expectations with this one. And they were not disappointed.
Its a totally different from Troyes in terms of mechanisms but equally great. The dice as random element in Troyes has been replaced by Cards in Tournay.
The biggest difference is that while in Troyes you can see nearly everything from the beginning in Tournay you'll have to get to know the cards and learn what to search where.
This is the reason why I don't own the game yet: You'll need a few games under your belt to start knowing the options and less experienced players might not enjoy the first game enough to want to play again.

Though it is rightly it's own game it still feels like Troyes in that everyone scores from the same scoring cards and you have use the right citizens (which are meeples not dice) to activate certain colored cards. It's a tableau builder though and can be a lot of fun. It has the Ora & Labora effect of paying opponents to use their guys which is always cool when you do it and frustrating when it's done to you. :)

The nature of this game being a solitaire tableau builder yet one that you can then use your opponent's buildings is cool and makes for a fun 2 player game as well as more.

Tournay astonishingly takes the themes of Troyes including both external events and buying the use of other people's citizens, and turns it into a tableau building card game. As with similar Euros of the time, there's a bit of iconography and specific card/building detail to reference for the first few plays, but it's carried out easily and disappears over time.

Troyes in a different format or very close to it. I think this has less luck and more opportunities to follow your strategy further.

RATING: 7

Once you get to know the cards and combos this really shines.

Very well put together. Great fun.

Especially with advanced rules and 2 players!

I liked this one a lot.  Probably shouldn't be tied to Troyes - it really doesn't have a lot in common.  

Cards create an interesting engine mechanic.

Far too long. Bad use of icons.
First play took 3+ hours. Second play was abandoned past 2 hours. 
(but after reading the comments here, i have to admit that it were 4 player games. Sounds like it's better with just 2)

Players manage districts in Tournay, a broken town strategically vulnerable by its access to the Scheldt River.  This is a card game, city builder, successor of Troyes. The district is divided into three classes of citizens each of three levels. Building cards offer combination strategies that can also be used by the other players which creates tantalizing interactive strategies. Drawn town criers announce coming events. The player aid icon sheet is pretty brutal.

Use workers to collect cards which help you make points. Lots of card combos to feel out during your first couple of plays.

Not sure why everyone is complaining about the symbols on the cards. Didn't find it that hard to understand what every card does. Maybe it's because we also have played Troyes from the same desingers.

Clever game with great combo's just like Troyes.

Really impressed with Tournay. I was afraid it would be a weak simile to Troyes. 
But after initial wrestling with the rules (understanding all the icons, and understanding the end game condition) the game flows smoothly, and provides lots of interesting decisions in only 45 minutes.

I love the graphics of this game, they seem so authentically medieval. However, the iconography of the cards is hard to learn and to understand sometimes, so you spend as much time reading what the cards do as you do actually playing on your first tries. 
Gameplay is good, too. Always nice to built something of one's own up from nothing and good player interaction with the possibility of using another player's meeples.

a cousin to "Troyes", gives off a similar vibe but, uses meeples as the primary resource instead of dice, a good pairing...like "Puerto Rico/San Juan" or "Cuba/Havana"...

"Wait, that's it? I guess we count up points now."

This sums up how I feel at the end of each game of Tournay. I wanted to like this more because I really love Troyes. However, this game is so streamlined that I hardly feel like I got to experience a full game.

The cards simply don't do very many interesting things and the events feel very generic and tacked on to give the red building something to do. By the time you start building any engine you should already be buying your final prestige building.

I do like how the box looks next to my Troyes box. 

To scratch this card game, engine building itch I would rather play Race for the Galaxy.

When we looked at the game the first time, we believed it was the game Troyes without a game board. Just another quick game from a company which wants to lean on the success of an earlier published game. It didn’t interst us at all. Then we started to read some reviews which said, it really was another game. Tried it yesterday, and the other reviews are right. It really is another kind of gameplay. It’s not Troyes without the dice and the board. There’s more to it. Although the rules were explained the wrong way to us, this is a game we want to play more. Nice tactics are possible, and you have to think which of the prestige buildings you want to work, because they have advantages for the opponent also. By playing one, you can make your opponent win instead of you.

The biggest minus point from this game (it has two), is the fact that it looks like Troyes. The theming is right, but if I would have the choice, I would have chosen another graphics designer, so the game would look very different of Troyes.

The other minus, is the fact that the publisher didn’t put Dutch rules inside the box. Pearl Games is a Belgium company, and one of their native languages is Dutch. I think it’s a shame, they didn’t take the effort to make a Dutch translation of the game. Well, at least in that way it just looks like Troyes. Pearl Games didn’t place Dutch rules inside that box either.

There's not really much connection to Troyes, other than the artwork. The gameplay can get a little fiddly with the sorting of cards in the various decks. The iconography also isn't intuitive, although I think this would've improved with more plays. There's nothing super exciting here but I would've liked to have kept it for more plays. Unfortunately my wife gave it the kiss of death.

Very interesting game, with small elements in common with [thing=73439][/thing], but a very, very different feel.  It always feels a little tricky to gauge how fast you should push for the end of the game, or how to capitalize on others' choices, but that is also part of the fun.

A quick version of Troyes with cards. It plays quickly but is not as meaty as Troyes. Still good though. It doesn't take long to play and has interaction going on. It's adviced to know which cards are in the deck.

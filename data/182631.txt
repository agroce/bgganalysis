If the rating decreases the same as the original (Not at all) this game will be one of my top 5 favorite games.

I might say better than original... but it's to early to tell.

Fast-paced, tactical deck builder for two player. Both player battle until one has no more life. 
The rules are simple, however, all the different cards create the complexity and requires the player to find the best available combination. 
It is a super compact game which make it excellent suited for travelling.
Luck plays a role but does not matter for a such a short-time game.
I like it, especially because it is very compact, but I would prefer to play other 2-player games instead.

Review for Star Realms base game as it applies to Colony Wars follows. Stuff exclusive to Colony Wars in the CONCLUSION section.

QUALITY:
The card quality is serviceable for a few games but quickly wears down to the point of needing sleeves. The game is fairly cheap, so it feels a bit weird spending upwards $5 to sleeve a $10 game.

ART/UI:
The UI by Vito Gesualdi is pretty good in some places. The symbology makes sense, is easy to remember; the body typography choice of Handel Gothic was classy, and the colors have good pop and compliment the art. I would nitpick that the overuse of beveling does detract from the card design and makes it a bit tackier.

The art is pretty superb in most cases. You have a few instances where cards are clearly just a bunch of separate pieces thrown together in Photoshop with glows and filters added. However, most of the art is top-notch spacefaring stuff with lots of added color to keep you engaged and keep cards looking memorable.

GAMEPLAY:
Gameplay consists heavily of drafting. This will be roughly the only decision you ever make in the game: which of these 5 cards do I take (that I can actually afford)? Tons of incredibly complex game situations spring forward from just this one simple starting point. You can talk for hours about how many "levels" of nuanced play a player can learn after each game, such as knowing to pick up scrap cards to thin the deck, scrapping starting Viper cards first, knowing when to loop your deck and when not to, knowing what cards will make it through less deck loops, and knowing how to both create your own damage trajectory as well as counter-draft an opponent. There's a lot more that goes into the game that wouldn't be appropriate for a review, so let's just say that it has an insane level of depth that you could be exploring for a year or more of solid play.

THE BAD STUFF:
Every game has a flaw and Star Realms' is randomness. No matter how good at the game you get, an opponent getting a Trade Bot in open is going to set you up for a huge disadvantage. If cards bottomdeck (appear on the bottom, thus getting to use them one less time) uncontrollably too often, you can lose through no fault of your own. Between two highly skilled players, much of the gameplay comes down to who went first (first player has an ENORMOUS statistical advantage) and what picks were available on the draft conveyor. Even when you do everything in your power to control the game by limiting your buys and crunching numbers for hours to learn the best choices, the game can just take a fat dump on you for a loss. The only upside to the randomness in the game is that you should almost always be able to beat someone of a lower skill level. However, expect closer skilled players to have a lot less fun, especially ones that hit the skill ceiling of the game. Once you hit that ceiling, the game feels like pure random chance.

VALUE:
You get at least a solid years' worth of play in a $10 or so package. That's some intense value you shouldn't pass up even if you dislike the genre. I don't think I've seen a better value game in board gaming history.

CONCLUSION:
Colony Wars, when played alone has the same pace and feel of the original Star Realms. It's certainly a "more of the good stuff" type of core expansion. When thrown in with the original, either for 2 or 4 player games, the bases and ships tend to bloat up the trade row. Be sure you're taking out less-than-satisfying cards from your games when doing this. In addition, the high-cost bloat is high too. Both the card and cost bloat of combining the two tends to cause really swingy trade rows and therefore wildly different game satisfaction. So be sure to treat this with care when combining.

The base game is definitely more predictable which is desired when you get to high level play. Colony Wars is a nice break from the repetitive. If played by itself though, expect the turn extension effects that buy directly to the hand to completely dominate the game. On one hand, they're fun to play and see. On the other hand, you can't predict their occurrence in any meaningful way when you start your trajectory early game, so they become a major factor of chance that can swing the game in ways the base version can not. For competitive and brand new players, stick with base set. When you want to have a more light-hearted game, go with Colony Wars. Otherwise it's just another amazing Star Realms!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Another solid Star Realms set.
Adds a new "directly into you hand" mechanism and a lot of the same things that made the base set so great.

Be warned, this set plays fast! It can sometimes feel like you're kicking things off midgame. Colony Wars certainly requires a slight adjustment for veteran players – but if you're ok with that notion, then this one is a must buy.

Alternatively, if you're interested in having another pair of starting hands for the various multiplayer modes, I definitely recommend players skip re-purchasing the original Star Realms base set and grab Colony Wars instead.

I plan to use this more as an expansion for Star Realms than an independent game, and to that extent it's a big fat stack of cards that not only offers me more choices on the line, but helps flesh out the theme of the Star Realms universe a little.

I like some of the new cards abilities that this brought to the game. We actually just mixed it into the orig. and play with it all mixed up all the time. It also allowed us to make Star Realms a 4 player game. Though I have only done that a couple of times.

RATING: 7.5
Objectively Star Realms is "just another deckbuilder" but the factions do work well to give this a nice flavour and it plays quick without the need for large and heavy boxes full of cards.  Lots of fun and the expansion ups the fun factor with some interesting powers.  Probably best not mixing with the base game but playing seperately but it doesnt matter that much - great fun either way.

An all new deck of all new ships that can be played standalone or combined with the original Star Realms. 

Most games are short and sweet but they can be pretty epic when you both have a few ships that increase health.

   Virtually indistinguishable from its predecessor, Colony Wars gives you a whole lot more to play with, thereby enabling up to 4 players to enjoy what I think is a solid deck-building experience.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I was sceptical of this expansion, as I love Star Realms and the numbers on the cards seemed changed almost arbitrarilly, but I must say it seem to be a much more balanced deck. I've mixed some cards from each of my decks together, and I keep taking more of the old cards out for these.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I enjoy playing this as its own stand-alone game, rather than mixed in with the core set. The pace of Colony Wars is quite different from the base game as many of the cards have higher damage or future purchasing power; when played alone I usually find it results in a game where you feel like you're buying expensive ships and dealing crippling damage to your opponent really quickly, which I really enjoy. However, when mixed with the base game (although it adds some nice variety) the pace of the game can be very stilted and a little "confused". In the worst cases, it can mean that one player very quickly get many of the stronger cards whilst their opponent is left with the "scraps" of the core set - and whilst this is also a problem in the base game, it does feel exacerbated when the sets are combined. However, I thoroughly enjoy both sets - and rate them both the same - I just enjoy them as separate entities, rather than mixed together.

Played bgg.con.   LOVED it. More of a good thing. Same as the original star realms, but new cards.

I will say that I am not hugely familiar with the original cards, and so I didn't actually notice a huge difference between the original and this one.   That's not a bad thing though.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Nice compact deck-building game, that have direct players interaction.
++ Good replayability from the different card that show up in the trade row and from the 4 different factions that have different style of play. Every games, you can set up a new strategy using the different combinaisons of cards available.
++ Good card graphic design, that is clean and clear.
++ Really fast to set-up and super fast to play.
++ There is several expansions available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- Since this game have an exponential game speed curve (it's maybe too fast), it seem that if you have a bad start (too slow to acquire the right cards or to thin your deck), you already know you will be loosing and winning just past the half game (so it's a clear runaway leader problem here), which is sad. But since I'm playing this game exclusively with the app, it's so fast that it doesn't matter me much.
-- The replayability of this game is lower when always played against the same opponent (as it would be in my case) as part of the variability is how the players play the game and what strategy they try.
-- The game start to feel samey quickly too, even if you haven't try all the possible combinaison of factions or card combos yet.
-- The space theme, the direct player interaction and the fact that I already know how to play this game, all this makes it a no-buy for me as I mainly play wife my wife, and all these things will turn her off, so it's a "Don't buy" game.

If someone asked me whether to buy this OR vanilla Star Realms, I would say: the difference ins minute enough not to really matter. But I will say that there's good reason to own this [i]and[/i] the original version, particularly if you're going to play with 4 players.

Star Realms is a very fun game that pretty quickly becomes repetitive - the deck is pretty small, and so while things come out in a random order each time you play you're still seeing the same cards every game. Honestly, just doubling the amount of cards will improve its replay value a lot I think.

It's not exactly the way I would prefer to see the game handle expansions (I'd prefer something like Dominion's Kingdom system) but it works fine - if you're a Star Realms fan there's really no reason not to pick this up.

Four player Star Realms is also a lot of fun*, but at 4p with just one set, you're really going to see every card every game - and for the same price there's no real reason not to get both instead of doubling down one or the other.

*I [b]highly suggest[/b] playing 2v2 but WITHOUT shared money. With the rules as written, there's simply too much incentive to just build up one person's deck while ignoring the other person. The fact that this strategy works so well feels completely broken and this one small rule tweak fixes it nicely.

Star Realms is an amazing game. You get the same feeling of a TGC without any of the annoyances. This game will speak to your heart if you, like me, stopped playing Magic The Gathering because all your friends were putting too much money in that thing. Star Realms has many, many, many options to play and I had lots of fun with any player count between 1 and 4. Need to say that the two headed Gi... Sorry, I mean Hydra format with 4 players and two decks is amazing!!! One of my all time favorite games!

Weakest of the stand alone sets in my opinion.  From the sets I've played this is the most "snowball" of the sets where the games are often decided in the first 2 deck shuffles.  Highly synergistic (which is interesting) but runaway games happen at a much higher frequency.

There are pros and cons between comparing the two star realms base games.  Colony wars is more balanced and less "broken" than the original, but this one is a little TOO balanced in some ways.  That being said, this is still a must for any Star Realms fan.

RATING: 7.4
Really more of the same compared to the original Star Realms deck.  There aren't many cards or abilities that add to or feel different or unique.  From an "if it ain't broke" standpoint there's nothing wrong here and a little mild variety is good for people looking to break monotony after frequent plays or wanting more variety when mixing 2 decks for multiplayer games.

Really fun game, easy to pick up, rules are not too complex. I generally hate Sci-Fi space stuff but this was really good. played a game 2 player. Will definitely play again. It took us 45 mins, but now we know the rules can see it easily taking 20 next time.  
Also game can scale to last longer by having more health easily done with the cards in the base set alone.

Also, my sets of the original game and Colony wars have slightly different colouration on the back of the cards. The Colony wars ones are a bit brighter.

"Colony Wars" is "Star Realms - Extreme Version".  Everything is on a larger scale, from card cost, to damage and healing. The two major differences are: scrapping fine tuning and bases & outposts tweaking. Overall,  (IMO) not for SR beginners because it tends to be more swingy than the core deck, but more rewarding and spectacular at the same time. If you like high stakes CW is your deck of choice!

Big hit with my family. Colony Wars is better than the original Star Realms in my opinion because it's more balanced and the games feel far less random.

Easy to explain, but enough depth for some fun strategic elements. The games are over before anybody has time to get frustrated which js probably why this hits the table so often for me.

I think this should have gone the route of the "Crisis" expansions.  I'm not sure this warrants a full standalone game.  There are some really nice ships in the game though.  Machine cult seems to have gotten both an upgrade and a downgrade.  Some of the more expensive Machine Cult cards are very nice, but the cheaper ones are worse than Trade Bot and Missile Bot by only allowing you to either discard from pile or hand, but not both.

Green feels a little more potent on the ship side.  Possibly same for Star Empire.

Not sure how I feel about the put into play ability based on ally, since it's very situational.  Also not sure I want to mix this with regular Star Realms.

Plays exactly the same as [thing=147020][/thing], but with different deck of market cards. You can combine the decks to make a 3-4 player game, which I have yet to try. Star Realms has proven to have a lot of longevity with my son and has probably done more than any other game to get him to appreciate board games. I really enjoy playing this with him. I score this a point lower than the original because our games so far with Colony Wars have been more lopsided. The combos seem more powerful and whomever gets the right cards first seems to steamroll the other player. If this continues we'll probably just combine the market decks from both and play it that way.

So if you own and like Star Realms, then I guess you should buy this as it improves variety. On the other hand, it introduces almost nothing new and I would argue is ever so slightly worse as a base set. I rated Star Realms much higher, but think this plays essentially the same, so to explain I would simply say that I am disappointed it didn't do anything to make the game more fun with multiple players. This was the opportunity to take a 2 player game and streamline it for 4 players. It doesn't do any of that and simply increases the card pool. Even if you didn't go the 3+ player route here, this game adds nothing "new" to the original.

Not sure why, but this set isn't quite as good as the original.  It doesn't really matter too much since all of the cards work together.  The nice part is that this is a self contained game; you don't need the original game to play with these cards.

Colony Wars is still a very good game.  There are some great cards in this set.  If you love the original, this is a must have.

Colony Wars add quite a many cards to Star Realm and it can also be played by a independent game without the core set. I like it a lot and mixing it up with the core set gives me a nice selection of cards to play with 3 or 4 players. If you like Star Realms I cannot recommend this enough. If you want to play and cannot find the core set I can say that this is just as good and you can easily just go with this one.

[-]Only played on its own so far.[/-] I'm not convinced it's more balanced than the original set, but it's more of a good thing in any case. I think it may be best when mixed up with the original set or used for surgical replacements. Some early impressions:

The game seems slower which favours scrapping. Consequently red is more important, and going heavy on red in fact seems far more viable than before. Drawing a full hand of cheap red is no longer underwhelming in the endgame, and there's good base support.

Conversely, rushing seems more difficult to pull off. Ravager replaces Ram but doesn't have as much support among cheap green. In fact red appears to outpace green in damage thanks to the thinning. Update: Green is good though.

[-]Most cheap bases seem like false options.[/-] Even if they carry their weight in the early game by providing ally triggers, you're not going to want to draw them later on. Stellar Reef at least scraps itself, and Orbital Platform is OK. Update: Only Storage Silo feels like a trap, the others have their uses.

Yellow is pretty much as before: some mid-to-high-cost muscle that everyone will want, but you won't rush to commit to the colour. They get trade now, though; everyone does.

Blue has only a handful of cards doing damage in the whole deck, so it's purely for ramping into high-end cards of other colours. No idea why people are praising the win-more Central Station.

Most powerful card: Factory World. Cards that perform notably well in almost any deck: Convoy Bot, The Oracle (got early), Orbital Platform, Stealth Tower. Best flavour representation: Aging Battleship. Favourite card I don't tend to win with: The Wrecker. Most underwhelming 8-card: The Incinerator. Most jarring swing card: Emperor's Dreadnaught.

I have played this about 15-20 times, and though I like it a lot, so far I don't like it as much as the base game.  I have not yet mixed the decks so will be interesting to see how that works out.  So far it seems there is a lot more trade and less card draw than the base set.  So you can buy those big 7 and 8-cost cards faster - and have to resort to buying explorers a lot less - but there don't seem to be quite as many fun combos to pull off.

New cardpool, just so you don't have to look on the same cards everytime. But it is essentially the same game with some other stats on the cards. However I do feel it has got a lot more cards that allow you to draw with their ally ability, but I could be mistaken, I mixed in some crisis expansions. This just means I don't want to grab the mech cards to thin out the garbage of my deck but instead just combo all draw cards and draw half my deck at the end of the game :p

Colony Wars is a deckbuilding game in the Star Realms series which is both a standalone box set for two players (featuring an 80-card trade deck, as in the original) and an expansion for the base Star Realms set that allows it to be played as a four-player game.

In Colony Wars, as in Star Realms, players will start with a fleet (deck) of 10 basic ships, and can spend Trade to acquire more powerful ships and bases from a central trade row of 5 cards. This row is continuously replenished by random draws from the trade deck. Many ships and bases deal Combat damage which you can use to attack your opponent and/or destroy their bases. When you reduce your opponent's Authority to zero, you win.

Played my first game yesterday. Enjoyed the new cards, abilities and ally triggers. I've only seem 1/3 of the cards in play, but I have sleeved them all so I have seen them all.  It seems like this could be played independently, but I think it would be more fun combined with the original or some of the Crisis expansions. There seems to be more lower and higher cards and not a lot in the middle. The artwork again is wonderful and it is clear to tell which factions the ships belong to.  If you liked Star Realms, I'd advise adding this to your collection. It breathed some life back into the game for me.

From my two plays I don't think the new cards solve the issue of the game at times being too swingy and promoting runaway leader, but overall the cards seem more balanced (in fact, some cards are strictly better versions of older cards), and they generally have more interesting powers, while only adding a small amount of complexity. This makes Colony Wars probably the new best starting point for Star Realms.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Quick and addicting, but such a simple system with great combos that still hasn't gotten old after so many plays.

Only downside is the randomness of cards in the trade market. Sometimes things just don't line up for you, however there is definitely something to be said about strategy and overall evaluation of individual cards and their value at certain stages of the game cross referenced with what other cards you already own.

Love the freshness this set brought.

Bought this as the prize for the winner of a Star Realms tournament I hosted. My wife ended up winning it, so win-win. Including it with the base game makes the draw pile huge, but I like what the new cards bring to the experience. Bought the custom deck box to hold both decks.

RATING: 10
A nice variation after playing the first core set for a while. The unit abilities are slightly different and it does change up play a bit. The general deck archetypes (unless based on specific cards) seem unaffected.

I would suggest not to mix this in with the first set as that may increase variance too much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.25
Probably a slight improvement on the base game, in the sense there's more cheap trade generating cards available (so one player is somewhat less likely to be shutout early on), and some of the scrapping cards have been slightly nerfed (by being limited to scraping a card from your hand, or being limited to scraping a card from your discard pile, but not the freedom of picking between the two options)...but it's still a luck driven game.

This has a distinctly different feel than the base Star Realms.  I think it's slightly more complex and slightly slower paced, which are both good, but I need to play it more to get a better comparison.

RATING: 10
Very much like the original Star Realms game, it offers a variety of new cards to spice up gameplay. It is pretty much identical to the original game and the different cards don't seem to change gameplay a lot (which is often a good thing) but they don't seem to add anything new either. Even though all of the cards are different, you barely notice this difference since the cards are very much alike. Nonetheless, the game itself is fascinating and I'd recommend it to anyone. It has many plus factors: it is quick, interesting, compact, easy to play, almost language independent and of course: itÄs a deck-building game where you try to get many good cards into your deck, all the while "trashing" cards of little efficiency or moderate usefulness. If you already own the original game and like it a lot and are considering to buy the game again in order to add the possibility of more players, then don't buy the original game again - buy Colony Wars!

Just like Star Realms, but with new cards. Why? For variety, of course. A refreshing new set of cards. Perhaps slightly better art than the base game, also feels slightly more powerful – not sure if that's actually true. But interesting new gameplay with a small footprint, so I'm not complaining.

OK game but we have the same problem as with the base game: it seems like there are not that many interesting decisions to be made. Just check for the cards that you can afford and buy those, attack, done and in the final stage scrap cards to kill the opponent... swift gameplay but the game plays you it seems

Todo lo aplicable a Star Realms Base es aplicable a esta expansión. Aunque se puede jugar independiente, nosotros lo combinamos con el juego base que aplica más variabilidad. 
Esta expansión tiene naves mucho más agresivas y potentes, que hacen que el juego base sea un poco más desafiante.

-Building a deck/engine unique to you
-Simplicity

-Shuffling, which is in the hand of the players, combined with luck
-No interaction (except buying stuff your opponent might want)

I love building and optimising decks, and this game is perfect for exactly that! No complicated rules about playing or (a lot of) tactical stuff you have to consider when playing cards, just... building...

The theme and mechanics don't integrate well enough where I want them to though... Also, it's got this thing that I say in many reviews where it's not really a case of outplaying someone but more of "would you look at that, seems like I played a bit more efficient than you".

I'm interested in trying Eon's End, as it removes most of the shuffling and there's interaction in the sense that you're all working together.

Most fun "Realms" version I've played. The original Star Realms is a little too swingy with overpowered healing of the Federation, Cthulu Realms is just a tad too slow and fiddly to give the "Take That!" feeling that makes a "Realms" game so fun. I passed on Hero Realms as watching a few playthroughs - it looked even more swingy than base Star Realms.

This is the most matched and fast version of Star Realms IMHO. Great great little filler.

Faster, uglier, more imbalanced than original, adds nothing new to the concept if not for the "acquire this and put it in your hand" mechanics found on 4 different cards only.

More of the same is all right but in this case, I don't see the point of making a new game when it virtually adds nothing to the table : no new strategy, no new way to play, no balance. It just makes what was wrong with the first game even worse.

Go green and go home. There's not much more to this.

Definitely overrated.

Good cards and cool art. The cards in this set seem a little bit more powerful and complicated than the base set. That has its pluses and its minuses. One's turn takes longer adding up all the different effects and points. There does seem to be more strategy, potentially, due to all the volatile special abilities; but honestly at this point I am pretty happy with the simplicity of the base set. I think I like the base game better by just a bit. That could just be because I am used to the cards in the base game. Again, pluses and minuses to this set. Some will like it because it requires more thought and a little more depth, and others will prefer the simplicity of the base set. At this point I lean towards the latter. ***

This adds more cards and variability to Star Realms.  They integrate in seamlessly, almost to the point where I didn't notice anything was different.  It did add more depth and added some more strategy.  It is largely the same game though.  I had been meaning to buy a second Star Realms deck in order to play 4-player games, but luckily this released before I went through with that.  One thing that I would love for the game to have is being able to play cards on an opponents turn.  It would be a significant addition, but I believe it would at least be worthwhile to make a variant or game mode with "interrupts" or traps/ambushes.

Nehéz bármit is írni erről a kiegészítő, alapjátékról, hisz ugyanaz, mint az előd csak új lapokkal, de a játékmenet teljesen ugyanaz. Így a pontszám is.

Kicsit elemezgettük a lapokat. A sárga frakció lapjai nekem jobban tetszenek ebben, kicsit erősebbek. A pirosé viszont fordítva, jobb az alapjáték változata és erősebb is. A zöld frakció körülbelül ugyanolyanra sikerült. Az egyes frakciók tulajdonságai hasonlóak a két játékban, de mindenképp változatosságot hoz ez az új alappakli, ezért a rajongóknak kötelező beszerezni.

I have really high rate on Star Realms (The base game) and this was an auto-buy for me, but it doesn't live up to it's name.

The things I loved in Star Realms here are somehow nilled.
I loved in SR that if I wanted to scrap cards id go for reds.
If I wanted to regain authority I'd go for blue.
etc.

For every functionality there was a different fraction. With this expansion that is somehow flattened.

Another thing, in the base game for everything there was a symbol, now there are cards with a lot of text. For instance in this expansion there are cards that allow you to put them into your hand if you have played a card from the same fraction that turn, and the thing that bugs me is that for the first time in this game there was the name of the fractions within the text itself. Up until now i didn't had to know that Machine Cult are the reds. From now on you DO.

So from the mechanical stand point, the game is made more noob friendly, but from the card/text design wise it got more complicated, rather than vise versa.

If i had to choose between this and the base I'd go for the base.

Good thing, with both this and the base is a 4p game because it has the base cards.
Feel free to mix them up because other than the base cards there is front marker to distinguish them from the base.

The rating is for the game as a stand alone game because it can be played as a stand alone game. If I were to rate it as an expansion it would deserve something like 6.3, because unlike expansions we have seen that add mechanics, flavor, diversity, strategic options, this adds none.

Really... not much different from Star Realms. There aren't really any new mechanics here, it feels like they just tweaked the numbers for all of the cards in the base game. Now this card costs x and does y damage, this other card costs x and lets you scrap a card now.

I haven't mixed this with the base game because I don't want to dillute the card distribution, so I'm not sure how it acts as an actual expansion.

I'm still rating it highly because Star Realms is a good game and this is just more of the same, but I don't really see a need to own both sets.

Got it to be able to go for 4 player games of Star Realms. A bit sad that they changed the type,of grey core for the cards - the newer ones are lighter - but probably won't really matter in the situations where I would play this. The set feels like it has much more power than the previous one, I like to play it against the nemesis beast, feeling like I have a real chance with this set. Definitely a keeper. Plays will be recorded on the original base set, as sooner or later I might mix both cores.

Doesn’t really change the base game, just gives more variety. 

We tried playing it as a 3-player game and found it fun. We’re a very non-conflict group so there wasn’t really any teaming up and everybody’s points dropped about the same pace. Which kept the game enjoyable and peaceful.

Star Realms: Colony Wars is pretty much just more of the same. First off, there's more player decks, so the game can now be played with more than two players. There's also rules for various multiplayer game modes. And there's new cards that can mix into the regular game. Some of those have a new mechanic which allows cards to be put immediately into play instead of going into your discard pile when bought. But overall it's just expanding the game slightly, not really reinventing anything. But that being said, if you like the base game this is probably worth getting.

The only game which my wife really enjoys playing and asks me to play with her. The games are extremely fast and losing does not feel too bad (we usually play 3-6 games in a row). Artwork is awesome and all four factions feel different but at the same time balanced. I recommend that if you like the game you should buy regular Star Realms and mix the two decks since then you will not see same cards too often. The only reason why this is not a 10 is that I would hope that the bases/ships had a bit more complex/unique abilities to support more strategy/choices. If you want to only buy regular Star Realms or this you should get this since the factions are more balanced.

Great deck builder. Fast to set up, easy to teach, yet still has enough depth that the better player will win most of the time.

More Star Realms goodness. A welcome change after playing the crap out of the original.

Star Realms but fixed. The power level of bases has been tweaked so that fewer games go on too long, and there are no longer as many obviously under-costed cards (Trade Federation Cutter was the prime offender in the original).

The best deck builder I've ever played now plays four!  Well, it did before, but I refused to buy two base sets.

A full-sized expansion to Star Realms. Very similar to the base game, but a different set of cards can be mixed in or played as a stand-alone. Adds enough cards to expand the 2-player base game to 3 or 4 players. However, this can make for some much lengthier games than the 2-player version.

Prefer it to the original. Seems better balanced with a wider range of cheaper cards.

Standalone expansion to Star Realms. Tries to fix some balance issues of the original.

Just plain fun!  This is one that can easily be played multiple times in a row, and you can completely follow a different path each game.  It's fun to see cards come out that complement each other and to have crazy, awesome, damage-inflicting turns.

A standalone expansion on Star Realms that does a lot to aid the game. I play with the both together, though I think I prefer the cards on the original. Either way, opens up the game to four players.

Colony Wars is worth a 7.5 as a stand alone, because the game becomes very violent (or too violent and too fast). But when you add it to Star Realms it shines, the mix of cards become great.

Lots of fun. Great art. I wish I brought this out more often.

Cards seem much more powerful than the base game. By itself I doubt you'd notice but I'm curious how it goes with the two decks mixed.

RATING: 6
On its own, it's not as aggressive as its predecessor. Makes for a longer game and that's not what make Star Realms exciting, IMO. Next playthrough, I'll definitely mix the two decks.

Crazier and wilder than Star Realms but the more I play it the more it the more I grok the design.  And I love it.

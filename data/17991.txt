I strongly prefer the simpler [thing=2633]Dog (wooden Brändi Dog in my case)[/thing] over this.

The cards are smaller than regular cards which makes handling them a nuisance.
Furthermore I think that they cluttered the streamlined and mean version with more special cards just for the sake of it – it feels too much like a homebrew variant after all.

Combines some things I dislike. First you get a hand of cards and play all of them in an order you like. Its basically not roll and move, but instead play a card and move. Furthermore there are some randomly dealt "mess each other up" cards and its possible and not to unlikely that you spend a whole turn discarding instead of playing because you lack the one card to start a new marble.

I enjoy this game a lot. Although I play "Mensch ärgere dich nicht" only to spend time talking with my family, not giving a crap about whats happening in the randomfest of a game, TAC looks like athis type of game only at the surface.
Teams can become very good at this if they train. Many strategies, some luck but manageable.

Simple. Thrilling. Always great fun.

Well ok almost always. I admit if you get no 1 and no 13 dealt, that means bad luck you cannot start. You then just sit there and discard all your lovely cards while watching the other team clapping hands and winning.

wunderschöne 'Dog'-'MenschÄrgereDichNicht'-Variante, aber noch viel schöner durch die vier Sonderkarten und das schöne Material.
Tolles Team-Play !

Easy and quick learning rules, but still a lot of TACtic.
Highly recommended!

RATING: 5
Abstract 4 player ludo variant with card movement.
Strong points: teamplay, simplicity (aside a few rule exceptions) & game length.

I'm a sucker for 4 player games with a clean cut teamplay mechanic, if it wasn't for that, this game would fall very flat. But as it is, it's a pleasant "social" game (in the line of quirkle & co.)
The game-setting reminds me vaguely of some teamplay-trick-taking games. But trick-taking games i can't stand & TAC is pretty palatable if you wanna play something without having to think too much.

The new classic game of two teams of two players. We often play this to conclude game night. Everyone I know loves it: gamers, family, girlfriend and non-gamers.

RATING: 8
Can be frustrating if you lack the right cards to get your pawns into play (which may last over several rounds). Good thing is that this doesn't happen too often, and when it did happen to new players, they were all still ready to give it a second chance. So there must be something to it!

The comment on the publishers Website "TAC - the unique combination of board game and card game - it can be called without exaggeration a small revolution in the field of tactical games." is in my opinion simply wrong if you look at Dog wich is basically the same Game and much older. It´s alsow not a very tactical game beacause ist is (through the cards) very luck driven (I won the Round I played against a better Team woth pure luck). I dont say that Dog ist better but Dog simply doesn´t say it is tactical.
The grapics could have been done better. The Board has a good quality but it is hard to count the fields, another shape would have been better.

TAC is a beautifully produced game and also fun to play! The game can be best described as an improved version of Pachisi. It is no longer a simple roll and move, as the dice have been replaced by cards (some have special abilities) and you play in teams of two players. This gives you more control on the flow of the game and allows room for tactical decisions.

Abstract games aren't really my favorites.
But it's basically a cooler version of ludo. No dice rolling. Instead you play cards to move your pawns. There are quite a few special cards like "swap any two pawns on the board", "undo the last move and use that card for your own move", etc. Also, you always play 2 versus 2.

Basically a 99% rip-off of DOG, with some extra cards. Completely void of originality. It looks amazing though. but that only adds to the disappointment.

I have played this game today and am surprised by the high rating it has here.
I would describe it as a pachisi-variant. A good one, absolutely. If I would have to choose between pachisi and this one, this one would take the lead.

I would give the gameplay a 6, but there are some things, I dislike and that's why it get's down to a 5:
The board looks good, but it's not practical! Those graphics on it are just a show off and have nothing to do with the game - distracting attention.
The board itself is far too big for the game (heard there will be a smaller one available soon?)
The whole graphic consists of abstract geometrical graphics - why?
I would prefer a cleaner look.
The cards are not named intuitively: the 4 is meant to go backwards, not forwards - why not call it -4 then?

Nonetheless the game is a bit tactical. I think you can enjoy a game and it's playable with non-gamers. Maybe a bit too expensive, but as I am not rating the price...

The favourite game of my girlfriend. Really cool mechanics, a tiny but too much of luck factor. But that just requires more games to play! I tend to lose everything, that's why. I blame my partner ;-)

How can a game that is only 10 years old be such a bad design? It is basically Pachisi, but the board is round, instead of throwing dice you play a hand of cards (with special abilities) and! you play with a partner. Sounds actually quite fun. But then you get dealt cards for the next five rounds, and if you're unlucky you won't be able to do ANYTHING in five rounds. Why? Well, you can only use the cards if you are "out", meaning you have a playerpiece in the ring. If you don't, and you don't have the cards to get a piece out, then you just sit there and throw away cards. You can move you're partners pieces by the way - but ONLY IF YOU ARE OUT!!! Gosh. Plus: Way, way, WAY too long for what it is. Spare me!

You and your wife having dinner at home with another couple? Gamewise I guess there is nothing better to close the day afterwards than some nice rounds of TAC then. Biggest drawback of this game: It only works with 4 players. Otherwise I would give this game a 10.

Rather boring Pachisi variant played with cards. The game sure looks cool but it only works when played with 4 in teams. A 3 player game sucks big time. The rating here on the geek really is strange... Considering the price and that this game literally has *nothing* new it's only a 5 in my opinion. Btw: I wanted to like it, the board looks absolutely beautiful.
Here are some negative things:
The graphics (symbols) on the board don't match up with the holes - makes it very hard to count the steps, so you always have to count one by one...
Like in Sorry, you can only get out with the correct card
The undo cards are very fiddly especially if you play an undo on another undo card (see the example in the rules).

GAME: Deathwatch: Overkill

RATING: 10
It is a very easy game from Warhammer 40k universe. Captures the essence of Warhammer and synthesizes it as a game very tactic for both sides. The mechanic that allow the Space Marine Commander choose which enemies will enter in your zone (through free positioning on zones) letting him control the distance between Marines and Genestelers, chosing who will be locked in combat and forcing the Commander to antecipate the next enemy moves is a great insight.

The game with the Genestelers Cult is another kind of game. While the game with Commander is very tense and extreme strategic, the game with Cultists is more funny, but not less strategic than the game with Space Marines.

It is a great game!

A cross between Space Hulk and WH40k table TOP. Restricted by the zones but yet measurements are required like the actual 40k game. Game play is very average. Some strange game plays that do not mimic actual 40k rules. But it does bring everything down to the bear minimum. A good start for non 40k gamers. But completely lacking if you are a sessioned gamer. 
Miniatures are again top notch.

The best parts of an 80's action film, distilled into boardgame form. Lots of dice rolling, figuring where best to place Marines to take out the most enemies, and a good variety of mission types (that can be easily adapted to other map layouts).  Very simple to play, and could perhaps have benefited form the Space Marines suffering aim penalties (requiring higher values to hit) when wounded, to reflect their status - but this is easy enough to implement as a houserule. The tactical cardplay and controlled ambushes offered the Tyranid player make it an exceptionally interesting experience. And the models are gorgeous, no two ways about that.

RATING: 5.5
Quite mediocre, unfortunately. The rules are easy enough for anyone to simply pick up the dice and start playing. But playing as the Deathwatch commander is pretty boring - all you do is move, attack, move, attack. The player controlling the Genestealer Cult on the other hand have a lot more fun - planning ambushes and how to best use his or her hand of cards! But for what you get, as a board gamer, this game is in no way worth its price. Sure, the models are as stunning as always (Games Workshop quality) but you need to spend like 10 hours on assembly... And like I said, the game is simple - way too simple to be worth that amount of money.

a mediocre miniature contribution system, like most of GWs new standalone releases that aren't reprints.

The Space Marines in this game play like your Action Adventure Heroes in movies, you know, the heroes that are able to take out entire drug cartels while being outmanned and outgunned. The Hybrids are members of that cartel that can't hit and get slaughtered by the dozen. Accept that concept and you have a really fun dice chucking game. Not having models block line of sight I felt was odd. Blocking, line of sight and facing would have been nice and I feel made for a better game but those would come at the cost of rules overhead. As it stands the rules are super simple and create just exciting dice chucking. The Marines have the fun weapons that mow down hybrids BUT to make up for being thrown into the meat grinder the hybrids have the perk of more interesting gameplay with a deck of cards to coordinate the assault with.

GW's video came off flat, but BoLS's videos definitely sold me on the game. No telling whether this will be a one-time release or remain on the shelves, so I'm jumping in (one thing's certain, it certainly won't get cheaper in the future). Hopefully GW will reign in their steadily-climbing prices for a bit.

Atmospheric and violent.  The Space Marines in DW: Overkill are the juggernauts of the fiction and the body count in these missions is staggering.  Balance feels a bit wonky, but it should be possible to adjust the difficulty of scenarios by adding Genestealer cards or extra Marines.

Bought this because it was on sale, (20% off discount) but still think it was a bit crazy... A bit expensive for a game I'm probably not going to play a whole lot, but I really wanted the minis for something else...

A great game for tyranid or Space hulk fan's alike. would like to see some fan made missions though.

The actual gameplay is subpar, but the miniatures more than make up for the games' flaws.

Great game that takes the best from space hulk with the warhammer 40k experience, feeling a good kill team dungeoncrawl, well made game that really deserves be in any game collection, specially by the amazing miniatures it does bring. 

Also a good way to enter into warhammer 40k universe and gameplay.

Nice minis, easy gameplay. This is just rolling dice and killing lots of monsters. 

I would define it like a less tactical Space hulk.

Wow this game is easy to learn and tense. I love how different the two sides are and play. The game is quick- Quick to learn, quick to setup, and quick to play. It captures the massive firepower of the 40k universe better than any other GW game... So much lead flying everywhere and no cover to be found. 

The space marines finally feel godlike in their survivability and destructive power! It feels like a mix of space hulk and calth but has better pacing and tension than either.

I hope they make some conversion card packs to bring assassinorum character to this game and the hybrids to assassinorum and calth.

Another decent rule set included with a board game from GW.  Not perfect but captures the feel of both sides (alien hordes getting stronger toward the core of their lair and nigh god-like space marines).

We're 3 games away from completing the campaign.  Because team composition often varies from mission to mission and there's 11 choices for the marine player, there's a good deal of replayability.

After first play, It felt way too simple and random even though I expected it to be simple and random. Not really worth the price unless you want to collect Warhammer 40k Genestealer army. Otherwise, this seems to have nothing over Space Crusade, which is much more fitting comparison than Space Hulk.

Components are mostly top quality though, so the game looks good.

Exciting and fast-moving skirmish game. Nice components for the most part, but the hybrids could use better reference cards and the marine cards should give a better indication of which marine the card applies to. Seems a bit unbalanced to the hybrids.

Having played scenario 1 it feels like a really quick and interesting game system. I would place it in between GW's fantastic Horus Heresy and their bland Assassinorum. Would definitively play again.

RATING: 7
Unique rules and as asymetrical as it gets. Just a 7 though, as it feels like you're just waiting for a moment the marine player fails, or a good card combo comes along. Fate has too big a hand it seems.

Getting more playthroughs under my belt might raise or lower this rating.

Great to see the Genestealers back in action.  This one is a reversal from Space Hulk where now it's more strategic in playing the Genestealers rather than the Space Marines.  Interesting mechanic of not having cover in the game.  It creates a lot of rush and crush dice chucking and forces timed implementation of the strategy cards.  Pure Ameritrash.

Warhammer 40k two player miniature skirmish between the Emperor's elite space marines sent to a mining planet to deal with the genestealer cult. Some assembly and glue required.

RATING: 8
2011-05-28 (rating 8):

An excellent game. A bit of randomness makes it somewhat "party game" (and happens to be particularly painful at the beginning of the game). But still lots of interesting choices and clever track building.

RATING: 5
Nice little game, only distantly related to RRD1. This one's much more accessible and quicker. Randomness is a factor, but not much of a problem, as clever play can overcome much of its consequences, especially early in the game. There is however a serious runaway leader problem: the eventual winner is usually determined once all trains are sold.

Unfortunately, this game has the Wassertal curse: rules that are vague to the point of uselessness. You really have to guess what they mean (not that it's hard to guess).

Rules are terrible, but with a couple of answers, playable.
The game is good, and very short if the players don't get stuck in analysis paralysis.

Nice quick railway game - some people will dislike the luck element as you roll dice each turn for your track etc, but the skill of the game is building your track in such a way any roll is useful. Only thing it lacks for me is a share game element - this game is all about building track and running trains. *** Update, not so sure now on replayability - gets a bit repetative if you play it frequently, dropped a notch in my rating to a 7.

There is a lot in this very short game - mini train rush, anticipating and triggering an end condition, nasty track laying - but it just didn't grab me. I'm not sure why, so id be glad to play again. It is certainly not a big time commitment.

This game is easier to understand and simpler to play than the original. The gameplay is different, as well; there are no shares like the first game. Players mainly just try to get the best routes to as many stations as possible in order to ensure delivery of the largest number of passengers. Much of this will depend on the roll of the dice, hence the title, "Railroad Dice 2". The components are very good.

RATING: 8
Only played once 2-player, so take rating with grain of salt, but I really liked it.  It has elements of 18xx games (train rusting, track upgrading), but obviously is very different as well, and of course much shorter.  You need to be very aware of when the 2-trains will rust, and when the trains are running out and plan accordingly.  I think people may be spending too much time building track and not watching the train situation.  I also don't think the rules are anywhere near as confusing as people are making out.

Played this as a 2 player game, not realising it went to 4. It worked out nicely, but we found some of the English text to be ambiguous. Nevertheless, we completed a tight little game and enjoyed it a lot. My opponent hoarded a lot of dice which starved me and drove the game to an earlier finish. I had bought more locomotives than him, and didn't use them optimally, and so lost by a close margin.

The dice and game-board are small, but just big enough if you're careful. It could work as a travel game.

Railroad Dice--does this title possibly imply the game is dice driven????  Oh gosh, why didn't I think of that?  Do I usually like dice games?  Well, no.

I went to some trouble to get this game (and believe it or not, the basic RR Dice, too--haven't played it yet), so I am disappointed I don't like it any better than I do.  But what idiot would buy a dice game, not realizing it was a dice game?  What was I expecting?  A card game?

If I keep it, the only time I would use it is when traveling and for some weird reason I have to have a RR game.    It is very small & compact (6 sections create a 4 1/2" x 6 1/2" game board), and without the box, won't take up much room.  (Although I have some RR card games even more compact--I have yet to play them, but I'm sure I'll like them better--after all, they are card games--I am sure they are because the word "card" appears in their title.)

I find that the track laid out by dice, are harder to read than tracks laid out by tile in other RR games.  

The concept that passengers and money are the same is different.   Upgrading locomotives, laying track, some terrain costing more, and delivering something are pretty standard in many RR games.  Nothing outstanding in this game for me.  

Will probably play it again, because I know some others who are interested, but guess I'll try to sell this afterwards.

It's actually a pretty good game when you want to play a train game but don't have the time for an Age of Steam or Railroad Tycoon type of game.  It also is a good introduction to buying engines and transporting passengers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Eliminates the companies and directorships from the first rail road dice game, which were kind of broken. This is a simpler game of building connections and delivering available passengers according to the terrains you are connected to and your engine size. The odd thing about this game is that distance deliveries are not worth any more than short deliveries. The only reason to go for distance is to be connected to as many terrain tiles as you can. That way, if a closer terrain tile's passengers dry up, you can pull them from others that may still have some. This game needs an additional trick or two to stay interesting, I'm afraid.

What a letdown!  I liked RRD.  I really liked RRD-D.  I thought I'd love RRD-2 but no such luck.  The game opens well but seems to have a real runaway leader problem.  Guess I'll have to stick to RRD-D.

Played once (in a train!). A quite nice one with some nice twist. I like the mechanism how you build the tracks, but somehow the "board" is too small and that's why it's hard to see, which city has money and how much. But definitely want to play this again.

Interesting little game . . . in fact, too little.  I'd prefer larger bits, as the small ones are hard to manage.  

I liked the tactical parts of this game, but others with whom I played, and who had other rail games, didn't like it as well.

First impression (3 players): This is one of the more clever dice games as it uses dice in a different way. The game itself is pretty simple with homage towards 18xx series. The game itself is a good one although it feels quite likely in the early game for someone to be blocked badly by a couple of bad rolls. A good and enjoyable dice game.

An unusual game of connection and transportation. The dice mechanism is just great :P

There's a slight advantage for the starting player, especially when using random maps.

Caveat - these comments based on a single play between me and the owner of the game.  Both of use for the first time.  Though we have played his copy of RR Dice multiple times.
------------

We missed a few rules but I enjoyed the game and would be willing to give it another go.  The game did not work as a 2 player game as there was a runaway leader and the 2nd player had no hope of catching up.

RATING: 7
A much better (although seemingly tiny) game than RR Dice I. There is quite a bit of thinking involved in both placing your initial station and figuring out when and how many trains to buy. It seems the person who buys the 2nd 2 train is at quite a disadvantage but more plays will tell. Each game has played out very differently and all have played out fairly quickly (30-60 minutes with four players). We thought the end game rules would be boring and lengthy but they go very very quickly as the last of the passengers are drained out from the map.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The game concentrates more on building connections than the first game, and dispenses with the shares and companies changing hands.  As a result, it feels more cohesive and also more balanced.  Oh, and it doesn't take anything like as long to play as the first game.

RATING: 5
After one play with 4 players: I appreciate that it IS a railroad game: build track, ship goods, collect revenue, upgrade engines, repeat.  However, I dislike that the TYPE of track you could build, and therefore the locations it's useful, is determined by ROLLING DICE.  That spoiled the 'reality' feeling of the game, for me.  "We want to expand our coverage from Dallas to Oklahoma City." "Sorry, we only have curved track available this week."  Uh huh... right. (Not that there were any labeled cities on the map to begin with.)  But worse than that, with its existing rules, it is HEAVILY unbalanced to turn order, and everyone but the first player felt frustrated for the first half of the game.  After that, everyone felt crowded on the VERY small board (we're talking single-digit square inches here), with very limited options.

RATING: 7
Very different game than the original Railroad dice--this is essentially connecting and shipping passengers.

Very novel mechanics are still undone by underdevelopment.  Here the game sems very imbalanced in the cost and availability of trains (which work somewhat similarly to 18XX).  Players have just enough money to buy two 2 trains or one three train  (which allow travel of 2 passengers over 2 tiles).  The problem is since there five 2 trains available--someone is going to behind in trains early and can't catch up:
-  2 Pl.: 3 vs. 2. 
-  3 Pl.: 2,2 vs. 1.  
-  4 Pl.: 2 players get 2-2's, one gets 3, the last is stuck with a single 2.)

One negative is the change in the game to upgading track (which wasn't present in the orginal game) gives the game fiddly components.

RATING: 6
Clever odd game that blends 18xx style track and train buying with random dice luck. Enjoyable and strangely appealing, although it seemed fiddly and long given the randomness. I suspect it will go faster if I play more and get more experienced though.

Railroad Dice 2 -- 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very different game to RR Dice 1. This edition is a stand-alone game and is more about rolling to build tracks and buying locomotives. Players then ship passengers along tracks to other stations. The 'shares' element of RRD 1 which I liked has been removed. Ideal as a railroad themed filler but not a serious game.

The components are top notch and the coins/passenger chits are a lovely touch. The rules are poorly translated and written and could have been better!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Ugh.  Great concept, but man is this game random.  Roll the dice that you need and you get where you are going, roll those that don't help you and you lose.  To make matters worse the game completely devolves about half the way through, when all of the white dice are used, and you roll less orange dice to place in tougher constraints.

Yuck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cleaner system than the first game. 
Randomness of dice is offset because if you lay your track well you have options on your other lines. Smart use of your orange dice helps offset randomness as well as all sides of orange dice are useful.

A big improvement over RRD1.  It's still not a perfect game - the board is very tiny and cramped, roll of the dice can be brutal, unforgiving of errors, if you get a monopoly you win, etc. - but it's very enjoyable and not too long.  We haven't yet tweaked it but I'll be adding some white dice soon to see if that does anything.  We may also try some fix about engines - if you get bowbed out of a good engine, you can't win without a monopoly.  Anyway, we like it and play it, and that's all that really counts.

love the components, though the board itself could be bigger and 'lock in' the dice placements.  I've only played two games, and though the first was fast and furious and a lot of fun (7), the second turned into analysis paralysis for most players as they tried to figure out how to place the dice they had rolled, meaning much longer wait times and a lot less fun (5).  I guess with the right map set-up and players, this would be consistently fun, but I have my doubts.  I guess I'll have to play again to see!

This is a neat game, and is reminiscent of Age of Steam, since it's a pick-up-and-deliver game with opportunities for screwage as players get in each others' kitchens.  Oh, and also because you'll need a nice locomotive to do anything useful in the game.  I'm definitely interested in playing this some more.

OK, I've played it some more, and I see some problems with it.  In four-player games, the person placing last is going to suffer from having no good choices, and the way that the turn order plays out in 4-player games means that one person is always going to be JUST behind the income earnings needed to upgrade to the next engine, and that player is going to lose because he can't keep up with the others.  I'd like to try the game with 3 to see how it works.

UPDATE: I've played a 2-player game, and I think it's just me.  I made a poor choice in placing my station, and then made some critical errors in how I placed my tracks.  It's not the game so much as it is me.

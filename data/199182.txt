GAME: Commands & Colors Tricorne: The American Revolution
RANK: 4507

RATING: 8
This is probably the sophisticated one, requiring finesse and skill.  The simplicity of two lines facing each other, terrain permitting, is belied by best use of officers, which is critical, as well as the other units types, along with Command and Combat card combinations. The expensive physical production has its successes & deficiencies, apparently in the manner of a first attempt at 'Command & Colors' wooden blocks by Compass.

This is a game I have been waiting on for about 6 years. I bugged Richard Borg to make a [thing=62222][/thing] expansion for the American Revolution. I'm glad he ignored me and made a stand-alone game.

Compass Games did a mostly bang-up job with this. It has mounted boards, glossy rules, thick terrain tiles, great blocks and artwork. The only thing they missed out was that they didn't use the same card thickness as C&C:N and that puzzles me since I have other Compass games with thicker cards.

For game play, this uses the C&C system, as opposed to [thing=10630][/thing], meaning you have battle back, support, and leaders. In this game, the dice have 2 flags and one of every other symbol, rather than 2 infantry symbols. That makes it more likely that you will retreat, and when you do, an additional roll may make your unit leave the battlefield and give your opponent a victory medal. This is EXCELLENT as desertion was a bigger concern than casualties in these battles. It makes you concentrate on maintaining your line integrity and leader placement. You will put your leaders on the front lines and in harms way more often, as they traditionally were (Horatio Gates being a notable exception).

The game also has a common deck and special decks for each side, which remind me of those in [thing=84406][/thing], except these cards are not as overpowered and easier to acquire.

A nice development of the C&C system. I particularly like the extra texture provided by morale rules and combat cards. First impressions at my club were positive. A bit pricy for a game--hopefully expansions will be a touch less expensive.

I hated [i]Commands & Colors: Napolenics[/i] and, after one play, this seems to fix the issues I had with that game. I don't know if I will buy this, but I suspect I'll play all the scenarios.

Tricorne is unique in its fluid treatment of the small-scale battles of the American Revolution. The combat decks give the opposing armies interesting advantages based on their perceived historical doctrines: the British want form solid lines, issue a withering volley or two, and close with the bayonet. The Continentals want to form resilient knots in good terrain when they can’t form lines, take edge off British units with volleys of their own, and give ground carefully before the British can close with them. “Three” seems to be the minimum when rolling dice at opposing units to have hope of an effect. Any fewer and you’d better be issuing a Line Volley. It feels in some ways like the earlier Ancients game in its close, tactical feel. But the reliance on good musketry and hitting the weak points in the enemy’s line as hard as you can give both players interesting challenges that set it apart.

Prepare to spend HOURS putting on stickers.  Ugh!  You would think that for $108, the game would have pre-stickered blocks or stencil painted blocks like the old AH Waterloo game.

An enjoyable implementation of the C&C system.  The morale rules add something new and the ranged combat and combat cards make this different from Ancients or Napoleonics.

I must say I am really impressed by Tricorne. It manages to capture the period really well, and forces the aspiring commander to consider leadership and morale far more than simple brute force assaults. I very much look forward to my next battle!

A really fun block game that uses two different types of cards to issue orders to units in 1700s battle style.  Can you defeat the enemy without loosing too many men to casualties before they break and run?

I ordered this direct from Compass Games. I was extremely pleased with the blocks and decals. This title is an excellent addition to the Commands & Colors series. Richard Borg really captured the theme with this title. I really love the War for Independence.

First impression. Good quality components and graphic design, except that the colour of the board is too muted and the stencils on the dice are poor. I like the addition of the Combat cards, which adds a little something extra to many other C&C titles. Is this as good as C&C: Ancients? It's too early to tell.

Compass Games.  Arrived August 2017. Finally got to the table in December. Quite fun to play, as I binged my way through a half dozen scenarios in a couple days. Although I own the Ancients games and Napoleonics, I think this new entry to the franchise has more texture and nuance. The new morale rules make you pay attention to how you use the various calibers of troops. Militia and provincials can be very fragile, and you can find yourself losing a bunch of banners in no time. The combat cards also add some flavor and variance. This game is easy too learn and rewards you with some fun games that can weave an interesting narrative.

One of the better entries into the Command and Colors series. I like how the threat of failing rally roles adds tension to a unit that is forced to retreat.  That mechanic certainly boosts the importance of leaders (who are generally very strong in this game) and maintaining support.

Another great Borg game in which he handles the distinctives of combat in the era with a few tweaks to the simple Command and Colors game system. I have been waiting for a long time for Command and Colors to cover this game era, and I am very pleased with the result.

Borg has done it again, adding some tweaks to his basic engine to make it reflect another period.  Here the command cards reward keeping your lines intact.  An infantry line with no gaps has a good chance of making some devastating attacks.  Proper use of leaders is crucial, as they help units exploit battlefield successes, remove the necessity of retreats, and add dice to ranged and melee combat.

The big change to the system is in retreats.  Now units must roll at the end of their retreat, one die per remaining block (+1 die for elite units, -1 die for the rabble), and if they do not roll at least one flag, the unit is eliminated.  Again, keeping leaders adjacent to units and keeping units supported will avoid the need to retreat, so players should strive to keep a continuous line and keep their leaders adjacent to trouble spots.

British artillery gets to start most scenarios with an opening bombardment, but artillery in general has limited effect.  You can try an artillery charge if you like, but the guns do not get many dice.

Compass did a great job with the components.  After one night's pressing, my game board lays perfectly flat.  The terrain overlays are beautiful.  The blocks look great.  Although the artwork is perhaps not quite up to GMT's level, it is close.

The game plays quickly, probably between Commands and Colors: Ancients and Commands and Colors: Napoleonics in scenario length.  On our first play, we finished Freeman's Farm twice in a 90 minute session.  That time included a bull session between the games and numerous pauses as we looked up rules.  I imagine most scenarios will take 20-30 minutes once players have experience with the rules.

This game will get some serious play in my gaming group.  We were impressed.

I bought this game because I like the show Rick and Morty, but the game is extremely entertaining and well made. I've played this many times with people who have never seen Rick & Morty and they love it! It's one of the few games I own that people ask repeatedly for me to bring on game nights, not to mention the game is incredibly quick (being about 15-25 minutes).

Those who are fans of Rick and Morty (and of this specific episode) will appreciate it more than those who aren't, as it definitely conveys the manic, paranoid theme. But it's a fairly fun, quick deduction game with a number of little catches in there that can shake up the game play. I do feel like the 'Advanced Mode' with the potential for hidden Parasite players might ratchet up the tension to just the right level, but if folks are really against 'traitor' elements then it's still entertaining without that.

With 2 people it was incredibly tedious. And not because the gameplay was intricate and had many small moves. It was just waiting to pull the right card and wasting turns  just to get a shoot card. After Anatomy Park I was very hopeful. But I wouldn’t waste your time on this one. The only reason to own would just be if you are the biggest superfan

This is a good easy to play co-op game that is fun to play and has some neat mechanics that can mess up each others plays. It easy to learn it as there are only a few actions that you can do. I have never watched the cartoon so I suppose that it would appeal more to the people that watch it. This isn't on my to buy list but I'd play it anytime.

On the cusp of being good, but too wonky. The incentive structure for people based on their identities is just all over the place, plus I fear that familiarity with the (brilliant) eponymous episode is 100% a must. Perhaps fixable with house rules?
[EDIT] Yes, house rules up the quality considerably.

RATING: 8
Really fun cooperative game with a twist, one of your friends could be deceiving you.  Honestly the normal game should be the "advanced mode" and the normal mode should be considered learner mode. If you have any less then 5 players, there is a chance that no one is a traitor. I just played a game where we had 4 players, and from the start none of us were traitors and we stayed that way throughout the whole game.

RATING: 7
This is an incredibly fun filler game.  We broke it out at our local game store and ended up having quite a crowd gathered to see if we could save the world...we did not.  The theme is great and the game is excellent.  I would highly recommend you watch the tv episode "Total Rickall" as well.  It just adds to the humor of the game.

So this game is solid. However, its place is at parties or Rick and Morty marathons. Otherwise, there are a ton of games that give me more of a sense of accomplishment. The good things are the theme and a genuine feeling of dread when you shoot the wrong people.

This game is far too easy in basic mode; play basic mode once to learn the mechanics.  Advanced mode is what makes this game interesting, but it still feels as though the game is missing something.  It definitely feels like it wasn't play tested and just cashed in on the cartoon license.

One problem with this game is that it is far too easy to count the cards; I'm not sure how it can be avoided.  My group has started using some house rules to keep people guessing a little longer - we shuffle the identity deck and deal out the top cards.  There are problems with this because it's possible to create a no win situation for the real team - unless the parasites shoot the 4th real.

Now, all this criticism doesn't mean that I don't have fun playing this game.  First, you will enjoy this simply if you're a fan of the episode that it was based on.  Seeing the episode also helps you understand the concept better; it doesn't compute for a lot of players that the dirty stinking parasites don't want anyone to die.  By not giving up on the game, we started to learn the nuances that make it really fun - like lying as a real to screw up the game with the hopes of getting shot so you can turn into a parasite and win the game.  There are a lot of opportunities to betray your friends, which can lead to hilarious moments.

I bought this hoping that it could be something to play if there weren't enough people to play The Resistance: Avalon. It is very good for that purpose.  So far, everyone seems to really enjoy it, even the people who don't like hidden identity games.

RATING: 8
Social deduction game that actually has both nice looks and interesting gameplay. Usually these tend to fall short on the latter. We have a Ghost Stories style clock which requires you to kill on average more than one parasite a turn, kind of. Changing loyalties add some nice juice.

RATING: 8
I bought this game thinking that it would be a generic card game based on a famous I.P. that was quickly hashed together.  But I wanted to give it a try.  I played a two player game of this once and thought, "yep, I was right."

But then me and my friends, all of whom are fans of the show, played with the advanced rules.  You will never go back to the normal rules if you play in advanced mode!!!  It's like a fluid version of Avalon or The Resistance!  In the advanced rules there are two sides, the real people and the parasites.  And your identity can change several times mid game!  Just like in Werewolf or Avalon you want everyone to think you're on the side of good.  But you might be lying!  Finding out your friend is a parasite is thrilling, realizing that your friend tricked you for half the game is intense!  It went above and beyond my expectations.

One of the best episodes of the show is adapted into a fairly decent card game, tasking you with eliminating characters you believe to be parasites with preserving the real ones. With 2 players this makes for a fun memory/deduction game but it really shines with 3+ players as there is a chance one of you will be a Parasite in disguise, adding a nice traitor element.

The "standard game" was a breeze-through Coop experience that we won pretty easily the first time through. If you want to add "challenge" there is an advanced mode that makes it into something of a social deduction game. This COULD be a decent party/coop game if you're a big fan of Rick and Morty (and waiting for Season 3 as impatiently as I am), but the theme can't save pretty basic mechanics. There are better coop games and better social deduction games.

A really quirky deduction game based on a pretty famous Rick and Morty episode. I definitely think that the advanced game is the way to go, but I wish there was a little more incentive to shoot characters not controlled by the players. Sort of takes the tension of something like The Resistance, and builds a take that/hand management game around it. The game can be broken with certain setups, however, so it isn't a very polished game, but it works well if you're a fan of the show.

Initially had difficulty tracking this down: it seemed only to be available in the US, but with shipping coming out at triple the cost of the game itself, and the likelihood of VAT and 'handling' charges on top. Then suddenly it appeared at a reduced price and only $4 shipping through Amazon's US site. Snapped it up before the offer evaporated.

I was very very surprised when I first got this game as a gift. I thought it would be one of those cheap "play it once as a nice gesture, never play again" type of games.

This game is much better than it would lend itself towards. It is a co-op/player betrayal game with pushing-your-luck elements. It keeps everyone on their toes and gameplay is very very fast.

However, I also think that while it is fun, there is a lack of depth to it so depending on some groups it may get boring easily.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I'm giving this a 10! It does exactly what it says on the tin. The game is complete mayhem party game that gives so much interaction between players. Back stabbing and undisputed carnage, it's a true PARTY game in all sense of the word. If you want long drawn out EURO strategy games then go play one of those instead. 
It's also worthy of note that non-gamer family members can also join in, in fact it only makes it a better experience when you have players of different abilities and attitudes.

RATING: 6
I am a fan of the show, and thematically this captures much of the brilliance of the total rickall episode.  Except that it doesn't seem to quite work.

There is a serious problem that can likely be fixed.  It is far too easy for the parasites to get an unsatisfying win.  I see no issue with the parasites winning, even easily, but I dislike how their path to victory can cut the game off just as it is getting interesting.  Specifically, in a 4 player game, any 2 players can force phase 1 to end.  If a parasite is ever outed, there is not reason for them not to propose a vote.  If there are is another parasite (likely if Jerry has been played a few times), then the game instantly ends without a tense conclusion.

Another concern, although less severe, is an anticlimatic win by the real characters,  If they can get to dinner without killing more than 1 real character, then there is no tension, as they can just shoot anyone at all suspicious.  Those victims won't even object, since they win even if shot.  And there is no credible argument a parasite can make.  Once again, this isn't a balance issue but an issue of undermining tension just when it should be peaking.  Good play should let the humans win, but not without some negotiation and tension about who gets shot.  Agreeing that you should be shot and that you don't care is not thematic or tense.

Of my first two games, each of those cases occurred once, leaving me disappointed.  Both started off interesting and clever, and left me feeling irritated that the game's potential hadn't been realized.  I hope they were anomalies or that they can be fixed with house rules, but I fear that a clever mechanic paired with a brilliant theme has come up short.

This game surprised me. Yes, it's social deduction, so I was probably bound to like it. But I didn't realise I would love it - so much so it made me watch the episode it was based off, having never watched Rick and Morty before. Quick turns, dialogue inducing and hilarious as you try to work out 'who to kill'. Watching people plead for their lives is always fun. Watching them squirm their way out of it and flip parasite, even more so.

Way better than I expected.  Fun memory/deception type game, based entirely on one of the best episodes of the show.  They did not half-ass this one, it's a well crafted little warm-up type game.  My group has unanimously wanted to play this almost every time we've met since I got it.

RATING: 8
A fun group lying/sabotage game that keeps everyone engages the whole game.

Allegiances are looked at by only certain players, and frequently swapped randomly. Leading to lots of moments where you know there's a chance your friend is parasites (unless your OTHER friend was lying when he said one of these two characters is parasite before shuffling them!). Hilarity ensues.

It avoid a trap of some similar games by preventing permanent player elimination until very late in the game. When a player dies, they draw a new character card and a new identity (real or parasite) card, putting them right back in the action.

A great warm up or wind down game on game days.

I was a little unimpressed with this title.  We played cooperative, which, IMO, doesn't work that well.  Most of the mechanics seem built around the idea of having a "traitor" present.  I'd play this once more with a traitor, it would take some convincing to get me to play cooperative again.

First Impression: I'm not sure what I think about this game. Despite playing a full game I was still not sure how to read the icons. The main mechanism used in the game has to do with reverse deduction but overall the game didn't feel polished. I find that Tobago does reverse deduction better and prefer to play that game over this.

Would have been a 6 for production, and play, until we got to the ending which basically was a domino effect allowing the last player to easily win.

RATING: 7
This is highly original, fast paced and (for me) great fun. There is a large luck element but certainly plenty of room for skill, particularly in the timing of plays  involving "my building..." cards, holding these back until they really pay seems a key strategy. Very satisfying to make that one play that clarifies multiple buildings in a trice.
In our group the "error hawking" aspect not a factor since I only recall one error in four playings.
Component physical quality is good but usability suffers, some of the building names are really hard to read. This reduces in importance after a play or two since the graphics are distinct.

A simple logic game.  There's a few things you can do to improve your chances of scoring, but luck of the draw plays a strong part.  Fun theme.  OK for an occasional play, but nothing spectacular.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a quick and fun little point maximization game. It plays under the guise of a Sudoku puzzle, but really what you're doing is assessing your hand and then playing the card that will net you the most points. It's [i]kind of[/i] straightforward, but the mental loops your brain has to do in order to suss out how valuable a given card is are just plain fun for me. I like this style of thinking.

There's also a hand management element, where you can try to save up cards for some good combos - luck of the draw is of course a factor there but it's still a nice touch that adds a little bit of planning to otherwise pretty obvious plays.

The team rules feel laughably arbitrary... but the game moves so fast that it's impossible to catch up, so they make sense for balance reasons. That said, this game definitely is at its best 2p. You get more control over the board so you can rely on those combos a little more, and it's just a closer game.

Update: Played for the first time in years, and I still just have fun figuring out how to score, dammit. Holy god is the board ugly though. I remembered the game as being ugly but... I forgot just how bad it is. I'm sort of glad Tobago came along just for that reason.

RATING: 6.5
Two games so far with two players.  Lots of fun.  Rules were tricky to figure out, though, and there was some disagreement between the German and English versions.  Played one game now with three, and it was definitely more chaotic than with two.  Not sure I'd play with four.

RATING: 6
A really unusual game that plays out like a logic puzzle- it's definitely a welcome change of pace from the usual Euro rubbish.  I really like the concept of the game and I think the theme (exploring and recreating a ghost town) is unique and well-implemented, but I don't know that the game is something to play more than a couple of times through.  It plays well with 2, and has a nice casual but not simple-minded feel to it that I think is an asset.

RATING: 7
Played with 3 and 4. Unique concept. The first edition rule book is not very well structured. Extremly improved second edition rules. Components and artwork are OK. Once understood, the basic rules are simple, gameplay is fast. Card drawing luck seems to be very important. Plays equally well with three or 4 (with 4: more luck / chaos).

I REALLY like the concept here, and enjoy this game.  It doesn't quite work as well as I'd like it too, I think--too many problems with the rule that you can't play a card if it would put a tile where there are already three.

Sort of a deduction game.  You get cards that offer choices, and try to play them to enforce the "deductions" that score best for you.  Pretty light game, but fun for what it is.

Clever "deduction like" game which is more like a puzzle game. The mechanics seem a bit difficult and dry, but the feeling of ditching up an old town makes that up for a pleasant journey.

RATING: 5
Unusual deduction game, where players are trying to reconstruct a town from the Old West via a string of clues left behind.  Players play "clue" cards that sprinkle building counters on the board.  Through further clue cards, and deduction logic, the actual buildings themselves begin to appear.  Points are scored for removing counters from the game.  The rules are rather opaque and it takes some re-reading to understand exactly what's going on.  The game itself is quite fun, although winning seems to be based more on the luck of the cards, rather than any skillful play.   Recommended if you like unusual and different games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very fun game. Certain wording in the rules will spin your head but once you figured that out, the game's deductive reasoning mechanic is very engaging. Replayability is in question but it will still be fresh if you played it once a few months.

By concept both mechanics and theme of the game are wonderful. In practise, the mechanics don't work quite so well, as one player often manages to solve third of the board with one move, effectively winning the game that way. Still, because of it's novelty, it's a very entertaining game for 2-3 players, especially considering it's length.

Very different logical deduction game - may be more open to non-gamer audiences if the deduction is compared to sudoku?  I'm keen to see how people react to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very intriguing as a logic puzzle/exercise.  As a game, it suffers greatly from a lack of control (with 4 players).  Big scoring plays tend to come in sudden avalanches, and players are overwhelmingly dependent on their limited selection of cards in hand, two factors which together threaten the play balance.  We played with four and I suspect it might be quite a bit better as a two-player affair.

At first you don't believe that in this game everything is about deduction, but somehow the plan is filled with buildings and the system proofs it works (as there are 2 buildings not used, cards that become illogical do not hinder the system). You can be mean when scoring and that's the interesting moments in this game. Not breathtaking and the graphics look like a prototype but really something different.

RATING: 6.5
Old Town is a bit of a curate's egg- not quite warm, not quite cold, not quite PNP, not quite publisher quality.

It has the feel of a game the designer keeps coming back to improve a little more each time- not quite streamlined, but not without a certain flow.

This particular version required a great deal of manual cutting of building chits and cards before play, and the cards are a mix of parchment and very light cardstock. The boards are decently mounted on cardboard, and the buildings are of heavy cardstock. All of these are color prints, so it is not an unattractive game, but this version has a homegrown feel to it.

The play consists of playing a card limiting the placement of a building (possibly more than one), and either placing chits showing possible locations in the old town, or collecting any chits from the board that can be logically removed.

It makes for an interesting style of game, and one can see the developing mechanism that became treasure determination in Tobago.

It's not a bad game, but not the most fascinating game either- it truly promises to be different each time it is played, but that doesn't necessarily change how the game might tend to play out. I think I'll pull this out again and see if it changes in style, but I would guess not.

I am starting this precursor to Tobago at a 6.5 after a first solo 4-player game.  It's certainly not another cube pusher, and I hope it grows on me with more plays.

A game that seems more a clever activity than a game.  I enjoy the design, but there is usually a RIGHT answer for your turn.  Most of the game is simply figuring that out.  Still a difficult set of mechanics to mesh together, and Mr. Riedel does so nicely.

Only just met this game (8 years too late!)

Liked it very much (especially as I won) even though I had one "unplayable" card very early on.

Clever multiple deduction cards provide game variety and make it replayable.

I look forward to playing again now that I have sourced my own copy!

On the down side, the buildings graphic design aren't "obvious" to me.

RATING: 6.5
A superb, fast logic/deduction game like a riddles or logic puzzles. This is a neat little logic game that plays quickly and smoothly. Set in a wild west ghost town, you play cards that reveal information about the location of buildings (ie the Jail was on the west side of town). Once a number of these types of clues combine, you can determine the exact location of the building. You score points by eliminating the uncertainty about the location of the buildings.

Interesting mechanism, but not sure if there is much strategy here other than making the best of your cards when it is your turn.

Very unique game that plays quickly.  I wouldn't necessarily call it a deduction game, though a minimal sense of logic helps you to evaluate your choices.  Since the entire game is structured by the cards you hold, it's mainly about evaluating your options.  It is astounding how the game actually works, I have no idea how the designer came up with it.

RATING: 5
A logic-puzzle game that is heavier than it looks and requires some analytical thinking to play. The rules were so shockingly bad that even after downloading 3 different versions, I still had no clear idea about how to play. Things got even more confusing after my first play. So many unanswered questions.

I can see the potential for a good game there if you can figure it out, but I think thats its a little too brainy to play as a light filler and figuring out the rules and sorting the components for each game was an incredible pain.

I've now played twice.  Strikes me as a kinder, gentler Fresh Fish - in that you must examine the board for errors.  Nice theme, and good components especially for a homemade game of limited run.  As others have said, I'm not too sure how to apply skill to this game.  Either you have a good card to play, or you don't.  Seeing the meaning of the cards is important, and that is the 'skill' I've seen to apply.

Played couple of times, then sold my copy. Two-player game is dull, with three this is the best one, with four it's just ok: it's lightweight, yes there are luck but who it's actually not so bad thing. If you like light deduction (or card-handling) games, then you might like this one too. I like it, but I don't need to own it. The worst part is that the game is actually good only in the middle of the game... the rest is very annoying. Solo-game is interesting.

Played once.  Pretty much a straight deduction game.  It took me roughly half the game to really figure out what I was trying to figure out, and by then, I was way behind, so, yeah, whatever.  I'm not a big deduction game fan, but I can say I liked this better than most others I've tried.

Intriguing logic puzzle with a bit of deduction that is certainly a bit different than most games.  Its definitely unique in the way it plays.  However, I would tend to agree with the complaint that luck of the draw plays a considerable factor in the game.  Still, I think its worthwhile to have in the collection just because its different.  Besides, it plays quickly.

Provisional rating - may go up or down with more plays, but it looks very good on first attempt; a bit of a brain burner, but because the cards are play once then discard, you don't get bogged down in the history; and the discard two useless/contradictory cards and remove one counter token is inspired.  Reminds me of Fresh Fish.

Rating in decline - after the first few games, where you are trying to build the mental framework to deal with the new concepts, it becomes clear that there is less going on here than you think.

Nice little "deduction" game. It's not quite your typical deduction game, though. There's a big dose of luck, too, so it's fairly light, but then again, it plays quick and it's good fun to see how the town is slowly created.

RATING: 6
The essence of the game is you either play a card to establish possible locations (up to 5 of the 16) of a new building (the fewer the better) or you narrow down the location of possible locations for buildings already scouted (the more locations you can get rid off, the better). Once you've grokked the key rules (1 point for each tile taken off or not needed to be placed, plus replace "my building" on the card text with either of the buildings you've claimed) the game moves along nicely. Once you get going, it sort of plays you though, as turns become more obvious and usually you have 1 clearly better move. You don't want to be responsible for placing a lot of tiles out there - others will get a chance to take them off and score points before it gets back to you. Plays are tactical - the board layout changes too much to plan more than one turn in advance. In the end, your scoring is dictated by the luck of the cards you get, ie the game plays you. Still, it's an enjoyable proces to work through, working out those best plays and watching the town come to life. You'll just wish you had a touch more planning and control.

I often hear the cliche that the "game plays you" but I've never really experienced that impression until now. I always felt I had choices in games I've played which influenced the outcome. But in Old Town, the "game" felt too programmed, leading to a definite outcome due to the two types of cards in play. I felt I had no real choices that could effectively dictate my standing in the scores. Game play feels the same, first play type A then type C cards, followed by type B with the occasional player lucky to have the right card to cause a point blowout. Too many regulations and reading from text and ensuing logical explanation is an experience that I didn't care for. It was pleasant to see a refreshing design which I consider a puzzle rather than a game.  The solitary puzzles were of interest and I'd be proud if I home produced a game to that quality.

Just like its sequel Schinderhannes, an incredibly unique game.

Don't expect a game with any kind of planning or long term strategy. However, the logical thinking process required for this game -- it feels like Sudoku -- is unique.

In comparison to Schinderhannes: Old Town is more streamlined and I prefer the theme better, but I think Schinderhannes is the better game. I think setup for Old Town is a bit longer than Schinderhannes.

For all the work in learning the quite odd rules/gameplay in this game, at the end it is pretty underwhelming.

Surprisingly clever and original and somehow strange deduction game. Confusing situations can occur from time to time.

Reasonably fun game where you solve a building placement logic puzzle, getting more points for eliminating more possibilities. You're supposed to be archaeologists recreating a 19th century ghost town. The rules aren't very well written.

At boards and bits. Supposed to be a bit a brain burner, yet also a bit lucky. Soloable.

oszinten megvalva jobbra szamitottam. Egy kicsit sotlan, izgalmaktol mentes volt a jatekmenet. Annyi a dontes a jatekban, hogy a kezedben levo 4 kartyabol meg kell talalni azt ami a legtobb pontot hozza neked. A jatekosok egy regi vadnyugati varos felipeteset probaljak rekonstrualni a meglevo nyomok alapjan, az a jatekos aki a legtobb es leghasznosabb informaciokat talalja meg, nyeri a jatekot. Izgalmasan hangzik, de sajnos jatszva nem annyira az.

Head hurting logic game. It has a certain appeal to it. Not for the masses. But I love it!

RATING: 5
A strange and interesting game.  With four players, though, it was too chaotic for me.  Since there doesn't seem to be much long term strategy, you're left with finding your best scoring move each turn, which is either trivial or causes long down time.  I wonder if the game is better with 2 or 3 players.

This game most definately stands out on its own.  Is it a deduction game? I'm not so sure, but it certainly has a cool system using an open process of elimination.  You garner points by narrowing the options, rather than just revealing the answers.  The best thing about the game is that you end up choosing what the answer is as you play along.  This is a vastly superior upgrade to the basic mechanics in Fu Manchu's Hidden Horde.  

That said, there is a lot of luck in the game.  Getting cards that help you best will give you the win.  This mean that to me this just becomes more of a cool activity rather than an exciting game.

This is a neat little logic game that plays quickly and smoothly.  Since the cards all contain miniature maps showing exactly which building sites are implicated, it should be approachable (if not winnable) by the logic-deficient.

I rather like this game but may be too predictable. We did get one rule wrong so definitely merits another outing.

Plenty of luck in this one, but still a pretty good and challenging game. I found it somewhat tough to grasp the rules at first. Nice theme.

The original proof game comes in many versions which reflect the designer's evolution of this labor of love.  Any are worth playing for a the first major social approach to the once-solitary logic puzzle.

Interesting deduction/logic style game. Tends to drag a little as you calculate your plays, but interesting enough to make it worth it.

You like riddles or logic puzzles? Then this unusual game is a "must have" for your collection. Recommended: Download the modified rules from the website ...

Deduction based game that is simple to play, but fun to figure out.

RATING: 5
As a sort of collaborative puzzle, this is really cool - the way the clues interlock is very well done.  As a game, it&#039;s not so good - how well you do is mostly luck, as it depends on what cards you happen to draw when.

Poor rules - we either played wrong... or the game is not to my taste. Perhaps the next time we play it will all be made clear and I'll like it.

The rules need some cleaning up, and some minor card errata are the only things holding this game back from being a 10.

A nice game of deduction/puzzle solving with an interesting scoring system.  It will play different every time.  There is some luck, but also room for some card management and decisions on when to play certain buildings to maximize points.

Typical match/mismatch the parts for best score type of title. Kind of like light zoning board work. Ho-hum. I'd rather pull out Sim-city even if I want the company of people.

Dusty and worn, as the title suggests, but with some spittle and polish it'll be as good as new.

I really like the puzzle. It is hard to understand at first and second glance but it works in the end.

It's a great game to play with math oriented teenagers that is full of the algebra of sets (union, intersection, complementation, etc).  Getting cards are random however, so card counting and tricks like that are needed to play your best game.

no.  too hard to visualize.  guess i don't like this type of thinking game.  never was a big fan of Mastermind.

RATING: 5
Interesting concept, but not a very good game. Basically each turn is a little logic puzzle and you have to find the card that maximizes your score. That makes it a purely tactical game and very luck-dependent.

Seems like a too simple game for my tastes. That might be for too few plays, though - hard to say. However, it seems the choices on what to 'deduce' is always pretty straight forward (pick the one with most points).

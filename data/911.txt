The Decision Games version is not worth the cost.  They eliminated the "slider bar" element for social state thus making the game less playable as you constantly go looking for chits when state goes up and down.  And the additional event cards provide little added value.

RATING: 6
One of the better SPI games. I picked the folio version up for a song ($4) in a sale bin while on holiday. It needs a lot of players to work but it has a good feel of empire building problems. Not to sure about the history though. There is almost no chance that an "England" will arise in northern Europe which given the resultant hundred years wars is a bit of an ommision.

Flaw in the gem:
The system simulates the successfully centralized powers of Ancient Classical Empires far better than Medieval Kingdoms crippled by the centrifugal forces of feudalism.  The very title of the game reveals this completely inappropriate and inexplicable bias.  Easily fix that and it's a 10!

This is a nostalgia rating.  This and Third Reich were the games I enjoyed playing the most growing up, but I haven't played it in 30 years now.  It is one of the few wargames I own that I will never dispose of, but will I ever break it out again?

I really wanted to like this game: it has beautiful map and nice counters, interesting event cards, but has a high luck factor degree too and it seems to be loooooong. I played solo scenario, but I'm wondering what could other gamers do while they wait acting player to have done. I think even other scenarios could be played solitary and enjoyed much more than multiplayer sessions if you apply some history knowledge. Avoid some puzzling and boring options such as raiders (better if adding event cards) and magnates.

I actually have a playtest credit in this game.  But as other people have said "you spend too much time fighting the system and you don't really get a chance to attack your opponents".  By the way, we never playtested a 10th of the scenarios in the game.  We played a couple of generic scenarios and the designers made up the other scenarios from our general results.  That was SPI and why they went out of business.

A beautifully realised game which does a fascinating job of depicting the tides and currents of dynastic control in medieval Europe.

The game is fairly simple to play, although procedurally a little bit of a chore - choose an action, lots of counting and addition and subtraction... followed by a decision on whether to spend gold to improve your chances and a card draw.

It works fine, and the deck of cards for resolution is no doubt cleverly crafted - but five times a turn for 20 turns for five or six player, plus all the game controlled raiders and local rulers... it drags towards the end.

I used to rate this a 9 or 10, but the more I have played, the more I have become convinced that it's a 'diplomat wins' game. Plus the fact that there are too many slightly different rules (roll 3+ for this, 2+ for this, add one for mountains etc.)

RATING: 4
Civilizacio-ludo simulanta la konfliktojn kaj marĉandojn inter princoj de la Mezepoko (750-1492).

Not as engaging as all that, perhaps because of the rather dry economic take on the whole period. 

A small but annoying point: Graphically the designers have not really made any effort to re-create a medieval mood. Look for example at the levels used for cities: first your Wooden Shacks are upgraded to Tudor houses, which can themselves be upgraded into... Palladian palaces (?).

I played this game once or twice a long time ago. I recall enjoying it, and I liked the card mechanics. We played a multi-player campaign game which was interesting, but it's hard to say how much of the fun we had was from the game vs the people I was playing.

I did briefly try a two player game with the 2nd edition many years later, but I didn't find it terribly interesting. I also disliked the map changes.

A justly venerated classic, at least in terms of design and concept.  More a game of statecraft than empire building, it&#039;s a very dense and detailed game, and the rules are sometimes hard to follow.  Some mechanics are difficult to work out and the random, wanton destruction of the cards makes long term strategies impossible - but that&#039;s really the point.

Very long game. Need to have a lot of time and energy to be in the mood to play it, but it provides an overall rewarding narrative if you can finish a game.

Original linked-areas SPI version. Played this a lot both solo and with friends in the mid-80s. Contains a few puzzling rules (especially, as I recall about Ties and when/if they are "broken" and impact on other "alliances") ... an early "card driven game" ... before they became a "fad", but an enjoyable fad!

Unpunched EOTMA 2nd Edition (DG) acquired via eBay (July 2014).  Very nice map and components. Currently skimming rules and so far impression is not good: references to placing markers on the "area register" alas these do not exist on the 2nd Edition map and also reference to Leader counters ... none provided! Hmmm, DG strikes again!

RATING: 6
I love the concept of this game.  One of the few games where I feel like an actual leader.  I can influence events, but do not have perfect control over the empire.  Problem is that in many cases, you have very little to no control.  So you try and build an empire with the strong leaders, and just try not to break it with the bad ones.  Realistic, but can make for some bad gameplay at times.  More of a historical testtube than a true game ... but I'm boring enough to enjoy it.  Dropping the rating from 8.5 to 6 because of the awful utility value of the board and having way too few counters to track everything.

Edit:  I enjoy the game more each time I play it.  I feel the game is closer to an 8.5 for me now, but I'm keeping the official rating a 6, because the production values of the game really grate on me and I feel a few rules could have been cleaned up.

Tried the campaign game which took too long to start in my view (it starts as a two player game and then divides up after a number of turns). By the time it had divided into four kingdoms someone was left with a terrible kingdom and everyone had to agree not to attack him until he had recovered (it wasn't his fault it was in such a bad state). I need to try this again with a lesser campaign.

This is not as much a game as an experience.

Own both original and new version. I like the new version for the additional cards and extras like armies and important buildings. But the original map i prefer, as it was smaller. I also like the original counters, especially since the new one has the blues too close in color.

I do think that larger empires should get a slight bonus, but nothing major.

I liked this game primarily for not being yet another "risk-like" medieval wargame. What it lacks, however, is rules for splitting large empires (like the Frankish Empire), as well as the creation (or emergence) of new political entities (like new kingdoms, etc...)

RATING: 8
Initially, I rated EotMA 6.5, because the game proved to be a disappointment. There are so many things in the rules that I really liked, but it was all destroyed by some of the overly powerful event cards. It seemed like player actions had only marginal effects in comparison to 'leader dies heirless' cards. Winning or loosing EotMA may be more dependent on how many of these cards you draw (and which ones) than on your actions. That is a serious problem for a game that takes this long.
As you can see, I raised my rating considerably, because I believe that the 'leader dies heirless' problem can be fixed and that - if you do - you'll end up with a truly great game.

RATING: 10
The components of the Decision Games edition is gorgeous.  The 2 maps are now expanded (previously 1) to accomodate a larger playing surface.  A fairly complex, articulate and sublime game. It features quite extensively about the medieval society in Europe.  Tax, crusaders, politics and religions and of course, the wars...all are integrated with an elegant "endevaour" gaming system.  A champion game on the subject.  Highly recommended.

I have played worse games, but not many.  If you enjoy playing solitaire for hours and weeks and months on end, you might enjoy this, because while you sit around with 3-4 other people playing, there's no player interaction (Except that you can't move on with your game of solitaire at your own pace because you have to wait for others - why???).

DG 2nd Edition
The core system with the endeavors is very appealing (works without classical movement or combat), but the rest is a mess: not very much player interaction, mechanistic and boring game procedures dealing with neutral powers.
Also to much luck-driven for competitive play: Leaders with different qualities come and go by chance, your score depends much on the leader you have at the end of the game.
The DG additions add not much positive to the game play, especially with regard to the increased production costs (doubling the cards).

A truely great game.  Playing the full scenario is a real commitment.  I did it once with a group of 6 over a summer.  Took weeks and weeks, but was worth it.  

If you play the full version, reduce the points for "religious conversion".  I essentially won the game with those, and frankly did not deserve to.  If I recall correctly, you get 5 points per conversion.  3 points would be better balanced.

I had this game back in the day, but traded it away, I think. It was a monster game that had an amazing depth, but to me it was just too much of an abstraction of the period. Sure, the cards covered all the major points of the period but it was all too removed and impoersonal. There was a spin-off game called The Sword and the Stars, which took the basic game system and applied it to a sci-fi setting. It also made it playable in something less than one human lifetime.

A game from 1980 that plays like a Euro (except it takes forever to finish a game). It's also a war game with no military units (there are hundreds of others, though).

Players expand their empire by performing one of six actions (conquest, diplomacy, pillage, defense, ruling, build fortifications). Only conquest really enables you to expand. Most of the other actions give you modifiers to make expansion (and the ease of taxation) easier.

On each turn players receive five cards. A player plays a card to perform one of those six actions. However, you can't do all actions with one particular card, and each card enables you to do a particular action with varying rates of efficiency. So there's a hand management optimization puzzle each turn as you figure out how to best assign which card to which action.

In our first game, we played only four of about 25 turns, which took a couple of hours. I don't think we'd be able to play this that much faster; this game is really, really, really fiddly with lots of tables and tedious 2d6 checks. Also, some of the random event cards are disastrous.

Excellent politically oriented game. Although rather long, every player is involved in each player's turn, so it doesn't drag.  Very worthwhile to play.  For a smaller sci-fi version, check out the equally fine Sword and the Stars.

This one has not aged very well in my opinion. It is not a game for a modern gamer. It desperately needs some house rules to be suitable for particular gaming groups but I have to say that its EPIC and I love it just for that.

Great game marred only by a tendency for it to turn into a contest between the players & the system - especially if the players are conservative. I have the SPI version which had a couple of problems (raiders for instance were unstoppable civilisation killers) but apparently the new version is worse.

I love the concept of the game, but I'm not sure about the implementation. The game becomes very tedious at times. I understand that pat of what is being shown is the difficulty of even maintaining a kingdom, but the way it is implemented is somewhat uninteresting and can seem completely random and arbitrary. 

Every once in awhile, there is a confluence of the perfect circumstances and holding cards where you can make a play on someone else territory through something other than combat--which can be really cool--but those moments are few and far between. 

I attempted to play the campaign game, maybe the smaller scenarios would be better, but the draw of the game is the grand scope.

A 5 or 6 player game in the 80s was both the dullest and the most disappointing gaming experience of my life.

I moderated a postal game of the grand campaign for over 10 years. My map faded in the sun along with the pieces that remained on the board for a while. I must say that I have not had the inclination to play the game since. However, it is a very good game. One of the earlier card driven 'wargames'. A lot of luck involved, but I don't mind that.

No specific historical figures or events.  It's more of Sim City computer game simulation of the Middle Ages.  I think we played less than 1/100th of the campaign game.

Interesting, and sort of ahead of its time. There still is quite a lot of randomness, as well as a certain geometric dryness to it all, which is what worries me most. Rules are quite nice to read, but not as exhaustive and clear as one would want them.

Probably unfair to judge it based on the solo scenario, as this seems to be very much a negotiation game.

Why not spend an afternoon (or several!) building up a medieval nation? I haven't played the newer version of EotMA (mostly because the "flaws" that the Decision Games purportedly fixed are features that I enjoyed), but the SPI version of Empires of the Middle Ages is a unique classic in my book.  Truly epic in scope, the game inevitably involves watching your precious empire succumb over time. And that's the best-case scenario.

What can I say?---I'm a sucker for a tragic theme and the chance to participate in a giant sweep of history from a period that fascinates me.  Though I don't think it's mere 80s-gamer nostalgia that inspires my high rating.  The fact is that EotMA may feel a little clunky in terms of its pace and balance, but the game was (and remains) quite an innovative specimen, well ahead of its time in many respects.  And for what it sets out to do (i.e. epic historical macro-simulation), it does as well and with as much panache as *almost* any other since.

Just received this one.  The cards look just right to me, beautifull in a sober kind of way.  Same comment for the map.  I read through the rules, they'e a mess, but luckily I found a rewrite on the 'Related Links' section of the boardgamegeek article on this game, and that really makes a difference, so if you'e planning on buying this game, make sure to look for that rewrite!

This is probably mostly nostalgia, but hear me out.

I haven't played this at all in over 30 years, but I did play the entire campaign game three times in 1980-1983.

The first two times, I was living in a group house.  I started playing solitaire and two of my housemates joined in.  We each played both a primary empire, plus a secondary one which we traded around to produce maximal conflict at all times.  It was a lot of fun.  We could whip through 25 years (5 turns) in less than an hour and sometimes we would play an entire century in an afternoon and other times, we would just let it sit on a table in the corner of a room for a week.

What makes this game different from most monster games is that the rules are quite simple.  So, it's easy to play a bit, put it aside, and pick it up again.  And, the gradual ebb and flow of empires over centuries, as old ones decay and disappear and new ones emerge, is really fun to observe.

So, I can definitely recommend the campaign game if you have the table space to leave it set up over 2-3 months and a couple of interested friends.

The game does has its problems -- the colonization rules for large language groups are way too strong (lots of languages went extinct), as are the Saracens.  But, it's still a lot of fun and different from any other historical game I know.

As a shorter game, it's SF cousin may be better, but as I think this system only shines in the long haul, I prefer this one.

It's a really long game, but darn if it doesn't capture the feel of the ebb and flow of the empires of the midlde ages. In some scenarios, just ending up in better shape than when you started seems like a real victory. Inter-player conflict can be a major part of the game, or relatively minor, depending on the scenario and the particular players involved.

I have the original SPI version, and the new reprint.

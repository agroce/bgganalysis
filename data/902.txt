I like the theme. The production values are good. But it doesn't quite grab me the way Verrater did. It isn't as deep and as tactically challenging as Verrater. I'll play it but it feels like a game that's not quite a filler but not quite a main dish.

I think the 8 rating will go up once I get a few more plays.  A very nice light game but with a lovely mix of mechanisms, a little economy, action drafting, battle, and it all just works together beautifully!

I like this game more and more each time it comes out. I don't think the online version with strangers really works, since  a lot of the game is in the body language, and the obligatory piratey accents.

From the Reviews: Looks like to could be fun but the 3-4 player would greater reduce the number of time it would get played, especially since playing with 4 is essential to having a good game, nevertheless the mechanics look interesting and when it did get played it would probably be lots of fun

I've got quite a few plays of this from before I started logging, but there were some interesting rules misinterpretations.  It's a great, light, easy-to-learn game that can easily jump to midweight and get very competitive once players get the hang of it.  Completely iconographic, so being in German isn't a problem.  Unfortunately, it's really hard to make a comeback so things can be pretty unforgiving.

The first-to-30 variant may actually fix that...

A fine game. There's a nice tension between competing in trade and getting an early choice of job.  The Captain is powerful, determining where the ship will sail to, so no one can be left in the job too long.  The cards are very nice.

I like this game a lot. However, the strategy seems to depend a lot on what cards you draw. If everyone makes the optimal move based on the cards they draw then everyone does the best they can possibly do. The game ends up not depending on strategy anymore. Still very fun, especially for people who haven't played it before.

I’ve played this online quite a few times and really enjoy it. I bought it because - all it is, is a deck of cards and at a bargain price you can’t go wrong. It's a whole lot of game for what it is.

The only thing that keeps me from giving this one a 10 is that there&#039;s a lot of shuffling, and no scoring track (though someone made one, posted here, I believe).  Which is why I ADORE this game on BSW (the shuffling and scoring are done for you).  A unique system, similar to Verrater (same designer), but without all that nastiness.  I LOVE this little box of cards.

Meuterer is my favourite card game. Why ? Because it is so much more than a simple card game. The gameplay is as rich a board game one. I never get tired of this game. Once we played 3 times in a row and I wasn't even close to getting annoyed with it. More than a game, it is a gem.

Meuterer is a lot of fun. It gives me a feeling of having options no matter what cards I'm dealt. I love the use of the secret role selection where the more goods you try to sell, the later you get to pick a role and thus the fewer roles are left to pick from. This makes the roles more exciting than in Verrater or Citadels where you just pass the stack around the circle. I'm also not much of a card counter, so I appreciate how easy it is to do in this game.

Voor kinderen vanaf 12 jaar.
Het is dan ook een gecompliceerd spel.  De regels zijn niet zo moeilijk, maar als je goed wil spelen, moet je toch veel logische als-dan vragen in je hoofd beantwoorden.

De kapitein beslist waar de boot wellicht strandt, maar de muiter kan dit ook beïnvloeden.  Ieder kiest zijn rolletje (ngl wie eerst past).  Je kan maatje, muiter, scheepsjongen, handelaar en kaartenpakker zijn.

Iets te moeilijk voor mij om echt van te genieten.

I was lured into playing Meuterer under the expectation it was kind of Citadels if not Citadels Lite: in reality it turned out as being a clumsy and pointless game where the role selection isn’t as prominent as it is in Citadels.

Sure, a good planning can make up for bad cards yet the effort required to play Meuterer is still too heavy for the extremely and unsatisfyingly simple game it is: there are many better games around that play the same - if not better - than Meuterer, Citadels being their forerunner and Hoax a worthy second.

Even though it's really a boardgame in card-game disguise, I don't think it's that amazing a deal at 8 euros. Not sure if it would be worth much more than that. Still an ok game. Only good with four, though.

Weird game.  The character cards are generally pretty useless (except if you pick from them 1st).  Likely the ship is going to some random island that you don't care about but someone else does.  Your best bet is to be stingy and try to build up sets of 3 cards or else it's too easy for opponents to mess with you.  Not a terrible game, just not a ton of fun for me.

Es un juego de cartas que tiene la complejidad de un juego de tablero. Algunas de las cartas hacen las veces de tablero de hecho. Tiene algo de estrategia y un puntito que recuerda un poco a una mezcla entre póker y ciudadelas. Curioso.

Vendido a cibertorres en octubre de 2014. Formó parte de un pack que incluía aventureros al tren (de cartas), dominion, caylus magna carta, bohnanza y ciudadelas (con ciudadela oscura), por el que pagó 55€.

Everybody in my regular group hates this game - I have no idea why. I like it quite a lot. Yes, with a very bad hand (no goods to sell and no conflict cards) there isn't much you can do, but bad hands exist in every card game. At least you can always take the Lademeister to draw extra cards next turn, that's already more than you can do in other cards games.

Interesting card game that gives a "big-game" feel in a small box. Each element of the turn (card play, role selection, possibility of mutiny, trading) is well integrated and provides numerous intriguing possibilities. Moreover, the game is also a lot of fun, with numerous options for screwage and reversals of fortune.

The only reason I traded it away is that it is only playable with exactly four players (which was not a typical player count in my group).

Great game.  Feels like a big game in a little box.  Interesting mechanics and keeping track of possible locations based on the Captain's hand size are interesting.

RATING: 8
05/20/10 - Finally got this game on the table, after owning it since Christmas. I'm VERY impressed with the strategic depth of this game. After more plays in the future, my rating is likely to go up if this game proves to be as deep as it seems now. I like the fact that there's 2 kinds of strategy at play: There's the objective strategy of trying to maximize your hand/position/earnings, but there's also the subjective strategy of playing based on your opponents plays. 

For example: The Captain just offered 2 points to the unselected First Mate. Does that mean he has a defensively weak hand, or is he just trying to conserve his Conflict cards? How has he played in the past rounds? Should I pick the Mate card right away for the guaranteed points (if there's no successful Mutiny), or should I try to capitalize on the marketplace? Well, that depends on where I think the Captain will try to steer us. Where is the Captain likely to go? Should I wait to find out the desitination before picking my role card? Etc...  VERY strategically deep game for such a simple cardgame format!

Good game, not as good as it's sister game Verrater I think, but still a decent little game. Like Verrater, though, it has an extremely unwieldy sequence of play, and is not as easy to play as one might hope - and as a consequence it doesn't get as much play as it might.

Only played this the once so far so not sure on all the inticacies of the game yet - I enjoyed it but felt what I drew was pretty much what I could do. Clever card play where everything you play affects everything. The points you gain. The forthcoming mutiny and selling of wares and the distance the ship can move. 1 Play.

Great little game. Better than Verrater or Citadels. Definitely need all four players, though. I think deducing who picked which role, predicting who's going to pick which other roles, and using that information to figure out which role will help you most is even more important here than in Citadels. Definitely one of the best games you can get for under ten bucks. Damn shame that I can't really seem to get anyone else interested in playing this often.

Beautifully designed 4 player game.  The knock against it for me is that you need 4 players.  This does not scale.  However, with 4, this is brilliant. Tough decision after tough decision, with a large amount of bluffing, and the possibility to cut and run and play for a later round like Taj Mahal.  This is much better than its brother Verrater, although that game had a bit more going for it in the way of drawing roles.  It intrigues me as to why people still want to play Citadels.  Once you try this or Verrater, it will be "Citadels who?"

[u]June 2009:[/u] Played twice with 3 players. The game is nice, it goes quickly, there are some decisions to make, some aren't that easy but overall the game is pretty light. There is a good deal of luck with the cards you get, specially when you're captain, then again, that's just the way it is and losing your captainship isn't really damaging (you just skip a bonus).
I can't say this will be one of my favourite game as I'm pretty sure it will never be, however, nice little game and for just 6euros and the size of the box (smaller than a card game), I'd recommend it to anyone.
In the same kind of card game, I prefer Traders of Carthage which is more challenging in my opinion, even though I don't think it would play well with 4.

[u]September 09:[/u] Upgraded my rating from 6 to 7 after a first play and 2 new players, they both liked it very much and I admit the game is growing on me.

[u]November 2010:[/u] after writing a [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/583839/multiple-player-review-meuterer]review[/url], upgraded my rating to 7.5. Not sure why I don't rate it higher though...

First game did nothing for me, but to be fair, I played this with three players, and the general consensus is that 3p is, well, crap. I can easily see 4p being a decent-to-good game -- as role selection goes, I like it better than Citadels (quicker and breezier if nothing else) but not as well as San Juan, let alone Race. I think that my problem here is that I want to be rewarded for correctly sussing out the strategic situation, and the situations where I did have a grip on what was going on and still couldn't reap the benefit or set myself up for future benefits were dismayingly frequent.

RATING: 4
I have played this with both 3 and 4 players now, and I don't see what all the fuss is about.

Meuterer uses the same basic system idea as Verrater but it adds a second conflict area at the expense of making the main conflict extremely uninteresting and luck based. The Captain does not select a role, thus role selection is much more obvious than in Verrater.

Additionally, because of the limited number of the conflict cards the ability to successfully mutiny is based more on drawing the right cards at the right time as opposed to conscious choice.

Meuterer just didn't play out well at all, it was mechanically sound, but it just wasn't that interesting: mutiny times were obvious, and there was little intrigue afoot. The best way to optimise one's score was generally very obvious as was figuring out what everyone else was up to. I would always opt for Verrater over this.

As with Verrater this game is much better than Ohne Furcht und Adel. There are some similarities between all three. This card game plays much more like a board game. The choices are very strategic. There is some luck but for a card game it&#039;s very minimal.

Played with 4. Good game. Nice artwork, rules could be clearer. Draw deck finishes fast, so you have to shuffle the discard pile rather often, however I think it is supposed to be  like this in order to give you a chance to anticipate your oponents hand. Needs more than one game to see all possibilities. Print the scoring table you find on the designers page.

A very good filler with a little more depth than the usual 30 minute filler that seems best suited to 4 players.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The cardgame is actually quite a clever little thing with some intruiging character selection. However, stay clear from the reported 2-player variant floating around here: it doesn't work. With the full compliment of 4 players it is much better, but is hampered by one annoying fact: there doesn't seem to be sufficient conflict because of the small number of conflict cards. With just 7 conflict cards in play (one being the Mate) and 4 players, approximately 3 are in play in a given round. That is enough to instigate a mutiny, but if you are not able to support either side based on what is laying open, you will not chose any of the corresponding cards because other cards might be more beneficial to your own position. For example, I have seen quite often that people chose the Merchant over one of the others simply because the Merchant at least netted them a good amount of points. The Boy is hardly ever chosen: you get 2 points, true, but you aid someone else in becoming Captain, and are stuck in the same position you started out with—worse, even, because you may have been asked to play a sword which you could have used to become the Mutineer on your own! To summarise: player intervention is rather diffuse, you can't target someone specifically. More problematically, the Captain tends to stay Captain, especially if he managed to travel to a few good islands and can then afford to bribe the mate every round. These factors marr an otherwise nice design with cute reverse psychological tricks. 

[b]Update[/b] The game was sold off, and although it didn't take up much space I still say 'good riddence'.

Components: Great artwork that is both thematic and functional. The backs of the cards could be better differentiated. Though this game is nicely designed to fit into a tiny box, I would prefer a more completely-produced version, with a score track and markers for the ships and Captain's/Mutineer's target islands.

Experience: The game proceeds briskly, though sometimes in a flurry of bookkeeping-type actions (moving the ship, flipping islands, collecting discards, returning action cards, etc.). The decisions are entertaining; deciding which island to target and which goods to sell can be as interesting as deciding which role to select.

More often than not it seems mere chance whether the goods in my hand match at all the two active islands, and their quantity is often not enough to get me any points. I can throw them away, hoping for a better hand, but while I do that, someone else is taking a better role, and I really don't know where the ship will be in the future. All seems a bit random.

Wonderful game based on Verrater. This game takes a lot of the mechanics from Verrater and themes it on the journey of a merchant ship. The ship travels to goods-buying islands at the whim of the captain, where all players can sell goods for potential victory points. However, mutiny aboard the ship can send it to a different destination. Players change roles during the game (between the Captain, Mate, Mutineer, Cabin Boy, Loading Master and Merchant), and try to gain majorities of goods to earn victory points. Quite a lot going on in this tiny card game (it&#039;s really a board game), but it&#039;s worth the effort. Excellent.

Has some decent ideas in the role selection but the trading of goods is a little frustrating as you have a small hand size and are very limited by the luck of the draw.  If your cards match the two active islands, then great.   If not, then you are hosed.   Would play some more, but it probably has a ceiling for me.

Ez a játék mintapéldája annak, hogyan kell néhány kártyalappal egy kiváló, nem túl sok szabállyal rendelkező, mégis kellő kihívást és elgondolkodást biztosító, győzelmi pont gyűjtögető játékot készíteni. Az alap játékban egy kereskedő hajón próbálunk minél jobban érvényesülni az árukártyák és a szerep kártyák segítségével. A játék ötvözi a kártyák kijátszásának optimalizálását (hogyan tudjuk a lehető legtöbb győzelmi pontot kisajtolni a lapjaink által) egy jó kis szerepválasztós jelleggel. Szokták hasonlítani a Citadellához a szerepválasztás miatt, én azonban úgy éreztem, hogy mindkettő más jellegű játék. Nem egy belépőszintű játék, mivel a szabályok átlátásához el kell telnie egy-két fordulónak, azonban a gyakorlottabb játékosoknak nem okozhat gondot. Az interaktivitás magas, lévén zendülő a játék címe, de ez csak pozitív irányba tolja a játék megítélését. A fordulók alatt kellő mennyiségű gondolkodni való akad, ami élvezetessé teszi a játékmenetet. Bárkinek jó szívvel ajánlom, akár családok is jól szórakozhatnak vele. A játékidő megfelel a leírtaknak.

What a deep game it is for just a bunch of cards! Almost every decision you have to make, and there are a lot, influences the course of the game directly.

How many and what cards do you play in your turn? When do you select what role?...

ACCESS: No desire to have access to it.

Rating history: 8...|9..|8...|7...|6

Played 15+ times. And suddenly I can't get enough of it. Decent for 3 (but a lot luckier), and awesome with 4 players. What a game! [f]

16th play: 6. Oct/14. Finally had to downgrade this to a 6. When I first played it and acquired it, it was different from anything else I own, and fit so nicely in a pocket. These days it is frustrating to have a game that only plays 4p exactly (3p isn't fun), the gameplay has gotten stale, and portability doesn't matter so much in the age of microgames. Just no reason to hang on to it or play it anymore.

Interesting game of merchants you can play on a coffee table.  The fact that I haven't played in such a long while is maybe because on the simpler side, a game like Die Fugger for example, is more accessible.

[Hand Management, Pirates, Role Selection] {4P:7, 3P: 4} Should have been a boardgame. Interesting role-changing mechanic. The pirate theme does a lot for it too. Loads of fun, and challenging on a strategic level as well. Do not play with less than four players! *** UPDATE: The problem with being only playable with 4 is that you rarely see Meuterer since there are so many other games that are great with 4. Still a nice game to have, though.

A board game in a card game box that plays well for 3-4 players.  Available in German only, though the rules are all available on this site.  It has some set collection, role selection, enticing teammates to temporarily join your cause, and a decent dose of luck in the goods/conflict cards you pick up.  Great for the 45-minute "filler" that it is.

Nagyon jópofa szerepválasztós, szállítós kártyajáték. Elég egyedi mechanizmusa van, mint minden Merkle játéknak. Nagyon hangulatos a lázadás illetve annak a leverése.
Két zavaró dolog volt csak, az is az alkatrészekkel kapcsolatban:
1. szánalmas, hogy írogatni kell a pontokat
2. Lehetne kétszer ennyi terménykártya, így gyakorlatilag minden körben kevergetni kell, ráadásul elég alaposan, mivel ugyebár előzőleg jellemzően egymás mellé kerülnek az egyformák. Az elég sok "adminisztrációt" eredményez ráadásul kötelezőnek tűnik hozzá a kártyavédő.
+1 kellemetlenség: gyakorlatilag csak négyesbe játszható.
Viszont ha négyen egy könnyed, aránylag gyors, hangulatos kártyajátékra vágytok, akkor kitűnő választás.

RATING: 8.5
For me, this has the feel that Citadels was missing- people don't often spend more than 30 seconds pulling a role, and I'm busy thinking about my next move while they are.  I also like the fact that there is more than one way to get points.  We play without knowing the running score tally to prevent the occasional kingmaker situation.

This game is about as lucky as any card game but the choices you have to make in order to maximize the return on what you are dealt are still demanding enough to provide a satisfactory gaming experience for me.

Meuterer is a fun little commodity speculation/ variant roles game that's played through cards.  At first it seems the Captain and Mutineer are the obvious choices, as the VP totals for successfully guiding your ship seemed a huge advantage over the others.  However, as the game goes on the roles really begin to even themselves out giving this little game a big game feel with many paths to victory.

This is the gamer's Citadels. The role selection is interesting and can hinder you greatly if you guess wrong on who is doing what. You don't want to passively sit by and let the captain do whatever he wants.

RATING: 9
WOW.  I just played this with three students, and it was phenomenal.  At first, the three of them predictably chose the mutineer as soon as they could, but after three rounds, they started to see the value in the other roles.  It was amazing to see them slowly grasp the strategy.  And, obviously, as is often the case when I play games, I finished last!  

Three plays in and I absolutely love it. Being captain too often actually makes it quite hard to do well. There is a lot of tension between offering points and trying to hit the right islands.

Don't make the mistake I made: assuming I wouldn't like Meuterer because I didn't like Verräter.  I found the earlier game to be ponderous and unbalanced, whereas its sequel Meuterer is neither of those things.  It's fairly light and plays quickly, yet it never becomes simplistic because you're forced to juggle several balls at once.  Adlung's second best game after Die Fugger.

Two plays. Fun but a bit klunky. The idea of having both the cards you play [i]and[/i] the number of cards you hold back be significant is a neat one, and the role selection is cool as well. On the other hand, it's unintuitive and rules-heavy for what it is, and I feel like there's a bit too much dumb luck for a game that's this involved. Players will often churn through most of their hand on their turn, so there's not a lot of long-term planning.

Overall it feels like a missed opportunity—it's a fun little oddball game, but a really good developer might have tidied it up and made it into something exceptional. I think it's telling that people praise this game more than they actually [i]play[/i] it.

RATING: 6.5
Meuterer is a 3 or 4 player pirate game that's seem at his best with 4 player.  The character that you take secretly every turn is nice.
The only character that is know at the start of each round by every player is the Captain.  The Captain score VP by reaching its destination.  He may give up some VP to get help from the Mate.  Every player can also score VP by selling the most goods.  When a player doesn't want to play a card, he passes and must choose one of the character.  The first player to pass get the first choice.
- The Mate will gain VP if the Captain reaches his destination.
- The Mutineer try to take control of the ship. If he succeed, he gain VP and become the Captain.
- The Cabin Boy help the Mutineer and will gain VP if the ship reach the Mutineer's destination.
- The Merchant get more VP if he's tie with another player for selling goods.
- The Loader draw more cards at the end of the round.

Great fun.  It plays quickly, isn't too difficult to learn, and has a bunch of player interaction, bluffing, and scheming--a very Citadels feel.

One of my all-time favorites, though it really needs four people.

rating after one play - nice meaty game for such a small package.  If you can struggle through the awkward explanation in the rule book, you'll find an interesting card game of temporary and changing partnerships through a role selection mechanism.  tough decisions to make several points through the phases in a round.  bring some chips along for scoring (and some for eating too!) if you don't want to use pencil and paper. 

more plays may raise rating.

Excellent board game masquerading unsuccessfully as a card game. Fabulous bang for the buck, tense decisions, and lots of nifty mechanics.
[EDIT] Upgraded half a point. This beauty is accessible, moves along quickly and engagingly, and demands to be loved and played. I rarely get exactly four players together, but when I do, the mutineer comes out.
[EDIT] Regrettably, luck of the draw predominates, as does the captain only sailing to the 5 point islands. Between this and Verrater is the ultimate card game, I suspect.

Ez egy tipikus táblás játék. :o) Persze modular board kategóriában.

Sokáig - félreértés miatt - úgy játszottuk, hogy az adott forduló induló és a célszigete a kereskedés helyszíne.

Így kellemes volt a bizonytalanság az egyik keresked&#337;-sziget létében. És a kereskedési tervek szorosabb kapcsolatban álltak a lázadás támogatásával illetve leverésével.

Míg ha szabályok szerint játsszuk, akkor mindig ismert a két keresked&#337;sziget, tudjuk mik lesznek az eladható áruk.

[Initial Impression: 7]
This one requires exactly four players, but it is a fun and relatively fast, hidden-role and area-influence game where you "build" the playing area out of cards.  On each turn, players play cards to "bid" for the ability to sell goods on one of two available islands.  If there's a tie, the tied players will each score less, unless one chooses a tiebreaker role card.  In addition, the captain controls the movement of the merchant ship, scoring points for taking it to a new island.  The real fun comes once a player decides to quit playing out cards and pass, taking a hidden role card.  When a player chooses the mutineer role, there is a mutiny, with the mutineer and the ship's boy fighting it out through conflict cards with the captain and the boatswain.  The captain is usually in a good position to score points, but needs to pay some of those points to the boatswain if his hand is lacking in conflict cards.  Often, there will be a mutiny and the captain will change nearly every turn.  One drawback is the limited number of cards in the deck - you're constantly reshuffling and it is easy to track played cards, which lets you calculate the likelihood of winning with your cards on each turn.  Always use the Pirate variant, as this adds an extra source of mayhem and strategy to the game.

This is really clever! There are hidden roles, but they change each round, almost Citadels-style, only you have more control. There's also a neat set-collection element, but what makes the game really work is how neatly all these things work together; the set collection affects what you'll be doing in the later trading phases, what roles you can get, etc. (1 play)

Uno dei migliori giochi di carte mai pubblicati. Perfetto ed equilibratissimo, unisce componenti di bluff ad altre di strategia e ad altre ancora di pura tattica.

Assolutamente consigliato, con un unico limite: ha senso solo se giocato in quattro.

First played August 23rd, 2007.  This takes a little more that 5 minutes to learn and plays in about an hour for a group of four.  For a deck of cards, it has amazing complexity.  You have a circle of islands with goods to trade.  A captain who decides where to go next, unless there is a conflict.  That's where the non-captain players pick a roll to play.  Of course you don't have to be against the captain, you can actually be his first mate or do other rolls.  You can also get points for supporting the captain or crossing the captain.  Very interesting.  It has a good balance of luck and strategy in it as well.  I'd recommed giving this a try and see if you like it as well.  Especially if you know someone who has it.

A thinking man's pirate/merchant card game.  I think the mechanics really blend well with the theme.  Except for that whole sell at the last two islands thingie...

What I *really* like is that it almost guarantees a good time.  Seriously, has there every been a mutiny without moans and groans?

(10/07 Update) Somehow, it just seems so inaccessible to new players.  I've had to drop my rating since there's just too many rules to get through to uncover the game I enjoy.

Nice theme and attractively illustrated cards. This is a little more substantial than most card games, with a 45-60 minute playing time and a reduced role for card luck. Careful card play, short-term tactics, educated guessing and bluff are the main elements of the game. Compared with Ohne Furcht und Adel/Citadels (which was partly inspired by Meuterer), card play is more important and role selection less so. The main limitation of Meuterer is that it's for only 3 or 4 players.

Far superior to its precursor, Verrater. Even better than Verräter due to more varied gameplay, but like its predecessor it does not work very well with three players. The trading rules (trade at the island you are at and the one you visited in the previous round) are a bit counter-intuitive, but that is about the only quibble I could find so far. Decent for 3 (but a lot luckier), and awesome with 4 players. This is a cool game! It has some strategies, nice player interaction, great theme, and cool rules!

Initial Rating: 6.0 (March 2012)

Years ago a friend explained Meuterer to me, however we could only play one round before we had to stop because more friends arrived. It took me almost 4 years to try the game again.

I bought Meuterer (and  Verräter) because I adore Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg and they are both from the same publisher (Adlung-Spiele).

Ok theme.

The cards are in German, but the game itself is language independent. The art of the cards is merely ok. The rules are pretty easy and you can explain them under 8 minutes. Playtime is around 45 minutes.

Meuterer is an ok, light-medium, role selection game. The decisions aren’t obvious but they aren’t hard either. Players have a 5 card hand, so I feel the luck of the draw is high on this one and that can decide a game (a huge negative for me). Hidden roles is one of my favorite game´s mechanisms, however I didn’t like it much here. The double-guessing is boring in Meuterer. I do like how the mutiny works but it seems trading is more important in the long run.

Best with 4 players.

I feel I would have enjoyed the game a lot more years ago, as it stands right now, my desire to play it again is low. With its reputation, I was expecting a better/deeper game, it is way too light for my current tastes. I will sell it ASAP. I hope Verräter is a lot better. All my friends liked the game more than I did though.

A fun short game.  The luck factor is balanced by the quick play.  Choosing a role (a la PR or Citadels) is not new, but the added intrigue of when to "bail" and choose your post-trading role is a great mechanic.

Nice theme and that's were part of the fun comes from. I found the rules to be difficult to explain. Once you know them it plays fast, but the constant shuffling and redistribution of the cards makes it a bit fiddly. Only played with 4. (26 dec 05 after 3 plays)

RATING: 9
Very solid strategies and mind reading skills required. My favourite aspect is gauging how many cards to sell on an island since you will sell twice (going in and leaving). Also, knowing when to strike a mutiny to match with the cards in hand.

Lots of a depth for such a compact game! Highly recommended.

RATING: 8.5
Very psychological game involving auctions, secret role selection balanced against hand management, and, most interesting, shifting alliances based on tactical situations.  As said before, "a board game hidden in a card game".  In addition to the meaty gameplay, there is beautiful artwork (done by the designer!).  Only cons are: always shuffling the goods (could have used double the goods cards assuming same ratios) and keeping score on a score sheet is fiddly and distracting (could use chits to allocate points).

It's always a blast to watch the last player pick up the remaining role cards and muse "hmmm... interesting..." as they try to deduce what's going on with everyone else.

Upgrading this slightly to a small boardgame would make for a really nice "deluxe" edition and I think would be a success in something like the FFG Silver Line.  Double the cards (so you don't have to shuffle as much).  Instead of cards for islands, use islands a la Luna.  Have some nice minis for the ships.  Use chits or gems to keep score.  And, have an "A" chit and a "B" chit for each player and on the islands, to keep separate the offers to the two different islands.

I can see why some would prefer this to Verrater.  The jury is still out with me, but it is still enjoyable.  I like the more restrictive movement of the ship, which creates a greater need to accurately manage the cards you hold.  Both of these games provide a nice level of strategy for such a low price and small box.

RATING: 7
Pretty fun little "pick up and deliver" game without the pickup ;).  And mutiny on the high sea!  I think there's a lot of technique timing here and knowing when to make a push for a particular role or to trade off a good.

I didn't quite get the feel of the timing and at several other points felt that I just wasn't drawing any useful cards.

Still, it's fairly quick, has nice role selection.  It also probably benefits from a teaching round or two, as the role selection and placing of goods is a bit difficult to describe.

A good game, but I prefer Citadels that plays with a slightly similar system. Alliancing adds a fine flavor, though, but not all of the features are tuned enough. And this is only playable with four which is bad when comparing to Citadels. The risk level is lower than in its predecessor Verräter.

There's so much depth in this little card game. The more I play this game, the more I find those tiny little details which make this game shine. Ie, a player can choose to play a lot more cargo cards and yet is most likely to be the last to choose a role. The captain can choose to play more cargo cards and yet won't be able to travel as far. A player who pass early on will be able to choose a role first but yet would not be able to trade much. Choosing the mutineer role early also reveals the player's plans to subsequent players. These and so much more. Not to mention also that the pirate variant adds to the game. Perhaps the only nitpick is that with the pirate variant, its rare in game to find the pirate event happening. From the games I played, it seems that the pirate event will at most only happen twice in game and often once and there are even games when it didn't happen at all.

It's a great game which doesn't cost you over $10. Well worth your money. I love this game. I played Varreater once and was totally confused. This game has simpler rules and it's more fun I think. In responds to someone who said something about drew deck being too small: you can re-use the discard pile as a new drew deck when it is exhuasted, so that would solve the problem of having small drew deck. Having too few hand cards can't be helped, it is part of the game.

I'm a huge fan of big games in small boxes because of the bang-for-your-buck factor, a category in which Meuterer might just hold the crown. It's gone over exceedingly well with every group I've introduced it to. I particularly like that, aside from the captain, you don't choose your role until after you're done showing wares, adding the tiniest bit of push your luck. The mechanic used to decide where the ship sails to next is brilliant. I have one complaint though: It can often be quite obvious what your best move is, leaving you feeling a bit like the game is playing itself. Then again, if you trust the game too much, you'll end up missing out on some clever plays. Overall, Meuterer is another title that has me excited for MAC-M's future designs. [b]8[/b]

What a messy card game. Rules aren't actually that messy, but the gameplay is. VP's for the single player of the single round can "swing" from 0->10 with just one righttime played card AND other players won't have a clue of that move. Whee! This is - once again - a great example of game which tries to be clever, but the result isn't that great.

Backstabbing, pirate themed card game. Looks fun, but would have to look into more. 

With the highland pacified in Verräter, we now move to the ocean. Through bluff and strategy, players try to turn against the ship's captain, seizing the profits intended to be turned at the next port. Game includes a Pirate variant.

[2007.Apr.12] With the right group of four players, this nautical-themed card game—which combines role selection and bluffing—is near perfection, especially with the pirate variant. Who will be the next mutineer?

Played a few times. There is a lot of game here for a very tiny box. That said, something seems missing and/or awkward.

I will look for a second deck to try out this variant.

Very nice role-choice game, in which you need to balance the captain&rsquo;s bonus and destination control versus the rewards of trading at ports, and early role choice versus selling lots of goods.  It involves more thought than Citadels (though still a fair amount of bluffing), and less analysis than Puerto Rico (though you still need to think).  It&rsquo;s also very portable, and has nice art on the cards.

RATING: 8
Only played it on BSW.

The more I play this game, the more I like it.  There are more layers to the strategy than are apparent the first few times you play.

Still the randomness, while not as significant as it appears at first glance, does keep it from being an all the time must play.  It is a fun, light strategy game, probably best used as an appetizer or dessert, not the main course for a night of gaming.

Definitely better with four players than it is with three, although I have played a couple fun and interesting 3p games.  It feels like it would be a very good 5-6 player game, if only it supported that many. It would up the tension and guesswork.  

Hamming it up always adds to the fun, too.

In the end I'd say it's a strong buy, if only because you will be hard pressed to find another game that is this good that is this inexpensive.  Sorry these comments are so rambling :)

I like this game. It has an interesting dynamic of needing to take a certain role but also wanting to get goods on the table. I was hoping it would be more about role deduction, but it isn't. You can pretty much tell who took what most of the time. I've only got 5 or so plays under the belt, so the rating may go up or down after time. The only reason it gets a 7 instead of an 8: everything is in German and the rules ane NOT intuitive. They seem forced. But, strangely, they work.

it doesn't take long to realise that no one wants to go to the islands that are worth less than 3 points. The game is all about hopping from a 5 points island to the next 5 points island. I think there is serious imbalance in the island cards that needs to be fixed (eg. there should be some islands that pay more points for goods but are worth fewer points as destinations, with some other islands it should be the other way round).

Rules seem counter-intuitive to me and I didn't love it. However, I would be willing to play again to see if the rules click and I get the point of the game.

06/26/06 Received. A card game that plays like a board game. I like it a good deal; a little better than Verräter. In that Mueterer not only has the conflict of that game, but an economic side as well. Though I had some difficulties teaching it as getting past the German text (as little as there was) turned out to be an initial stumbling block for some players. Its unfortunate there will never be an English version of this game. If at all possible play with the full compliment of four. For it loses *a lot* with only three. 
As of 12/12/17 I've played 16 games, almost all four-player.

My first german card game. Look really nice. Besside the constant shuffling and that the rules are unclear in the English and French traduction, it is a very solid game. After a couple of play I can say it is one of my best game for 4 players.

Not very good with 3 players.
Excellent with 4 players.

To me it feels like Citadels but plays different.  It's a set number of rounds so you know how long it will take.  There aren't as many characters.  You trade the most of commodities rather than building.  The difficulty level is about the same.  But it definitely scratches the same itch for me.  I love Citadels and this as well, however, I think both can be very group dependent.

A very fun game with many tough decisions to make. The hidden role choosing is pretty cool and there is a ton of player interaction. I played with 3 and it could have used one more player. The rating will more than likely go up with additional 4-player games.

UPDATE: 4-player game is pretty fun, much better than 3 (actually, I probably won't consider playing this with 3).

For $8.00 and it's portability, it's a steal.

Feels a little random, but I liked it. There is definitely some place for tactical play, but the best decisions are not obvious; maybe that's why it felt a little random? No downtime and fairly fast playtime -- why am I not more enthusiatic about this game?!

RATING: 7
A fun commodity collection game where players take on different roles to captain ships or stage a mutiny.  Whomever controls the ship decides where it's going to sail to which is important.  Goods are sold to one of two islands each turn (the island of departure and the new island (decided by the captain).  VPs are earned by having majorities when goods are sold.  Fairly deep for a small "card" game.  UPDATE: dropped down half a point as I'm looking forward to playing this less and less.  The card draws can be frustrating.

As of writing, this card game is only available in German. The game itself does have German text but it’s still quite language independent. English rules can be downloaded here at BGG.com as well as clarifications. 

If you like a bit of backstabbing in your games then this is a game for you! Secret roles and mutinies is the name of the game as players try to gain control of the ship and/or sell their goods to gain the largest amount of victory points. Plays fairly quickly and is quite portable. The only downside is that it only plays 3 to 4 players, which doesn’t leave much wiggle room.

Only two plays with four players, using the Pirate variant. Fun enough, but both games were marred by runaway winners. Coincidence?

Maybe I just don't get it... actually, I'm sure I just don't get it.  In my single play, I couldn't figure out the strategy  and it was just random card play.  If someone could have pointed out what I was doing wrong, that'd be one thing, but everyone else seemed to be having the same problem.  It is nice, though, to have a whole board game in a card pack.

Not a bad game. It's a little counter-intuitive, which keeps the mental gears turning the first time you play, but eventually it clicks. Drawing almost a whole new hand nearly every round, there's not much strategy here; you just do the best you can with what you've got. As such, this game is competing against an awful lot of other games I'd probably rather play.

A very clever game, with role selection and hand management being the central mechanisms. Unlike Citadels, the downtime is minimal. The tension between players exist largely based on if they should leave early for a role that could use, or stay late and trying to sell the most goods. The only thing about game that I dislike is things seem to be predictable - it's easy to imagine where the captain will locate, who is going to sell the most goods this round, if the meuterer can be successful etc. Still, for a compact card game what it delivers largely exceeds what we have expected!

RATING: 7
For a $5 card game, this is not bad. There are 12 islands arranged in a circle. Captain attempts to sail to an island after which players sell goods depicted on the island for VPs. After playing cards out of hand, other players choose roles. The traitor attempts to take over the ship, the first mate supports the captain, the deck hand supports the traitor, the handler breaks ties when selling and the cargo master gets more cards. Conflict resolved by cards with pictures of swords, other cards are just a type of good. Played twice, need to play more to see how much luck there is, especially when you replenish your hand and you get the cards (such as a specific good) you need.

Gioco divertente, poco determinante la fortuna (c'è comunque la pesca delle carte), non immediato il regolamento (alcuni esempi sono addirittura forvianti) ma una volta iniziato le meccaniche risultano semplici. Le carte sono graficamente belle, purtroppo con i termini solo in tedesco. Manca il tabellone per il punteggio e l'avanzamento dei turni ma è scaricabile da questo sito.
Difetti: giocabile solo in 3 e 4 (quest'ultimo è l'ideale), la variante in 2 non mi ha convinto.
Simpatica l'alternanza ad ogni turno delle alleanze.
Tempo per partita molto contenuto.

I like it, love the artwork, and the theme allows you to ham it up during the game; "Maaaaaate" as he comes to the captain's rescue from an evil mutineer. 

The key strategy seems to be to focus where the big points are (the trading at each port) and grab the captain / mutiny points as bonuses. The trick is how to go about this given your cards. Luck can therefore (of course) win out, but there seem to be a host of interesting decisions along the way on when to pull out, what to go for this turn, what the other players will do, anticipating where the ship will end up so as to know what to keep and what to discard and so on. Plenty of gaming in this one for a card game. Downsides are the 4 player restriction and the time it takes to teach.

戦闘でダメでもなんとかなるようになった代わりに、その要素が相当強い。結局は商品の売買がうまくいかないとどうしようも無く、そこに関しては引き運が強く影響する。で、結果主眼の戦闘の結果どうこうがどうでもよくなったりするのが残念。

Meuterer is a short role-selection card game.  The players collectively sail a ship around a circle of port cards; whoever sells the most of a good earns points.  However, most ports only buy one good, and the captain decides where the ship is going.  Another player can choose to be the mutineer to change the ship's course, and others can choose roles that support either the captain or mutineer.  Points are awarded not only for trading, but also for being on the right side of a mutiny.  It's decent, but a lot hinges on the card draws.

A four-player game behind and I was left rather cold... I came second so not because of my position.
After many stupid moves I still were able to find my way to easy points. This is a game in which a beginner is easily left behind.

I have nothing to complain about the card art. It's functional, easy to read and nicely colored - only the role cards reminded me too much about Citadels... It sure is a pretty small box with huge contents. 

I won't turn down an opportunity to play this again - I just need some time to reload my interest.

Much more enjoyable than Verrater, with a nice blend of strategies possible.  Not nearly so mathy, with combat very simple.  A nice group of clever mechanics (captain offering points, cards in hand determine location, each island sells different goods, etc.) fit together really smoothly for a nice tight game without any of the questions of "what's going on?" that Verrater produces.

After bringing Meuterer twice to the club but never finishing it because we started too late in the evening, I got 3rd time lucky. It’s a very interesting game that mixes role taking (à la Citadels, which this game inspired) and selling a majority of goods. It’s very tightly knit, mechanics-wise, and takes the initial rounds (out of 8 total) to get your head around, but it’s worth it. The most-thumbs-up review on BGG gives a very good list of the decisions involved. I’ll be happy to bring this again and try the pirate variant.

This is a really good game compared to how small it is. Really engaging, interesting decisions, it can even bring some table talk that matches thematically (let's conspire against the captain). There is a luck of the draw but if you're good enough, you can still gather some points with bad cards. We accidentally played with 6 cards in hand for a while (rules say 5 cards), I think this can help a bit with the luck problem and it doesn't change the game at all. It's said to be best with 4 players, but we usually play it with 3 and I still really enjoy it. We even tried with 5 players and it still worked.

I'm a sucker for card games, but this one could just as easily be a board game with the addition of a board (duh) and a few plastic bits and pieces. The role selection and trading elements of the game are linked together really cleverly - much more so than in Citadels where I always find the building part of the game much less interesting than the role choosing. The downsides are that there's no English version (although its perfectly playable in German) and that it only really works with exactly four players. But for its tiny size and reasonable price, it's definitely worth having it in your collection.

As of this writing, I've only played Meuterer one (half = 4 rounds) time. For a micro box game, it sure packs a punch in terms of interesting decisions in each turn.

While the game play is fairly easy, the continuous point tracking using pen-and-paper can be somewhat tedious and error-prone. In addition, it seems that the captain has an advantage especially if nobody initiates a mutiny because then he gets the docking points on every turn. However, this is more likely a deliberate design so as to motivate frequent mutinees. I will probably refine my opinion on the game as I play more but right off the bat, it is a 6, and is likely to go up marginally than down.

The upside:
-Props for the price and the footprint.
-I think there's more than enough potential, but found hard to teach, not the rules, but the apparent strong meta-game needed to shine.

The downside:
-Only with a certain type of players it will shine.

Recommended for 4 players. For 3 players the game loses soooooooooooo much. Each player chooses its role in the ship during the 8 turns trip and sells goods in the active islands. Some islands are useless (usually the ones with barrels).

Pretty genius mechanics for such a small deck of cards. I love the way ships move around the "board" and the subtle intimidation in laying down certain cards. Still, this feels like it should support more players somehow...

Quite a good bluffing/treachery game.  I think Verrater is a better game but Meuterer is simpler and more stable.  My hunch is that the roles are smoke and mirrors which make the fun and that the trading decides the game. My fear is that the trading is decided by luck of the draw...

I have to try this game a few more times to solidify the rating.  Played with 3 and something seemed to be missing.  I think with 4, and a fight with the Captain, Boatswain, Mutineer, and the Ship's Boy would make the game much better.  I do like the theme and the flow of the game.  Things change up quite often and very little down time.  The small package makes this a great one to bring along to game nights.

--Sep2009-- Heh.  Only had it in the collection for 8 years before the first play.  And my friends weren't that enthusiastic this time, either!

On the downside, there's not much overall arc from first turn to the last:  one turn is much the same as its predecessor.

Great role selection game.  This game encourages multiple plays since often , new players will ignore the Mutineer in favor of less, more attainable points.  Games with a lot of mutiny are very interesting and that is were the game shines.

A hard game to explain the rules for. It's another Adlung game bigger than the box size lets on. Unfortunately it's also a bit of a popularity and bash the perceived leader contest. It should be fun, but I've never really had fun playing it. I prefer games with a touch more than control than you get here. I greatly prefer Ohne Furcht und Adel for a lot of reasons, but chiefly for its more accommodating player number flexibility.

You can't get more for this kind of money.  A peculiar ship goes from port to port while its crew tries to get the most profit selling goods everywhere.  The captain and his/her suporter will also score points to achieve the different destinations, but the mutineer and his/her partner want those points for themselves.

I liked this one quite a bit. Hidden roles done well. 4-player only, please. 

The phases and flow are somewhat unwieldy, but I think they'll come with time. My one concern is: With only 6 Conflict cards in the deck, choosing to Mutiny is based more on either drawing a couple yourself or hitting the Captain if he's just used a couple to quell a Mutiny so you know he's low, than to any real decision on my part. 

Update: The shine is coming off this one. Some great mechanisms, but it feels so dependent on good card draws that it's hard to feel in control. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game seemed really fascinating the first time I played, because the captain role kept shifting around the table.  The second time, no one seemed to be willing to go up against me as captain so it was less competitive.  If no one chooses the mutineer role, the game comes down to a lot more luck.

Mutiny on the high seas! After playing with 4 players, I can say that this is a fun, tense card game of second/out guessing your rival  merchants with whom you will sometimes be cooperating to hold a mutiny on board your vessel and overthrow the ship’s current captain. 

It’s certainly a neat small-box card game with a sort-of dense ruleset that is somewhat difficult to explain easily and quickly. We eventually opted to play a practice round to feel out the various game phases-etc, and we just went on playing from there.

I imagine increased plays with familiar players would see some particular patterns and expectations emerge via the “groupthinking hive mind” or whatever.

Cool game.

Little card game that makes a nice 4 player boardgame. Uses character selection method seen in Citadels which has double guessing but also has an interesting movement system based on the number of cards in hand.

RATING: 5.5
Played it again with gamers and can evaluate it more properly. 

The problem with Meteurer is that it's hard to explain to the kind of people who would most want to play it (nongamers, casual gamers). Second problem is that you have to shuffle your deck almost every round. Plus you really have to play it with 4 players. And you have to print the scoring track, makes it more intuitive to understand who you have to gang up against. 

But for four players who will endure the explanation it's probably better than Citadels. The storyline is more gripping ([i]we have to fight the captain, the bastard is getting new points every round[/i])and you are more involved with what the other players are doing (bidding with goods, looking where the ship will go).

As of now, I have played 2 4P games. The gameplay is much simpler than the rules let on, though it could possible be due to me failing to find a way to explain the rules in a more streamlined manner. The hidden role selection creates some interesting decisions on when to opt out of the offering phase and take on a role. Makes for a good filler, although the deck could have used a little more of each goods cards.

Kicsit Citadellára hajazó hajózós kártyajáték. A kapitány mellett 5 szerepből választ a másik három játékos és a hajóút során különböző árukat adnak el, minél többet egyből megszerezve a többséget. A szerepek minden körben változnak, egyedül a kapitány tarthatja meg, ha jól sáfárkodik a cél elérésekor kapott pontjaival. Némi kooperativitás is van a játékban. A kapitányt és a zendülőt is lehet segíteni egy-egy szereppel. Jól kivitelezett, kis helyen elférő jó átvezető játék. Nekem jobban tetszett, mint a Citadella.

Cleverly combines a few simple elements into something more complex, with lots of interesting decision-making and second-guessing. Selling goods is only one way (and maybe not the most important way) to gain points; controlling the ship's destination, and knowing when to take sides in a mutiny, can be big point-winners. The Pirate variant adds great opportunities for hosage. The rules require careful reading, and even then leave some things unclear; be sure to consult the examples.

Although Meuterer's rules are not terribly complicated, it's a rather tough game to wrap your mind around. Especially which goods can be sold is always tripping up someone.

[Adlung 2000 edition] {Pirate; partnership, role-selection, hand management, bluffing; optimal 4p} {basic game 7, pirate-variant 7} A thematic pirate game. There are many things to do in a round but there is little down time. There is quite a lot of player interaction in Meuterer. The decisions in Meuterer are usually straightforward.

The fun depends much on the mindset of the players. If the players are aggressive, there are more mutinies and it is more fun. Otherwise, if players never challenge the captain, Meuterer may be a little dry. 

The art work is good. The hints on the cards are very helpful. It's a good choice as a family game with such a low price and quality.  Meuterer is not language independent, the rules and cards are printed in German; though it doesn't the game play much.

Rating likely to go up after more plays.  More depth than appears on the surface.

Update: I love everything about this game.  Once you have the rules down it is a very balanced and interesting game.  The small size of the box makes it extremely portable.

The inherent power of the Captain role is right at the edge of being too good which really encourages dissension if played correctly and leads to the inevitable mutiny. The flexibility of the Mate's bonus (0-3) points can help the Captain stay in command longer until the inevitable coup.  

In the meantime, the loader and merchant are cleaning up on the trade points while the rest of the players swap control of the ship back and forth.

My rating is based upon play on BSW.  I own the cards, but had to learn online since I had a hard time figuring out the instructions (even in English...but my fault, not the translated instructions).  Really enjoy the Citadels-like qualities, but a major upside is there are fewer roles to choose from.  This also makes the decision to finish the trading round harder.  Online games are 15 minutes since the math is done for you....however, I REALLY look forward to teaching this game to some friends to play in real life.

RATING: 5
The rules proved a bit confusing to our group at first (somewhat ususual, as this is an experienced game group), which didn't help matters. What bothered me more was the luck factor is very, very high here. Some people are just dealt four of a kind turn after turn, selling at port after port, while other players might spend three turns trying to collect enough of one commodity to be able to sell, and might still get beat out when they finally play them. Or, more accurately, those luck swings coupled with limited control any player has over the selection of ports and whether the captain or mutineers win (often based on whether you were dealt a bunch of sword cards or not) left me feeling a bit flat.

Lived up to all my expectations and more.  My gaming group loved it, although there was some confusion concerning a few aspects of commodity sales on Highland and Pirates Nest.  Once those issues were resolved the rest of the pilot game went smoothly.  This is definitely on my list of games I'd like to play regularly.

One of the better card games out there. It has excellent game mechanisms. There is some luck of the draw but what do you you expect from a game about mutiny and pirates? Aaarrrgh! You will play it a lot of times and you will enjoy it even more as the time passes.

RATING: 7.5
In [thing=902][/thing] players are seamen in a merchant ship, with the goal to sell goods in several islands while the Capitain tries to hold the control of the ship against constant mutiny attempts. 

This happens because the Capitain of the ship receives points accordingly to the island the ship will arrive, and the Mutineer might want to sieze these points to himself. To defent the Capitain can have the help of the Mate, but, in order to make this more attractive, the Capitain can offer points (from 0 to 3) to the person that takes the role of Mate. The Mutineer can also have the help of the Cabin Boy, as this one will gain 2 points if the mutiny is successful. Finally, there are two more roles: the Merchant, that makes his offers worth more when tied with others; and the Loader, which, at the end of the round, will receive three extra cards - but the player will have to discard 3, the Loader just helps to make the hand of cards better for the next round.

The offer of goods starts with the Capitain, by putting one good card in the table. Then every other player, in clockwise order, will be able to put, 1 card at a time, good in front of themselves. The island in which the ship is docked shows the type of good the islanders want, and only these can be sold there - there might also be another island "active", which will be the last one the ship docked, and players can also sell goods there, but also only the ones accepted there. The players can put more than one type of good in the table, however, each one can only sell one type, and to only one of the island (if there is more than one available).

In the offer goods phase, players can also put Conflict cards in the table, as these are among the good cards, though they can't be sold. The Conflict cards only help to defend the Capitain or to help the Mutineer.

Once a player decides to pass, he will take the role cards available and choose one for himself. So, the first player to pass will have all 5 (Mutineer, Mate, Cabin Boy, Merchant and Loader) roles available, the second, four roles, and, so on. The roles are kept hidden, but, of course, the second, third and fourth player to take roles will know which ones were taken, though not all of them will know who took what.

After everyone have passed, the roles are revealed. If someone took the Mutineer role, there will be a contest for the position of Capitain. All the roles involved in the contest (Capitain, Mutineer, Mate and Cabin Boy), starting from the Capitain and going clockwise, will have now one chance to play Conflict cards. The Mate role counts as a Conflict card. If the Capitain side has a higher amount of Conflict, the Captain wins the contest and keeps the position - the Mate will receive one extra point. In case of a tie or if the Mutineer side has more Conflict, the mutiny succeeds - the Mutineer takes the role of Captain and the points of the destination island; and the Cabin Boy gets two points.

The ship will move clockwise to the new destination island accordingly to the number of cards in the hand of the Captain (or the Mutineer that took the role of Captain). It is possible that the ship won't move, if the Captain doesn't have cards in hand - so it will stay in the same island. If the ship moved, the destionation island will be activated, being flipped to the light side, while the last island will also stay activated - goods can be sold in any of the two.

Now the points for selling goods will be given. Only the player that sell the most goods of the correct type makes the sell, but tied players with the same highest total also gain points, even though a lower amount. For instance, if the island is Affeninsel, the good the islanders want is grain. If a single player offered the highest amount of grain cards, he will get 2 points. If two players are tied for the highest amount, each of them will get 1 point.

After the distribution of points, all the player draw back to 5 cards in hand (the Loader gets to 5 then 3 more), and a new round will start. At the end of the 8th round (or 9th when playing with 3 players), the player with the most points will be the winner!

[floatright][ImageID=1341273medium][/floatright][thing=902][/thing] showed itself as a pretty interesting game, and is noticeable that, even though it is a card game, [thing=902][/thing] passes the feel of a full-fledge board game, with board and pieces, since the island cards basically make a "board" and the ships (as it is possible to play with the variant of the Pirate ship) also stays in the table. [thing=902][/thing] offers, also, loads of decisions to be made by the players: go heavy on sells, try to sieze control, offer nice deals for the Mate, steer the ship to the most favorable island (and also prepare yourself for it, keeping cards in hand or going for the Loader; or try to force a mutiny, to prevent the ship from going to a island or to make the ship go elsewhere), when to pass (vying for a certain role). Plenty to think and to do for everyone at the table, and everything happens in the concise time of 45 to 60 minutes.

It worth mention that in [thing=902][/thing] the status of the game is all player driven. The Captain, if players allowed, can keep the job for a long time, as it won't automatically passes over to someone else - and here there is room for some politics at the table, something that I liked very much. Also, everyone can go deep in offers and conflict, since the hands re-fills at the end of every round - so the "withdraw" here is more to take a role or to save goods to sell at another place. Is even possible to empty the whole hand to try something new next round.

Though not everything is praise, but the things that aren't, are of very little concern: first, [thing=902][/thing], if I'm not mistaken, was only published in german - even though it is, indeed, language independent, you lose the aid cards and the auxiliary text on the cards. Also, is required, to be played, pen and paper, to mark points and rounds - luckly, not things you will have to worry too much to get, and even a cellphone can do this nowadays.

Anyaway, [thing=902][/thing] passed with flying colors by my quality test, truly earning the epithet of " hidden gem", which we see thrown around to lots of games, specially those in the wasteland of Unknown Praiseworthiness that are the 501-1000 spots in the BGG ranking ([thing=902][/thing] is, currently, in 527th). And when considering [thing=902][/thing] is 15 years old (was released in 2000) it is worth mentioning that I can't remember seeing a game that work in the same way, except the very predecessor of [thing=902][/thing], which is [thing=72][/thing], from the same designer. Which is weird to me, considering how well everything was put together and the fun it allows to happen throughout, and this make me even more glad to get to know it.

Easily recommended.

RATING: 6.5
I was pleasantly surprised with this game, considering it is less popular than Citadels and was supposed to have provided some inspiration for it. Meuterer is the cleverer design, though I'm not sure how much better a game it is.

I like how one may choose to not get involved in a Captain vs. Mutineer fight, via choosing a role that gets an unrelated perk that could be more valuable. A clever way of preventing all attempted mutinies from looking the same.

The fact that ship destination is based on number of cards not played definitely forces you to think, but so often I feel like there aren't any great options there. I think it might be better to give players a little flexibility in where to set the ship destination.

The lack of long-term strategy bothers me. I played half of a game, felt tired, and could not think of any reason why I should play out all the rounds, considering how every round pretty much feels like a self-contained game.

Only played this once and with three players sofar, but I clearly see its potential with four. The rules seem complex on paper, but once you start playing they are really easy to grasp and teach. In some ways it shares similarities with Citadels, but I like it a lot better. This may have to do with the fact that it has a much more acceptable playing time and the fact that there is hardly any downtime.

RATING: 4
I am  not quite sure what the fuss is about the game. We had trouble getting this game off the ground and even after things settled down, we still didn't get much fun out of the game. One of the basic premise of the game is to fight the mutiny (if you are the captain) or to initiate a mutiny. However, there are so few limited conflict cards and your hand size is small. Only 5 cards. Thus, most of our mutineers could not even launch a successful attempt. That is not entirely surprising since you only have a limit of 5 yards. Another area of confusion comes from the scoring of two islands. Why have two scoring locations? This absolutely does not make any thematic sense. I keep wondering if I played anything incorrectly...... otherwise, the ranking of the game doesn't really any sense.

RATING: 7.5
I finally got to play this once.  Four player games are hard to get to the table.  I really should have printed out an abreviated rules sheet/player aid because the translation I used was complete, but really made the game seem more complex than it was.  In truth, this is a very simple game.

I expected the game to be more like a hidden role game, but I should have known better.  Since the roles are constantly changing, as in Citadels, the role selection is a very tactical choice, and does not have the feeling of deception like Werewolf, Bang, or Saboteur.

That doesn't mean the role selection is uninteresting.  If you don't have alot of goods to sell, you get first choice of the roles.  If you choose later, you get to see what roles are missing, and may have to adjust your plans to match.  If someone took the Meutineer, but no-one took the first mate, you have to decide who offers more points.

Unfortunately, the other way to get points, selling goods, seems much less interesting.  The goods you have are strictly limited to what you draw, and the luck of the draw can net you alot, or very few points.

I enjoyed my first play, but I won, and felt mostly in control during the game.  Other players seemed to feel that luck was an overriding factor, and I can see how they could be right.  My rating will rise or fall, depending on who's right.

Watch the rules on which islands you're selling at, the second time we played we were selling at the island the captain sailed to, an error which made the captain win by a landslide.

Starts out fun and is at least interactive. Goes on a bit too long for what is really a pretty light game, especially since there's a bit of a runaway leader problem (I had some early winfalls my first game and it was mathematically impossible for anyone to catch me 2 rounds from the end in a 9-round game). It also suffers from one of the most anticlimatic endgames I've come across - all the other players had a "wait, it just stops?" sort of reaction once we reached the end.

One of those games I would play if it was the only one available, but I'd much rather play other things.

Brilliantly simple rules and smooth game play provide for an amazingly light but wholly engaging romp. Each round is packed with fun-filled, interesting options (threats to display, roles to play, goods to sell) that make plotting your course entertaining as well as rewarding. Make a bad decision one round? It really won't hold you back the next. I feel good about this game even when I lose miserably. 

This game could do with an English language version. Fortunately, the wonderful community here has pitched in and given those of us who do no speak German translations of all we need to learn and play the game! All in all, a slight inconvenience.

I was disappointed by this game.  The good options open to you seem to be dictated by your hand alone.  Do what your hand wants you to and you can do very well, but that just involves discerning what course your hand wants you to take, and following it.  I found this to make for few interesting decisions during the game, which is odd as the nature of the game (with the choosing to mutiny or not) seems like it would lead to lots of interesting decisions.

On the block.

A decent blend of mechanics (role selection, hand management and a bit of set collection) in a small boxed game.

Definitely play with the pirate ship because that always garner the most laughs, but with the fact that there is only one movement card for it means it probably won't get to rob more than twice.  Ok for the price you pay.

Cracking value for money game , given that its a fairly cheap deck of cards , that plays more like a board game.

RATING: 6.5
An interesting game with a quirky tempo. It is certainly a "bigger" game than its size would suggest. Good choice for 4 players who enjoy tactical games.

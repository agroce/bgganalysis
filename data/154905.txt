This one has a bit of the San Juan vibe to it. The theme is nicely integrated I think and the game is very straightforward. But it doesn't have anything memorable to it either. The card selection is few - only about 12 unique cards in the game - which I imagine limits replayability and on-going interest.

Like Rummy, but more Beery...

A quick, light filler game that has a little strategy in how to use the card's special abilities to build up your brewery for the best scoring combos.

I've taken this into work to play with my boss and another engineer, neither of whom are gamers and it went down very well.

Second favorite in the Dice Hate Me 'Rabbits' line, it's a super light, intuitive alternative to the Brew Crafters board game that you can bring with you anywhere. Very easy, you either play down cards to use for their abilities, or use cards as ingredients for recipes that you score. Play to 21 Rep. With 4 players, you play in teams of two. Good time, portable fun, the theme will appeal to a lot of non-gamers also.

nifty little card game. Pretty compact so you can say it is a travel game, but you will need a bit of surface space to spread out your cards. Nice little combos that you can pull off. What really gets me is the theme, love craft beer, so yes I am sucker for this game.

RATING: 5
Honestly a forgettable and slightly boring experience. Nothing special it is more like the usual Euro style tableau building game and there are multiple far better ones in this field. I guess that is what happens since every year hundreds of new games have to come out. A lot of them are actually worse than the older classics of their respective niche.

Rated after 2 plays @ 2 players.

A light card game about collecting sets of ingredients that can be turned into beers (points) or used in your brewery (playing space in front of you) for extra points or special abilities. Not too much depth other than trying to figure out how to specialize your brewery cards to chain the best bonuses and also knowing what ingredients are left in the deck. Cards are multiple uses so there is a trade off of whether to save them for a beer or get the special ability.

Not a game I'd play every day but a good filler for those times you don't want deep thinking. Rules are easy to explain to new players and game lasts the right amount of time. The 4 player game is setup as team play and I'm curious how that will work.

RATING: 7
A simple cardgame that has more depth than would appear at first. This is mainly due to the dual nature of the cards, with both the ingredients needed to make the recipes and the needed upgrades that will insure that you can get a good engine going. Since you cannot both play an upgrade and complete a recipe on the same turn, this has as an additional side effect of forcing you to decide what is best to do on your turn: expand or get points.
Add to this decision point the fact that the game end is triggered as soon as someone scores 21 points and you get even more interesting decisions as even the smallest recipes score 3 points, and that's if you don't have an equipment to grant you bonuses.
Lots of interesting decisions in a really small package and a short playing time: good game, can't wait to play again.

RATING: 7
Decent little euro-style card game. I enjoyed it even though the theme did not interest me. 4-player game is played as two teams.  I usually don't like team games because most times it seems like one player dominates, but with this game I really felt like team members contributed equally.  As name implies, it's extremely portable.

Nice little engine building game with a beer crafting theme. Nothing spectacular or new, but it simply works and plays fast with 2. As it's in essence a solitaire game with linear play time, it will drag a bit with 3 and certainly with 4, which makes it a 6 instead of an 8

Played this one a number of times now and I really quite enjoy it for what it is. I don't know if I'd necessarily want to play this over full Brew Crafters, but for a filler game it's got interesting decisions and a nice, short playtime. The end of some games can feel like they happen just as you're getting a decent engine going, but that's about the only bad thing I can think of.

Having played the original this was an open and play in 2 minutes game.  The simple ruleset didn't keep us from playing twice in a row though.  Has a classic feel, not in a bad way.  Not the best filler out there but pretty good overall.  Quick and you do care what the other players are doing since it is a race for the most part.

RATING: 5
Pleasant, light weight, fast moving, simple. Not much to think about. You put together ingredients for the brews and convert them to points or play a worker or equipment which give permanent discounts to future brews, a bonus pick off the table or free play out of your hand, or bonus points at the end of the game. Your usual euro framework distilled (hah!) down into the most banal and bland package. 

Still, for the price point (I paid a little over $6 mail order), and it's super compact size, I don't really have anything to complain about. There is nothing compelling about it to get me to play again but I would not be against it, either.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (July 2015)

I hear Brew Crafters is a deep game (I still haven’t played it), so I though the travel edition would be similar in some fashion but it isn’t. Brew Crafters: The Travel Card Game is very shallow and obvious. It comes with few cards so I think replayability is also low.

I’m disappointed because I usually enjoy games in which cards have multiple uses, but here the best option is fairly obvious. Perhaps it is best with two players. Its main strengths are: 1. It is very easy to teach. 2. It play very fast.

The theme was interesting to some friends, but it didn’t do anything good or bad for me. I don’t dig the art.

Bottom line, it is way too light for me. I already sold it. I really hope Brew Craters have A LOT more meat than the travel edition. I will find out soon.

Brew Crafters: The Travel Card Game is a great game in a small package.  I really enjoy games where the cards have multiple uses, in this case ingredients and special powers.  The flow of the game is perfect.  Pick two cards, brew, play a card into your brewery or pass.  I like that there's almost always something to do.  If you can't brew, you can usually play a card in your brewery.  Very rarely do you feel it's a must to pass.  Clever and fun game.

A San Juan/RFTG-like game, where cards can be used for their printed ability or as a resource. The game is very engine-based -- it's very much about identifying strong combinations of cards in your hand, and finding ways to get those cards to the table as quickly as possible. Not sure how similar this is to the source Brew Crafters game (which I understand is strongly inspired/influenced by Agricola) - it seems to be similar only in theme, not so much gameplay. It's a decent game, fairly light, since it does not have the Role Selection element of San Juan / RFTG / Glory to Rome.

RATING: 5.5
Wasn't expecting much of this one... it's one of those quick filler type micro-games, but this one was a bit to simple for my taste...

At least it seemed to us that the strategy of the game is pretty straight forward and there isn't a lot of variety on the cards so you get to play almost the same things...

My Brewery was a bit more "efficient" than João's because I had the 2 cards that give end game bonus points and João didn't... but of course in the next game he knows he has to play them...

Other than that, I think we had all the same cards, maybe with one difference...

All our brew's were of the most "difficult" recipe, my final one was one step bellow because that's what I could do when João triggered the end game...

It felt a bit to constricted the game with little real choices to be made

Nothing wrong per se except that the game is forgettable.  I feel like I am going through the motions but not really making any choices.  The game is balanced but all the choices seem obvious.  It's fast, but not engaging.  If you like the theme, it is a pleasing experience.  If you don't care about the theme, then it is inoffesively forgettable.

The low number of distinct cards removes luck swings but it also makes everybody feel like they are pursuing the same strategy.  There is little differentiation between players except for some obvious specialization, which doesn't really feel any different.  So, replay value suffers.

One of our favorite 2P games. The game is superbly easy to learn, amazingly straightforward to play and combines some great mechanisms (set collection, hand management, engine building, etc) with a great theme. The game plays in about 15minutes and takes about 3 minutes to teach (I've taught this game about 20 times to a variety of people comfortable and new to modern board gaming). Honestly, one of the slickest lighter card games that still has an amazing amount of meat on the game and causes some agonizing decisions (do I use the card for its effect or to brew? Do I start an engine quickly and stack bonuses for certain brews? If so, my opponent may be brewing beer before I  can finish, etc). Love love love it

From "Let's brew some beers in 30 minutes!" to "Whatever, let's just open a beer" in 30 minutes.

There is so few card variation (besides multi use cards are nice) and it has a chunky game end that a nice theme becomes just a very uninspired engine building card game.

Interesting simple little game, plays a little like San Juan light with the multiple card uses. Doesn't really have a lot under the hood though. Good as a light 30-minute filler, not much else.

A nice light card game. Build a small engine of workers & equipment as you race to brew up 21 points of beer. Might be more interesting with 3 than 2. 4P is supposed to be teams. Worth a try, especially since there aren't many of those, making this a good couples' game, perhaps.

Just tried it out on a pub with two friends. 
The game was very simple to get in to. Some variation in the cards may have made it even more entertaining. Different strategies were used between players, and it seems to be a fun short game, that offers reward for sticking to the specific strategy. Easy to learn and good for playing with people who like the beer.

All in all a good, quick game, easily kept in the pocket.

This is a quick card-game version of the Brew Crafters worker placement game.  Really, it's not a card game "version" of Brew Crafters but rather a completely different game with the same theme.

In this card game players take turns drawing cards Ticket to Ride-style from a set of 5 face-up cards and a face down deck.  The cards have ingredients on them as well as equipment or workers that give special abilities.  After you are finished drawing you can either combine a set of ingredients to brew beer for points or you can place the equipment or worker in your tableau.

This continues until a player reaches a point threshold and plays pretty quickly.  This is a fine enough game, it plays quick and its fun and I really like games where cards have multiple functions and the opportunity cost you have to decide between when using them for one purpose or another.  However I also think with such a small card pool there are clearly superior options and once those are identified the game is a bit luck heavy wherein you need those cards to show up on your turn (or draw them from the top by chance) and you need them early or other players are going to abuse those options first.

Just another small box, set collection card game. Not sure there are many choices to be made. The theme is glued on. It is an average in most all respects and perfectly playable quickly and the instructions are easy to explain. 

While I know that this is supposed to be a small quick filler game, there are much better ones that fit the bill. As a strong upside, the game is playable and has no other faults, other than being run of the mill.

Simple engine-building game with multi-use cards. Players either play a set of cards for their ingredient values to brew a beer (from a simple ale up to a fancy special reserve) or play one of them to their tableau ("brewery") for persistent bonuses like ingredient discounts or additional points.

At 30 minutes with new players including rules explanation it's quite a stress-free way to pass the time. The problem with it, if that's the right word, is that it is so strikingly bland that its greatest accolade appears to be that it is not obviously broken. I would prefer something with a little more to it.

This actually works really well as a travel game, just as advertised in the name. The deck has enough variety that you will probably have to use a different strategy each game, yet few enough cards that a non-hardcore gamer can grasp them all, and it plays well with just two. We've played it in several hotel lobbies.

[Dice Hate Me 14 Edition] {Wine; card-drafting, set-collection, partnership; optimal 3p} Brew Crafters is a simple set-collection filler.  Players try to collect resources to score more points in brewing.  Some action cards provide bonus victory points or let players have better efficiencies in action.

The card illustration is practical, not attractive.

The team play mode looks bolted on for me.  It doesn't really increase the fun of game.  It seems to me that the purpose of this rule is allow the publisher states that this game supports 4p to attract wider audience.

This is an easy to understand filler. There are low number of distinct cards. So the novelty wears off quickly. What remains is a game that lacks enjoyment and humor.

Fast, smart filler. Hint of engine building, plays in 10 minutes tops.

Addendum: finally played with 4. The team variant may have been added due to component limitations, but we loved it.

Simple card game.  I am a beer drinker, and this is one of those games where its not super complex, and its just fun to sit around and play while drinking a beer.  Plus, its made for three players, not many games are good with 3.

This game is portable, easy to explain, and quick to play. The card design is clear and readable, and the theme tends to capture people's attention. My biggest beef with it is that the box isn't big enough to hold the cards after they have been sleeved, so I have to store the game in a sandwich bag separate from the box. Bummer.

Super light filler version of a much more involved Agricola clone about brewing beer... Has a San Juan vibe with using cards as resources or as permanent abilities... Cool, but limited replay value since there aren't that many different cards in the game...

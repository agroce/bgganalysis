nice cross between boggle and scrabble. one or 2 interesting variants around. Tisby is a heavier game word game fans might enjoy.

RATING: 6
Akin to Scrabble with cards. Works really well and we found it resonated best with people who were unfamiliar with gaming in general as it's not hard to get into the game. In some ways, the setup for this appeals to me more than Paperback, it's certainly mechanically easier to grok and play.

Kind of like Scrabble, in that you try to make words out of the letters you have in your hand and the weird letters are worth more points, combined with Rummy. Since you can make multiple words at once, you can almost always use your whole hand at once unless you're unlucky and get no vowels or something.

RATING: 6.5
One major improvement over the mechanically similar Five Crowns.
Part of Quiddler's appeal is certainly the attractive Medieval Celtic lettering on the cards. I find it far more suspenseful than Scrabble, since you have no idea when the other players are going to go out. Quiddler solitaire is dreadful. As well, the more players involved, the more boring Quiddler can be, as you wait forever for the opponents to make their moves. I would probably recommend Quiddler for 3 or 4 players, and certainly never more than 5.

RATING: 5
What's up with the challenging system in this game? The game allows you to 'bluff' words but that's total crap. Challenging a word slows the game down, and can REALLY knock a player out of the game. Just take it out of the game. Oh man, and don't talk about the luck. One time, I went out on the first turn (I'm awesome btw) and one of the other players was stuck with a hand full of consonants, and drew a consonant, and lost a bajillion points. Or uh, got zero? I don't know. Also, did you know quod is a word? Heh, same guy challenged me on that one. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Randomness that may result in all vowels or all consonants really hurts the game. With 6 players you only had 1-2 rounds to make words, which isn't enough time to counteract the randomness.

This game can get kind of boring, and moves too fast.  Someone always goes out immediately, meaning everyone else has to scramble to play.  It's OK, just not a whole lot of fun.  I bet a better game could be made from the cards.

This is a good game for the scrabble crowd or those who don't play a lot of board games.  Definitely for a different segment of folks other than the ones who like analytical games.

Tends to bring about a lot of turn angst, as players first try to decide if they want to take the last discard, then whether they want to go out, then which card to discard.  Although the rules allow dictionary consultation, it only makes the game go even slower, so I recommend against it.

Another word game that I would rather avoid, but unfortunately Rikki loves it.  The rules even permit a dictionary at the table for people to search when it's not their turn, this just takes out the knowledge requirement and adds to the analysis-paralysis.  It's just so luck-based that it doesn't offer enough for my taste.

RATING: 6.5
better than scrabble.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This seems to be a popular game with whoever I play it with, but popular opinion is that the rules are missing ... something.  Whether allowing for extra rounds before going out, or allowing to achieve a negative score to add to the complexity of challenges, or abolishing the most words score.  There is definitely a good game here, and luck is certainly a factor (as it is with Scrabble and most word games), but it's just missing that one perfect rule that will fix all the middling imperfections and power it up to the upper echelon of casual games.  House rules are highly recommended, although I have yet to play it with one.

Scrabble + Phase10 - (Someone's ability to run away and hide with a victory) = Quiddler.

I've been playing word games as long as I could spell. This is my new favorite. It goes to every family gathering. (Who do you think taught me to play word games?) Everyone plays. Everyone from my youngest cousins to my grandmother. Great game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
As much as I like word games, this one is kind of broken, I think.  The problem occurs once you get to the rounds where there are 5  cards in your hand--with four or more players, someone almost certainly can go out with their initial draw, so often people get at most 1 turn to improve their hand.  There's really not much strategy beyond anagramming your initial cards and earning the number of points you were dealt.  Maybe it's just my scrabble-bias talking.
Of course, I like anagramming, so I can be convinced to play this.

My mom loves word games and requests this frequently.  My wife requests this as well to a lesser extent.  You receive letters, make words, add up the score, and repeat.  As word games go, and I generally like them, this one gets boring for me.  I'll play it when my mom or wife suggest it, but I doubt I'll suggest it myself.  One bonus of this game is the cards can also be used to play PDQ, a Gamewright game.

Never Played, Cards Still in Shrinkwrap
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
While I can't argue with word games as I love making words out of raw letter material, this one skimps on the rest of the game.  It's supposed to play kind of like a ramping up Gin Rummy with words, but unfortunately, with competent players it seems that SOMEONE goes out on the first round no matter what, and it can mean that if you got a terrible draw you simply won't have any opportunity to do anything about it.  Any strategy that might have been intended is gone once you only get a single turn.

It could work MAYBE with some slight variations (perhaps only one word can be played per round), but frankly I'd have to try it to see if that would actually work.

Despite my complaints, it'd probably make a nice, casual family fun night, and I'd recommend it for someone looking for such a thing.  Just don't expect too much from it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I am not a word game fan, but this one I almost like.  Good points: players have no time limit which allows them to consider all their options; the double letter combination cards give variety and open possibilities; it is simple to learn and quick to play.  Bad points: luck driven and it's a word game...which for me is a negative thing. :-)

I want to like this game, but all too often - particularly in the later rounds - someone only needs a single round to have a finishing hand, which means the amount of choice (what to take / discard) is a lot lower than I find interesting. Too bad.

RATING: 6
The "fun" factor of this game is going to depend entirely on who it is played with.  This is a popular game in Mensa, but the problem is that hard core word gamers have all of the two letter words memorized and can often lay down with the cards they are dealt.  As such, the game becomes more about luck than skill and, ironically, this is a concept that room full of geniuses has yet to figure out.  On the other hand, when I play with my mom, we both play a few turns out, trying maximize the point values in our hand.  There is still a fair amount of luck in it, but it does become a more interesting game.

You're making words.  No, you're playing rummy.  Actually, it's kind of both.  10 hands, with the number of cards available increasing by one each hand.  Popular with the folks at work.

RATING: 7
This is our "go-to" game when non-gamer company is over and it's been a big hit with everyone we've introduced it to. As well, it makes for a good quick-play when my wife and I have a half hour to burn and can't be bothered setting up something more complex. There is a heavy luck element involved, as the letters you are dealt initially can make or break a hand, but I have noticed that over long periods of time those with better vocabularies tend to win more games than those without. I prefer Quiddler as a two-player game due to the amount of downtime between turns when played with more people. A few people with Analysis Paralysis can really turn the game into a slow drag.

(Actually part of my sister's collection.)

This is like a quick card game version of Scrabble with rounds. I much prefer it to Scrabble or Boggle. It has a nice tension of whether or not to discard certain letters that may help your opponents and whether to end the round or press your luck attempting to make a better scoring word(s) hoping the round doesn't end before you can and force you to lose points for unused letters. I don't like word games, but I think this is a good solid game.

Word game married with traditional set-collection card mechanics, with scoring rules that can balance out the wordsmith versus the novice. My wife is a Scrabble expert and I am Scrabble inept, so this has become the compromise word game of choice.

RATING: 5.5
A decent enough word-card-game, although it has a frustrating luck element that is impossible to overcome sometimes. If you don't have any vowels and another player goes out, you're screwed. This tends to happen multiple times during the course of a single game.

I've played this game at least a hundred times by now, and will play it many more. It's a great "joy of words" game. If you're the sort of person who comes across a three syllable word you've never seen, and get a little excited, this is probably a good game for you. That said, with large groups of people the game can really drag, and with small groups (especially two) it feels like you spend most of your time shuffling. I've also found that many small-group games turn into runaways by halfway, which can be frustrating. Still, it's a great portable game that will always be in my backpack, whether in the woods or on a plane.

Only played once with 9 people. It was very slow and someone always went out on the first turn, so it basically came down to the luck of the draw as to whether you had a decent set of cards. A hand with 8 high valued cards and no vowels pretty much takes you out of the game if someone has just gone out. I much prefer boggle for a quick word game.

Nice idea, but it's just too easy to go out if you know a lot of two-letter words (which all good Scrabble players do).  So a hand never lasts more than a few rounds.  The cards are nice, though, and there's probably lots of ways to tweak it into a better game.  UPDATE: I tried it again, disallowing 2-letter words.  Turns out it's still very easy to go out on the first or second turn, but, that's usually not a winning strategy because there's no bonus for going out and everyone else gets one more turn too.  It's still a bit too random, but I've upgraded it from 5 to 7.

The more I play this, the more I like it. It's best with 2-4 players; more, and it starts to drag as you wait for people to decide what they're doing on their turn. I would like to try playing it asynchronously with timers with larger numbers of players, though; I think this would make a different, but still excellent, game.

Very amenable to modification. We've taken to playing games of, say, 8-13 cards, as the higher card counts are much more interesting. 3-4 cards leaves you far too much at the whim of the cards.

Very light, and not something I want to play every day, but definitely something I want to play a couple times a month.

UPDATE:More and more I find this drags when I play it. Dropped to an 8 (from 9).

After having read good reviews, we decided to play this game.  First time playing was okay, but after that we were very disappointed.  We discovered that too much of the game depends on luck of the draw.  And the only real way to win is by using very short words - which is boring for people who like playing word games.  There is a huge disadvantage if you try to hang on to your cards in an attempt to make longer words.  Played five times, and unlikely to play again.

If you like Scrabble but aren't good at building on existing words, Quiddler may be a great compromise. The mechanics are similar to Rummy as each player draws a card, either from the deck or the top of the discard pile, then at the end of their turn they discard a card. Players earn points by laying down their cards grouped to spell out one or more words. There are bonuses for longest word and even the most words, so a large vocabulary isn't necessary to win. Much of this game relies on luck of the draw (which is why I didn't rate it higher), however there are a number of strategies that can give you an edge.

A simple word game that's pretty much brain-in-neutral.

It's kind of like Scrabble, in that you're trying to put together words from an assortment of available letters. With no board, though, there aren't ever enough letters in play to actually make it challenging.

Not a bad timekiller, though, and it can produce some amusing word combinations.

I like that you can make big or small words and recieve bonuses accordingly, and I like that there is a bit of control over card in your hand and a bit of risk management in terms of keeping high-point cards.

This game depends entirely on the luck of the draw, and on what dictionary you use.  Just like in Scrabble, your score depends on you knowing ridiculous words like "xi", "xu", "jo", "qaid", "ae", and "ai".  Unlike Scrabble, however, there are many Q and QU cards, and even a few CL cards, which are all hard to play.  I'd much prefer Scrabble, because you can overcome bad luck with good strategy.

Half-baked. My rating might be a little unfair, as I only played the solitaire version noted in the rulebook. Which sucked - three out of five times, I had no vowels and therefore lost (in one case, just after flipping over the first eight cards, so the game ended instantly). 
My original interest in using this in the classroom is somewhat diminished; there are better games with letter cards, (Typo comes to mind, for instance). The artwork is not going together with the gameplay either.

Has some advantages over Scrabble: the lack of a ridiculous dictionary and the elimination of left-right binding.  I think Scrabble is the deeper game, though.  The main strategy in Quiddler seems to be going out as soon as possible.  Good filler to bust out at random moments.

Knowing my love of word games (Scrabble! Boggle!), my mother bought me this.  I was bored of it by the second game.  If you have any talent at all for anagramming, you can go out almost immediately. After that it's just a question of maximizing your gain on the point system, which wasn't very interesting either.

The game is basically a combination of Five Crowns and Scrabble, and since I like both of those games, it only makes sense that I'd like this as well. There's a nice progression to the word-based melding, and it makes for a nice bit of light entertainment. It's not a game for everyone, but it works for me.

Jan09: Well, it's about exactly what you expect.  It's scrabble rummy.

How did it play?  Not too bad.  We required 3 letter words, so it didn't get too silly.  Because of this, we also skipped straight to 5 cards since 3-4 just seemed silly also.

We also got the dictionary off the table and just consulted on what words were right.

If you really want to play a word game, I'd much rather play this than Scrabble.  But really I'd just rather not play any word game competitively.

This is a very fun game if you like word games like Scrabble and fast-playing games.  You can get a very bad hand that kills you score for the entire game, so there should be a mulligan rule, but other than that, it's a fun game.  Usually you don't get hosed that bad.  If you do like short games + word games, this is probably a 7.  If not, maybe a 5.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (September 2017)

I bought Quiddler on May 2014, my desire to play it was low, but after playing it, I can say it surprised me. Quiddler is an ok word game. Some friends loved the game though and I already sold it to them.

The rules of the game are pretty simple, you can explain them under 3 minutes. Playtime is around 60 minutes. 

Best with 4 players.

The idea of the game is to form words with the cards you have at hand. In each round you will have more cards. The first player who can play all his cards, will force the end of the round and force other players to play as many cards as they can. The cards they can’t play will count as negative points while the played will count as positive points. There is a high luck of the draw factor, sometimes you draw only consonants, other times you are able to play all your cards in the very first turn. In any case, the game is fun to play. 

The copy I played was in English which is a problem to Spanish speaking people. There are some combinations of letters we don’t use (Th) and the points of the cards are bad, for example the “w” gives very few points because there are many words in English that use it, but not so in Spanish. I think I would buy a Spanish edition of the game.

Bottom line, I was surprised by Quiddler, is it a fun game to play but the high luck factor bothers me. I already sold my copy of the game, but I would play again if requested. 

Current Rating: 6.0

RATING: 6
A nice alternative to full-on scrabble. When I was ten I could out-spell most 18yo. At 15 I could usually beat either of my parents (a poet and an engineer) at scrabble, and scrabble was their game of preference with each other. I sometimes play Quiddler with my wife, for whom English is definitely a second language, and she can still beat me. Of course we give her a dictionary and she asks whatever Qs she likes about words.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
This is NOT a good game. I suppose if everyone just wants to sit and make the longest, cleverest words they can, then fine, play it. But if you're a gamer, or if even one other player at your table is a gamer, then neat words go out the door and the strategy takes over. I have yet to play a game of Quiddler where anyone has had more than TWO TURNS. You can nearly ALWAYS make words with the cards that you have (plus maybe one or two draws).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating so far.  The wife likes word games, at least this one comes out feeling a little more like a game to me and not so much like duelling puzzles.  Neither of us are scrabble players, so I have no idea about the possible problem of the game being too easy if you have all the scrabble 2- and 3-letter words memorized.

Boring. Everyone says "scrabble plus gin" But the best parts of scrabble are missing, and it's much easier than gin to go out--so worst of both worlds. There is some minor skill in counting discards and playing the probabilities of which letters to hold and discard.  But not enough tension or decisions to make it worth my while when compared to other word games. I had higher hopes.

Played once. Fun idea to combine building words with rummy-like rules. A couple of problems: 1) most hands only last one round, 2) this increases the luck factor because you don't have any time to exchange your bad cards, and 3) with more cards it can take too long trying to figure out the many word possibilities.

The deal breaker here is the play time.  I enjoy similar games like My Word! and In Extremis, though those are both speed games.  I also like Boggle, but Quiddler just drags too much for me to ever want to play.  I'm not a big fan of the font/artwork either, so I can't see myself wanting to play this.

Not a bad game, really. I have 2 problems with it, though. I can almost always form words with my initial hand of cards, so I don't see any tactics or planning in the game. Lay 'em down fast, and hope to stick people with negatives. Also, I analyze my cards quickly, but others don't. I spend at least 90% of the game staring at the walls while other people try to figure out what is in their hands.

Think scrabble with cards.  Each card has a letter and a number value.  You progress through turns starting with 3 cards and going up one card each turn.

When I play it next I will suggest a shortened version.

Quiddler challenges players to create words from an ever-increasing number of letter cards in their hand. The game lasts eight rounds, with three cards being dealt to each player in the first round, four cards in the second, five in the third, and so on. Each card has one or two letters on it as well as a point value.

A good change of pace game from Scrabble.  Can be a pain to play with those who memorize the list of Scrabble acceptable 3 letter words but can't produce the definition. It's good to have around for when you want to kill time or if you don't have a lot of space.

The card play is like Gin Rummy. Many comments compare this to Scrabble, but Quiddler has very little interaction (the previous discard) and no way to dump a bad hand. Avoid the upper end of the player count.

My impression after a handful of plays is that the letter mix isn't right. For example, this 118 card deck has both 2 QUs (nice) and 2 Qs. Small hands and a tendency toward short rounds make the rare-heavy letter mix especially troublesome. (If you're looking for a general purpose letter deck, [boardgame=783]Letter Head[/boardgame] is better.)

The solitaire variant is OK. It's vaguely Klondike-like, so you might sometimes prioritize playing a letter based on its stack. However, you can strip the deck to play the more skillful solitaire, [gameid=2553], instead.

"Word Rummy" sounded like a good fit for me, as Rummy is one of my favorite traditional card games (admittedly, a lose bar; I'm not a huge traditional card game fan) and I like word games. But it leaves out all the interesting parts of Rummy (watching what people pick up, deciding when to lay melds, building on others' melds) and involves virtually no thought whatsoever.

Get a hand full of words? Go out right away. Bad luck? Oh well. My wife and I went out on the first or second turn in every hand but one in our first game.

She liked it and I didn't, so back on the shelf it goes. But I hope it never darkens my personal gaming door again.

I like this better than Scrabble, especially since the basic rules include allowing players to look up words in dictionaries.  However, this game seems to take a very long time for me to play (as I keep looking up lots of words to find the optimal ones), and it's not nearly as strategic or interactive as many games I like.  This might be more enjoyable if it were somewhow shortened.

I think this might have run its course as a streamlined spelling game. The dominant strategy seems to be to go out as quickly as possible, which usually means coming up with short, easy words, rather than longer, challenging words. Your opponent either manages to match you with simple, quickly constructed words or takes forever trying to get the longest word bonus. The Achilles Heel of this strategy is when you draw a hand of cards you can't make anything with anytime soon, but that's a problem no matter what. In those situations (like when you draw no vowels), you lose a chunk of points for that round, which usually takes you entirely out of the game entirely.

I used to find this more interesting because I would [i]always[/i] go for the longest word, so the game presented a bit of a challenge. But this not only isn't the winning strategy but also is pretty annoying to the other player, who's waiting for you to page laboriously through your internal dictionary.

As such, I think this is probably best now as a simple filler for small groups or as a "variety pick" among a host of other preferable two-player games.

Played this at CABS, but won't play it again.  If I want to play a word game combining letters to make words, I'll play Letter Roll.  My favorite word game is Word Blur.  Other word games I like are AmuseAmaze,  Word Winder, and Bananagrams.  Montage is a unique and interesting word game for 4 players on 2 teams.  And although I'd rather play the aforementioned games than BuyWord, Word on the Street, or What's My Word?, all the latter games are better games than Quiddler.  I'd rather play plain old Boggle than Quiddler.

Interesting word game, kind of a cross between rummy and scrabble. There's got to be something wrong. I've never seen any round go one complete cycle before someone goes out.

It's okay.  The game can drag a bit in the later rounds as people spend time trying to form words with 8, 9, or 10 cards in their hand.  Also, luck is a factor.  If someone else ends the round and you're stuck trying to make words with, say, X-T-Y-F-TH, have fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Even though at its essence Quiddler is actually Gin Rummy with words (pick up and discard until you split your whole hand into words), the game has a very ingenious twist: it works over eight rounds, the first one with three cards in the hand, and then each successive round with a hand one card bigger (the last round is played with a hand of ten cards). This gives the game a strong feel of development, since good letters to keep and discard change throughout a match. Two different bonuses (longest word, biggest number of words) add more excitement into the play.

Overall a clever, very portable and replayable pleasure for wordsmiths.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
First game was a big disappointment. In the first three hands in a row, I was able to "go out" instantly, which is really frustrating for the other players - especially the ones who were dealt all vowels (or no vowels) ... and then no one wanted to play anymore. Maybe I just got lucky. Anyway, the luck of the draw seems all-important here; I like word games, but this sucks the strategy out of it. I do like the illuminated designs on the card fronts though (but the card backs, meh).

A gift from Josh.  He thought we would play it more than he.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like this game in particular because, unlike "Scrabble," it doesn't require that played words be connected to one another. I also like the aspect that players can be rewarded for short or long words, which allows a balance between younger players or players whose first language is not English. Additionally, players play cards solely within their own area--not off one another. And finally, players have to go through multiple rounds of potentially increasing complexity, as they receive more cards in each successive round. 

In general I'm not crazy about word games, but I like this one. Also, I like the solitaire game, which is challenging and therefore, intriguing. I'd definitely play this over Scrabble anytime. I give it an extra half-point for the solitaire variant, which I find addictive due to the fact that it's so darn difficult to win. 

I've also used this game to teach English as a Second Language by playing the solitaire version cooperatively, working together to come up with words, then play the cards, then have the student pronounced the words we form. Makes learning fun, plus by working together, students get the exhilaration of conceptualizing words in English. 

My son Trevor, who was 10 years old in 2009, rated the  solitaire game an "8" and the competitive version a "10". Some might find the competitive game a bit long for what it is, and on the whole I and my family gravitate toward playing it cooperatively, given the challenge of being able to put together enough words to play all the cards in a given game, something that is very difficult to do.

I like word games--love Boggle--so I love this game.  The Solitaire game is easily the funnest solo card/board game I know--any other just makes me want to switch on the Nintendo.  It's fun with my group just to see what we come up with, although we now use the word "qua" a sickening amount of the time.  I do agree with one review I read that hands are often put down too fast to allow for long, cool words to be played resulting in a "qua"-fest.

Could be more fun for a word game. Weakness is that it frequently favors the lucky deal. Almost always it is better to play small unimaginative words than to hold out for something interesting.

This is a great game to play with non-gamers. In addition to being a solid word game, this does something that I haven't seen any other game of any style or size do: it starts competitive and ends cooperative. During the round, we tend to keep to ourselves and fight over the cards, but after someone goes out, we tend to help each other notice cool words in each others' hands. This is also good to own even if not to play the game itself; having a deck of letter cards [with smart choices for two-letter combinations on certain ones] is a valuable tool for playing a number of word games. For anyone who likes to brew their own games, at $10 this is a must-buy.

If you like Scrabble, you'll enjoy Quiddler... round one, you get three cards then have the option of drawing and discarding to make a three letter word... subsequent rounds increase the hand size (to a maximum of 10 cards on the last turn)... scoring is based on the length of words... you typically wind up with shorter words than Scrabble, since you're not building on existing words... some games last longer than others, but generally a really fast, fun filler...

One of the better word card games I've played, or even the best so far (yes there are others I still need to try). Scales well for players with different vocabulary skills as you can get bonuses for longest or most short words (no two letter words allowed, yay!). Not too long either as can easily be played to less rounds or until the deck runs out. The rules say shuffle after each round, but with 118 cards, we never bother. I'd recommend this.

Combine all your cards into words(one or more words).  Cross between scrabble and rummy.

start witha 3 cards hand....play 8 hands....final hand starts with 10 cards.

The main problem with Quiddler is that the end game is subject to wild swings of luck based on the draw.  If someone has a complete word on the draw, you're out of luck and there's not much you can do about it.  Not a big deal if those late rounds didn't create such a big point swing.

Your fate is essentially determined by the deal since there won't be more than a couple of turns per round.  While it's a challenge to dig for four word combos or eight-letter words, it's really all up to what you start with.  Very little player interaction makes this a light filler game.  Be sure to designate the official dictionary, lest ye play "geek" and lose points for it!

This has the [i]potential[/i] of being a fun word-building game, but instead it often becomes [i]really[/i] annoying as most people are rather lazy and usually just go out with a bunch of two-card words rather than trying to build anything complex and interesting.

The root of the problem is that the game is nothing more than [b]Rummy[/b] - someone is bound to randomly draw letters which allow them to go out in the first pass-through of every round. It may be you. It may be another player. Regardless, it is the luck of the draw which dictates who goes out first for each round.

This is an intersting combination of a word game with a card game.  Word games have something of a spotty reputation with me, particularly Scrabble, which has a tendency toward "degenerate" play.  Despite this, there are a few that I will play when asked, and this is one of them.  At various times, I have actually considered purchasing it, but have yet to follow through.  So perhaps that is the best verdict I can give -- Interesting enough to play, but not enough to own. [08/14/2007]

Quiddler is a card game that I would describe exactly as Gin Rummy with letter cards. Each round you get more and more cards, starting from 3, up until 10 (?). On your turn, you pick and discard. If you can form all of your letters into one or more words, you (call Gin and) lay down your cards. The other players then each have one more turn to lay down all they can. 

Unfortunately, it is much easier to form words than get Gin in Gin rummy, and every round, the first player to go called Gin immediately, and if not, the player after him. Therefore, there is very little in the way of strategy or hand management, it was all anagramming, which I like, and luck, which I don't.

However, it may be possible to change the scoring of the game, or perhaps tweak the gameplay, to make somthing interesting out of it.

This is like playing Three Thirteen Rummy, but rather than forming sets or runs using traditional-suited cards, the goal is to make words using letter cards. Do the similarities in how the game plays, this game is easy to teach to Rummy players.  It's also quite easy for casual and non-gamers to learn and play as well.  Overall, this is a really good word game.

Game Variant: I like to play with the same discard rules as my family uses when played Three Thirteen Rummy whereby each player has a separate discard pile rather than using a single discard pile as in the original Quiddler rules. Players can either take the top card of any discard pile or the top card of the draw deck. This provides players more options on their turn and makes for slightly more interesting game play. It also helps even out the randomness of the card dray just a bit.

RATING: 7.5
A non-assuming but fun little game. Gets played to death at family functions but tends to suffer with more than 5 players...especially those with AP. If players process their hand while others are playing their turn the game moves along quicker and it can be quite enjoyable.

RATING: 8
Glad I purchased this for wifey, as it is one of the few word games we play that actually gives me a chance of winning. I love the fact that for once, it's not just the biggest word that score most points. You can also get bonus points for making the most amount of words as well.

Thus in our games, when it gets to the higher hand numbers in later game, I always try and come up with 2-3 little words to counter wifey's better vocabulary skills. And it normally works...

We can usually get a game played within half hour, although I have seen a bit of AP in some other players.

Components - .9/1 Basically all cards. Cards are of decent stock. The box is the small knock. It's small, but the design means the ends get bent trying to open the game.

Fun - .4/1 Played this a lot growing up. It was a fun alternative to scrabble because it doesn't take forever. That being said, it's just not that fun. A lot likely has to do with the people I play with but the game really encourages Analysis Paralysis because you have no reason not to. Most of the game time is spent waiting for someone to give up on trying to get those couple extra points.

Replayability - .8/1 There's a sizable deck that each game you're likely to get new letters. The problem is that the game itself isn't really any different though each play, so it gets very samey just from hand to hand.

Strategy - .3/1 Generally the game plays out that either the first or second person each hand goes out, meaning most people just have to maximize their hands points. Usually is a single decision to make, whether to take a couple less points and set yourself up for a bonus, or just play it safe. The problem is that this decision is only for the first couple people (if you're at the end, you know whether or not you're getting the bonus[es]). Other than that, "strategy" is just knowing words.

Theme - 0/1 There's none to speak of.


Personal Rating - 2/5 For game about knowledge, it tends to be a game about luck. The first couple rounds don't really matter, no one can create enough points without a really lucky set of hands to separate from the pack. At that point the best strategy as the first player is to go out if you can and hope that someone is stuck without any ability to create words because that will knock them out of the running. At this point it boils down to who had the best cards dealt to them. Really as long as players have competent vocabulary there's not enough letters going on at once to make the expanded knowledge that much more useful. The worst part is that the person who went out has to sit and wait for everyone to try and squeeze the most points out of their hand. This ends up taking way too long and makes the game feel like a drag.

RATING: 5
1 play with 2: a boring word-rummy variant. Generally fairly easy to come up with words, so it largely seemed to depend on the luck of the deal (we usually went out right after the deal).

The deck has 118 cards mostly with single letters, but also some couplets. Each also has a point value. 8 rounds, each starting by dealing each player (round 2) cards. On your turn, you draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile. If you can, you may "go out" = use all but one card to make word(s). End your turn by discarding a card. If you go out, everyone else gets one more turn in which they can play as many of their cards (in legal words) as possible. Score points for cards played, lose points for cards left in hand. Players may challenge particular words: if legal, challenger loses that many points; if illegal, challengee loses those points instead of gaining them. Also, 10 pt bonuses for player with most words and biggest word (if tied, no one gets the bonus). After 8 rounds, the player with the most points wins.

Word game?  Bleah!  Card game?  Double bleah!!  Combine the two?  *Shudder and rock back-and-forth in speechless horror*  Okay, so this doesn't happen to hit my personal sweet spot, although I have nothing against the game itself.  While I tend to enjoy word puzzles, I don't often like word games (with the possible exception of such fast-paced party games as "Scattergories" and "Catch Phrase"), and while I enjoy some games with playing cards, such as "Euchre" and "Poker", I tend not to like other card games.  Other people I know enjoy this one; it's just not my cup of tea.  I'd rather play "Monopoly".  There, I said it.  Game design: 2.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 0.5/5  Total: 3/10

Actually, not such a huge fan of this game. Luck seems to be too much of a factor in what letters you get. If you get bad letters, there's nothing you can do. And unlike scrabble, there's not much strategy involved such as finding good locations for your words or blocking other people.

This is another great tool to get even the non-gamers in your family around the table. It's the only game I can convince two of my sisters to play. It can get bogged down if you don't enforce the "no dictionary searches when it's your turn" rule, so having a couple of Scrabble dictionaries with lots of players is helpful. Even the tweens and teens get into the action (though when they go to bed the grown ups come up with some great words).

I thought this would be an improvement over Five Crowns, but the randomness of the cards and their values make it feel as random or maybe even more so.

It also runs into the same problems as most word games: players are unsure of spelling, may need to spend time looking up words or use some sort of challenge system, and there can be a lot of AP because of the multitude of words that can be spelled with a big hand of cards.

Not a bad game to play from time to time, but not a very good one either.

This game will crash and burn so hard and so loudly,  that you may be legally liable for causing every player in your group to contract tinnitus.

Always wary of any game that requires a dictionary on stand by - all of your darkest fears will be fully realized by game's end - but it has little to do with your Merriam-Webster.  Quiddler quickly devolves into a 2-3 letter word slog fest and mercifully ends just before your blood pressure reaches it's boiling point.

If you insist on having fun with words - read a book of dirty limericks instead.

Another rummy variant.  Best played with fewer people as it is a bit longer than I'd like anyway and a high player count only exacerbates this issue.

fun word building game, with the pace and style, bigger words are not necessarily better.

A great game to take on holidays.  In some ways I like it better than Buyword because you are equally rewarded for making long or short words, so there's more of an equal playing field when playing with kids.  I also like the combined effort of all players to help you make words on the final round.

I may have had the rules poorly explained, but this game was a pain to play.  Any game where you sit and wait five minutes while a player consults a dictionary before making his play, is going to be painful.

Played it with 2 people and 8 people.  I thought it was more fun with a larger group.  Then you can laugh at people who can't spell.  Just kidding, I would never make fun of anyone.

This is my alternative to Scrabble, which I really dislike.

I can break this out with pretty much any group of people, and they can all pick it up and play. For my hearing-impaired father, a party game like this one is a godsend.

Similar to Phase10, lots of fun with family members yet there are too many other fun games that I'd prefer to play or introduce to others than this one.

RATING: 5
OK game, IMO it takes too long - cutting out a couple of rounds helps. Between players of similar vocabulary/word game skills it will come down to luck. So as a vocabulary competition it's OK, but as a game... I don't find the decisions very interesting.

RATING: 5
Certainly diverting.  It definitely causes one to access their vocabulary in an interesting way.  I just wish it were more fun.

This is a fairly quick word card game.  My husband and I usually finish the night with a couple of games of this.  It is also a go-to game for non-gamers.  I've actually played a lot of games of this because I used to bring it with me to play while getting chemo -- it was perfect because it was fast, small and most anyone can play.

This game just seemed too easy for us. Often times in a draw or two we could put our hand down. Liked the concept, but it's just not challenging enough.  Probably could have increased the difficulty with a variant that would have worked. (Traded with Torres for RoboRally)

Can be slow.  Not much player interaction, but because you have a choice of drawing the top card or the last player's discard, you cannot plan terribly far in advance.

This used to be my game of choice with myself and my family (along with Rage!). Similar to the fall from grace of Life and Monopoly but unlike those though, you can play a game of this in under 30 minutes. Depending on your opponents. They have to play quick. Another annoying trait of this game is the constant assistance of all the players who aren't taking their turn. This one has hit rock bottom for me.

A little too quick; feels like Scrabble without the board strategy.

RATING: 5
It's essentially Rummy with letters, but without the option of making sets, and getting stuck with a bunch of cards that aren't going to be very helpful to you.  It borrows the mechanism of Oh Hell and Wizard, in that you get more and more cards to work with, and I expect that if you play a full game, it balances out, but it doesn't thrill me.  The bonuses in each round seem weird, but are easily removed to make the game more palatable.  Ultimately, I think Unspeakable Words or Typo do more interesting things with letter card games.

A word-making card-game where you make 3-10 letter words. Goes quickly, but each hand seems to end too suddenly.

Purchased before discovering BGG.  We all kept making a bunch of short words, and everyone pretty well went out on the first round.  Winning was more a matter of turn order than anything else.

If you consider yourself a "wordsmith" and enjoy expanding (or showing off) your vocabulary, this might be a good match.  Definitely not for everyone though.

My parents got it for Sasha in Colorado Springs, CO for X-mas. A fun word game that's faster and more exciting than Scrabble. However, I didn't like the lack of interaction with other players.

Playing a full game with 5-6 people takes about 2 hours, since many people sit and think during their turn. Playing time varies with the number of people.

I tried playing the Speed Quibbler variant with the kids. It was pretty exciting. However, my parents didn't like it since they couldn't handle the speed.

Rummy with words.  Good to play with non gaming scrabble types. Doesn't need much room and is quite quick to play. The solitaire game is very enjoyable and not as easy as you would think.

This is a fun word building game.  The cards have individual letters, or letter combinations with different point values.  You play several rounds increasing the number of cards in your hand per round.  The main drawback is the rules for bonuses "longest word" & "most words"  combined with losing points in your hand (after playing your best hand)  tends to lead to rushing to be the first to lay down, rather than building better words.

I love words and games that force the players to be creative such as this.  How many two letter words do you know?

The artwork is actually thematic and features old world (Celtic/Irish) letters.  Not at all an exciting game, but definitely competitive.  Not for everyone, that is for sure!

As far as word games go (which are not my faves), I like this one well enough. It's a little long, but that's easily fixed by not playing all the suggested rounds.

The more players, the deeper the game. Fun and easy to explain (also with &quot;non gamers&quot;), it works well with 6-7 players. One of the best strategy games I own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great concept, very tense and entertaining, can be played with anyone.
However, the game has some issues which made me drop out over time. 

Issues I have with this game:
- three player flaw (needs 9th character),
- the game thrives on interaction (so the more players the better) but it drags too long with 6+ players,
- the Thief could benefit from more gold in play,
- the Architect is a bit overpowered,
- the Warlord is severely underpowered especially with 4+ players,
- the districts could be more useful and should interact better with the chosen Characters.

All these points should be addressed in the 2016 Edition, which would raise my score from 7 to 9.

Best with 4-6 players. 
Ordinary with 2-3 and too long with 7-8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
It's a simple game that brings new fun to card drafting with extremely high player interaction. The length is just about right, meaning just a bit longer than it probably needs to be (which is how I like most games.) Predictably unpredictable. A perfect family game.

One of the first games in our collection, this has seen lots of play time during the years. While we don't play it nearly as often now, I still appreciate the fun of the role-taking aspect and the "I know that he thinks that I think that he thinks..." twists. A lovely game that can work wonders in creating a fun atmosphere in any gaming group.

RATING: 6
Based on 1 play, I couldn't rate it.  I was tired and the other guys were experienced.  I got torn apart.  I'd give it another chance, but I'm not sure its the game for me.

Update: played again with 7 players.  Which seemed far too many, loads of downtime and lack of control. I started off enjoying it but about halfway through decided I didn't much like it at all.
I've been told it is great for 2 players and can believe that I might like it for 2 - negligble downtime and complete control of your own destiny.

RATING: 7
Fun game for between 2 and 8 people. I was impressed by the way the rule is written to slightly change the game for every number of players. This makes it work really well with any number.

The game is like a mixture of Mafia with San Juan. You have role selection similar to San Juan but need to guess who picked what role similar to Mafia-type games.

The game includes some variant cards which I think is a great effort by the publisher to make the game stay enjoyable for a long time. We have not tried any of the alternate roles or buildings yet, but do they seem fun.

130929 As time goes by...I think I'm more open to playing it again.  I would need to know what the ideal play count is, because I think my first (and only) play had to many players.

100703 Meh...its ok, but not my thing.  Getting hammered by the assassin really sucks and can cripple you in the game...and a lot of AP going on, but not the fun type.  May go down to a 4 after another play, but hate to be too extreme in rating a game with only one play. It feels very rough around the edges....kind of like scepter of zavandor.

This ousted Carcassonne as my favorite game for two. The silent bluffing aspect of it when choosing characters might be my favorite part of it, but I love everything about it. Everything from the character abilities to the district card art. I'm holding off on scoring this as a 10 until I get some more time with it.

This is a great game for everyone- experience not necessary.  The game is designed so that anyone coming to the game for the first time has a round or two to get used to the game and by the end, it seems everyone has a strong grasp of the rules and the goal.  This is a great game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Fun fantasy-themed, city-building card game with nice art. Lots of opportunities to be mean to each other. When you get to know the characters, there is a good amount of bluffing and guessing going on. A nice, easy to learn, cut-throat card game.  One of my wife's favorites.

I think the two player game is great; there's definitely less chaos and more mind games. That said, I also like the amount of chaos in a 6-7 player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A classic. Especially fun to play with 5-6 players. (The normal game tends to be a tad long, though, so we nearly always play to 7 buildings instead of 8).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An excellent game that plays well with the kids and with adults. That's a big plus for us, and the fact that Citadels works so well with two players makes it a go-to game when there's a need for some filler time. It's great.

We don't use the expansion characters, but once in a while we mix things up with some of the buildings from the expansion.

This single game probably wins the "Most Fun Per Cubic Centimeter of Box Space" award.

The larger the group, the better for this one.  Everyone is someone, and no one knows who anyone else is.  The assassin chooses to assassinate the king, but is the King the guy next to him, or the quiet one across the table?  And a new round starts, and it all changes.  My only complaint about this game is that it can go on a bit too long.

Fun for a few plays. In the late game when all you care about is not getting assassinated or robbed it behooves you to just pick your role randomly. A real downer when the game ought to be at its most pitched and exciting.

For a game that is actually good play Witch's Brew instead.

It is ok, but not spectacular ... although I played it not so long ago, I can't remember it really. So I guess that is already a sign for its quality (or the lack of it). After my second game I like it better. It is just a lot better with 5 Players instead of only 3.

RATING: 6.5
A fun guessing game.  The Assassin and Thief (and to a lesser extent the Magician) roles spice the game with screwage.

A 7 player game lasts too long, so you may want to reduce the number of districts required in that case.  It plays well even with 2.

It will often take people too long to decide which role to take.  

Sometimes a player will just get stolen from and killed and screwed through the entire game, and that's not fun.  It's one of those games where sometimes, for the sake of civility, I've laid off on someone simply because they'd been a target all game long (even though it would be in my interest to continue to make them a target).

2008-01-31: Downgraded from 7 to 6.2.  Too much downtime.

2010-05-13 (rating 6):

I didn't really appreciate that game. It is fine but slightly boring.

We played 8 players game and obviously the game does not scale well. With numerous players the ending players have little choice of useful roles. And in particular it might be hard to become a king (or seat near to the king) for such player.


I much more prefer to play [gameid=3076] for example.

Terrific Game.  Straightforward rules that make it easy to jump right in (even for a 1st-timer), something that is nice in my gaming group.  Yet, it is complex enough to have staying power.

The game itself is good enough to be rated 8 or above; I gave it a 9 because it comes with "bonus cards" that can be swapped in & out from game to game, making Citadels extremely replayable.  

This bonus card idea is brilliant -- every game should have such a set of extra cards with rules about what to swap for what (in order to maintain game balance) like Citadels does.

It plays in a reasonable amount of time. Good game, but not great as it can last too long with more players, but doesn't play as well with fewer.

Somehow i expected a little more from this game. It should have all the elements I usually enjoy - psychology, bluffing, speaking, direct and indirect player interaction. But still there's something missing.

2016-02-23
Citadels involves a lot of outguessing your opponents, and this is basically all the meat. Otherwise it is a rather straightforward climbing game. Or maybe straightforward is not the best word here. The goal is simple but the way there may be quite twisted.

I like how the characters interact with each other and this gives you a lot to ponder on your turn. However, the negative characters (i.e. refraining certain players from taking an action), can create very unsettling moments which could be seen as king making, or simply bullying. In other words, Citadels can certainly destroy the fun for some players if they start taking things personally. 

For me Citadels works as entertainment in the realm of bluffing and table talk and I like it. Usually it is easy to see the best solution for you but this is in plain view for the others as well. Every turn, you have to work out your position relative to other players and act correspondingly but not predictably. Thus I would only play Citadels with friends I know. Playing with complete strangers kills half of the game since you have absolutely no way of knowing what might they be thinking.

One of the bests. Still, it has three minor faults:

Decent, but I played it with 8 players and that was a lot.  I reckon that it's better to have 7 buildings as a winning margin with that many players.  And the downtime between moves is very long if people take too long to pick a card.  I'd imagine that the game is better with 5-7 players.  We played with the Queen, which with 8 players is a pretty weak card.  next time we'd try a different card, I think.

If I had enough players for this I would probably just play The Resistance. You soon get to a stage when one of few players will obviously win and it's a case of stopping them. Just didn't click with me.

Maybe I was overly harsh with my first playthrough playing with too many people. Enjoyed a 5 player game much more that I played last night although it still feels a little random, there does feel like room for some good strategy.

Classic Bruno Faidutti. Citadels isn't my favorite of Bruno's games, but it is still good. The premise is simple. Each round you secretly select a role to play in order to use its specific power to help yourself win the game. The ultimate goal is to build buildings with enough value to win. Of course sometimes this means murdering other players, making money, etc. artistically the game is quite easy on the eyes but it has a pretty absent theme.

Great if everyone knows how to play well and keeps the game moving, terrible with new players. Some say its best with 2 but I hated it, did they take the assassin or didn't they?, did they take the architect/merchant or didn't they?, seemed like too many 50/50 guesses which I would always get wrong and my opponent got right. With more players, it seems a lot more interesting to see who would do what and the key roles were less defining of a good overall strategy because they were more spread out.

First game of this was pretty chaotic (7 players!), but really liked it, and can't wait to play it with a few less, as I'm sure it's completely different. But this one is right up my alley.

5-21-11 - 2 more games, but this time with 5. Like it even better at 5, I feel there's a little less chaos, and a little more cat and mouse with guessing who's picked which role. This will see play almost every extended game day I'm thinking.

The number of games I've played for more than a decade and am still interested in playing is very small. The fact that Citadels is so simple but still makes that list makes it incredible. I love how Faidutti makes you play each other as much as the game rules. I prefer playing with the "fast game" option most of the time, though, as the game can drag a tad at the full length.

+ The role-selection mechanic in this game is intriguing, leading to tough decisions and trying to out-guess your opponents.
- Assassinated for the fourth time in a row really gets old fast; Why has this game taken up more than an hour already?!?


Why it's previously-owned:
While this game played a major role in the formative time of my journey into the "real" gaming world, it eventually wore very thin on me.  Perhaps a bit too chaotic for my tastes.
I left this game with my relatives, as it's seemed to be one of their favorites with a large number of players.  We now have Mission: Red Planet and Libertalia to fill the hidden-role selection game space in our collection.

the game is perfectly balanced and is all about tactics. (which is my strong point when it comes to card and board games)

it aslo has a really strong replay value.

A good game that has elements of San Juan (roles) and other city building games with a deceptively deep strategic element. This game provides the player with many options which can lead to a lot of analysis. We played with six people and the game gets very long with that many people (it took us at least 2  hours). Overall, the artwork on the cards was excellent with the exception of the odd fairylike art for one of the castles (the rest of it all felt very dark and gothic, which I like). My only other complaint would be that the currency looks more like strepsils than any kind of currency, which takes away from the feel a tiny bit. As always, I was also hoping for oversize cards too!

Role-selection meets... more role-selection.  A decent enough game, but too slow for what it is.  Lots of downtime.  I would avoid playing this with the AP-inclined.  I guess I would play it again, though it wouldn't be my first, second or third choice.  Mostly I own it because other people at my gaming groups like to play it from time to time (it's small and easy to transport).

I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple play.

This is a very interesting card game, that is able to offer a lot of depth in a small package. Although I'm not particularly fond of its artwork and components, even if there's not really anything wrong with them, I've to say that I enjoyed it. I especially liked the challenge that comes with its game-play. I like games where you have to outguess your opponents and this one has that in spades!

There's a good level of interaction, but also some take-that elements that bother me a little, because they can really screw you over badly. It's not really fun when you lose your entire turn and it's especially annoying when that happens for a bunch of turns in a row. Furthermore it can really drag the game out to a ridiculous length for a filler like this.

Besides these couple of issues I find Citadel to be an enjoyable game. It's easy to teach, but it's deep and it's very interactive. It's not a game I want to own, but I would like to explore it some more, if I'll have the chance.

2-8. This is a card game where you build buildings and manage money, which sounds boring, but what makes it awesome is the role selection. Each turn you draft character cards with special abilities, that let you make other players skip their turns, or take their money or their cards and so forth. Very fun though I never win. In my opinion it lasts just a hair too long, especially when playing with 7 or 8. Rules: http://fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Citadels/support/citadels-rules-english.pdf

An excellent game.  Faidutti's games often look more fun to me than they play.  Perhaps most of them are good if you get the right crowd, but this one is good played against kids, eurogamers, ameritrash gamers, ..., and it scales very nicely from 2 players on up.  Just a fantastic design.  My only criticism would be that it can drag on a little for what it is.

Update: I think my comment above is far too harsh on Bruno Faidutti.  When his games haven't worked for me, it's almost always been referable to players not getting into the spirit.  I am probably unduly influenced by some extremely depressing rounds of Mystery of the Abbey with people prone to erroneous answers.

RATING: 7
Casual players can ruin this. The roles are just too harsh not to be picking them with a wider view to the table. AP is also surprisingly a problem.

Still, I think this game just has enough flavour to be the premier deduction game for multiplayer. The Resistance is a bit too fiddly and abstracted for me to rely on, and Werewolf needs 8 minimum. 

I like 4 players plus, but it's got to play tight and fast.

In this card game, players assume roles each turn like the king, alchemist, warlord, etc. while trying to build a diverse "district" (city or kingdom).

a card game where you choose a character (king, assassin etc) for the round and use them to help you build the best city. Really quite good fun except for the steep learning curve. It is more or less essential to know all the characters up front to get the best out of it.

Crucial to this game is that your actions with, for example the Assassin, are aimed at the character card and NOT the player. So it becomes a game of bluff as each player tries to disguise their choice to protect their turn and achieve the most glorious result

I don't like that your turns are determined by the other players.

I wouldn't mind playing it if someone else wanted to, but it wouldn't be my choice.

Definitely one of the better card games around for multiple players, especially when comparing it to Munchkins and Killer Bunnies. 

We played one game with 7 players. My husband got assassinated the first two rounds, so he hated the game because by the time he got to play, he was so far out of the game in terms of build-up, card collection, and money. His comment is that there is a definite runaway factor where 2 player got left in the dust with 2 players took a commanding lead. Also, everyone seemed to think my graveyard card was OP, even though I was only able to use it once during the game. So, my husband gives this a big Nay and it is banned from our house. 

I kind of like the game, except that it is way too chaotic and there is no real way to plan moves. You're not even sure who you are targeting for the character abilities since you call out the characters instead of target the players, so the game doesn't even let you plan that. Also, our game took forever to play, it felt like a 3 hour game - for a simple card game, it far exhausted the 1 hour that we wanted to sink into it. 

UPDATE: After playing Shadow Hunters, I've decided that this game just doesn't cut it.

First impression: 10/10
Current impression: 10/10

The first time I played it with my friends almost 2 years ago. Then in another year I played it in another company. Recently I've recalled playing it and actually enjoying it, so I decided to get it. It's not that expensive and it's portable, which is great.

I've had it for a week now approximately, and I'm totally enjoying it and I'm kind of addicted. 

- Short review of the game:

In my opinion, it's a game for 2 players. Maybe 3... 4 in the outermost case. 
Because: the more players there are, the more luck-based the game becomes. And the longer it lasts. 

I highly recommend playing with people who know the rules already and played the game before. And it's also better to make time limits for each turn, playing online we have a 55 sec limit to do all actions (picking roles first, and then in the next phase using the role, collecting money, drawing cards, building, also has to be done in 55 seconds). That can be a bit problematic online if there is lag, but if you play the game normally at a table - it shouldn't be a problem.

In a game with more than 4 people it becomes chaotic and luck-based, as I've already stated. It will just depend on the person's hand and on the randomness of assassins and thieves. There are only 3 destructive roles out of the 8: Assassin, Thief, Warlord. 
Warlord can only destroy a building of one person/turn. It might be alright for trolling, but in a game with many players - that doesn't give anything. And Assassins and Thieves mainly just hit random players. These roles are chosen by the advanced players to not be assassinated or picked themselves with a 100% chance, and to start first.
In my second game, when we were 5 I think... One person just was getting assassinated and picked over and over. Every turn. "F* this game...", "I hate this game" he said. And that was not logical. It was random. He even chose the least advantageous roles to avoid being killed.   
Didn't work. Of course that way some people will hate this game. :)


For 2 players it's totally strategical thinking, psychology too I would say. 2 players is really a challenge. Assassins and Warlords can really do damage here. In the beginning if you have bad building cards, you can choose the Magician, use the best of them, and give the other trash to the player. That might ruin his game. King is a bold role, because next turn you're choosing first. Merchant is overpowered, but for this very reason he is targeted the most. The bishop isn't too strong as far as I can judge by my few games, but still has his pros. 
2 Roles per turn mechanics is great in my opinion. That's best for 2-3 Players. Enjoy!

A very good game for 2 players. A lot of guessing your opponent (and learning its way of thinking).
A good game for 3 players. You can still "learn" peoples reactions.
It dies for 4(or more) players. It is more of an excercise in group dynamics (only after the role selection). And you loose all the role guessing aspect of the game.
But at the end, too long for what you get.

I really like the variable roles every round, but the whole buying of buildings seems peculiarly simplistic. As such, part of me likes this game and part of me isn't sure yet. Beyond this uncertainty though, I can attest that it is still a good game due to it's quickness and scalability for 2-8 players (you can add an 8th player with the special cards included). So, if you occasionally have large groups of gamers and/or nongamers, this one is worth considering.

A very fun card game with hidden roles, and the roles having special powers.  8 different role cards are shuffled, and one is layed face down.  (some layed face up depending on # players).  The king gets [#players+1] cards to choose from, and passes the rest to the player on his left, who chooses one, and passes it to the player on his left, etc. The last player (with 2 cards to choose from) takes one, and places the final one face down.  This means that the first player will know the first face down card (since he saw all the rest) and the last player will know the last face down card.  This gives each player a semi-advantage on knowing which role each person chose, which is a huge deal, since some of the cards require you to steal or murder a certain role.  If you want to target a certain player, you have to guess which card they chose.  This makes the game very fun and tense.  I can't wait to play another game.

Juego muy entretenido para jugar con los amigos que no se atreven con algo más complicado. Sacas las cartas en cualquier mesa y te pones a jugar después de una breve explicación de 3 minutos. Para ambientar, nosotros compramos una corona de rey que debía llevar en todo momento quien tuviera ese rol en la partida. Se puede jugar a dos, y además se vuelve un juego mucho más táctico con la elección de personajes. A más jugadores se disfruta más pero se vuelve mucho más caótico.

RATING: 5
Only seems to work at specifically 4 players, which is a bit too specific for a game in which the end result is still just a random hat draw. (And which takes 45-60 minutes to play.)

I feel like this game has been superseded by Coup, Resistance, and Love Letter. And even those I'm not fully keen on. So myeh, skip it and get one of those at least.

It's a 7 or even an 8 with < 5 players, but anything 5+ drops it to a 3 or 4. So it averages out to about a 6ish for me. 6.5 seems fair.

Just never play with 5+ players. 5 would be the breaking point.

Fun hidden role selection game.  Need to sleeve because cards aren't the best quality and get marked easily, but such is life.  I do mostly play RftG, but Citadels is a lot lighter and easier for new players to learn.  Dark Cities cards are interesting but generally unncessary.

RATING: 6
For me, it last longer than it should. Usually we play just until six buildings.
It scales pretty well! Playing with only 2-3 players is interesting as you pick two characters instead of one every round. Some of my friends only like it that way.

I recommend swapping the Assassin with the Witch in every game, and swapping the rest of the characters when you get bored of the base game.

RATING: 8.5
7 players. Won by 1 point. You better build cards that are worth 3 or more to ensure other's can't destroy them too easily. The leader is the most targeted person and easily recognizable. 

thief and murderer are good for payback/fun or balancing the game. thief is ideal if players have lots of gold.
mage if youve got bad cards. 
mercenary is useful at the beginning (low gold count means 1 point buildings) and at the end to destroy other competitor's buildings. 
architect if you dont have cards but not good if you already have several cards because then you most likely have to swap with the mage. can be great in the last round.
priest is only good if you have blue cards.(the game rewards being aggressive, so no use for a defensive card) 
merchant was target #1 in our group for murderer and thief, i wouldnt choose this card
one person chose the king at the beginning 3 times but he knew he will get murdered eventually. i'd say if youre always one of the last players during the turn this card is favorable. and for yellow cards of course.

king's cards are usually worth a lot so they dont get destroyed easily. merchant's cards on the other hand are usually low cost. Makes merchant even more unattractive.

a lot of fun, but i recommend playing with up to 5/ max. 6 players. it takes too much time otherwise.

downtime is no problem because you ought to think about choosing the next card yourself. also need to look at how many cards/gold and how many points the others have.

extra points for 5 different colours seems hard to achieve.

Played 6 players once - disappointed by all the downtime. Played with 6 again - we understood the strategy better, had less downtime and all enjoyed it much more. Played 2 player version with my wife - we loved it!!!

UPDATE: Played many more times now. It can be very frustrating when one gets targeted by an assassin, thief or magician (often unwittingly). 

For this reason I'm not happy giving this game a 10, as I like everyone to have fun playing my games, and invariably there is someone who won't!

What's really clever is that it's a combination of an investment game (earning income, buying districts managing cards) and a screwage game (caused by the chaos of secretly choosing roles).

The secret may be balancing these 2 perspectives.

In the past I always treated it as an investment game, and often got whipped. Last time I played I followed a risk management strategy instead - and annihilated the other 5 players!

I personally love this game and most people I've played with have really enjoyed it as well. The two player and the three player games are slight variants where you take multiple characters. I really enjoy the three player game and the two player game is ok. This game works best for me with four or five players. I played with 7 and that was way too much. Perhaps it would work with all experienced players as it would stop the amount of analysis paralysis.

RATING: 5
2-8(5)

2p: It's interesting, and there is plenty of gamesmanship in the role selection (my partner seemingly being better at this than I). Sometimes, I find that being the King, with the first role randomly set aside, leaves you open such that you nearly *have* to choose the Assassin (in some cases it would be blindingly obvious who you've chosen), which seems to remove some tension. Also lacking in that most of the districts are just placeholders (varying only in color and in initial cost/final score), which seems like a pretty big MacGuffin. If it's too aggressive, could go long, I'd say.

Multiplayer: I can certainly see where the Analysis Paralysis comes in. There are several role cards to choose from and sometimes players just keep psyching themselves out out their choices. Also, the games can run really ... really ... long to reach eight districts, especially with the warlord in play. Maybe we didn't play optimally (as far as building aggressively). I'd like to get this out more to see how it can be played more efficiently, but this first play was loooooong.

At the heart of Citadels is role selection and it is amusingly implemented here, with opportunities for bluff and take-thatery plentiful.  The rest of the game is a rather less interesting matter of developing your city as quickly and to as high a value as possible.  The problem is its ninety minute playing time; this game is really too insubstantial and repetitive to justify that sort of time investment.  

My Hans im Gluck edition is nicely produced and the card artwork is rather lovely.

We used to play this often back in 2008-2009 at my regular game night.  Classic bluffing game not to be taken too seriously.  In fact, I think that on most turns, you are better off randomly picking a role, or manage to convince your opponents that you are randomly picking a role :-)  So long as no one takes the game too seriously and pick roles quickly, it's a nice way to end a game night.

In my opinion Citadels is pretty decent (yet flawed) game for its price. It brings some of that 'big' board game experience and decision making to a very newcomer friendly format, but which cards you happen to have in your hands or draw make too much of a difference. It's entirely possible to waste a couple of valuable turns looking for an affordable building while another player has no trouble at all getting one building after another played. That said, with four or more players the drafting mechanic starts to shine which greatly improves the playing experience.

January 2014:  Too much down time while people choose their card, and too much "take that" aspect with assassin, warlord and thief.  No interest in playing again; thus, have to downgrade to a 6.

Backstabbing and assassination make for some vicious conflict, but the mid-game can drag as resources won are lost and rebuilding simply repeats what has been accomplished in previous turns. Does play well with large groups who know the rules. Also, the substitute cards make for greater replay value.

Lots of fun, as long as you don't let "random" screwage get to you.  It's not exactly a "take that" game because it's tough to target another player directly, but can be frustrating if someone guesses correctly (or guesses wrong and takes you out on accident) several turns in a row.  Still, the role selection mechanic is very interesting, and the rest of the gameplay is simple enough to not get in the way.  The only issue is if someone really suffers from AP and takes more than 30 seconds to pick their character - I saw one person take 5 minutes once... what could he possibly have been thinking about?

CITADELS! (raise your hand if you're an Eric Summerer fan) Small box but a pretty fair amount of game in it. It's taken us a while to actually give this one a try but it's good so far. Only have played it a few times ( and those with 3 players) I don't know if it will work well just doing 2 players. Given the role selection mechanism just not sure if it can scale down well.

RATING: 8.5
I love when you are the last player picking the role and you can choose between Assassin and Thief and you wonder "how could this happen?" than you get one of the cards and you miss your target. Only problem with the game is if one player gets killed by the assassin 2-3 times in a game, that player won't probably enjoy the game that much.

One of my favourite drafting games! Simple yet difficult. Can cause lots of different feelings to arise if played aggressively.

A decent game if it does not last too long.  It is either excellent or dreadful with a full player count: the game becomes much tighter, but it can also drag on forever.  Poor play ruins much of the experience, as it's easier to steal money from weaker players.  Direct attacks with the character that steals cards can also be a problem.

Even more variability with the expansion set. 
Played it a dozen times, still not bored with it.

Can be ok with 2 or 3 players.  With more than 3, there is WAY too much downtime.  If you get assassinated, you're forced to sit out an entire round and watch everyone else think about their plays.  This is agonizing.  (I've played games where over 30 minutes went by without an opportunity to take any action at all.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Revisited this and didn't like it nearly as much.  I actually wasn't too excited to play it.  Maybe this is because I've been exposed to a lot more than when I first played this.  Or maybe the novelty has worn off.  We also played with 4, and I think being limited to just one role might make this a little less interesting.

But yeah, I just felt too controlled by the luck of drawing the right cards or not getting hit by the assassin/thief.

So I pulled the rating down from it's previous heights.

------------------

This is a fun double-guessing, card drafting game.  You have to figure out a way to reach goals without being too predictable.  When one player guesses what the other is going to do then they can really screw them over.

We've mostly played this with just 2 or 3 players and enjoyed it a lot.  You get to pick two roles and it's much easier to predict what everyone else is doing.

Another game that didn't terribly excite me, but was pretty fun.  In our game, the Assassin kept killing the thief, which was pretty funny, but when they didn't things were pretty cutthroat.

An interesting card drafting game that has the elements to be a great game. High player interaction and interesting decision making, including anticipation of what your opponents are going to do, are great features of the game. However, the main problem with this game is that is drags on way too long. There's many too much downtime when players are picking their role cards and whenever someone gets close to ending the game, another player uses the Warlord role to destroy one of their districts. These reasons alone make it a snooze to play.

Love the roles and role selection - if only the gameplay were that good!  Scales well.  The latest FFG smallbox production with the integrated expansion is nice.  I think I've come to prefer the expansion roles which expedite the gameplay.  I don't mind the take-that in turn bombing, money bombing, hand bombing, and district bombing but I don't feel they make up for the added game length in 4+ player games.  I think people should take their damn turns quickly no matter the roles they're playing, though!  It's not hard.

RATING: 8
I like the role selection, and I like the gameplay.  You're kind of at the mercy of the cards in the amount of points you can get, but there are mechanics in place to help you get over that hump.  It's fairly simple, once you get past all the rules in place to keep you from knowing exactly what anyone else has.

Traded. It didn't hit the table often after all. The game's popularity also questioned me the reason to hold on to my own copy. I don't mind playing it but not enough to own my copy I guess.

Hated the first time I played this. Thought it was way too long for what it is. Later learned that my friend taught me wrong, we've played 3p game but only chose one role per round. I then also learned that this game works quite nicely with 2 player. So I obtained my copy to try out with my wife. I love this game as a 2p game. It's snappier, more choices per turn, less chaotic and most importantly more head to head mind reading. I thought the the city building element was slapped on during my first play, I still think it is but in 2p play it didn't bother me as much as the game only last for 20 minutes or so.  Willing to explore more on expansions.

This game's fun, but it does have its share of problems. If too many people are playing, it can feel like you have to wait forever to take your turns. If you're playing with 2 (and probably 3, although I haven't played with 3 before) certain roles are far too swingy. 4 is about right.

RATING: 6
The role drafting and the various abilities of the roles is a key design aspect of this game that makes an otherwise middle of the road game interesting.  Game play can be a bit long and the blind bidding feel can frustrate players if the game is extended to far.  This is likely to be a game that either works for you or doesn't.  It can be highly interactive, so the players involved in the game will determine any interpretation of the game.  Worthy of playing on occasion. [GTI: TGCL]

From two plays, it seems that you'll do a lot better if you can predict what you're opponents want to do each round. As I'm not good at that I don't seem to do well.

I understand what the game is trying to do, with the psychology of figuring out what role each player took and seeing how you can move ahead or at least destroy their plans.

The player interaction in this game is awesome.  Players can effectively ally against someone in the lead by choosing specific roles to corner him and wreck his stuff (or at least waste his turn).  Great game.

After playing with 3 players, my esteem for this game has risen even further.  The two roles per game round guarantees that you will get a turn even if you are assassinated.  Plus, the one random unavailable role keeps everyone but the pineapple king guessing.

One of the games that got me into the Board Game Renaissance.  Picked it up on a whim, since the art was stellar.  Easy to learn, and loved the 'second guessing' of role choice, and choosing the right one vs what other people chose.  It can get tedious, however, if someone is good at assassinating you (you get no turns!), and the non 'role chosing' part of the game, of building up your city, is kind of dull.

Generally, but I've still come to love this game. Very nice and simple, and really like how the FF 3rd ed. is so portable and compact, I wish more games would be like that.

Unlike many people, I find that the 2-4 player game better than with more people, as you can double up the roles in those game, which reduces the 'meanness' factor in the game. As well, at bigger player counts the game can drag on and on and on...

With faster players more players might work just as well, but I also like the chance to play with 2 characters per turn.

A big hit on a family holiday when rain meant we were often stuck inside. Love the bluff and double bluff involved in card selection. Not sure how often it will come out at home when we have bigger fish to fry, but it punches above its weight among smaller games. 
Main criticism: either through deliberate targeting by rival players or bad luck, you can be left behind early on by repeated attacks from the assassin or thief. This doesn't happen often but isn't fun for the player concerned when it does.

despite only 2 plays, I think this might be my favorite of the "hidden role" games.  In most of these games there's either not quite enough "game" (werewolf) or the hidden role aspect isn't very satisfying to me (shadow hunters).

Citadels presents the players with tough choices that directly relate to the hidden role mechanic.

It works great.

*Update*
More plays now and this still is a wonderful game.  Every now and then you will get a dud game where either you are the unfortunate target of multiple assasinations, or the game as a whole just drags on a bit.

Still its great bang for your buck and a must play if you like the psychological dance that comes with hidden roles.

Got interested in Citadelles after so many games of Groo (with which it distantly shares the town building theme and 'take-that' aspect). Played my first games in a tavern with friends over some beers from 4 p.m. until 3 a.m. Excellent variable player power game which made me discover Bruno Faidutti. There are variants available and more than one edition was published.  I never get tired of this game!

Me and my boyfriend play a lot this game, is one of our favorites. When it;s about choosing personalities we try to guess what the other chooses. With more people I find a bit more chaotic, you can't really guess who chooses what. But it's also interesting. You have to pay attention on you chosen one, because there's a high risk that somebody will choose the thief or the assassin.
The interesting thing for me is when playing with expansion, and we choose the bonus characters: each game is pretty different, you have to find new strategies all the time, because the deck of characters which you use in a game changes all the time, and the characters influences each other.

My biggest problem with the game is with how slow it is with 4+ people. A round generally lasts at least 9-10 minutes because of the long time people take to choose characters. Then it takes 1-2 minute to resolve the choices. I prefer games where I get to "play" for more than 20% of the time. For this reason, in 4+ player games I think Citadels is too light/deep/slow/random for the final payoff. However, I have played several 2 player games and I like it a lot more this way. In my experience, this game is much better with fewer people (2-4). So overall I'd say Citadels is an good game for 2-4 players with the added versatility of enabling up to 8 players to play. If you are playing with 4+, insist on fast role selection.

Nagyon tetszett!! Könnyed és változatos, 4-en próbáltuk. Nálam kenterbe veri a Dominiont.
---
Nem tudom már, 2010-ben, amikor először próbáltam, miért pont a Dominionhoz hasonlítottam:) Így 5 év elteltével újra játszva vele ami elsőként eszembe jut, hogy szerintem megelőzi a korát. Konfrontatív játékot nem kedvelőknek nem ajánlom. Olvastam hogy csak többen jó, de mi hárman is élvezzük, szerintem változatos, a sok karakter sok újrajátszhatóságot ad. Ráadásul mivel kevés játékos esetén 2 karaktert visz mindenki, kisebb a holtidő, és nehezebb teljesen kilőni valakit egy körből. Egy 6 fős játékban elég uncsi lehet ha kinyírják a karakterét valakinek és passzívan végigüli a teljes kört. Ráadásul a gyilkolással nem lehet tutira menni, lehet hogy véletlen mindig ugyanazt ölik meg, aki így végigüli a játékot tétlenül, a halott karaktereit siratva. Ez mondjuk nem túl pozitív, de szerintem még mindig jobb, mintha konkrét játékost lehetne megölni.
Sajnos a szabály nem elég egzakt, bizonyos szituációk nincsenek leszabályozva (pl. a Diplomata adhat cserébe olyan épületet, amiből már van a városomban? A logikus az hogy nem, de ez csak faq-ban van meg, ahogy sok más is. Elég sok egymásrahatásuk van a karaktereknek és épületeknek, ezen alaposan illett volna végigmenni a szabályban...)
De a hibái ellenére is jó kis játék!!
---
Húha, eddig max 4 fővel játszottam, most 9-en próbáltuk, ami azt hiszem hivatalosan nem is lehetséges, a szabályban max 7 fő van, a dobozon 8 az extrák miatt... Azt hiszem, igazságtalanság lenne ez alapján a parti alapján pontozni, mert nagyon sok holtidő volt így, 2 és fél - 3 óra volt a játékidő. Egyszer ki kéne már próbálni 5-6 fővel, ahogy ajánlják:))) Egyébként nem volt rossz élmény annyira, csak nem tudom eldönteni, mi akar ez lenni, partijátéknak hosszú, de amúgy meg laza káosz az egész... Néha bele lehet azért trafálni dolgokba, de sok esetben nem látom a tervezhetőséget.

Although playing with up to 3 players tends to be a bit boring,with bigger parties where every player picks only one of the characters available per turn, it is really intriguing to try and guess which one to take to further your goals, avoid sabotage and/or try sabotaging the other players. I like this deduction mechanic employed and the low down- and play time.

I find it to be ok.  Not especially excited about.  There is enough mind games and you can plan somewhat since you can try and predict what roles people are going to choose.  However, the Thief and the Assassin employs direct conflict, which would turn a lot of people as they can get pretty personal.  At the same time, I don't know how the game would work without them without applying athematic, rigid rules to prevent broken "combos".  Just not my cup of tea.

Possibly the biggest gaming hit yet with my boys (7 and 5) - despite the "take that" elements (and occassional break-downs!) they keep coming back for more. Very impressed by the 5 year-olds ability to think through his options. We play with the Witch and the Wizard to reduce the impact of the "take that" aspects to a degree. Especially good with 2 as you can never be certain which roles have been selected. Good with three too.

One of those classic games who made on role selection a widespread knwledge. It has light rules but need quite a lot of deduction and bluffing, so it is a great choice as a gateway-game. There's lots of chaos and chance, however, so it should not be taken too seriously, but seen as a fun ride (quasi a party game) and played very quickly (ideal play time: 30 minutes! Above this, it overstays its welcome...).

I enjoy the game, just not very much.  I like it when I am not getting assassinated or stolen from.  I dislike it when I am getting assassinated or being stolen from.  It's more than that though.  Due to the hidden role selection it can sometimes be tough to catch the leader as unless you are the Warlord you can't actively target another player, just roles.

It's a great game to try to figure out what role others will pick but there are enough choices that it's hard to be a consistently effective guesser.

I suspect the rating for this one will improve the more I play it.

The first game of this took a bit longer, and was a bit slower, than I would typically like.

Lo interesante de este juego es que no solo vas construyendo tu distrito, sino tienes que ir adivinando que personaje escojeran tus compañeros para hacerselo más dificil. A veces resulta complicado escoger entre hacer crecer tu ciudad o fastidiar al que antes era tu amigo y ya comienza más a parecerse a un conocido.

RATING: 7
The first card game I've owned - city building with hidden roles and a bit of bluffing among players. Game takes a bit too long that usually I'll make the end game triggering condition to be 7 instead of 8 cities. The character drafting at the start of every turn will really slow the game down if anyone is unfamiliarize with the characters or over-analyzing the possible characters that other players have already drafted. Still a good game but I'm pretty burn out from overplaying it when I initially own it, will still pull it out from time to time if requested. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very cleverly designed game.  Good amount of strategy.  I don't like the amount of downtime, though, while people are choosing characters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I think I like this game more then my friends and it's really not very good with less then 3 players. It's another city building game and I prefer San Juan over this. the major difference is the characters and they way you purchase your properties. It also have the added element that one character will be able to destroy a property of your opponent if you can pay the price. 

A majoy thing about this game is to always try and figure out which character each of your opponents are holding and since they are selected in a intricate way. The flaw in this is that you will almost always be able to figure it out or atleast very rarely be wrong if you just follow what is going on and that is really the greatest downside in this game since the characters you choose may counter effects of your opponents character or set him at a disadvantage. 

Since the characters are numbered from 1-8  and whoever picked #1 will play first during that round, plus with the added twist that that character happens to be the assassin who can chose to kill on of your opponents characters if you guess right of what they are holding (long sentence) it is a major advantage to be able to chose the assassin as you can take away your opponents advantage of his card for an entire turn. The more people you are the less power will the assassin have but the game is still not hard enough tactically to make it anywhere near the top of my list.

Fun on occation

First Play: Easy enoughy to learn but a cheat sheet with the character details on is essential, one per player. 

There is a danger of down time as people pick character cards so a timer might be necessary for those with AP.

I liked the deduction necessary to establish who was doing what for any particular reason. The randomness of the cards might be an issue with further plays but the expansion would seem to add legs to the life span of the game.

Looks like it could be a good one for the pub.

After further plays this one has legs and some. Rating up'ed (7.5)

Indeed the randomness is starting to jade the experience. Its an OK filler but having returned to play after a long break, it really did seem that a large slice of the game is out of a players control. Rating back to 7.

Very good game;  I really like it in its 3-player form.

Really cool game. You don't just focus on building your kingdom, but you try to read the other players and guess which character powers they'll choose each round. And based on this, you choose a power that will most benefit you.

Solid game for the simplicity. I like the mechanics that allow for a lot of player interaction (killing, stealing and destruction of property). Enough luck to make it interesting but usually not enough to kill a superior strategy. Easy to learn, decently quick game play and high number of players make it a good choice for large groups. If someone is having a good night and winning a lot of games; throw this game in, gang up on them and take them off the winners seat ;)

RoleSelection, Solo

I've mostly played this game two-player, and it's been an excellent role-choosing game (one of the mechanics that Puerto Rico and Meuterer are famous for).  I have been playing this game multiplayer online, and I enjoy it there too, about as much.  In my personal copy, the character cards are safely sleeved for handling.
  
I keep this game around because it's a great bluffing/role-choosing game, and I am fond of bluffing games.  The game around the mechanic is simple, and the roles interact with that game in interesting (and sometimes brutal) ways.  The alternate characters in the American version are a must.

One of the most back-stabby games I own.  Great fun with the right crowd.  It's a bit long sometimes even with the seven-district variant.  I suggest six unless you've got a crowd that's into it, but you have to find the scoring changes to make that work.

Borrowed from library. 2 playthroughs. Played with 2 players using 2 characters each. I think i would have enjoyed this game alot more with a few extra players. With 2 you always had a an idea of what the other player was going to do, whether they would steal your gold or attack your buildings, so more often than not you could preempt that from occurring.

Borrowed this from a friend for bit over a year and now considering buying this myself. Great psychology aspects when trying to determine who is playing what character, which I think is the best aspect of this game. Suits very well for groups from 4 to 7 players. Only problem is the endgame which can drag too long.

Edit: bought the borrowed game from the friend.

One of the first games I got when I got "back" into boardgaming. Blew my friends and myself away the first few times. It's a good game with it's mechanic of choice of character each round. The initial "wow" feeling has faded and nowdays it doesn't get much play since it seems to drag on for quite a bit, especially with more players. Four players seems to be the ideal number to me.

Scales nice for 2-8 players and well balanced, but I have grown to dislike as a 2p game as it becomes predictable for those with a good memory.  However, everyone picks it up easily and enjoys the game.  Larger numbers of players can make for a long game, especially if you have AP or distracted players.  Small, so travels well.  Nice addition to the collection.  Character cards showing wear already, ended up sleeving cards.

Also, some of the friends I play with tend to like this game with many people, so with 4-5 players they might say "it's not enough people" and ask for a different game :(

Good 4-5 people game. 6+ makes it too slow, and the 2-3 player game is a bit clunky.

The interaction of the different roles is wonderful, and the twist of attacking other players by guessing which role they selected is awesome.  It's a really great game as long as it doesn't last too long.  We usually play to 7 districts instead of 8 to keep things moving.  I don't recommend playing with large groups, though, unless none of the players suffer from analysis-paralysis.

For some reason people can really freeze up when making their role selection, so be prepared for that.  Also, this game is about beating others down as much as it is about building yourself up, so don't play with players that have easily bruised feelings.  The fun in this game comes primarily from the assassin and the thief roles.  Players who select those roles are challenged to select the role that a particular person chose, and players who might be targeted are challenged to select roles that the assassin and thief won't expect.  It makes the game tons of fun, and I love seeing the look on someone's face when I select the right role and steal their pot of gold.

Played this once when I was in no condition for gaming. I was extremely tired and had huge problems focusing. Add to that that 3 of the 5 people had never played before so we had massive amounts of downtime while people selected roles. The game lasted more than 2½ hours which is just way too long for a game like this.

I did see the potential in the game though. A game that is easy to grasp but hard to master. Indeed I came in second to last after struggling immensely the first few rounds. Don't feel like I can rate it properly at this time though - would need more plays. Which I'd happily do - I just wish there was less downtime. We played this right after 7 Wonders where downtime is close to zero.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Incredibly fun.  Everybody knows the strategy, so it turns into a game of can-I-out-think-you with the character cards.  Play mechanics work seamlessly, and for the seeming complexity of the character cards, I could explain the entire game in 3-5 minutes.  The two-player game, which is where all of my plays have been so far, has been thrilling, intense, and most of all, fun.  Anxious to try it with more players.

Alright, tried with more players and I'm convinced.  Tremendous fun and staying power.

Fun game that gets better as you add more people. It's nice to have a 7 player game that works well. Your role changes between 7 personalities allowing you to do something different each time you switch during the card draft. Guessing who will select what also gives advantages to the assassin or thief as you try to be the first to build 7 buildings and acquire the most points based on their difficulty to build.

I played this once with 6 players.  It feels like a filler but then drags on, especially when people over-analyze their role choice, considering how much luck is actually involved with the blind decision making and draw of the cards.  I felt I had very little control over what was going on.  It's probably hard to avoid that in a game that can accomadate up to 7 players, which is it's major plus.
I have no interest in playing it again.

I've played this twice, each time with 7 players. Each time I was told it would be a fast game, and each time it ran over two hours. Assassination, stealing, and destroying buildings all make a long, slow, boring game longer. And it's not as if you have anything to do on your turn if any of them happen to you. It's a slow, boring, slog and I never want to play it again.

The only reason it's a 3 and not lower is because I hear it might be better with fewer people. If so, why even go up to that many players?

Good stuff. Easy to understand, even for newbies, yet very different from most other games. Some geeks have complained that it is too lobng, but I really don't thik so. We have played with 6 players a number of times and it has been good fun until the end. Nasty game as well, I like that!

Update 080308: Lowered the rating to 7. Can easily run too long. I prefer Mission:Red planet if we are not too many players.

Update 110625:
Lowered to 6. I just never ask to play this game. With 4 players, I still think it would be fun for me though.

Great game, really enjoyed with 2 but it shines with 4 or more. Easy to teach with lots of interaction and second guessing.

Some might say it is a little over long (depends on the thinking time of the players involved), and it is certainly chaotic and frustrating, but I guess that is one of the things that makes it a great game.

RATING: 9
Citadels is the perfect (card) game for it keeps the rules to a minimum while making for a deep interaction among players and creating a very warm and friendly ambience: actually I would number it among the all-time best games as well, for it requires strategy, skills, vision and even a bit of luck, which helps prevent the game from being too cold and impersonal.

Citadels is easy both to understand and play and as such it’s a good game to be played with casual or non gamers: quickly indeed they’ll feel like they’re pulled into the middle of the action and within just a couple of turns they’ll start thinking they could even make it, thus pondering more cautiously their next actions.

Edit: after further plays I raised my rating from 8 to 9 in November 2011.

I owned this game a long time ago, played it a bunch 2-player and was unimpressed, so I traded it away. Recent games with three players made me more impressed with the central role-selection/imperfect information mechanic, but ultimately until I play with more (ie enough that we're not selecting two roles per player) I think this will remain a 6. I'm convinced the game scales VERY poorly.

EDIT: after a 5-player game where I came second, I think the problem is that I just don't really deal all that well with the sort of role selection game that privileges the reading of multiple tableaus at once. Might be why I find the higher levels of RftG strategy so difficult, too.

RATING: 3
Six is too many for this game (way too long), two is too little for this game.  It might be okay with 3 or 4 people and I would be willing to give it another spin.  Otherwise, the game is okay...I didn't find anything special about it and would rather play other things instead.

A "gateway" game for me that I haven't played in a while. Always play with the Diplomat--the Warlord's ability to destroy one cost buildings for free is too destabilizing (and forcibly trading buildings is more interesting than simply destroying them.)

RATING: 7
Good game but having only one interactive element it gets repetitive. Brilliant to play just once in a while though. To my surprise I have heard some people consider the game unbalanced. This is an impossibility since the balance is determined by the players themselves as it is they who choose roles to play every turn. The only aspect of unbalance lies in that some people are easily read and some are poor at reading others.

Completely loathsome.  I have had the unfortunate pleasure of playing this again recently and it confirmed that this is maybe the most overrated game on the Geek even at a paltry 100+ ranking.  At least other highly rated games have something I can point to as appealing, here we just have a pile of randomness rolled in with some hosage and then overbaked with a 45 minute playing time.  Virtually no important decisions yet one player always spends far too much time thinking about what role to pick.  Then I get assassinated even though I have no chance of winning as it is.  At really short filler length it might be tolerable, but it's not and for that I give it my second lowest rating.

Traded this away years ago, and should not have.  Great game with some interesting interactions.  Only negative is the downtime during role selection.

// I like the city-building aspect of this game. On the
other hand, I don't like the negative player interaction
in the game, like being taken out of the round by an 
assassin, or stolen from by the thief. Those things work
better at higher player counts, but make the game feel
way too frustrating with 2 players.

I've only played this in 2-player, against an experienced player.  It was a fascinating exercise in logic, deduction and indecision!

Played this a few more times now, in some larger groups. I like it - it's not amazing, but it doesn't take too long, and I like the feeling of always being able to do something. On the other hand, it's a pain if everyone decides you're winning and spends their time trying to stop you, and the assassin effectively wiping out someone's turn isn't a great feeling. I'm not a fan of mechanics that see people losing turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Any real strategy is negated by the game's chaotic nature. But who doesn't love the little conversations you have with yourself when trying to pick a character? "He's bound to be the merchant! No, wait, that's what he'd expect me to think - he's probably the thief. Or maybe he's the warlord - I'd better take the priest. Oh wait, I haven't got any blue districts....ahhhh!!!"

I have only played this with two players so I cannot speak to the "wildness" of the game with many players or speak to the claim I've heard that it can overstay its welcome. The two player game was a very fun conjunction of choosing of roles, bluffing and strategy. It's a short game (again, with two players) and it surprised to me to find that there still was a little feeling of theme in the gameplay that made the experience enjoyable. It was satisfying to look over my city at the end of the game. It's not a brainburner and could be played with the same intensity as Carcassonne, for example, and therefore could allow conversation and music, for example. It's a great weeknight game and I'm glad to have it in the collection.

Update: I finally played it with six players and it moved up to an 7 to an 8. I get it now. We played with the Diplomat and only to six cards and this kept the time down significantly. With a watchful eye towards keeping the play time at a healthy pace I think this is a winner.

Another Faidutti title that I'd just rather pass on. I don't get into the excitement of the role selection, especially when that is essentially all the game is.

My friends love this, I don't anymore. The game itself isn't very deep and after a few plays you know the drill and are just hoping not to get killed. There isn't much tactic in the game itself, it mostly lies in the psychological game of which I think it's not a lot of fun. 
In short: a little too shallow for me after a few plays. Non-gamers seem to really like it though.

Some have said it isn't great with seven, but how many games are?  It seems fine with that number to me.  I have yet to try it with fewer but I suspect it will still be good.  The extra characters help this. Just about always willing to play.

Never thought this was the greatest game, but it was one of the first games I played starting the board game hobby. Almost everybody who played something more than staple games like Statego, Risk and Monopoly seems to know this game. I'd say it's probably as well known as Catan.

After trying a 5 player game and a 2 player game, I have to say that for Citadels, the more the merrier.

I don't really know what Citadels is. 

It claims to be a bluffing, cutthroat, city-building game that operates within variable powers and turn-order, (overall some really nice mechanics) but nothing truly stands out in terms of purpose. In fact, everything is kinda pithy with elements of luck and low decision making. Most of the time, it comes down to how good your starting hand is and who can build their citadel first.

Another game others love and I loathe. It's all about punishing success - unless you luck out and get missed. Collect gold, it'll be stolen, get a big hand and the magician swaps with you, take a good role and be killed by the assassin. You can't plan ahead, the 'take that' is rather random, game is just too chaotic for me.

Add the downtime and it's killed stone dead - had no fun at all, just wanted the game to end ... could stand it if it ran 20 minutes, but three times that (+) no thanks.

Surprisingly balanced.  I had originally thought all of the strategy is in what you do, but it's more in how you anticipate what others will do.  You can't hoard gold because it'll be stolen.  You can't pick the merchant with three green districts because you will be assassinated.  Jumped up a few points once I realized this.

A nice game that can be completed fairly quickly. After a little stumbling with the rules (which, to be fair, may have been due to my attempt at describing them - something I'm not too brilliant at) it went along fairly smoothly. 
It wouldn't take too long to complete, and with the extra 'special' characters after the first few games, it could become quite good! 

A great little game if you've not got too long to play something, or if you've got a few hours to kill (waiting for meals, or at an airport waiting for your flight).

The cards have really nice artwork on them too, which is always a plus - even if a subjective plus. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad game, the drafting for the role can be annoying as when you are last you get stuck with whatever is left which forces your playing.  The assassin making people lose a turn can be very annoying, especially for those who get hit multiple times in a row.  An interesting game but just not my style.

Fun game but it gets old.

update: I played again recently in 7-player game and it was pure torture. The game took way too long (though 2 or 3 of the people were new). The perfect number for this game is 4 or 5, with more than that it goes far too long, and the 2 and 3 player variants totally suck.

edit: kinda wish I hadn't traded it away.

10x10 2015. The action selection by drafting characters is cool.  There's not a whole lot going on in the game and it may be a little long for how simple it is. But it's a small game that plays a good number of people, and I think it fits that niche pretty well.

RATING: 9
Fast-paced, fun, nerve-racking, and makes for some hilariously paranoid situations. Every round you secretly draft role cards that give you specific upgrades as you try to build up a city, but some role cards are specifically designed to screw other players over. However, as much as the game is very much about screwing over other players, the fact that you can easily recover means that Citadels never feels particularly mean. A great, portable card game that I carry around just in case, and it usually does a great job of filling in awkward gaps of time.

I LOVE the role interaction and bluffing and second- and third- and fourth-guessing of Citadels, but honestly  I would be happier if the buildings were simpler; as it is, they are too "interesting" to me, such that they distract from the game's key mechanisms.

An old favorite of my gaming group. I must confess that Citadels is a rather flawed game, but I still have a soft spot for it.

It provides a greatly different player experience with different player counts. 2-player Citadels is surprisingly good; it is a very tense guessing and bluffing game.

3-player Citadels does not balance perfectly, since the first player typically has too great of an advantage. 4-player and 5-player are better, but then down time starts to become a serious issue.

- Do not try to play it after consumption of alcohol - people get angry very fast
- A bit too much randomness in drawing the castle cards
- the 1st player (the king) has more chance (and if experienced way to control the game) to win and the last player (who gets only the worst cards every time)

Players have to realize it's a bluffing game or they will get targeted by the assassin and the thief.  Getting hit by these two (especially the assassin) can take the fun out of the game.

This game is spectacular in that it's easy to learn the general gameplay, but very difficult to master.

The role selection is great fun. Some roles are obviously better than others. It becomes interesting because the good roles have a higher chance of being murdered by the assassin and making too obvious choices makes you a target for the thief.

Sometimes it happens that one player gets murdered and mugged several times in a row (without intension from the other players) which leaves them with no chance to win. Luckily this doesn't happen too often.

The extra roles from the included expansion are good to mix in with the original roles, but overall I prefer the ones from base game.

I just don't like this game.  The role mechanic is somewhat interesting, but the rest of the game is pretty dull.   There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of tension or excitement in this one.

It also slows down waaaay too much as you approach 6 players.

Far superior as a tactical 2-player game. 

4-player is a better version of 3-player but anything above that is pure torture. Citadels should take max 1 hour, MAX! There are loads of other games out there with much more depth and much more interesting choices and situations to experience in an hour than Citadels will ever provide.

I've owned this for ages, but for some reason it hasn't gotten played...until recently. Introduced to some friends my wife and I was been converting to the goodness of gaming and it was a smash hit. They previously only played Ticket to Ride and Pandemic and this game introduced them to more direct conflict, screw someone over type game play.

RATING: 6
One of the strengths of this game is playing well with large numbers. What I find difficult is that bad things happen to good people - since you pick on people usually by role rather than by player it can be difficult to pick on the people you want to and difficult to avoid being picked on. Of course, in a sense that IS the game...

I think this game is quite good.  This was one of my first game purchases, and I like that it's playable with large groups and by occasional gamers, although they may find it too punishing.  Slows down quite a bit with more than 5, though.

Played 3-player:  Did not care for 3-player... king doesn't move around enough and one player can end up hosed in the character selection process for a whole game.  Would likely raise my ratings for either 2-player or 4+ player games. UPDATE: Played 6-player and raised my rating.  The game played more quickly and was more interesting.  Still don't love it, but certainly enjoyed it more.

RATING: 6
I liked this game a lot when I first played it, but then it started to wear on me. A group of friends really likes to play this game and so I have probably overplayed it. We've played with six or more which makes it too long and too long inbetween decisions. It is probably best with 4. I find the assassin a flaw in the game. It isn't very fun to get killed and miss your entire turn and can completely ruin the game for you if it happens to often. The game also has a king-maker problem; I've had several games were two or more were in contention to win and then one of the other players destroyed one of their buildings (sometimes for spite because that player took their cards earlier in the game) and completely handed the game to the other player. I like games where I win based on how well I play, not by how long I can fly under the radar. It can be quite fun though and if you play it in light-spirits it makes for an enjoyable game.

My rating is when playing two-player. It goes down steeply from there. The 2 player variant is a wonderful mind game.

I've played this with 2,3,4,5 and 7 players. I will bow out graciously when a 7-player game comes up again and probably with a 5. 7 players just doesn't work. The five player game was not as enjoyable as the 4. The 4 was not as enjoyable as the 2 or 3.

Played this again recently with three and had a blast. So my rating climbed, but ONLY FOR 2 or 3 Players. Any more and a horrible waste of time.

This is a game, like Forbidden Island, that has a high "cost to fun" ratio.

Played with three players. Very fun, although (at least in the one time I've played) the Assassin is hugely overpowered, and some of the other role cards were almost entirely ignored (in particular, the Magician and the Bishop -- although my brother invoked the Bishop at just the right time to nearly eke out a victory).

UPDATE: Played again with five, incl. three new players. The game dragged a little, and it was much harder to teach than I had expected -- it took a couple of turns before everybody understood the roles well enough. But then everybody got into it! The most surprising aspect, with so many people: heated negotiations to avoid (or redirect) the Warlord's power.

UPDATE: With two players, the thief is too weak, and the bishop too powerful. Might have to swap out.

UPDATE: I have yet to have a truly outstanding session of this game. That makes me sad. Downgraded.

The best known pre-PR role-choice game, and deservedly so (though inspired by 'Veratter').  Being a Faidutti, there's touches of chaos here, and the Assassin, Thief, Magician and Warlord can make things very tough if you seem to be a random target, but you should only be a target if you're doing well.  Played properly, those characters help make sure there are no runaway winners and the whole is nicely balanced as a result, with finishes usually pretty tight.  Just don't overthink it or it will drag on a bit too long - the key is for the King to keep a close eye on things and move on at a good pace rather than letting things meander.  Still Bruno's best I think.

EDIT: the time change things! I kept my copy of the game until now and recently rediscovered it.
My thought is that Citadels is a good bluff game for experienced players: they can appreciate flavour game and sub-mechanics occurring with some roles.
Dark City expansion completely unbalanced: we used the witch and the alchemist and they completely broke the flow.

I have at best mixed feelings on this one ... much, much too slow with more than 5 people, and the game is perversely designed to limit any control you might try to exert over the it. The game is too long for what it is; the endgame can be tedious. If the King doesn&#039;t move much, and you are usually to his right, it&#039;s going to be even longer, really painfully long. Despite this, though, it&#039;s a nice-looking game, easy to play and with some interesting stuff. Not really a recommendation, but worth giving a try.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
I was going to give Citadels a 9, but then I had to raise it to a 9.5 because it's just that good.  There are a few minor flaws that hold this game back from a perfect 10 (why does the Library cost more than the Smithy?), but few games offer more excitement and intrigue.  This game has rivaled Settlers in terms of play time for all of the gaming groups that I've introduced it to.  It's great as a 3-player and a 4-player game, and that's something Settlers can't say.  Like Dante's Commedia, Bruno Faidutti's Citadels is a work of art for the ages.

This game does not shine until 6 or 7 seven people are playing.  One person in our group does not like it- but she has beaten all odds and is usually assassinated (over half the time) and this obviously leaves a sour taste in the mouth.  (She can pick Architect just because it clearly wouldn't help her any and she still gets assassinated!)

RATING: 4
Although a little simplistic, I quite enjoy this little game and would love to break it out when time is limited or when I'm too tired to devote the required energy to one of my larger games.  

Unfortunately, my typical gaming partners don't seem to enjoy this game: one doesn't care for the bluffing/deduction mechanic; one doesn't care for the conflict demanded by half the roles.  Consequently, I can't accurately comment on the depth of strategy or quality of the experience. 

I am quite disappointed by the blandness of the buildings.  It'd be nice to feel like I was really building up some sort of city, rather than just "banking" gold (which is largely what building amounts to).

I feel like there's more waiting to be explored. 

Edit: I'm making an effort to rate games where possible, even if a bit premature.  After purchasing and playing Battle Line, I just can't imagine this hitting the right spot with any group short of 5+ (Battle Line is far Superior with 2 players; Dominion or Race for the Galaxy are more interesting with 3-4) and that seems like it might just be chaos.

I'm quite fond of this game. However, at least when meeting up with gamers (the more involved sort) I tend to suggest somewhat weightier games than Ohne Furcht und Adel/Citadels/Citadelles. Yet, with a more casual partyish crowd this might be a good alternative to Kuhhandel/Tabu/Heimlich & Co. which happen to be our staples for a wine/beer late night crowd. Got this feeling that the step up in complexity is still digestible for such a gaming group - at least if they're not hardcore non-gamers. After all, it's more psychology and bluff than calculating strategy (which doesn't tend to mix well with a less than sober state. :p ). 

So, given the low price, I may pick up this one for the above purpose.

Now. This one is a great for people, who have problem with more demanding games. Quite simple rules (with few exceptions), fast play, nice pictures and this role selection mechanics is just good for certain people. But you have to prepare for 0 friendliness at the table. So much negative interaction, bluffing, plotting, backstabbing. This game gives you maximum satisfaction from a fillerish game. My co-workers and neighbours want to play this on and on and on... The box says: 2-7 players, you can play all range and it will be ok. Some like it for 2 players, some for 3-4 players and some more. I am in the first two groups.

This got pulled out by a new guy at our game group. I was not sure (even though I have owned it for a couple of years now) and was very happy with what happened next. We played a great wee game. Trying to figure out who each person is, so you can make sure you steal the money right, or kill the right person to stop them doing something that could end the game too soon... Played a second time with different characters. There were a couple of errata questions that could have been answered a lot better but these things iron themselves out pretty quickly.

Still one of my all-time faves. The role mechanism allows for such delightful knife-between-the-shoulder-blades stuff between players. But if you get knocked out by the assassin a couple of times, it's possible to get so far behind you can't catch up. The fix: replace the assassin with the tax collector from the Dark Cities expansion.

Way too long for what it offers, as it doesn't offer much other than randomly blasting away at each other hoping that we made the right call to move ourselves forward and the leaders back.

Citadels was never something I played a lot of (my group had already more or less exhausted it by the time I'd entered the hobby - a mere two years after its release), but I enjoyed it with a few caveats (use of expansion roles to replace Assassin & Thief, always playing to 7 buildings, never playing with more than 5 players). These days, I find it incredibly hard to go back to.

Let's start with the positive, though: the role selection mechanic here is great. By now, there have been a million copycats or variations on it but Citadels' implementation is uniquely tense and exciting (okay, besides Meuterer which is identical, but has a better game wrapped around) - it just plain feels good to pull off what can feel like elaborate double bluffs, and correctly deduce which roles the other players are going to select in order to maximize your personal gains. There's better bluffing games, to be sure, but Citadels' mind games (and the rewards they reap) carves itself a nice identity all its own (again, excepting Meuterer but nobody wants to play that with me for some reason).

And yet... I feel like the game occupies this weird space between "light game" and "filler". It's somehow not enough to say "the game drags on for too long", though that is the core issue. It's just not punchy enough to hold up to an hour (more frequently 1.5 minimum), and even at 30-45 minutes (rare) it feels bloated. I just think I would like this game better if it had been pared down to its absolute barest essence, dissolving all of the fat (I apologize for the yucky imagery) and leaving behind only the PURE FUN that is the shining core - the kind of bare-bones-but-maximized-fun systems that are the hallmark of a good filler. Everything surrounding the bluffing and double bluffing just feels non-essential.

And it doesn't help that all of the truly confrontational interaction in Citadels serves to extend the game time. Assassin, Warlock, Thief... these roles all just artificially draw things out, while encouraging you to attack the leader without really feeling like you're making tactically satisfying or clever plays.

Blame it on the advancement of designs, but these days whenever I think of Citadels I increasingly find myself wishing it was either just... more than it is or less. And for me, there's just no turning back.

Great Game. I have owned this for many years now and it's always one that my friends request to play. Fun mechanics, great roles, amazing artwork and overall, a fun game. We even figured out how to play this on your lap as a travel version. My only issues with the game is that it can get a bit slow towards the middle and some combinations are just overall nasty (I'm talking about when the assassin AND thief target the same role). But those aren't so bad compared to other game downfalls. 8/10

This game has player interaction in spades, but drags badly until players have read over the roles a few times. Three player makes it a bit too easy to give someone a guarenteed hosing -- I hope two player will have a bit less of this.

Un juego ligero entretenido y divertido. El factor suerte aparece, si bien casi nunca no es determinante en las partidas, añadiendo variedad al juego. Aunque Ciudadelas es un juego ligero, yo no lo recomendaría como iniciación. Normalmente surgen problemas a la hora de conjugar los diferentes roles con sus posibilidades estratégicas, y al mismo tiempo, confunden habitualmetne la regla de principio de turno de o coger dos cartas y elegir una o coger dos monedas. 

An entertained and amused light game. The luck appears, although it isn t determinant, adding variety to the game. Although Ciudadelas is a light game, I would not recommend it like introduction to the boardgames.

There are many things I like about this game.  The components are nice and the artwork on the cards are very well done.  The premise of the game is simple, but there is a lot of strategy.  The main gripe that I have with the game is that the perfect setup is required to have a blast with the game.  Although it plays with 2-6 players, I've only had a really fun time with 5 players. With less than 5, it becomes a lot more predictable what roles players pick with the amount of information on the table.  With more than 5, the game tends to drag and become too chaotic.  Even with 5 players, the right crowd needs to be involved for everyone to have a good time.  The game can be very cutthroat, even if the actions are based on educated guesses.  A person who is constantly killed, stolen from, and districts destroyed will have a miserable time.  People who don't take setbacks well will darken the mood of the game.  The game can move really slowly due to the analysis paralysis that may occur.  If you have a group of heavy gamers, the rounds will tend to drag.  I would rate the game higher, but lowered the score due to the difficulty to have the ideal setup of players and personalities required to make the game enjoyable.

RATING: 4
Bizarre mashup of chaotic take-that fest and deep decision making deduction game. I usually like that kind of managed chaos hybrid, but here the assassin and thief choices often seem arbitrary. And they might as well call the warlord role the kingmaker or game-never-ender. Too many odd purple cards that completely change the game as well. The card that ends the game one building early is absurd, as you can't plan anything. If the game played in 45 minutes, it could be OK, but it drags on and on and on

If I remember correctly, my first rating of Citadels was 7.5 or so. It was quite intriguing because of the role selection mechanism. Since that first play my enthusiasm for the game has declined, and it's mainly because of the fact that it's actually a quite light game without many meaningful decisions and because it's basically just too long for what it offers.

I still think the role selection is okay, and it's always funny to pick the Assassin or Thief and think about who picked which role! Those two, along the warlock, means that the game has a fair amount of interaction which is almost always a plus.

I wouldn't play it with more than 5 players I think, simply because of the massive downtime and long playing time, and if I'm playing it again I think I'm going to suggest to play with the variant that the game ends after the 7th building has been built as I think that's much better for a game like this.

One thing I appreciate about a game, but which has nothing to do with the gameplay, is the size of the box... I don't have much space for games, so this tiny box is warmly welcomed (and the new edition even includes the expansion which is great)! Still, the gameplay isn't great so it's a game I don't need to own and will probably only play on rare occasions.

RATING: 7
Playful, frustrating, enjoyable chaos that is surprisingly quick for newbies to pick up. I consider it a must have for any gaming library, and partly because it it scales well from 3 to 7. It's a must to put the character cards in protectors. // Kudos to Fantasy Flight on upgrading the 05 edition---smaller box, better card quality, expansion included = ALL GOOD 

UPDATE: 01/09
Hitting the table more as I have been teaching it to new people just coming into designer games. For those first four or five times you play it with a new crowd---this is good stuff! Maybe you can play it into the ground if played too often, but it is a favorite of mine to teach and introduce to new gamers. 

NOTE: In an effort to speed the game up I teach the game with 7 buildings as the goal (6 for the very first game teaching) and also allow players to keep both cards on a draw. Speeding the game up is important to keep the game fresh. Usual good for a copy plays with a group and then we move on before it starts bugging people.

RATING: 7.67
The two and three player games are friendlier, because they guarantee that each player will get at least one turn each round.  I also prefer the Witch to the Assassin; not only is it "gentler", in that the bewitched player gets his action, but it's also more interesting with the Witch getting to take over that player's turn.

The downtime is too long in this game. It still serves a purpose in my collection as a lighter  multiplayer game, but lots of downtime while players wait to choose a role.

My criterion for rating games


http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: For the most part this game is the same everytime, but there is some mystery in what roles you will be passes and what role each player has taken.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions.  Some choices throughout the game mostly about what role to pick. Too many times it is obvious which role you need to take.

3) Player interaction:  This is the strength of this game.  Trying to figure out which role each player is taking and who the assassin/thief is attacking as well as whose building the warlord is going to destroy is fun.

4) Components/artwork:  Nice cards and money tokens that look like candy! The artwork is kind of strange and not really my thing.

5) Game length/complexity:  The game has a nice about of complexity for a game night crowd, but the game can really drag on with the assassin killing the merchant/navigator and the thief stealing and the warlord blowing up the buildings. It can really drag with more than 4 players.

This game is a winner for me.  A tremendous amount of potential for strategy building on each turn, and the game plays very fast with 2 or 3 players (because you can build up to 2 buildings per round).  Overall, a fun game, with easy rules and fast play.

This game is the most fun with 5 or 6 players, and a few purple building cards from the expansion (that comes with the new reprints from FFG).  Each player only gets one role, so the game plays out longer, but the element of intrique, suspicion, and guessing really make this a gamers game.  A lot of fun with a group of people - Well done!

RATING: 7.2
A nice little card game that takes @30 minutes to play.  The cards are of excellent quality with moderate to good art.  The gold coins that come with the game feel substantial enough that you feel good getting them and are not so big that they're cumbersome to deal with.  
Strategy can vary depending on the number of players, with the mechanic of picking your role(s) being the most notable change.  I am particularly fond of this part of the game; the challenge of figuring out the best role to chose based on the mindset of the other players.
Biggest complaint is that the city districts being played don't feel to have any real relationship to each other (why would my city have a battlefield?).  
All things said, a great game either for a quick one-off between other games or for an entire evening with friends.

Played this a lot ages ago, and still enjoy it when it comes out.  I like the art and the flavor of the game, and think the selection of character/powers is well balanced.  Games tend to result in pile on the leader activity, so often the first person to approach a win is definitely not going to win.  It can have some real player conflict, which some people may be averse to.  The expansion characters can alleviate this some, such as the diplomat which is a less screw-you version of the warlord.

Initial rating is a 6 after a 2 player game, but I suspect this will go up. The true test will be to see how this game works with a range of player numbers, as I'd like this to be flexible enough for 2, 3, 6, and even 7 players.

Update: I'm still only playing this with two players, but I'm liking it more. Bump it up to a "7". It took a while but it's growing on me. The rules read OK, but nothing special. The first game felt "eh." But once you learn the character cards and how to play off your opponents, it becomes much more enjoyable. Curious to see how this plays with 5, 6, or 7 people. I expect this rating will continue to increase as people learn the game.

Update: Finally played this with 4 players. It's not shockingly better than 2 players... just different. I predict though that with 6 or 7 players this game would drag too much. 4 or 5 is definitely the "sweet spot."

Update: Dropped this to a 6, and it probably stays there. I don't mind owning it... it's cheap, and it serves as a decent gateway game for new players. However, it's also a little long (I can see how I'd always cut it down to 7 districts), and there's many more interesting games I want to play at this complexity and time frame.

Update: traded this away in a math trade for the Treasure Chest expansion for In the Year of the Dragon. This just wasn't getting any play, and there's far more interesting games in my collection.

A secret role selection game that is fun for the first few rounds, but there is too much attacking in this game for it to be a lot of fun for me. The game can simply stall out once people get to 6 buildings because so many roles damage other players and take a few more turns so it outstays its welcome. I will admit the purple building card special abilities are pretty good and really do give the game some extra life, but if I am looking for a game of this type I would reach for Libertalia because in that game you know it will end after a set number of turns.

RATING: 7
The most amusing part of this game for me is looking at what roles have already been taken and trying to figure out who has done what.  Some of the game is luck and some of the game is skill in figuring out what moves to make, but in a large game, most of the players--especially those further in the middle, further away from the king--have to make lucky guesses or clever deductions to figure out who's playing which role.  An egg timer might be useful for the role selection phase of the game, especially in larger games.

Update on 9/11/15: Okay. It is not terrible with three. Moderately fun. The take that aspect is a little annoying but, with less downtime, I can see more of the charm of the game. But there isn't much.

(3/29/10 - still 10 plays): I've got to steal enzo622's comment. It is just too right on:

"Ugh, this game annoys the hell out of me! Seriously, I can't believe people enjoy sitting around a table and playing a game of "random take-that" that goes on and on and on... and on and on. Twenty minutes for a group of 8 per turn and if you get assed out of a turn by the Assassin or Thief or whatever, you're looking at literally 40 minutes without doing much at all. And the thing is, you got assed out of a turn completely randomly; the other player was probably not even gunning for you.

I played Mission: Red Planet and it was the same thing. I could not figure out why I was at the table when a monkey would have the same results as a human playing that game. I guess if you want to be absolved of any responsibility for winning or losing, these types of games may appeal to you.

I can't stand Bruno Faidutti games and their chaotic, random style of "take that". Mr. Faidutti, you know what? Chicken butt."

(2/2/10 - 10 Plays) I'm doing a ratings revision, and maybe this isn't fair, but I can't imagine asking to play this game, and I can only imagine it being fun with certain people. The action selection mechanism just bugs the crap out of me.

Originally rated a 6. Since updated to a 7 after 7 plays. So far played with 7, 6, 4, 3, and 2. What is actually neat about this is how totally differently it plays with different numbers. So far, I think I like four the best. With 6 & 7, the game went far longer than its worth.

I enjoy this game every time but it's the best with 6 or 7 players. The mechanics of choosing secretly your character every turn is great. You must guess which character other players chose. I give it 1 point less when playing with less than 5 players.

Remarkably reminiscent of Illuminati, but better!  Unfortunately this doesn't also mean that it is particularly good.  Also, unlike Illuminati it plays reasonably with 2 - 8 (use the 2-player variants on Bruno's site for 2, and the new/extra characters for 8).

RATING: 8
Players: 2 − 7*
*Dark City expansion adds an 8th player with adjusted rules.

[Played with 2 Player Rules]
A lot of game in a little box. Almost 2 games in one with 2 solid core mechanics. Choosing a character (and hindering your opponents in the process) and building a city, enhanced by your character's abilities. The fact that you're changing characters each round makes it all the more interesting.

Starts out as a luck based game, but over the rounds you can influence how the game plays out for both yourself and your opponents. The hand that you are dealt in the beginning really shapes your strategy from the onset. 

Full of options. One of Bruno Fiadutti's best! Also comes with the Dark City expansion which adds more variety.

Pretty decent fun bluffing game, though it can drag with higher player counts, particularly if the warlord gets used a lot (just about ony character/role can be replaced with an alternate one, though).

Too long to be a filler, even to be a deluxxx-super-filler like Race For The Galaxy or Fleet, more interesting games with similar footprints and half the playtime. Too insubstantial to be a really good main-event game. But, at the same time, not an actually [i]bad[/i] game, if you feel me. Just an unmemorable one. But at the very least it certainly conveys the atmosphere of intriguing power brokers in a fantasy city better than Lords of Waterdeep can manage...

Despite my love of variable player powers, which this game has, I feel that there's too much emphasis on the role-choosing stage - and not too much emphasis on the rest of the game (which is why they had to bring out an expansion). I like the game, but there's some  blatant problems with the role balance (Assassin will always be able to target the King), so that this game may be mis-played.

Rare to find a strategy game that supports 7 players, but I've only played twice so I'm not sure how much I like it (rating may go up/down one).  It's really important for players to choose roles quickly or the game drags.  Might be worth using a timer for that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
The rules are quite straight-forward, so you can start a game quite quickly.

There could have been more variation in the available buildings (filling a city with three castles, two palaces and a few churches just seems silly) and I do not particularly like the artwork (inconsistent style: realistic mixed with fantasy-like, and humans look pretty awkward). Also, scoring is not easily memorised, meaning it is not that simple to determine the winner at a glance when building the last building for your city.

Overal, the game is a success despite the above, because it really leads to excellent player interaction: the insecurity when you notice the murderer is gone after the first player took their card means you do not dare to take the merchant card as it would be the obvious move and you may get killed because of it - only to find out later that the murderer was not in play in that round... It is a game of phatoming and anticipating your opponents' thoughts and decisions, but also a game of luck/guessing to some extent. These elements are mixed brilliantly through a simple system.

My enjoyment of this game is probably a 7 or 8 but because it comes with so many caveats, I have only rated it a 6.

Firstly do your research before playing this game! I heard beforehand that it can play too long (so we only play to 7 structures and never play with too many players). 

Secondly, play this when you're all feeling fresh, and not late into the night after 3 games of Pandemic and everyone's a bit sleepy or it will SLOW RIGHT DOWN. It sounds silly, but because you have to think about your role selection and what you think other people will choose, if everyone is tired the game will drag on.

I have played the 2 player and the multi-player versions of this game. Both are good. The 2-player is very psychological and sometimes for me, a little too intense/stressful. This is because you are picking two roles to play and you and your opponent are gunning for each other from the start. I really do enjoy the stimulation from the game but sometimes I just won't play it (as 2 players) because I get stressed out!

The multiplayer is much less stressful because you aren't constantly a target or having to target someone else - it gets spread between you, so you can actually focus on building something. That being said, it can drag if you let it (so take heed of my first two points and you'll have fun).

I own the Fantasy Flight (smaller box) version of this game which comes with the Dark City expansion included. It is very portable and we originally bought it because we can take it hiking easily and it plays such a variety of numbers of players which is a win in my books.

In the end though, if my entire collection was destroyed, I probably wouldn't try to replace this.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite card game.  The game is easy to teach and most people grasp it after the first round or two.  While some feel there is too much downtime, I stay engaged with everyone's action and trying to figure out the players' strategies.  The game can drag with the wrong people - especially the closer they sit to the king and have more character options.  For that slight inconvenience, I knock it down to an 8.

RATING: 8
An awsome little card game that has maximum replay value, this game is more about reading your opponents and trying to get into their heads than the cards.  Games play quickly, allowing several games to be played in an evening.  A great party game that is not so involved and intense that you can't carry on converstaions as you play.  Alot of fun.

This game can be aggravating. The Assassin is my main problem with the game in that you're never completely sure if you're hurting the right person and, thus, you can completely hose another player with inaccurate guessing - which makes the game not very fun for them at all. If one person happens to get hit every time (whether they are taking roles that help them or not) it can result in a situation where the person is left to watch the other players play.

This game has some of the best card art out there, but the game play just tends to drag with role selection always seeming to take a while, so the game outlasts its welcome by a good half hour to forty-five minutes.
8/08 I have changed my opinion a bit as I played a 3-player game tonight and it was pretty good, I am still giving it a fairly low rating since people seem to think that it works well with larger groups, which I am convinced it does not, so 2-3 players = 8 rating 4+ = 5, so I split the difference and give it a 6.5

RATING: 7
This is a nice little role selection game, at a nice price point. It takes a little longer than I like. I'd strongly suggest playing to 7 buildings instead of 8, and keeping the player count to 3-5. Even 5 leads to a game that takes a little too long.

I don't consider Citadels a terrible game. I just don't particularly enjoy it. With more players...it tends to bog down beyond the point of enjoyability. As a 2p game, possibly 3p, its a fun and light bluffing game. But if you have one player who likes to over-analyze each choice....be prepared to rip out your own entrails.

I like a lot of Bruno Fadutti's comments and he seems like a great guy....but as a rule I've been disappointed with most of his game's I've played. I'm sure there's an exception but I can't think of one offhand.

Citadels is a game I'd rather not play, but if someone was enthusiastic about it...I'd be willing.

What is with the hype on this one? The overall mechanisms of the game have promise, gold or cards, build buildings to make different roles better for you, usw; what it boils down to though, is a whole lot of punishment. You can't have a big hand or the magician will swap with you. You can't have a lot of gold, or the thief will hit you. You're in danger taking either of the better roles (Merchant and Architect) because the Assassin will be likely to hit you. And on, and on. 

My A number one complaint with this game is that planning ahead is nigh impossible because of all the constant chaos that unfolds as the game progresses. I like a lot of the ideas that it has, but the reality of its implementation is just not to my tastes at all. The game presents the illusion of interesting choices (i.e.: I think I'll create card advantage by doing this) and then randomly punishes you and renders your planning useless. Funnily, games like Fluxx, which I consider about as random as this, are less offensive to me in the grand sense because at least Fluxx doesn't have the pretension of being a game where the decisions you make are all that important. Citadels does, and what it delivers is that much more annoying to me as a result. Quite easily my least favourite game put out by both HiG and European design firms in general.

I quite like this.  It's pretty light really and your win or loss comes more from what you draw than what you do, but still it's awful satisfying to try to guess what each of the other players is doing.

Finally, after playing this off and on for a few years I've come to really love Citadels.  For whatever reason, the game never really clicked with me (probably because I wasn't playing it with the right people) but it's become a regular fixture with my group.  The game has a very, very high degree of replayability because it allows for direct interaction, deduction, and competition unlike many Euros and there is always an interesting choice or two to be made every turn.  The art is terrific, the expansion is great...definitely a seminal classic that will be played for many years to come.

Not my favorite. I won't turn it down, but it's just OK. I like it better with less than 7 people, and I'm not opposed to playing for less than 8 cities. Not a bad filler, but I don't want to have it the focus of a game night.

RATING: 8
Egyszerű játék, amiben az a legjobb, hogy minden játékos minden körben más-más karakter lehet. De nehéz a választás:
ha olyan karakter vagyok, aki inkább a saját kis kerületeit építené vagy pénzt, lapot gyűjtene, megszerezné a koronát, akkor a többi karakter könnyen meglophatja, rombolhatja. Ha viszont olyan karakter amivel mások kártyáit, pénzét elszedem, aki megöl másokat, vagy aki lerombolja mások épületeit, akkor bár másokat hátráltat, önmaga sokkal lassabban fejlődik.
Az is lényeges, hogy jól blöfföljünk, ne tudják a többiek én melyik karakter vagyok éppen, és közben a magam javára tudjam fordítani az eseményeket.

Szóval közelíti szememben a tökéletes játékokat. Hogy mégis mi a negatívum? Amikor a karaktereket ki kell választani, illetve amíg adott játékos azon gondolkozik, hogy kit öljön meg, vagy mit építsen, stb., addig nagyon lehet unatkozni a többi játékosnak...

Egyébként ajánlott beszerezni a magyar kiadást, amikor én vettem a kiegészítő is benne volt a játékban új karakterekkel és új (lila) épületekkel!

Sértődős játékosokkal nem ajánlatos játszani, nagyon rosszul érint minket is, amikor már 5 kör óta mindig rosszat tesznek velem. :D

Another classic game that I waited far too long to introduce at game night.  An instant hit AND plays well with 5 players.  I can't wait to play this again with 6 or 7.  The Role Selection and Bluffing are excellent!  You want to assassinate or steal from a certain person, but you have to deduce which role they've selected.  Great stuff here.  Better with more players, but play time goes up, especially for those w/ AP.

Play is balanced with the basic set of characters. The use of the expansion characters (ex. Witch, Tax collector, ...) causes some unbalancing in the game dynamics. The game is fast to learn and play and is a perfect "starter" for a game session.

RATING: 6.5
This is a  good game. The art is very nice, and the game play is strategic enough to make it interesting. The guessing or "deductive reasoning" portion of the game is pretty fun too. The major drawbacks to this game is that the "choosing a character" phase really takes up about 2/3 of the game, and the actually playing and building up cities only takes about 1/3(obviously!!) It is very prone to analysis paralysis making this even worse. Still overall a fairly enjoyable experience.

Not my type of game, at least to play with my wife, who is my main gaming opponent. Too cutthroat. And I don't like bluffing, at least with my wife. And a lot of the art is "evil looking," as my wife calls it - although the rest of the art is beautiful. However, I do like the short game length, the roles mechanic, and the city building aspect.

RATING: 8
You don't need the Dark City expansion to have a blast with Citadels. The new roles and districts add some additional flavor to the game, though. Just be careful to sub cards properly if you use the Dark City expansion.

Looking forward to examining the new 2016 edition with even more roles and districts. New artwork, tweaked the balance, and tightened up the rules for quicker games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fun, fun, fun, especially two-player. The sort-of-secret character selection adds a strong element of psychology and bluffing, especially with the Thief and Assassin cards. Rarely use the expansion characters.

First hidden role selection game. Sleeved the role selection cards. A lot of fun for not a lot of money. Enjoy the two player game - although the expansion role cards don't lend themselves well to this number of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Best if played with 4+ players.

A part of the game concerning choosing and playing own characters for each round is most important and focus most of the fun coming from a whole game. Building own Citadel is kinda not that exciting like it should be; districts serve mostly as a "game clock" and for determining a winner.

Very good game if you don't have enough time for anything longer than 1-2 hours, using a board. Can be played with little thinking put into it.

RATING: 5
As card games go, Citadels is an excellent game of sly maneuvring, reverse psychology, opportunism and deceit. Things can get surprisingly complex for a cardgame this size: it is a good 'filler', if a little heavy at times. However, the game has a tendency to drag on, especially as the number of players rises above 4: speedy builders are delayed, character powers become repetitive. Seasoned players also begin to target 'well known' characters and follow 'well known' tactics: the merchant is surprisingly often robbed; the architect is surprisingly often stabbed. (Or vice versa.) Should the architect survive a round, his owner becomes a sitting duck for the magician, and so forth. I hadn't played the game sufficiently often to notice this at first, but of late I have. Presumably this is why the expansion was released. Machiavelli also has a sweet spot at 4 and 5 players; all other numbers don't really work or aren't as much fun.

Plays better with more people then with just two.  But, the more you add, the longer game takes to complete.  Four or Five players seems to be ideal.

Wife thought the pictures were too grotesque to suit her though.  We couldn't get past that on our first attempt at the game.  I've replaced the pictures with the legal theme offered in the download area.

Played with my brother-in-law.  It had its moments but two player seemed too predictable.  More like flipping a coin.  Need more players to prevent the guessing of what the other player has.

I'm beginning to like this game more and more.  Unfortunately, it seems like my gaming group is already burnt out on this game.

RATING: 9
I recently purchased the English version (Citadels).  The game aside, I have a few negative comments for Fantasy Flight Games:  The box is way too big (could have been contained in one of those Kosmos 2-player style boxes) and the worst offender being there's no tray of any kind inside the box.  Despite the presence of a heap of little cardboard counters and about 80 loose cards, there's no way to organize it.  Another gripe: the card quality is really poor.  They're very thin, flat finish cards; the kind that come out of their wrapping bent and typically get worse with play. (at Bruno Faidutti's suggestion, I've already put deck protectors on the character cards)  Maybe I'm spoiled by most game companies (Rio Grande comes to mind), but this is disappointing presentation for a $20 game.  All that aside, I love the actual game.  I like the fact that there's definitely tactics and strategies, but nothing that requires eons of thinking or forward planning, especially since you never really know what character you'll be next round of play.  I took some complaints from other players to heart and earnestly looked for these flaws in practical gameplay.  Maybe I'm missing something, but many of the complaints seem unfounded to me (but then, I'm assuming there's been some rule changes between the German and English versions).  This is a superb, relatively quick card game, that actually has a certain "beer and pretzels" type feel to it.  Big thumbs up from me; I also think it's a good introduction-to-European-games game, especially with the semi-CCG looking aspect.  I LOVE the art, love the design; it's a fun game...definitely will hit the table as a light entry.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]** Tiene la gran facultad de que gusta a casi todo el mundo además es estratégico y muy original. Las reglas son muy sencillitas, lo suficiente para aprender con la primera partida las cuales suelen durar unos 45 min. El número de jugadores puede ser desde 2 hasta nueve (aunque detrás de la caja y en la web pone 7) personalmente creo que es más divertido jugarlo con mucha gente (sobretodo a partir de 4 personas).

This game has gone through something of a lifecycle with our gaming.  In our initial exploration of Euro games this game got played all of the time.  It was fun and easily accessible so everyone liked it.  My then nine-year-old went from little success to absolutely kicking our butts!  The dynamic how every turn you choose (a potentially different) character was something that kept the game feeling fresh and new every hand. 

2005-09: Had to downgrade this from a nine to an eight after playing with six people (including some newby's).  Yikers!  Just poke me in the eye next time.  At least the pain would be over a lot faster.  Brutally ugly game with six.  Too much down time.

2006-05:  We haven't played Citadels in forever.  It just isn't a game that makes it to the table.  This is probably due to something of a change in the game playing dynamics at home.  Either that or this game has lost some of it's appeal due to discovering other games with a little more depth.  Whatever it is, it's rating has got to come down another notch.

This game is a jack-of-all-trades.  It has enough mechanical strategy to be a light gamer's game, but not enough to scare away casual or non-gamers.  This is carefully blended with a social aspect that gives it a casual, poker-like feel.  Luck can occasionally play too big a part, but there are a few ways to turn the tide on a bad hand.

The art and presentation are really nice, and the included expansion cards can do a lot to extend the replay value.  The play length is about right too, long enough to feel meaty, but without dragging on.

I want this game to be so much better than it is.  It has role-selection and cards but it always ends up being slow and disappointing and feeling more random than it should be.  I can't see a case where we would ever choose to play this over one of our other games -- RtfG and GtR are better card-role-selection games and 7 Wonders or TtR:Team Asia is better with a larger (6+) group.

Citadels plays like a combination of Notre Dame and Love Letter. 

You build a city with the district cards, but select character cards each round to gain different abilities. 

The more players, the better so far. The two player game seems too predictable to work, but perhaps this will change over time.

RATING: 6
I own it and only played it once (german version), but man, this one was a lot of fun with 5 players! The rules read more intimidating than they actually are and an experienced player can explain them very quickly to newcomers. I especially like the aspect of changing characters each round as it adds uncertainty to the gameflow. Determining the winning strategy seemed a bit too random at first, but I guess you would have to play it more often to determine successfull strategies.

This was the first game I tried with role selections. And I still love the ease in which it plays. Sure being

RATING: 6.5
My gateway game. A good medium weight bluffing and tableau building game. Predicting the intentions of other players is a critical mechanic which lends the game far more depth than might be evident during the first few plays. It is, however, a bit too long of a game for the medium level of depth it provides.

This is designed to be a 5-8 player game, but it drags on way too long with so many players. The 2-3 player variant is far more interesting.

I randomly decided to buy Citadels without knowing anything about it and I have never once regretted it. Citadels was one of my first games and it really turned me on to the other side of board/card games. So, it always holds a special place in my heart. Solid game though, I love the gameplay and the artwork is pretty nice.

I've gone back and forth on this one.  Sometimes it seems to take too long for what it is.  Maybe should play with only 7 districts.  Found the 3 player game to be a refreshing and very workable change.  Also tried the Dark Cities roles and liked the change.  As a group, the Dark Cities roles probably shorten the game time.

This game gets better with every play.  4-5 players seems to be best, though I've had great games with 3 and even 2 players using the variants included in the rules.  With 6 or higher it tends to drag, especially with new players.  The expansion characters add a lot to the game, and this one will never suffer for lack of replayability.

Enjoyed this a great deal back in the day, but now find it too long for what it offers. Something very much like the role-selection / deduction portion is done in [gameid=170340], which plays faster - sadly it's not more broadly available.

[b]Old comment:[/b] Lovely game with partial-information on who's selected what role, making nailing a particular player [i]hard[/i] but not impossible. Role selection can take longer than I'd like (for myself as well as others) but the turns themselves tend to go promptly. I'm not sure I like the dynamic created by the Magician (where having a hand above one or two cards is just begging to get it stolen), it can be really frustrating being assassinated multiple turns in a row (ditto for getting final role-selection), and the Smithy district is overpowered (tweaking it to "...as your action" puts it roughly on-par with the other card-drawing purple buildings), but the game's worth playing even with these difficulties.

My group love this game. And one of the few games that can play for up to 7 players so good (exept the waiting for your pick thingy), the other serius problem of this game is that sometimes the last player will determine the winner even if he is not the one that going to win. I don't really like Citadels when this is happening

A good party game, the hidden role card is nice and you do need a bit of strategy when picking the roles. There's a luck factor involved as the roles you need may not be available when you get to pick your identity but it can be mittigated by chosing the king and getting first pick in the next round if you really need that 1 role. 

New players seem to grasp it fast and most people I played it with enjoyed a game and had fun. It's portability is a big plus as you can easily take it with you wherever you go.

The downside is, playtime can increase greatly with a high number of players but otherwise it's a good game.

One of the games that, along with Carcassonne, got my friends to start attending my game nights regularly. We love the role mechanic, even though the Assassin can inadvertently kill the same person multiple times, but everyone has a fun time, it's a very social game. 

The game takes a bit too long for what it is, and analysis paralysis can be a problem, but I generally limit the buildings to 7 if there are a lot of players. Citadels feels completely different when there are few players, and while it's perhaps more balanced that way, I'd much rather play it with 4-6. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Just great. Simple rules, that still provide deep gameplay, interesting character-choosing idea and great art (really great!). And in addition it has pretty high interaction level, which is rather cool for me.
I really like this game and often use it to "capture" people that have never played board games :-)

RATING: 9
Components: Great artwork on the cards. All-around good production quality except for the character cards, which need to be made of firmer stuff so as not to become marked or worn through repeated use. The most recent Fantasy Flight edition has the nice plastic gold pieces, a wooden crown, and a linen finish on all the cards.

Experience: This game fascinates me. The money/card management and district building is enough for a simple game on its own, but the character cards make the game superb. They really transform the game into a psychological battle, whereby if I can properly guess what others will take, and what others will expect me to take, and which roles others will attack regardless of who takes them, then I can make an informed choice about which character to choose. There is no certainty, of course, but it sure is fun trying to out-guess my opponents.

I've enjoyed this with 2-5 players, but find that it bogs down with more. I love it with 2 or 3, where each player gets two characters, and therefore the possibility to synergize.

The game builds very steadily. The character bonuses for the four colored districts is the only aspect that makes the game start to steamroll. I wouldn't mind if there were more powers on the district cards to increase their engine quality.

Bought new for $8.99.  Excellent card game for up to 8 players.  This can be a frustrating game.  I play with the expansion tokens, and sometimes with the expansion characters.  I just dumped the contents of my expansion box into my base game box.
I believe that Brent Clark owned the first copy of this game, and I subsequently bought my own copy.
I like Bruno Faidutti's games that have individual characters with different abilities.

I first bought Ohne Furcht und Adel because I just loved the art. My one attempt to introduce it to casual gamer friends with the German text was a disaster but I'm glad I picked up the English version &  took it to the PutWets who proceeded to kill me off & steal all my cash (which meant they played the game as it was meant to be).

RATING: 8
This game was a 10 for me then as I overplayed it, it slipped to a 9.  Unfortunately I had a couple bad experiences which have whittled it down to an 8.  One thing is NEVER play it with 6 or more unless you have very experienced players who understand that people don't like to sit around a table and watch idiots successively stare at a slowly diminishing hand of cards.  Secondly, I'm not crazy about the endgame rule where once somebody crosses the line (gets the required number of building points) they are safe from getting buildings demolished while everyone else is still in the line of fire.  I went from first to second to last in a game because the eventual winner crossed the line and the next person to go who was out of the game, decided to torch me because I was the next in line.  (I was actually in a better position but no one knew that - I had done an excellent job of keeping my head down... well, until the last play:*)  I hate kingmaking!

In Citadels, it's easy to be screwed. I consider this as a soft elimination game - you can be easily eliminated or robbed for one round. Plus the whole game might get slow due to paralysis by analysis. I think this game concept feels very dated in nowadays fresh environment.

RATING: 9
This is a little gem which is great with 3 or 4 players. I've always found the other role, trade, build games a little dry. Citadels adds the sometimes controversial option of stealing from, murdering and destroying your opponents hard work which has lead to some great moments of bluffing and double guessing. Enjoy...

Excellent game for 5 or 6 players. It's pretty hard to avoid the murderer, the thief ánd the magician every turn. But if you do, big chance you win the game. I really like the psychological aspect of the game. A must have if you also consider the price. Ideal game to teach to non-gamers.

"Citadels" has a neat concept of constantly changing roles and plays quickly. It involves some strategies but mostly relies on predicting other players' moves. I don't like this aspect of the game because it quickly devolves into one of two situations: (1) a casual game where people don't deliberately try to outguess/block each other, so it's random who ends up winning; (2) a highly competitive game where people smartly gang up on the one who seems ahead, then it drags on forever. I prefer the first situation but then the outcome is somewhat unsatisfying.

Excellent game.  Easy to play but you have agonizing decisions to make at times.  Screwage factor is off the charts with this, makes for a great time.

It has some similarities with San Juan, but it focuses more in role selection rather than building an engine.

It plays different from San Juan to be worth having both. My favorite part is the interaction between players: some roles can affect others, bluffing, trying to figure who picked what so you can stop them.

Probably my least favorite game. I'm willing to concede that perhaps I'm just missing some form of strategy here, but it seems to be mainly a game of randomly choosing who is going to get screwed and sit around doing nothing for five minutes while others take their turns. Every few years someone convinces me that I just had a bad game and I should play again, so I do.

Card game in which players have to choose a character each round, and try to score points by constructing buildings. Each character has specific abilities which can be played next to the normal actions (taking money or cards, and constructing a building). Tense interactivity as murder and theft are lurking behind each and every corner. Can be quite frustrating when you're constantly victimised.

I played this in French and everyone assassinated the cards I chose right from the beginning.  I suppose one should learn to choose cards that are less likely to be assassinated.  I knew there was no possibility of winning but had to sit through another hour of the game, so I took the crown and and assassin every turn to try and destroy the other players in revenge.  The art is pleasant, the strategy is something like Coup or Loveletter.  It's fine but doesn't blow my socks off.

I have just gotten this, as we were looking for a nice card game a la Battleline, but with the ability to play with more than just two players. Looks great - will rate after several plays!

Update (11/26/07): OK, after my first two plays, I rate this at least a 7. I will probably rate it higher as it gets more plays - I might have rated it higher if I hadn't come in last in both games we played! Character selection is an interesting exercise, and I also liked both the special powers of each character and the unique benefits of the special districts (such as Library, Observatory, and Great Wall).

RATING: 6
Fills the niche in my collection for a fairly light game that can be played by more than six players well.  Role selection with significant player interaction, but does by targeting another role, not a specific player.  I think the enjoyment level varies depending on the group.

Citadels is a light role playing card game. Every player impersonates a character with specific abilities at each turn, then tries to guess the other players' character in order to trick them.
So the game is mostly based on bluff and deduction.
Very good !

RATING: 6
The set collection part of this game is fun and the hidden role selection makes it interesting when predicting who to target or what to choose for the most benefit since all other information is open. That being said, this game is prone to AP and with a large player count the game drags on and on.

Interesting game when playing with more than two people. The mechanics of a larger group seems to be more iinvolved, but in turn there is more downtime in between plays.

Good game, work well with 6 or 7 players. The good ideas from Verrater and Meurterer are improved with citadels.

--------------
Date approximative du texte: 2002

Citadelles reprend le mécanisme de l’attribution de capacité spéciale à chaque tour par le choix d’un personnage. Ce système m’avait beaucoup plût dans les jeux de M. A. Cassola Merkle, Verrater et Meurterer.

But du jeu : marquer un maximum de point en construisant sa cité.


Préparation
Chaque joueur reçoit 4 cartes quartier, 2 pièces d’or. Un joueur est désigné au sort et reçoit la couronne. Les cartes quartiers ont un coût en pièce d’or dont il faut s’acquitter pour pouvoir les poser. Certains quartiers ont une couleur qui les rattache à un pouvoir particulier: religieux, militaire…


Le jeu (de 4 à 7 joueurs)

Les tours de jeu sont divisées en deux grandes phases:

1- Le choix des personnages
Il y a 8 cartes personnage, en fonction du nombre de joueur, un certain nombre de cartes sont retirées face visibles et faces cachées (voir tableau dans la règle)
Le joueur qui a la carte couronne prend le tas de carte choisit un personnage, et passe les personnages restants à son voisin qui en choisit également un, etc… Lorsque tout le monde a sélectionné sont personnage pour le tour la phase 2 commence.

2- le tour de jeu
Les joueurs ne jouent pas selon le sens horaire mais en fonction des personnages. Le Roi appelle les personnages dans leur ordre, d’abord l’assassin, puis le voleur etc…Lorsqu’un personnage est appelé, le jouer qui a la carte en question la montre et exécute son tour:
- il choisit entre prendre 2 pièces d’or à la banque ou de tirer 2 cartes quartier pour en choisir une et placer l’autre sous la pile.
- il peut utiliser la capacité spéciale de son action à partir de ce moment
- il peut construire un quartier dans sa cité.


Les personnages de base

1-L’assassin: annonce le personnage qui est assassiné et qui ne joue donc pas se tour ci.
2-Le voleur: annonce le personnage qui sera victime du vol. Dés que ce joueur est connu il donne sa fortune au voleur. La victime du vol ne peut être ni l’assassin ni l’assassiné.
3-Le magicien: quand il veut pendant le tour, il peut au choix échanger les cartes de sa main avec celles d’un autre joueur (cette fois c’est un joueur qui est la cible, pas un personnage), ou se défausser d’un certain nombre de carte qu’il place sous la pioche pour en repiocher le même nombre.
4-Le roi: il devient immédiatement roi et prend la carte couronne qu’il pose devant lui. C’est le roi qui choisira en premier son personnage au prochain tour.
5-L’évêque: reçoit quand il veut une pièce d’or par quartier bleu de sa cité. Il ne pas être la victime du condottiere.
6-Le marchand : Reçoit une pièce d’or au début de son tour. Reçoit également quand il veut une pièce d’or par quartier vert de sa cité.
7-L’architecte: il prend au début de son tour 2 cartes quartier. Il peut donc choisir de prendre 2 cartes plus 2 pièces d’or, ou bien 4 cartes et en défausser une. En outre il peut construire jusqu’à 3 quartier ce tour ci.
8-Le condottiere: reçoit une pièce d’or par quartier rouge de sa cité. A la fin de son tour il peut détruire un quartier (même de sa propre cité) en payant le coût du quartier –1. Il est interdit de s’attaquer à une cité terminée.


Le score
La fin du jeu intervient à la fin du tour où un des joueurs a une citadelle qui compte au moins 8 quartiers.
Les joueurs additionnent:
La valeur de tous les quartiers posés
+3 si les 5 couleurs différentes sont présentes dans le quartier.
+4 pour le premier joueur à avoir terminé sa cité.
+2 pour les autres joueurs à avoir terminé leur cité dans le même tour.


Mon opinion
D’ordinaire je suis assez sceptique face aux jeux comportant des capacités spéciales, mais ce n’est pas le cas avec Citadelles car elles sont peu nombreuses et tout le monde les connaît rapidement. La comparaison avec les jeux de M. A. Cassola Merkle est inévitable, mais Bruno Faidutti à crée un jeu bien différent. Souvent dans les jeux de société, le joueur qui est en tête est la cible d’attaques répétées, mais içi on ne s'attaque pas à un joueur mais à un personnge ce qui fait tout l'interêt de Citadelles. Nous avons à faire à un jeu de bluff où chaque joueur tente à la fois de deviner l’identité des joueurs et de se protéger de l’assassin et du voleur en évitant de faire un choix de personnage trop prévisible. Il est en effet possible de déduire pas mal de chose grâce d’une part aux cartes personnage encore disponibles quand arrive son tour et d’autre part à la structure des cités des joueurs. Un joueur avec beaucoup de quartiers bleus sera par exemple tenté de prendre l’évêque qui lui rapportera 1 pièce d’or par quartier bleu.
Citadelle à un défaut, la victoire du gagnant est parfois décidée par des éléments pas toujours contrôlables; le tirage des cartes quartier, où l'ordre des joueurs pour choisir leur personnage.
Mais dans sa catégorie de jeu léger il a des atouts: il fonctionne très bien jusqu’à sept joueurs ce qui est plutôt rare, et l'ambiance est au rendez vous pour peu que l'on ne s'attarde pas trop pendant le choix des personnages. Et la seconde edition nous offre des nouveaux personnages.

Yuck.  Randomly pick a role from the random cards that are left.  Hope the thief/assassain doesn't randomly pick the role you randomly picked.  Pay for whatever building you happen to be able to afford.  No possibility of long term planning and yet no real short term decisions to be made.  This is an illusion of a game.  Terrible with 6 or 7.  I assume you must be able to make some actual relevant choices in a 3 or 4 player game but I'm afraid to try.  People rate this highly; they are WRONG!!!  UPDATE, didn't like 4 player either.  I hate this game but lord knows I keep trying.  BAD MEMORIES DOWNGRADE.  I really don't think anyone could convince me to play this ever again.  DOWNGRADE.

Great staying power for a 15-year-old game. Shades of Love Letter with some more strategy. There are some great decisions to be made and trying to figure out what your opponents will do. You can't just pick the obvious choice or the assassin might get you. Keeps the whole table involved. Well done!

This is a great game by Bruno Faidutti. The characters really fit in well and spice up the game, which would otherwise be mediocre. It&#039;s somewhat like an enhanced version of the party favorite &quot;mafia&quot;, with the bluffing factor and hidden identities.

RATING: 7.3
A simple, though engaging strategy card game. With the intelligent addition of the dark city expansion in the basic product, great interchangablility and complexity is added to the game. You'll be eager to try out new and different combinations of characters and purple estates. 

Despite being a stand alone card game, sessions can take a while to play through, as a lot of strategy is involved, and the lead can change at the drop of a hat. Highly recommended, though not as casual a game as it may look at first.

Only played this with 2 and 3 players but may be better that way as you get 2 characters per round which adds a layer of strategy to the selection/guess what your opponent has done process - it also gives you more to do each turn.

This goes in the list of fast paced games that is easy to learn.

That being said, it's hard to get what the right strategy is for this game.  It very much depends on the people you play against.

In one game, you might be able to get by gathering many districts of one color and taking the role that corresponds...but in others, the players will gut you for having too much power.

Very good game with one major flaw.  It's too easy for the game to go too long.  I think it's the Warlord's ability to destroy buildings that is the trouble here, as it essentially rolls back the clock on ending the game.  When the Warlord isn't actively used, the game length feels great.

I love the role-selection mechanics in this game.

RATING: 6
Fun and simple card game that fills the "7 player" category nicely.  Players secretly draft roles such as assasin, thief, architect, merchant, warlord, etc.  Then take the action specified.  All things considered, the theme is pretty good and seems to work.  A little chaotic and luck driven to warrant a higher rating.

RATING: 2
Citadels, along with Carcassonne and Puerto Rico, was a game that was suggested to me by Mr. Sam Black back in my CMG/CCG days, when I was just beginning to mull over jumping into more "serious" board gaming. 

At first it went over as well as Carcassonne did, and the girlfriend and I even enjoyed playing it two player at times. After a while however, it lost its luster a bit, and finally reached the point where I decided it was essentially not worth playing for many of the same reasons as Kung Fu Fighting. 

The chaos factor is essentially too high, particularly in games that have more than 3-4 people playing. So many bad things can happen to you based on other player's sometimes random choices that it can be almost impossible to build anything resembling a successful game strategy.

A spin off from Verraeter.  This game certainly has its fans but I can't quite admit to being one of them. It certainly is an entertaining game, where each turn you select a chararacter from a selection of eight. Each character has an ability that allows certain rules to be broken. The object is to build buildings in your play area by amassing gold. A couple of nasty characters turn this game away from being an excellent and light family game into something a bit more sinister. Worth a look, however if you're robbed or assassinated a few times, sit back and watch - you can forget about winning.

This is not the usual type of game I like (I'm not very good at it!), so I might normally rate it lower, however the portability, combined with the ability to accomodate up to 8 players, and the fact that it is easy to teach to new players, definitely makes this a handy game to have in my collection, and certainly increases the rating for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A simple game that plays really well. The psychology involved in picking your characters is a lot of fun. It's fairly aggressive, but since you don't know who has what character, it doesn't feel as mean when you assassinate someone. (It still sucks to be killed.) There is too much sitting around with larger groups. The two player game is my favorite by far, even though my wife can read my mind. I applaud them for adding the extra characters to the basic game (instead of making it a separate expansion) which provides a lot of replayability in the card combos.

First off - I had a very bad first (and only) experience with this game. I kind of got punked by being assassinated 3 times in a row early on. My review is despite that early setback (I came back to be on par with all the other scores except for the winner who slaughtered us all).

Moving on. I don't like this game one bit (well, except for the gold bits, those were kind of fun). We played with 7 players, and it took way too long for the turns to go around...and it happens TWICE per round. All of the interactions between roles that "balance" the game, more or less just make the game take longer without adjusting the end result by much. Many decisions are just too self-destructive to make it worthwhile interfering with other players too much (especially with that many people, you'll probably just hand the game to someone else by messing with the leader).

The lack of interaction makes the game seem longer than it actually is. Frankly, half-way through the game I thought to myself "I wish we were playing Shadows Over Camelot instead".

Normally I can see the things I "might" like in a game, or at least something the designer did well. Honestly...I didn't see much of anything in this game positively. (I had more fun joking around and discussing other topics than actually playing).

A great game where you need to balance several individually simple elements into a dynamic whole.  Scales from 2-6 players pretty well.  The game is excellent with 5, 6, or 3 players, and still good with 4 or 2 (but with those numbers I'd probably play something else).  The cards in the Fantasy Flight Games edition are of disappointing quality.  The character cards especially need to be made of stronger stuff, but this is easily remedied using standard baseball card sleeves for the character cards.  I would rate this game a little higher if it wasn't so often the case that you get beaten down and there's not a thing you can do about it.  The game entices you to plan more more strategy than you are actually likely to be able to execute, and that can be a little frustrating at times..

Currently one of the most played games, all of my groups love it. (My copy is getting a little worn) The FF edition of the game comes with the Dark city expansion, which basically adds to the re-playability of the game by giving you more Character cards to use, and some special Purple construction cards. My only wish is that they eventually add another expansion.(which won't happen)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Another good card game that plays fast.  This one has the benefit that it really promotes screwage of the other players and it's good to have a few games that take that route in your collection.  Especially if they play pretty fast like Citadels does.

A hidden role game were the roles changes frequently as you try to build your citadel to be better than all the others. 
Great art, easy play with a bit of surprise and tension. I like that the assassin and the thief cannot attack a player, only a role. This means that someone cannot be deliberately picked on as roles are hidden until they are called and the assassin and thief are called first. Their target might not even be in play!

I like this game... the roles are fun and there's some good strategy. However there's WAY too much down time. Only one player can be doing something at a time, and there's relatively little player interaction. For new players, learning the rules, the time between each turn can be something like 5 minutes, and by that time phones have come out, conversations have started, etc... You really should teach in small groups. Once they know the rules turns go pretty fast.

Yes, it's fairly chaotic, but it's fun guessing who has what characters and trying to avoid getting stabbed.  It's surprisingly good with 2 or 3 players, although the designer has said that 5 is ideal.   Nice to have a game in this range that goes up to 8 players, although it gets painfully slow at more than 5, which is why I tend to prefer Mission Red Planet over this anymore.

Build a medieval city while each turn taking on a different, hidden persona.  Examples include thief, assassin, merchant, priest and king.  Each with a special power and each going in a pre-determined place in the round. Great for trying to figure out who each player would pick.  Best with large numbers of players (6-8).  But why oh why does it take SO LONG for people to pick a character?  Eh gads.

Kipróbáltuk a játék 4 és 5 fős változatát. Egyenlőre az alap karakterekkel. A játékosszám növekedésével megnő a holtidő is, ha valakit ez zavar, számolni kell vele. Egyszerű szabályokkal rendelkező, egymással kiszúrós, hangulatos, kiváló kártyajáték. A sikeres játékhoz kulcskérdés a karakterek megfelelő használata. A játék egymással kiszúrós jellegére álljon itt egy jó példa. A feleségem öccse az egyik körben a tolvaj karaktert választotta titkosan. Mivel nem volt egy vasa sem, gondolta szerez a többiektől. Azonban az orgyilkos mivel féltette a pénzét kinyírta őt, mert elfelejtette, hogy a tolvaj nem lophat az orgyilkostól. A következő karakter a sorban a tolvaj, ezért a szabályok értelmében a feleségem öccse csöndben maradt. Majd következett a feleségem a mágussal. A feleségemnek csak egy értéktelen kerület lapja volt, gondolta elcseréli előnyösebbre és kérte az öccsét (a tolvajt), hogy adja át a 4 db értékes (ez később derült ki) kerület lapját. Majd miután szólították a királyt, aki ecsetelte mit szeretne végrehajtani, a feleségem öccse feladván a titkolózást, csalódottan csak ennyit mondott: "a tolvaj pedig tölt magának egy pohár bort". Hatalmas röhögésben törtünk ki, mert mindenkiben ekkor tudatosult, hogy milyen pórul járt. Se pénz, se értékes lap, se cselekvési lehetőség, gyakorlatilag kisemmiződött egy körön belül :). Bocs a hosszú történetért.

This is a game that is very dependent on the situation and who I'm playing with. I like it a lot but my last we had a full table of seven (too many) and that took away some of the role guessing fun for me. I think four or five is where it needs to be and I also think it is a bit more intimate and intriguing about trying to guess who picked what role.

Stream-lined action-selection/drafting - to great effect. Actions are diverse and interact in interesting ways, excellent game once a player is a couple games into their board-gaming experience.

Some frustration caused by the Assassin action - hackles can be raised once two actions are cancelled in a row by tricksy assassinations, deliberate or not.

Though I have yet to settle on a strategy that I'm satisfied with, this game is pure fun. The psychological/bluffing factor in trying to predict your opponents characters is what makes this game so enjoyable. High replayability also, but it's only worthwhile to me with 5+ players.

I really like Citadels. It introduces people role selection mechanics before you hit them with Puerto Rico or (god help you) Twilight Imperium. The action choices are simple enough but can change your strategy. The included expansion adds a lot of new, interesting interactions to the game. Also, the money looks like Werther's Originals, which may be a bad thing if you have children. In my book, however, that's a positive.

I love this game. The artwork is fantastic, the secret role selection is perfect, and it's just great. However, this game feels like it takes just a bit too long for how much you're doing in the game. It's a light-medium game that takes as much time as a medium-medium.

UPDATE: Basically, Mascarade does everything I want with the role mechanics and then some without overstaying its welcome.

Fun and light card game with nice character selection mechanics. The goal is to complete your city by building 8 different districts, using 1 out of 8 characters every round, each with different special powers and bonuses. And there are 2 sets of 8 characters and there are even advanced rules so it will hold up for more than a few games. 
It plays well with more than 3 people but can easily drag on way too long for a light game which makes it boring.

This works best with 3-5 players as a light game. It can break down abit in terms of fun if someone repeatedly picks the assassin in order to hit the king and maintain them selves in turn order. This wont win them the game, but it doesn't stop them doing it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Citadels is a game about deduction and spite. It's easy to learn, and can fit up to 7 players, but remains a surprisingly long game. 

There's two main concepts going on here. There's a collection of "role" cards that are drafted each turn, and these provide each player with a unique turn order and special ability. These special abilities range from increasing your economic prowess to shutting down another player's turn. What makes it interesting is that, in many cases, the role cards that negatively impact another player require you to guess which role card they selected during the card drafting.

These role cards are used in the context of each player racing to build 8 city districts while simultaneously throwing spanners into each other's way. The winner is the player with the greatest value of city districts constructed, with some additional bonuses for finishing first or building a multicultural city.

I used to love it, but over a few plays the game length has really started to get to me. There are very few plays where it doesn't feel like it's outstayed its welcome. Also, after several plays we've decided that the way to win is never to be targeted by the assassin (lose your turn) or the thief (lose your money). The best way to do this is drafting roles that aren't useful to you, which isn't fun for an entire game.

Love Letter may have made this game redundant.

Edit 16/12/2015 - downrated to 6.5. This game is OK, but there are other games out there that do asymmetric role selection without draaaaaaaaaaaaagging on for an entire evening. One Night Werewolf being the shining example.

Citadels is basically one of the best card games out there in my opinion along with Colossal Arena. With the extra characters, it makes the game different from game to game compared to playing with the same characters all the time. It adds to it's replay value.

I find Citadels to be a bit too long when playing with 7 players. I like playing Citadels until 7th building is finished instead of the normal 8. It makes the game a little bit shorter and helps move on to a different game afterward.

The Citadels expansion characters are an interesting addition to the game. I have tried a few of them and the feel of the game is different between characters.

Traded Citadels 1st edition in a three way deal. I own the 2nd edition.

With 2 or 3: Too many of the decisions break down into 50/50 splits, or other splits where it's basically impossible to determine what the other person will choose. Because of this, the outcome can sometimes be basically random.

With 4, this is increased even further. The random pwnage gets old really fast. I like the core economic game here, and determining what another player has selected to best balance advancement vs. pwnability is interesting, but when someone misses with the Assassin it's unpleasant.

Citadels is alright -- for a time (at the beginning of time) I believed this exceedingly good -- but as time has slipped slipped slipped into the future, my craving for this has waned a wee bit (and I don't mean Waned Rooney) -- I enjoy the role playing, and the guessing of who is who and the attempts to stymie your rivals -- but I find now, a lot, quite a lot, (the more players, the lot more) of down time -- I have seen (and I have even seen meself) thumb twiddling and air guitar playing between turns (not good, oh not good) -- now, I shall still play Citadels, I do still enjoy this, but only as a 'once in a while' - 'go pull it from the shelf' please -- this WAS on my 'to get' list , but it has fallen away -- and yes, I do enjoy this, and I will play this when tabled, but more as a filler and a warm up to a much more 'here I am tonight, and ready to game' item -- tis fine, can be fun, but lately, the 'chore' has crept in

I've only played Citadels with 2 players so far and found it to be quite tricky.  My inner conversation goes something like this: "My opponent will expect me to choose role A so I'll leave it and choose role B instead.  On the other hand maybe they'll be thinking that I'll choose role B so perhaps I should go with role C, or should I just choose role A?".  Clever game and fun to play when I'm in the right mood.

I don't know what it is but this is a game that I like so much that I want to buy it again just for the pleasure of purchasing it a second time... not only that but I want to eat it!  Those butterscotch golden tokens I just want to pop in my mouth!

Why is this a 10?  Mind you, if you play this with a dry and analytic group it can be painful, but that seems to be a minority of the time for me.  Instead it just hits the sweet spot for me.  Players get unique advantages each turn, there is an element of bluffing going on in how you pick your roles, there is a building aspect to the game which can possibly gain you even more special powers with gameplay.  All of those elements are things that really excite me when it comes to games, and so dress it up with some wonderful artwork and those yummy looking gold tokens and it is just a winner for me.

Ah, I've been using the original german version all this time.  The english version does have a cheaper production value, but the german works great!

Good game, although a bit of the "gang up on the frontrunner, let the guy in second cruise by for the win." The two-player variants are better than I originally thought. With too big a group, the game gets unwieldy though.

A fun social game, but not a lightweight party game. Game has some downtime if players are inexperienced and spend lots of time in selecting roles. Thematically the game is spot-on; you build a medieval city, become a king, merchant, general, bishop etc. and become quickly involved in medieval politics trying to outguess your friends' moves. Good times!

This is a great game in a little box.  The varying selection of characters to promote one's causes and building is a nice feature remeniscent of the role choices in Age of Empires III.  The mechanic is just as powerful here in Citadels, with a lot less miniature figures to manipulate.

For three players: throw in the artist and do a random discard after the third person has chosen his first role.
Plays very different with 2/3 and 4+. A bit too much downtime with many players and sometimes a whip is needed to make choosing roles take less time (it should speed up with experienced palyers).

RATING: 5
This game has great player interaction and a simple interface, but the downtime required to make a character selection really throws a wrench into the whole process. If your friends have AP, pick a different game. Another problem with Citadels is its length. It's a little too long for a filler, and it's not quite complicated or flashy enough to be a main event game.

A light, fun gateway game. Good tension generated by the hidden role selection. Has problems of analysis paralysis, which can lead to a draggy game, and that really kills the game.

Love this game. Great with more than 3, and I find the more people the better. Strategy is great, and games can be very challenging, especially when playing with veteran players. My only gripe would be that the occupation cards are not made of a different material than the other cards. They are used and shuffled so often I would love for them to be more durable. Easily remedied by sleeves though so not a big deal.

This game rewards you for recognizing the progressive complexity of interaction between character cards. There is an intuitive strategy in what you choose depending on where you are in order, what you know has or hasn't been chosen, and what each other player is likely to select. That said, Citadels is not difficult to learn and can be fun without expending a great deal of brain power.

The role drafting mechanic makes the game clever in trying to deduce what other role other players will take.  However, the game tends to take longer than it needs to build 8 districts.  

Last time we played, the strategy went from win to end the game.  Since the game is light, it should play more as a filler and can be concluded quicker.

Update: Game is much different when played only with 2 players.  Goes very quick which is nice.  Also enjoyable with 6-7 players.

Un juego INDISPENSABLE para nuestra ludoteca. Barato, original y apto para todos los niveles.Tenemos varias opciones de juego, construir barrios muy grandes o construir rápidamente barrios de menor tamaño.Es importante intentar construir un barrio de cada tipo para obtener el bonus final, los barrios "maravilla" nos podrán dar beneficios notables sobretodo si los construimos al principio. En cuanto a los personajes: hay que intentar pasar desapercibido para el asesino y el ladrón, al mismo tiempo el mercader nos permitira crecimiento rápido pero es a menudo objetivo de asesino y ladrón. El arquitecto es muy útil y nos puede permitir cerrar la partida muy rápido.
PARTIDAS:05-04-2008 Partida de ocho jugadores (Pi, Gato, Chuchi, Olga, Peto, Richi, Iuliano, Charlie "Salinas"); jugamos con los personajes "normales" más la Reina. Richi es objetivo constante de ladrón y asesino; el Rey cambiaba de mano casi cada ronda y Julio alternaba constantemente entre Condotiero y Mercader. Pi fue la primera en cerrar gracias a una doble construcción con el Arquitecto y además completó los 5 colores para sumar un total de 27 puntos; Gato (yo) construyo mi quinto distrito con 5 colores y gracias a la bonificación GANO LA PARTIDA, aunque peto me hubiera destruido con el Condotiero un distrio pero yo había cogido al Obispo  ;-)

One of my favorite games that handles 4-6 people pretty well.  With more than 6 it can drag a bit. The secret role selection is really fun, as well as the attacks on other players. No one really runs away with the game. Game is easy to teach and get into. Surprised this doesn't rate higher here.

RATING: 6.5
The game has a nice growing tension to it, although it seems difficult to stop a leader once they are poised to win.  I don't mind downtime, but the downtime in Citadels is problematic because there's not much to look at while you're waiting for the role cards to get passed.  Best to play this with a social game group who can mix in conversation.  Second play increases my respect and raises my rating a bit.  This is easy to learn and has just enough depth to feel worthwhile.

RATING: 6
Citadels definitely isn't a game for players with analysis paralysis, but if you can keep the pace going this is one of the best large group (5+) games out there. Secret role selection, lots of screwage, theft and conflict all combine to create a surprisingly tense card game. It doesn't usually pay to grab the role that best fits your current situation (especially if you're in the lead), since there's going to be someone that will directly target your presumed play. 

This is a game that can be a bit challenging for first-time players, and it can drag on for a bit if you don't know the abilities of the characters. In that case, downtime can be significant. But after a few rounds, the game's pace should pick up dramatically.

A card game that is basically a race to play buildings/districts worth victory points (much like San Juan), but has character roles that remain secret until they are active.  Medieval theme with lots of bluffing, can be lots of fun, and is very good for a group of up to 8 (although it perhaps gets bogged down with more than 5 players).  Role-playing and getting into character can add silliness and fun (for example, get the King to wear a crown).

Ugh, this game annoys the hell out of me! Seriously, I can't believe people enjoy sitting around a table and playing a game of "random take-that" that goes on and on and on... and on and on.  If you get assed out of a turn by the Assassin or Thief or whatever, you're looking at a good 10 minutes (8P game) without doing much at all.  And the thing is, the other player was probably not even gunning for you; you just got hit randomly.

I played Mission: Red Planet and it was the same thing. I could not figure out why I was at the table when a monkey would have the same results as a human playing that game. I guess if you want to be absolved of any responsibility for winning or losing, these types of games may appeal to you.

I can't stand Bruno Faidutti games and their chaotic, random style of "take that." Mr. Faidutti, you know what? Chicken butt.

RATING: 7
A very excellent game of bluffing and reading others. And it scales well from 2 to 8 players!

I like to play this variant: Start with the original character cards. Each round, one of the characters is not picked at the end (not counting any cards that were not used, face down in the middle before characters are picked.) This card is set aside. After the round is over, the unpicked character is replaced by its numeric equivalent that was not in play (such as trading the King for the Emperor). This give a bigger variety of characters that are in play in a given game.

RATING: 6
Based on a lot of plays.
+ Card drafting.
+ A good game for 2-5 players and ok with more. It is a different game with 2 and 5 players, though. I enjoy both but prefer fewer players.
+ I love guessing other players' decisions. This is more emphasized with fewer players. 
> I prefer playing until someone builds their 7th district (instead of 8th).
- Having too many players (6+) slows down the game tempo.


Updated in 2007: 8->7. Has become a bit foreseeable. I must now go and play this with Dark City expansion some more.
Updated in 2011: 7->6. Haven't played this game in ages.

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]2-8 players[/b][/COLOR] (7 if no Dark City characters)

[b]Best w/ 5[/b], good w 4,5,6

Currently prefer to play w/ these characters (which right now are the only the base characters):

1 - Assassin
2 - Thief
3 - Magician
4 - King
5 - Bishop
6 - Merchant
7 - Architect
8 - Warlord

Swap Witch in for Assassin if playing with 2 or 3 players

Think Warlord sucks because you have to hurt yourself to hurt someone else (you could have spent that gold building)

Diplomat is not much better. Adds too much chaos since he makes losing buildings easier and makes it difficult to make long range plans

Currently playing with the Warlord since it doesn't get used very much

Also have expansion:

This game has grown on me, fallen off and grown on me again. It can be great fun with the right group and the right mixture of character cards - it is a drag if you keep getting whacked by the assassin, or robbed by the theif, but just swap them out with the alternate characters and you can get around that. Really makes you think. Great atmosphere - notoriously flimsy character cards.

I have played this too many times to enjoy it any longer; it is a reasonably fun "party" sort of game at first, but you can't really strategize enough to be fun to replay significantly.

Interesting role selection aspect but the rest of the game is a little lacking.

I can see how different game groups will change this game significantly and I can see that an agressive group who utilise the assassin and warlord a lot will drag the game on. 

I like the expansion giving different roles and I believe this will help a lot in making the game play very differently everytime however for me the rest of the game play which is a major part of the game itself just wasn't all that much fun.

Fun game to kick off a gaming session. The rules are easy to learn, so new and experienced players can enjoy playing together.

RATING: 9
One of my favorite games.  The more people you have to play, the better, IMO - get 8 if you can. Which is one of the great advantages of this game - that it tops out at 8 when so many other games only play 6 or 4.  So its playable for those larger game nights.  Its also a really small box, so its great for taking on trips.

Its also the most well designed, in regards to balance, game that I've ever played (not counting games like chess where you and your opponents all have the exact same pieces and moves at your disposal).

This is a must have for a game collection, in large part because its so easy to travel with and plays so many people at a time.  I often find myself at game nights where you genuinely need an 8 player game to include everyone, and there aren't that many of those.

RATING: 7
Slim box version, with [thing=13291]Dark City[/thing] included. It's a quick game, but it feels like a "deluxe" filler. A key to doing well is to try and keep your opponents guessing as to which character you're going to take. I think I've played with every number of players up through 6 now. I'd like to try 7 and 8 each at least once, just to say I did it.

In our two-player games, we usually use the Witch instead of the Assassin (if you're "bewitched," you at least still get to take an action) and the Diplomat instead of the Warlord (destroying districts slows the game down). We're very close to making these changes in all of our games, as both the Assassin and Thief are falling out of favor in our group, even with the teenagers.  

Other than that, we switch characters in and out based on our mood, but never more than a few at a time.  The only one we're not really interested in using is the Emperor: none of us can think of a good reason to let someone else  be the king for a while, especially in a 2-player game. Also, we find the Alchemist too powerful.

I recommend laminating the character cards, or buying sleeves for them, as they take a bit of a beating.

Pros
-Decent role taking game
-2 different roles for each number leads to good variety between games
-Fairly easy to learn and teach, good for most groups

Cons
-Very swingy/random. E.g. one of the card/roles lets you prevent a player from taking a turn, but you don't know who is who each turn.
-Very strong powers on some roles (possibly imbalanced)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fantastic gateway game with depth, though there are some fiddly rules to explain, it's repeatedly been successful due to the guessing and bluffing, and the simple, brutal interaction (assassination and theft).

I think that there are too many points in city completion and dislike how the Smithy overshadows the Observatory/Library. The the Haunted City and School of Magic are great.

I've recently noticed that the art is excellent.

Duration: Whether this is quick depends on how long people take to choose their roles. When performed swiftly this is a great game, otherwise the fun is killed.
Design: Minimalist, elegant with variable role powers balancing turn order, hidden information and very little randomness. The weakness is in the limited variety and styles game-to-game; I've played a lot of it recently and while it stands up, I'd like more variety.
Strategy: There's a lot in here, with direct aggression, deduction and guessing, but this is a tactical game.
Components: Fantastic art.
Theme: Fun, fairly abstract but still fits.

RATING: 4
[Special Powers, Fantasy, Building] [4P:5, 5P:4, 6P:3, 7P:2.5... see a trend?] Card game where players take turns selecting a fantasy role each turn - there are 8 roles and each provides a certain power to the player that turn. Entertaining game, if a bit chaotic. Can slow down to a crawl with more than four players, but as long as players don't take more than a couple of seconds to choose a role, it shouldn't bog down too much. ***UPDATE: While a bit more "fun" than its younger distant relatives, San Juan and St. Pete, Citadels doesn't see much play unless we need a 7-player game, and even then it takes a back seat to BANG! and other lighter (and faster-playing) fare. The drafting time is almost always an issue with more than 4P, and with 4P for the same playing time, one can easily find better games. Still Faidutti's best game, and not a bad one at all, but it's far from best-in-class. *** UPDATE: Funny how a descendant of Meuterer and Verraeter turns out to not be as goood as its forebears. Unless you really need to have a fantasy-themed game of this kind, seek out the two aforementioned older games instead. Not only are they cheaper, they're better. Besides, you don't want to play Citadels with more than 4P anyway, and 4P is exactly what you need to play Verraeter and Meuterer.

RATING: 7.5
One of the best card games I've played. It feels a bit like RftG, only toned down a bit.

Pros:
*Roll selection is a huge blast, and adds a element of deduction to the game. This is really where the game shines.
*Variable Player Powers is a huge fav of mine, and there is a wide range of rolls to choose, each with their own specific ability. You can get extra cards, blow up another players city, get extra gold and so on.
*City building theme is really fun.
*Options are never scarce, you always have to think about what you're best bet will be. 
*Deduction (already stated a bit) is key to the game. Many more times than not, your entire strategy can flourish if you know what everyone else picked.
*Cheap, small and portable.

Cons:
*Too long for what it is without some house rules. I play to 6 districts, rather than 8 (if playing with 5 or more players). 
*Black boarders on cards show any tiny fray really badly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
For some reason, I'm not as in love with the game as everyone else. The theme doesn't draw me in, and I just don't really enjoy the decisions.

Actually, I finally figured out why I don't like it: I don't like having to think that hard to avoid getting hurt or to inflict hurt so that I can have an advantage. Very tactical. 

I got it because I heard it worked well two-player. I'm sure it does for others, but not for my husband and I. Very painful to have a plan and try to execute when you've got to be attacking or attacked the whole time. I've only played it with up to 3, though so I really need to try it with more to get the real flavor of the game.

After two plays, both with six players, I must say I enjoyed the game a lot.  It was accessible two the new gamers in the group, and yet the more experienced of us had fun too.  The game was a bit chaotic, which probably worked well for the newbies.  I found there was not a lot of advanced planning possible, which evened the playing field.  I am looking forward to playing this with fewer players, to see if it is truly more tactical as is said.

This game will have a particular place in my collection.  Like Carcassonne, this game covers a wide range of players, is very accessible, and fun.  Unlike Carc, it travels in a little package.  It will probably get called on a lot, even when I don’t personally feel like playing it, which won’t be often.

I rated this as a provisional "7", which I suspect may go up with more plays.

PS - Just to be clear, I have the second edition, with the Dark City characters, but no additional districts.

Fun game.  But don't keep using the Warlord card if one of the players is in the lead and if that leading player keeps using the Assassin card to kill the Warlord card.  I was the player with the latter.  I would say this game is alot more fun than King of the Elves was.

RATING: 8
The game is quick (if played to 7 districts) and works for 2-8 players. The expansion adds a bit of variability (change) to the game, keeping it fresh. 

I enjoy it, and would play it often. Good party/family game.

Es un buen juego, pero quizás, cuando has jugado muchas partidas se haga un poco repetitivo. No obstante, el juego viene provisto de otro juego de personajes para cambiar cuando te aburras, y la expansion tambien modifica el juego. Además, ojo, si juegas con familia y amigos puede ser que acabeis todos a tortas!!!

A brilliant multiplayer game; we tend not to play with fewer than 6 and don't see a problem with the King not changing hands.  This happened (once again) to me in my last game for most of the first half; I won the game.

My most recent play was with the English edition, the Witch and the Tax Collector substituting the Assassin and the Thief respectively, and the Queen added in for a 6-player game.  It seemed much better playing with alternate characters, as the choices were more difficult to make, nobody was completely losing their turn by assassination and without the thief there was more gold in circulation.

Has lots of hidden information, but it's hard to call it luck-driven since proper deduction will allow you to make good guesses as to the contents of the hidden information.  Deduction isn't the ultimate goal, but it's important for reaching it.  A few simple yet neat ideas = cool game.

RATING: 10
One of my favorites, for sure.  I only like to play it with 4 or more players (there are rules for fewer, but it doesn't have the same feel).  Every round is intense, as you worry if you are going to be killed or robbed from, or if the person you are trying to kill or rob eludes you.  AND, you need to be making money and building structures at the same time.  Classic Bruno Faidutti -- VERY limited resources, painful choices to make, very exciting and intense.  (With 2 or 3 players, the game rates about a 6... 4 to 7 players, and the right crowd -- perfect 10.)

It's a very good game on paper. High interaction in plays but too much bad blood for my taste. It tries to offer you some taste of second guessing your opponents move but for the most part, it comes down to wild guesses and hoping you're not a target for the thief or assassin. Potentially frustrating and there's always a gang-up-on-the-leader going on.

I'm very fond of this game. It was one of the first games that I bought when I got into this hobby.

It's easy to teach and quite accessible.The hidden role selection is cool and in smaller groups can lead to some fun bluffing and clever deduction.

I enjoy this as a 2 player game a lot. With 3-5 as well. With larger groups it can seem a bit random at times and is nowhere near as tense as the smaller games. But then, I just look at it as a bit of a party game. It's just good fun.

Occasionally in the larger groups it can overstay it's welcome but its a great game to own as it's so versatile. There aren't many games that can play 2-8 and are as accessible. All in such a little, easily transportable box.

Pretty cool, pretty funny, pretty clever, very cheap, plus: easy to teach and to learn, what else could you ask for?
Each round, each player takes a different role from the ones available (murderer, thief, mage, king, bishop, merchant, arquitect or condottiere).
Belive me when I tell you there are just a few games that provides so much entretainment as this one does! The intrigue of not knowing who's gonna kill you... The emotion of discover the thief's plans... The crappy you feel when the condottiere destroys that violet-special building that you love the most in your district... (!)
And for the price, you won't get anything better arround there.

I like how often you have to consider your opponents in this game. Guessing correctly and foiling someones well-crafted plan is rewarding. The Thief and Warlord are essential.

Citadels is sometimes fun in a 'take that' kind of way. Its biggest virtue probably is that it plays up to 7, though, since the gameplay itself isn't all that special. The role selection is fun (and accounts for most of the 'take that') but it mostly just goes on for too long (which is especially true for the higher player counts, turning its biggest "virtue" into a millstone around its neck) and I always feel there should be something more to it.

Nice and quick cardgame. We usually play this game at the end of an evening filled with games.

The character-cards are a nice feature. However there isn't much depth in Citadels.

My first cardgame ever was Magic: the Gathering and every cardgame I've played after this was compared with MtG. So perhaps I haven't given Citadels a fair chance.

It can definitely get repetitive and works best with either 4 or 5 people, so that some of the roles are selected, but everyone only has one per turn.

It is hilarious fun to reveal your role and hear people gasp because they could have swore you would choose something differently.

CONTRAS:
-Hasta haber jugado un par de turnos no se entienden bien las mecánicas, ya que algunos aspectos como el orden de turno son diferentes a los más habituales
-A más de 4 jugadores se vuelve un juego muy azaroso
-El dorso negro de las cartas hace imprescindible enfundarlas para evitar identificarlas a través de pequeños arañazos o marcas

Great game, look forward to playing again.

Citadels is a really neat card game.  I love the idea of choosing roles to aid your gameplay (a la San Juan), but Citadels is even simpler and even a first-time player will feel like they know what they have to do.  Because only one player can use a role at one time, and some roles affect others, this game feels very interactive.  As well, The cards are magnificently illustrated.  Gameplay is quick but surprisingly deep and this can be a great game as a filler, main play, or beer 'n pretzels.  It really shines as a 4-player game, but just passes as a 2-player game (where choosing two roles per turn doesn't feel as crucial.)

My enthusiasm for this game has dwindled with time but it is a great time. There is a card that commands other players to say "Yes, my king" after being requested to perform their actions that I find hilarious. Great time. CITADEEEEEELS!

Grafiki w porządku, ale nie powalają, jakość kart jest ok, plus za to, że ta edycja zawiera w sobie dodatek. Ogółem nie mam zastrzeżeń, ale jej wadą jest to, że dosyć słabo działa na mniejszą liczbę graczy. Da się grać, mamy po 2 postaci wtedy, ale jakoś brak emocji w rozgrywce. Tak sobie budujemy, czasem ktoś coś zepsuje, zdarza się trafiać na nie za ciekawe karty, choć w pewnym stopniu można to kontrolować akcjami. Zdecydowanie lepiej się nadaje jako gra imprezowa dla co najmniej 5 osób.

This is a very easy game to learn and it works great with non-gamers. It is fastpaced and fun, you will need a bit of skill but also a fair amount of luck to win. On the box it says 20-60 min playtime but in a 4+ player game I´ve not seen a game yet that lasted less than 60 min.

[b]Recommended player count: 2-6[/b]

When playing with 3 players, ensure you add an extra character to the card draft to avoid any certain knowledge of which player picked which card.

Game goes on too long with more than 6 players in my opinion.

[b]Why I got rid of it:[/b]

Slightly too complex and plays too long for what it is. Has been superseded by better games since.

One of the rare games that I think gamers and non-gamers alike can enjoy.

I think great player interactions that come out of various role cards is what makes this game tick.

Citadels can offer a wonderful variable player power system.  What is basically a city building card game with a similar building mechanic and end game condition as San Juan, Citadels' many character offerings provide a much different approach to reaching the winning conditions.  Although I find San Juan to be the more structurally sound of these two, Citadels with its ability to scale to a larger group, and its stronger player interaction offers the more 'fun' experience. The depth of the game however sometimes leaves a game feeling empty, and an ill-fated card draw can hinder. However, the latter is often remedied by savy character selection and play.  

Update:  I have found Citadels to drag on many occasions, and loses the luster of its inital charm.  I still enjoy the occasional play but it's not a frequent visit.

Very nice cardgame for up to 7 players. It's fast and fun. Bluff and strategy are the two most important factors here. It's also easy to learn. By the way, in Europe the game is also know as 'Machiavelli'. Some luck is involved in drawing your card building but for the rest it's psychological warfare ;).

I found this game decidedly mediocre. With a large number of players, it suffers from gameplay time - the turns don't go quickly enough for 7 or 8 players to go around, there's a lot of downtime. With a small number of players, it suffers from imbalance - with only a few players, cards like thief or assassin become trivial to target. 

That said, it is a game that rewards guessing/predicting what the opponent is going to do next immensely, so if that is your favorite thing to do in a game, Citadels will be ok for that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Some luck, but not too much, lots of player interaction, relativly simple, short card game.  High "take that!" factor.  Enjoyable game, but is is probably a bit to chaotic for me.  The last time we played, we used alternative characters: the Witch and The Tax Collector and it really added a lot to the game.  Be sure and reduce the required number of buildings for victory to 7 from 8 if you are playing with more than 5 players.  With more than 5, the game is long for what it is and in my book doesn't highly.  Check out my "Definitive" 2-player variant posted in the forum... With the variant it is a very good 2-player game.  A similar variant is also necessary for the 3-player game.

This is one of those rare games that is good both with two players and with many players.  The mechanics of the game change slightly between games with 2 or 3 players and those with 4 or more.  As a result, both are very interesting games to play and I'm looking forward to many more plays of this.

One thing about this game though, the time to play seems to be directly related to the number of players in the game.  A two player game only takes 20 minutes or so, but a seven player game easily takes over an hour.  In fact, 10 minutes per player is probably a good rule of thumb, longer if just learning the game.

Edit: This was one of the first "modern" board games I played. I still enjoy it, but not quite as much as I did six years ago. Lowering the rating just a bit to reflect that.

Citadels has a nice learning curve. It's easy to teach and start playing but the sublties emerge with multiple playings. I would give it a higher ranking except for the cost. I payed retail ($19.95) and it is essentially a deck of mid quality cards. This is too much. Except for the crown piece, the rest of the bits aren't necesary. The extra character cards are nice.  I'm looking forward to playing more.

With the right group his game gets bumped up two places to an 8.  I've had some really good sessions with people who are into it.

RATING: 5
I've played one and only one game of this, but I feel I can rate this because I had the worst possible experience of the game.  I started last in turn order in a 5 player game, and had my gold stolen each of the first 4 turns, and 5 of the first 6.  It was incredibly frustrating.  Because the game is so affected by turn order, I can only give this a mediocre rating.

I think I'm ready to give this game another chance.

Ok, I've given it another chance with four players.  It wasn't as bad as I remember.  It was fun, but I enjoyed it mainly because I played with three people I know well.  The psychological screwage that goes into choosing roles was fun.

I can't believe this, but my rating for Citadels has climbed over the past year from 3 to 6.

Played a few more games including once with 3 players.  It was awful for 3.

Easy to pick up and fun. Best of all it can be wrapped up in a relatively short time. For us the end of the game is often not close. There is a "pick on/revenge" factor that can get out of hand with siblings and tends to take the kids out of the game making them more concerned about each other.  My understanding the term for this is metagaming, probably not the fault of the game.
  Haven't been able to convince the family to play this over the past year.   Perhaps playing with new people is the key to this game, once you have become familiar with your regular opponents.

Received from BGG Secret Santa, December 2008

May 2009 -- This game has quickly become one that we choose to play often. We have not yet used the Dark City expansion cards included with the game, but are enjoying the basic cards very much.

October 2009 -- We have begun using the Witch and Tax Collector in all our games, and will soon try some of the other Dark City cards, which look very interesting.

January 2010 -- We have played with some of the Dark City cards and like the ones we have tried.

October 2011 -- We still play with the Witch, Tax Collector, and Abbott cards, as substitutes for their original counterparts. We have not experimented with the other Dark City characters, but we do mix in different purple cards for variety. It is a fun game for us.

November 2012 -- Our adult daughter doesn't care much for this game, but since the rest of us do, she is willing to play it occasionally. I prefer playing it with 5 or 6 players, and that's our usual group.

2013-November:  Played this recently and still find it to be a fun game.

I really enjoy this game *if* players remember to choose quickly.  It's always slow for the new player who is trying to remember who does what, but it should go smoothly by the second game.  Fun psychology, though.

The sweet spot is 4P for me.  The assassin and thief seem like a less sure thing.  It's also good with 3, each player taking two roles, or with 5.  For 5 or 6 players, only build to 7 districts to keep the game length reasonable.

An ok game of building and role selection and messing with other players.

Choose a role and use its special power to help you while you build buildings for VP.  That's now a well worn pattern so Citadels doesn't have a lot of new ideas to recommend it.  It can be a good social  game if the players don't mind a bit of "take that" as other players may use abilities like the assassin, thief and warlord to stop them from getting a turn, stealing their money or destroying buildings they have built.  I never hate having played a session but I never ask for it either.

This has been a favorite for us, our kids, and non-gamers alike.  It's simple and easy to teach.  The game has two very distinct experiences at 2-3p vs 4p+.  I think my favorite is 2p where it is a bluffing strategy game.  With a group it's still a ton of fun, but it turns more into a party game with only tactical decision making.

A real good game, but scaling is a bit of a problem. When playing with many it has the same problem as poker - big downtime.

We like the two player game, less guessing leads to more tension. Super cheap cards, but nice artwork.

Well, this one has pretty much sat on the shelf since San Juan and St Petersburg came along. It'll make it back to the table, but its not really shouting to.

2/2008 update: got it out and played it again. Complete snoozefest.

RATING: 8
Enjoyable - another game that is simple to learn, yet can prove challenging to play. Gets better the more players you have available.

Worth substituting at least a couple of the cards from the expansion pack (the Witch and Tax collector for the Assassin and Thief always works well) - this results in a much more balanced game.

If you manage to play this game in under an hour without sacrificing the bluffing, double-think and general getting into each others brains. Then this is an excellent and devious little game and deserves a rating of 7-8 . My rating is lower because I have been burned out on the game after playing a number of not so exciting game sessions.
The game plays best with 4 players. with less players you each get multiple roles which I find not as interesting. And with more players the chance you have of figuring out what roles your opponents have chosen decreases dramatically. Which again makes the game less interesting.

Rated 8 After 2 Plays:

I really enjoy this one. Our first plays went rather slowly as everyone tried to learn the game but I can definitely see this one speeding along after more plays. I love the tension of choosing your role and trying to figure out what everyone else has chosen or will choose after you. 
A game where you get to murder, steal and break stuff is a winner in my book.

Rated 5 After 10 plays:

Unfortunately the game has up to this point always taken longer than it should for the amount of fun it provides. I've played a number of games with a few very AP-prone players, where it seemed like the game would never end. The problem here is that the whole double-think role-choosing mechanism can trigger an infinite loop of "I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me..." in your most AP afflicted players. A game can easily drag on for 2-3 hours, which is at least an hour too long for me. 
Another problem is the warlord card. Yes it can be great going around knocking your opponents buildings down, but it really only helps the people not involved. And again it makes the game longer than it has to be.
I'm going to try it again with some of the alternative character cards to increase money flow and remove the possibility of razing buildings to see if that can speed things up a little.

I would like the Citadels mechanism, if there was a game to back it.

The core of the game is hidden role selection, yet beside it there is very little you can do to play satisfyingly.
Moreover, the game is prone to be determined by a big mistake of one player who, trying to target one opponent, ends up screwing both his own game and a random other's.

Finally, a lot of time is spent trying to convince other players to do what you think is suitable and appropriate, in order to avoid to be hit by the aforementioned random screwage effect!

Theoreticaly it's fun, full of guessing, psychological games etc.

I reality it turnst out to be just very frustrating and random.The truth is you have very little control because others players' choises can give you no chance to do anything. In my last play during the first 4 rounds I was robbed 3 times and one my building was destroyed. So I was just drifting towards the end of the game, watching others getting stronger and stronger. No fun, just sheer frustriation.

Rating is for a 6 Player game.  At this player count, the game is really random.  You can easily get hosed with nothing to do for the duration of the game due to bad luck.  Since the game can take 90 minutes, this is a fatal problem with this game.

I should try this with fewer players; it's probably a lot better.

There are far too few interesting choices in this game. Either you pick the character that benefits you the most or you don't because you're afraid of the assassin or the thief. It's kind of interesting to be the assassin or the thief, but it doesn't necessarily help you so why would you choose them over other options? The districts are all pretty much the same which is also boring. It can be fun when the assassin or thief misses, but it's equally as unfun when they always accidentally hit the same player.

As a plus, it's fantasy themed, allowing you to get the family into heavier, fantasy games quicker.

Sold this in December 2014, and I don't have much desire to play it again. 

This game lacks a catch-up mechanic, and that bothers me, especially for a game that relies too much on luck. The last time I played this I was hit by the thief and assassin 5 times in a row. I got so far behind there was no way I could catch up, and I had to sit at the table and wait for the misery to end. Ugh. Not my idea of a fun time.

Most replayability of any game. This game is best played with a rule that permits negotiation during the character selection round. No player may reveal the cards they are holding or the card that they have selected, but they may make any claims they wish about the cards they are holding or the card they selected. This can become quite nasty. Limit wine consumption and don't assasinate the same person too many times in a row, if possible. Don't sit to the right of a player who likes to choose the King.

Provides a very different experience with two, with three, or with four or five players.  Not recommended for more than five players, and you should consider requiring one fewer district when playing with more than three players. The game is only fun when played *quickly* - this is not chess, after all.

The three-player version suffers a bit from one quirk.  Each round, every player will know with 100% certainty that two specific characters were chosen by someone else.  Consequently, the assassin and the thief become a bit too powerful with three players.

The character distribution system is the best thing about this game, the building phase is rather simple and unremarkable. The problem is that with more than four people it becomes really tedious, you have to wait until everybody has chosen a character and then finally start the round. There are better, faster games for 6-7 people, such as 7 Wonders (more complex) or Between two cities (a light game like Citadels).

We always play with The Dark City Expansion,mixing in any number of characters up to nine. It took a while for the rest of the family to warm to this one. But now, its a firm favourite. We all like doing the devious cloak and dagger stuff. Trouble is, the tit for tat can get a little annoying. 
But then there's nothing like pulling off a key bluff, and ending up with somebody else's loot, only to get assassinated next round. We play this with four usually, in under an hour.
But if we don't play for a while(3 months of more), forgetfullness can play a major part in slowing things down!

I loved it for a few years, then I noticed that many times when I played, that luck was wiping me out no matter what I did, then I started really hating it and the last 5 times I played, I got assassinated at least 3 times per game (4 out of those 5 games), which meant I had zero chance to win. When you know that you have zero chance to catch back up, and still have to play for another hour anyway, it becomes very grueling.

I finally sold my copy and don't ever need to play this again.

And yes I tried the variant assassin (witch) and folks at the table were not a big fan of her. Whoever went first - seemed like they would be stupid NOT to choose her, so she was kind of an auto-choice, which they didn't like.

In that game (with another player's copy) I chose my roles randomly and while I didn't win, at least I didn't lose as badly as I usually do when I get assassinated or stolen from a dis-proportionate amount of times, so the experience was only bad instead of awful.

Bruno Faidutti has come up with a slew of games that utilize a single mechanic - hidden identities. 
Citadels was his first, and I might argue, his best. The game is a little too long, but there are ways to shorten it up, especially when you have up to 8 players. Even though his more recent Masquerade is the best hidden identity party game EVER, I keep coming back to Citadels for it's compelling strategy and knife-in-the-back game play. It's almost like Dominion in it's simplicity, but so much more fun because of it's "gotcha" secret identity mechanic.

Menacingly fun game with heavy interaction. Have not enjoyed 2 and 3 player games but great for groups. I have to force myself to enjoy the experience of Citadels and not be too concerned with victory. That DOES NOT mean there is excessive luck involved OR that there is no strategy (i.e. choosing cards is never random). I have never thought so intently as when choosing a character in an intense game of Citadels. However, the chaos of this game is soooo high. Nothing can save you from being killed 17 times or having the Warlord (played by the loosing player) dump all of his or her gold into taking you out because you are in the lead (while the Bishop sits face up, discarded, on the table).

I have a hard time accepting that the second place person wins more often than the leader. Can't seem to work this into my strategy. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There is a lot of interaction, but it doesn’t seem to have the same take that mentality like many other games of this type. Instead the hidden roles make you think twice where the cards have been lost in the mix. I really like this deduction aspect of the game along with the different roles players can take. It’s simple to play but the thought aspect of the game doesn’t make the simple to decide. Should I take the most beneficial or trying to avoid conflicts? In the end I go by gut feeling, but it isn’t trivial.

I like to play with slightly different characters since the FFG version includes the Dark City expansion. I am not entirely fond of the Warlord from the basic game, since it makes the game longer and small buildings not a viable strategy. Sometimes I play to one less district than in the original rules for a slightly shorter game.

Excellent game, full of fun and tactics. Plays great with 2 players. A great game to teach to non-gamers. Citadels is a very entertaining, fast-paced game. Easy rules but the game makes you think. The wife loves the game. I really like this game and often use it to "capture" people that have never played board games 
I now consider it a good gateway game.

I tried hard to like this game, but I don't. Far too random and chaotic. The outcome is not really influenceable. Guessing which player chose which role isn't much fun either. Too much luck driven, no strategy or tactics possible (at least with 5 players or more). It is OK for a party game but not recommendable to ambitious players. The Dark City Expansion however works good as a bugfix, so the game becomes enjoyable.

RATING: 5
Played 10+ Played with 2,3,4,5&6 At 2 hours for the 6 player game it is way too long and there is likely to be significant down time between turns especially if you are assassinated at the start of the round. I suspect that if the whole group were comfortable with the rules then the bluffing element to the game would be more emphasised which would increase the fun. *UPDATE* The fun is squeezed right out of this game if played with ponderous gamers. Probably best kept in the family. This is not what I want to be playing with gamers. It feels like a waste of time. *UPDATE* Played with 2&3 none gamers and the down time was gone, the games were over within an hour and very enjoyable. My rating of this game varies wildly depending on the group at its best I give it a 7 at its worst a 3. April 05

Nice little game. Light but with tough choices to tackle. I played with six people and it was real fun. 

Intelligent and strategic.

***UPDATE***
I played in the two players version and I had AMAZING fun! So the score has gone up from "7" to a fat "8".

I wanted this game for the secret role selection and it definitely delivers.  Without the roles, it would be a very boring game.  I have lots of fun trying to out-think and out-maneuver my wife during role selection.  Unfortunately, I have a hard time remembering who's been selected, so my wife has won almost every game we've played.

Great game. Probably my favorite right now. Great strategy (more than I expected) and great interaction between players. Oh and I really love the screw factor in this game. Very ruthless if you want it to be. Only problem I see is after much more (and I mean MUCH more) play could see it getting a bit old. But definitely not as of yet.

RATING: 8
Amazing card game and social interaction that goes way beyond what I thought could be achieved with just cards.
It can be too long with the full player count, and with 2 or 3 players each gets two roles, so you get to play with time as well. It adds a very welcome layer to this already fantastic game.

Love it. A good mix of simplicity and depth (choosing characters is really the only thing that slows things down, and it's not too bad). It's basically a game of bluff, and second-guessing your opponents, with hilariously disastrous consequences.

I do think the three-player game is horrible, though (too many characters in play, spread between too few players, making the use of Thief/Assassin overpowered as tools to nobble your opponents as with so many characters in play, they nearly always find a target).

Has consistently overstayed its welcome, it just doesn't play fast. Even with only playing to 7 districts. But there's so much game there I'm sure I'd love it if it played faster. Haven't played the expansion yet.

Citadels is a very entertaining, fast-paced game.  It's quite unique in that it plays well with two players up through eight.  It's even better in a group of people you know well, because you can anticipate their actions and plan counter-strategies (or, try to).  It's got a nice balance of some strategy and some luck.

I recently discovered that my group had been playing with badly translated rules originally, making the game last way too long. Playing correctly, the game is actually quite good.

The first time I played was with my son, brother, and sister in law. My SIL played the Assassin and killed my son's character and he said 'I'll get you for that!' That pretty much ended that game.

Having played this several times, it has quickly lost it's luster for me.  Even with expansion cards, there just seems to be a lack of "different" things to do each game.  Randomness of assassin takes away some of the fun as well...nothing like sitting there in a large game waiting 10 minutes before you can get involved again.

I still like it, but with a small group.

When I first played this game, I was very excited about it. Nowdays, while still a fan, approach it with more caution. This game is a lot like snakes and ladders.

I love the triple thinking involved in choosing the assassin to kill the bishop so the warlord (that you assume your enemy didn't take) can kill a building of the person in the lead. I enjoy this game and love experimenting with the rules/characters with a 2 player game.

*Played 2-player only*. A very screw-your-opponent game, it's disappointing to me that, despite the nod to resource and card management, the meat of the game boils down to guessing which characters your opponent has. At least this is a genuine, and intriguing, skill on which to hinge the game, and maybe I would be more receptive if I wasn't so consistently hosed by my regular opponent!

This is a great game. Combines social gaming with strategy gaming. Bluffing and screwing over your opponents if the best part about this game.

Pure annoyance in card form. No interesting decisions to make as far as how to spend whatever meager gold you manage to scrape together before someone steals it. Most every building power is boring so the tableau you're building isn't interesting at all. The most celebrated part of the game -- the role selection -- far from being tense and psychological as some Citadel fans claim, is just a glorified game of rock-paper-scissors. On top of all this, there's a huge runaway leader problem, and you can't cycle cards quickly, so one bad draw can easily knock you out of the game. There's barely a game here, and what game there is sucks balls.

The character selection makes for an interesting bit of guessing what players may take but some of the character-based abilities (assassin/thief) can be overly punishing in a random sort of way depending on how people play.  The 2-3 player variant feels a lot different than the 4-8 player.  Minus points because of the varying face-up cards depending on player count, something I thought was a bit awkward and inelegant.

RATING: 5.5
One of the better (small) games that can handle a bigger group of players. This is a nasty little game that can and will screw you one or more times, which can be frustrating.

There can be rounds, where you don't participate due to the assassin, or where you lose all your gold or cards. There's no real balance here, just a nasty bluffing game.

Having that said, I dislike games, where you can lose full rounds and I also dislike most bluffing games, which puts this one onto the trade pile.

Great for it's time and for bigger groups, but nothing I enjoy much.

Gran juego de cartas no coleccionable. Tiene una muy buena relacion entre sencillez/diversion. Es para 2 a 7 jugadores pero lo ideal para mi es un numero entre 4 y 6. Aunque las reglas son muy faciles de aprender el juego mejora mucho cuando todos los jugadores saben jugar muy bien ya que agiliza el juego y lo hace mucho mas dinamico y entretenido.

This game has some potential for being a rather light game. I'll rerate it when I've played a second time.\

The game has some issues. The assassin always gets to take a turn while typically denying some else the same. As long as you treat it as a light game, this won't matter too much.

Just too long for what it is. The role selection element is interesting, and well implemented, but the game just drags on far too long. The only reason you are picking roles is to build district cards - there is nothing else to do, and the interest of this wanes quickly. If role selection were the core of a more varied set of mechanics I would be totally down with that (I am considering Mission Red Planet if I can find it).

Sold as I never suggested playing it anymore. It has a happy new home.

RATING: 7
I'm glad I got this one. The three player game is quite good. Haven't tried more than 4, but might shy away from it in that case due to potential downtime. It would really depend on the crowd, for both downtime issues and meanness issues, i.e., I would not want to play with any  A.P. players, and I would not want to play with people who take the meanness of the game personally.

RATING: 8
This is by far the most popular game in my circle of (non-serious gamer) friends.

I attribute its apparent popularity in Singapore to its closeness to Bridge, which is gaining popularity in Singapore. Like Bridge, part of the fun of Citadels is guessing the other players' roles. This is the most exciting element in the game for me. To me, nothing is more thrilling than correctly guessing what someone else.

It's proven to be a great gateway so far. Most of my friends love this game (it's even my class favourite). I am yet to get all these Citadels people hooked on some other games I play.

What I like:
As aforementioned, the system of different characters, especially trying to guess choices
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like this game.  It is sort of an interactive version of san juan with fewer, less meaty, but more interesting decisions.  If you liked the idea of san juan but didn't like the game because it had little interaction and no screw-you factor, Citadels is the game for you.  The assassin and thief are obnoxious if you are playing with people that aren't using them to bash the leaders/strong characters but instead just randomly hitting people for no reason.  The double-bluffing and deduction are pretty awesome and the alternate characters are pretty cool, though I wouldn't use them all.  I'd definitely just throw in a few now and then to mix it up.  Same with the alternate buildings.  This is a great game that can be easily sped up by playing to 6 or 7 buildings instead of 8.  My rating could easily go up with more playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice outsmarting/secondguessing game with secret role selecting from common pool of roles. Theme is medieval city developing, so you can choose roles of: merchant, assassin, bishop, thief and so on. Good light social game with nice tension and opportunities to stab other players.

RATING: 8
This is one of those games I enjoy but tend to do poorly at. I like how the game changes based on player numbers, which keeps it fresh. It feels pretty well balanced with a wide range of strategies being effective and the random discarding keeping you constantly addressing your tactics. I like that there's an element of reading what your opponents are doing as well. Solid game, and amazingly compact, which is useful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It can suffer a bit from the "player on my left doesn't know what he is doing" syndrome. In general though, this game has been beautifully balanced and a great test of psychology. Luck is generally pretty minimal and you have some control over how much luck there is. This would rate about an 7 except for one thing. I give the two or three player game a 8. Getting to take two roles and only having to think about what one or two other players are doing turns this into a serious thinking game. If this was ONLY a two-player game it would still rock. The fact that it scales, and scales well, to 7 or even 8 people is just gravy. After more plays, the viciousness has become a bit more aparent than it was at the first. Getting assasinated and losing your entire round makes this only suitable for more than 3 players with the right crowd.

RATING: 5
Although this is arguably the granddaddy of the whole role selection genre, it's feeling a little long in the tooth now. Can suffer from large amounts of downtime and the game claiming to support 6-8 players is more of a detriment than a benefit. At high player counts there is a *lot* of downtime and the amount of control anyone really has plummets quite greatly. Still decent with 4-5, but there are so many games for that player count that take about the same amount of time as this that I'm not sure I'd really pick it anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Nice balance, beautifully illustrated.  A good game for larger groups of players.  Still plays a bit slow though.

Rating gone up since I've played a few more times. Excellent game, suitable for seasoned 'pros' and even for infrequent gamers. Game length means 'lets play again' is an option and also scales well to large groups (up to 8!). Plays as well with 3 - the 2-roles-each mechanic gives a slightly different feel.

Very good game. Each player competes to build buildings. Each round each player chooses a role for that round that will help him or her build, or hinder his or her opponents. The roles are semi-secret and change each round. Some "take that" in this game, but due to the secret nature of the roles the "take that" doesn't always hit the intended target. Theming is meh for me.

I finally got to play this classic recently and really liked it.  Yes, it can be frustrating if you get assassinated or stolen from constantly, but not taking obvious choices can mitigate some of that.  This game makes you think of not just Plan A, but Plan B and C as well.

RATING: 7
Good game with 4 or more players.  NOT recommended with 3 players as the Thieve's role is next to useless as the other players can ofteb spend all their gold with one of their character's, thus leaving nothing for the Thief at the start of the target role's turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is great but it is also dependent upon the group with which you are playing. This game is meant to move quickly and be played in a not too serious manner. But when the game is subject to AP, this game drags out unnecessarily for decisions that should not take more than a few seconds (or at least would be more entertaining if they were vocalized).

An instant classic reading game. by reading, I mean reading your opponent.

Of the 8 Character cards, it's important to choose wisely, and to try and guess which one the other players have. In an 8 player game, this would be easy since everybody will have one card, but this gets more difficult with less players.

In a 2 and 3 player game, you take two cards each, which might make some things easier, but certainly hurries the game long as each player will get two turns!

Fun, well made, and easy to pick up!

[Initial Impression: 7] A fun little card game with hidden roles and the accompanying double-bluffing, although we usually play to a lower number of districts built for a shorter game.  I've seen games in which one player keeps getting killed or stolen from throughout the game, and they just don't have any fun. (Obvious Hints: Don't choose the merchant or architect a lot, and don't take the role for which you've already built a lot of districts. If all else fails, take the assassin or thief as your own role!) But I like this game quite a bit - it's especially good with non-gamers, and it is fun to watch (and engage in) the out-guessing that the game encourages.

Pleasant role-selection game you'd play with friends. Rules show their age & are a bit clunky but they work.

If you have a lot of friends it's a good idea to buy Citadels. The game works very well with a lot of people and you'll always be interacting with other players. Maybe one bad point of this game is that sometime the matches are too long (blame the Warlord), but you can fix it with the expansion.

A game of gaining trust or betraying one another depends how you play the game !

Players pick a role and gain character's special abilities. The abilities may be stealing other player's gold, swapping building cards, killing another player and that person skip his or her turn, be the king, etc.

A very interesting party game and recommended for party of 6-8.

Clever and elegant mechanics; very fun game in a small box. It plays up to 7 people, but in reality it drags a little to long with more than 5. Sweet spot is 4/5 players.

In the second game, out of the 10 rounds I did some obvious bad choices of roles. Still I came in second with only 3 buildings built, while the winner had 8 buildings. So I guess, there is a certain luck factor.

Lowered from a 9 to an 8 as I haven't played this in almost a year.  The member of our game group who comes up once every month or two doesn't bring it anymore.  I also don't know if it's worth buying for me since I have a bunch of other light games now that are just as fun.  Below comments still apply.

I see this game as sort of a Race for the Galaxy-lite version.  I played RftG before this, and while friends were saying RftG was super-fun, I still haven't found what they find in that game.  This game though, definitely is fun.  Easy to pick up, but has some depth to master.  Each round is different, much less each whole game.  Especially when you play with different groups of people who are more/less hostile.  It's a game I wouldn't turn down a play for.  It may lack a little depth, but I think the gameplay more than makes up for that.

This is a nice one. Quite different from the rest of my games. I like the interaction between players. It can be nasty, but you can't usually directly target another person but the role they choose (which you don't know), although Magician and Warlord let you choose a person you want to mess with. You can screw people up quite a bit. I understand that this isn't a game for everyone, but I've enjoyed this one and really want to play more.

RATING: 6
“Lands, titles, men, power, nothing.” - Robert the Bruce

GAMEPLAY
Players build their cities up to eight districts. Every turn each player chooses one of eight roles. All roles, all secret until played, give the player a special ability from gaining extra gold for having districts of certain colors, choosing a role first next turn, destroying someone else’s district, or building multiple districts. On the turn the first player gets to eight districts finish the turn and count points to determine a winner.
COMPONENTS
The box is small and the pieces consist of two decks of cards (roles and buildings), gold tokens, and a king token. The art is a generic fantasy setting but bright and crisp and very well done.
THEME
The city building is secondary to the role selection process. The gotcha gameplay is well related to each of the roles. Some roles promote winning and some negatively impact the other players.
WHO IS IT FOR?
This game is simple to learn but there is a great deal of bluffing and deduction. The replay-ability comes from your group how well can you predict their actions and bluff your own? There isn’t back stabbing because there are no long term strategies. Knowing the others who play or guessing their tendencies is where the fun is. A great game for a group to warm up a game session. Players 10 and up will enjoy the game, it takes about an hour to play. It plays 2 to 8 players, try playing with 2 or 3, each player gets two roles, changing the dynamic great fun!

I imagine my rating is artifically low.  I only played once, with seven players, one of whom was obnoxious as hell.  So I imagine it&#039;s actually a better game than that.

RATING: 6
This game goes relatively fast with experienced players, but with AP, a seven or eight player game can be unbearable with substantial down time between turns, and waiting for the character cards to come to you. I've played it with 3 or 4, where you get two characters, which can be great fun. Rating: '8'.

Update (06/25/09): Played a 5P game, with one newbie. Relatively painless. Note to self--next time, make sure to sleeve all the cards!!! The role cards wear out pretty quickly.

Update (08/01/09) 4 plays: I'm beginning to get annoyed with this game, as it seems to be too chaotic for my tastes. The assassin and thief can be useful, but they can also be totally unpredictable. The merchant is logically the one who gets killed the first round (usually, so now we all avoid it like the plague), due to its lucrative powers, but what is it with the architect getting killed instead? There seems to be several layers of meta games developing here. Those that get assassinated early on, or stolen from, don't necessarily seem to recover with respect to the rest. Is that me, or is it generally true?

Update (02/10/13) 6 plays: Not much movement in nearly five years of ownership. Hidden role-selection is still novel, but getting randomly killed is infuriatingly frustrating. The game would be awesome with 7 experienced players, but the thought of excruciating downtime kills the thought. No one wants to play this. No one. Downing to a '6'.

It is quite a good game, but we find ourselves willing to play it no more than once a month.  Waiting for your turn while other players try to decide which character to select is the worst part of the game (with 4 it is bearable, with 5 and more - the flow is broken).  It also plays a bit too long for such type of game.

Great psychological game of bluffing and analysis.  Played this multiple times in a group of four over a week and had a great time each game.  Scales incredibly well.  Non-strategic players can add a lot of randomness, but that's also part of the fun.

Really fun game if played in a big group. I would suggest a minimum of 4 players. The more players, the more fun. 
The game is very interactive, you are always trying to mess with your friends and outwit them.

I really recommend this to anyone who plays regularly with his friends.

Portable, elegant, inexpensive & excellent themed artwork. Considerable player interaction with short-term bluffing / guessing attempts.

This keeps each round tense because offense-defense exchanges occur so frequently.

2-7 (or even 8) players.  Works best with more players.  The bluffing & deduction are excellent.  We usually end up playing it in a similar way to the way we play Risk - always trying to tell other players who the "real threat" is & get other players to try to stop them while each trying to sneak ahead ourselves.  When 7 or 8 players are doing this at once it becomes very interesting.

However, the game takes a bit too long & can't really hold my interest.

A fun little implementation of the 'blind action' mechanism, although you can be (and often are) arbitrarily robbed or assassinated. In spite of the inevitable chaos, I seem to do well at this one, possibly because you don't have to think too hard. I prefer it without the expansion, but you don't normally see just the base set now. Overall my opinion has deteriorated with time, there's just a bit too much luck and chaos for the playing time, more recent light games like Blueprints are much quicker.

The information management is the most interesting part of this game.  The role selection is fun if you are not under the delusion that you know roles other people will pick.

Muy buen juego si es a partir de 4 jugadores. Se organiza en un momento y las partidas no duran mucho, además las reglas son sencillas. Alta interaccion y mucho puteo. Imprescindible tenerlo en cualquier ludoteca, aunque ahora lo tengo bastante "quemado". Contras: elevado tiempo de espera, frustrante y caótico. ¿Tienes muchas cartas? El mago te las cambiará. ¿Tienes mucho oro? El ladrón te robará. ¿Muchas cartas construidas? Te las destruirán. ¿Eres el último en elegir? Seguro que te matarán porque habrás elegido el arquitecto o el mercader. Llevo un año sin jugar a él y no lo echo de menos.

Is it too early to call this game a classic? It's a game that got so many into board games but has unfortunately shown it's age.

Nonetheless, still fun on occasion, however it's lost its charm when better games have taken its place

RATING: 4
Liked this one the first time I played it, but every game since then has been less and less enjoyable.  The role-choosing mechanic is clever and nicely implemented, but there is way too much down time when everyone is choosing their roles and the game really drags after the first hour or so.  Maybe with the right people the gameplay would move more quickly (every game I've played has had at least one first-time player in it).  I think decreasing the number of cities to trigger the end of the game would add a little more excitement - as it is, I think 8 is too many.

This is great game to get people into boardgame hobby. Secret role selection is amazing!!!Using only base game roles is enough for me. I like the original edition artwork better. And for now it is favorite game of my 7 year old daughter.

RATING: 9
A tableau game with unique player powers that change each round, Citadels forces players to read their opponents and form strategies that indirectly rely on opponents' secret power choices. It's not too long where a misplay or a loss is very bothersome, but is is lengthy and deep enough for choices - good or bad - to have some teeth. A great game for friends who know each other and aren't afraid to get in character with the differing roles and beautiful artwork.

Second must play game. What a card game should be like. Character selection mechanic was (still is) one of the best idea in the gaming world. El objetivo es construir 8 edificios en tu ciudadela. Pero cada ronda tu tienes debes seleccionar tu personaje lo que afecta tus opciones defensivas y ofensivas. Juego único!!

RATING: 9
Has just enough depth, allows just enough players, has just enough direct player interaction, has just enough choices, has just enough choices every single turn. It hits the sweet spot of many people. It would be a steal at three times the price.

Best sets of cards according to Faidutti, in his GOTW thread:

"With two and three players, play something else.
With four to six players, the eight basic cards
With seven or eight, the eight basic plus Queen or Artist. "

The box I purchased came with the Dark Expansion included.  Played on Dec 11th, 2006.  I have played this many times with friends and family previously.  The game has a decent amout of strategy (guesswork) in determining the characters other players picked to get them, along with trying to pick a character with the abilities to maximize your potential with your current cards for for each round.

When we play the game normaly the first personages picked are the thief and the murderer. The murdere kills the thief..that goes on and on. A bit boaring.. But maybee I have to give the game another chance. 

Can be fun though, but not my favorite. My boyfriend loves it!

UPDATE : 
Well, it is a boring game when you play it with 2. So I NEVER DO THAT AGAIN :D

But with 3 or 4 its a lot of fun! with 5 it may take a bit to long in my opinion. 
But rating for 2players  = kinda like zero.. for more i give it a 7!

A large group is preferable, but I find it plenty fine to play with two.  The game is controlled chaos with some psychology thrown in.  Often the person who goes unscathed from assassination the most will be crowned winner though.  -Still a very good game in my opinion.

Update:  Note to self - stop playing this game!  Your winning streak has been tempted time after time!  They're all out to get you now!  Flee, flee!

Played this at the game night our friends host, will be making it's way into my collection very soon.

The changing characters and elements of player interaction make this game a great one for a group of people you know well.  I especially like that this game led me to understand "Puerto Rico" better, the mechanics are very similar and knowing how Citadels works really helps make the explanation of PR easier.

I bow down.  People love this.  After playing it, I see why.  The new editions with alternate characters are really nice!  It's got double think and city building galore.  Some people don't take kindly to the direct opponent screwage though.

I find I haven't wanted to bring it out often though.  I think it's the dry under-game of city building.  I really find myself wanting to play Meuterer instead!

I previoiusly owned the 'Fantasy Flight' edition, called CITADELS.  It's a good game, but can last a while, and can be frustrating at times if you get killed off or stolen from too many times.  I think I will play with the 7 district variant next time, to shorten the game a bit.

It's an '8' if you play with experienced players who know the roles and have an approach to what they are trying to do - but you don't always get that luxury. This keeps the game from bogging down as players flail about trying to figure out what to do. Inherently too many ways to either drag the game down generally or for somebody to just get obliterated by an assassin/warlord 1-2 punch to really make this a very good or great game.

This is a fun game to play with my family. The character roles are fun and add a lot to the game. The game is still very easy to learn and play. My kids 8+ (the ones who enjoy 7 wonders)enjoy this very much. My wife, oldest child, and I feel it is a little too light for us, so when we play it can feel a bit long. But we loved it at first, I guess we just overplayed it after so many yeras, lol.

It's a fun game combining hidden role selection (drafting) and tableau building. I played this a lot around 2007, and it held up through many plays. There is a bit of feelbad with the assassin / thief, so a good group for this game needs to be OK with it.

Simple game which can be very tense at times and is usually great fun because of the psychology of character selection. It can take a while to explain to the concept to newbies, but is easy to pick up after a few rounds of play. One drawback is that you can spend quite a while with nothing to do but wait while other players to choose their character. Its a nice, quick game with 3 players but more interesting with 4-6.

A quick card game that plays well with 2-4 players.  I really like the role-selection mechanic.  When selecing a role, you must take into account the roles you believe your opponents are taking, so there's lots of bluffing action going on.  It sure looks pretty... it's got colorful artwork on the cards and sweet little gold butterscotch candies.

RATING: 7
(note: so far my rating and comments are based on games of the 2-player or (modified) 3 player variant)  

This game has almost all of the qualities that I am looking for when playing a "lighter" game.  1) It is of fitting length for its depth. (if not played with too many people) 2) It has an engaging theme. 3) The luck is manageable (luck in drawing hand card can be counterbalanced by proper role-choice) 

In addition to these favorable characteristics, the game contains a large element of bluff and counterbluff which creates a wonderful experience.

After playing so many complex games 'Citadels' still retains - for me - not only some sentimental charm but is a source of satisfying gaming experience.  A simple idea behind it but it seems an undying one.

I have special sentiment for this game as it was one of the first 'modern' boardgames that I played (and possessed).

EDIT: The new 2016 edition made it obsolete.  Sold.  Yeah, life is brutal.

RATING: 7
City building:role selection:bluffing
variable player powers:screwage

Rules read so far, looks a lot lighter than I expected which will be bad for me, looks like a filler type game worthy of an 8 rating or so...

Update: Well after one play, this really lacks any kind of depth and substance which I didn't see coming, a neat little role selection game that provides some fun but quite light for my tastes. Like a lot of games, I think it will be slightly more fun with more than 2 players but it lacks options, you choose a role, you build if you can, and you take a stab at someone if you can. That wouldn't be so bad but the building aspect of it really lacks here and it isn't enough to keep it interesting...will be played as an occasional filler for now and change rating if needed with more plays and players...Rating could edge up a bit...

Update: Although I am not raising the rating I have come to appreciate this game and lighter games in general(great for weeknights). I'm not sure this would ever be suggested with 4 players as there are so many good games for that number, but maybe 6 or 7. We are currently playing it with just the wife and I and I'm enjoying it more and more. We also noticed that some of the buildings have special powers also which makes it more interesting and we haven't even added in the expansion yet(got FFG version). I really like the different roles and trying the guess which roles your opponent is choosing so you can screw him/her or avoid getting screwed. Fun little game.

RATING: 8
In this card game, players select a hidden role that specifies their turn order and confers a unique ability.  Identifying who has what role (and disguising your own) is often a big part of the game. The roles can be partially deduced, but usually you have to rely on a little psychology.  This can be a lot of fun.  The rest of the game--building buildings to score points--is simple and a little vanilla.  This is not necessarily a bad thing because it allows you more time to worry about whether the thief or assassin is going to get you.  Scales well to six players.

One of the first games I bought when getting into boardgaming.

My wife and I both really like this game.  lots of bluffing, chaos, and very tactical.  It's always extremely tense when the king starts reading off the different characters. every round offers so many different strategies/tactics.

My score may be a bit low due to the fact that my wife seriously kicks my butt at this game when playing 2-player...  It seems no matter what roles I pick, she always has a retort.  I am bitter.

I was really impressed with the strategy involved in this game, very interesting play!  The game is very simple, it's the meta-game that's exciting. Second guessing one another, intrigue, suspense, back stabbing...it's great!  Can be a bit slow with 7 players though but it's a better game if you can stand the down time.

*Update* Though once fun, the overly long game time keeps this game firmly on the shelf for me. I have almost no desire to play it anymore.

RATING: 6
A fairly light game.  Each turn every player chooses role that provides certain advantages.  They then play cards representing different parts of a city that they are building.  Most have no function except having a color that corresponds to some of the roles.  The game ends at a certain number of cards and the most card points wins.  Most of the interest in the game comes from trying to guess who is choosing which role.  For example, one is the Thief which lets you steal money but you need to name your target role before you know who they will be so if you're targeting a guy with a lot of bucks, you have to guess which role they will be choosing.  If you think someone will try to demolish part of your city as Warlord, you might choose to be Priest to be safe.  Solid concept but in practice lacks interesting tension and strategy.  Somehow there isn't the sense for me that it actually makes that much difference which role I choose or that which roles others choose makes that much difference to me.  And the city cards are mostly pretty uninteresting or just worth points.  Still, not without enjoyment and pretty quick.  Sort of like junk food.

RATING: 6.5
Recipie: Take San Juan.  Subtract two parts long term strategy.  Add two parts backstabbing chaos.  Add one part poker-like bluffing and mind tricks.  Shake well.  Drink.  Smile.

We play two players.  Your chaos mileage may vary.  

Update: played this with three players last night, and it was great fun.  Bump it up half a point if you're playing a) with three or four people, who b) don't take themselves too seriously, and c) love backstabbing and trash talking.

Update II: had a rough seven player outing of this.  Took WAY too long, and was a three horse race about an hour in.  Dropping this a half point.

RATING: 4
There are two major issues with Citadels. The first is the way that certain roles can be too aggressive. It goes beyond "that player nudged me out of first" and into "I can't win but the game is far from over" territory. The second is that the process of selecting roles is flawed. There is often not enough information to make an educated decision. This slows the game down, especially for new players who are not familiar with the roles and think each decision can be "figured out."

With two or three players, these problems are minimal. Selecting two roles means that every turn will see each player at least making some progress. Seeing the hand of roles multiple also makes role selection much more intriguing and tactical.

With four players, the aforementioned problems start to reveal themselves. With five players (or several new players), the game is one of the most unpleasant game experiences I've ever had. Such games can drag on well past an hour and mostly consist of waiting on players to choose a role and hoping one doesn't become a random victim too many times, making it impossible to win.

I'd give it a six for less than four and move it closer to a two as the player count goes up and the experience level of the players decreases - so I'll average it out and give it a four.

There aren't a lot of games you can play with 7 people, so Citadels instantly gets high marks.  The mechanics are interesting and always entertaining.  One problem with the game is the downtime involved when everyone is picking their role card.  They're the same 7 cards every time, but it always seems to take forever.  My only other complaint is the cheap game parts.  German games have spoiled me on high-quality game components, and Fantasy Flight disappoints in this respect.  The King marker is peeling back and the counters and cards are not high quality.  But hell, the game is fun.

I think this game is a little better with more players. Ideally seven players. With less players some of the cards lose their value (thief and assassin).  Also some of the alternate characters aren't well balanced. The alchemist replaces the merchant, which incidentally devalues all of the green buildings.

Each round features a role selection draft followed by an action phase where each role activates in a predetermined order.  You're trying to build buildings of various types, and some of the roles help you and some hinder others.

Solid game with some great bluffing moments, particularly with a lower player count. I'm probably in the minority here but I enjoy this as a 2 player game.

GENERAL CONSENSUS:
If I can rope the same people to play this each time, it'll catch on. But it takes a couple of plays before people start digging it.

I printed player aides from BGG for everyone for this one and it went over well for us

works with 2 players. 3-6players fun building game that would benefit from a timer (when timer expires the person experiencing analysis paralysis has their character choosen for them). Tone down assassin role so that person loses turn but still collects income.

Secret role selection, and all the bluffing and mind games involved, is a clever idea, but Citadels just takes forever to play. It would be amazing if it were shorter, but I don't want to spend 2 hours playing a game of this.

I love the role selection mechanic. I'm not as obsessed as Faidutti with medieval fantasm, the theme does not appeal to me at all, but the game is simple, fast-paced, and is one of rare games that EVERYBODY in my family likes to play.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (June 2010)

Citadels was one of the first games I ever tried, Still I remember I never wanted to play the game very often. I’m not sure why because it is a fun game. Easy to play and teach. I prefer to play it with 5 or fewer players, with more, the downtime, playtime and uncontrollable luck increase a lot.

Nowadays, I almost never want to play it, I love hidden roles games but there are a lot of better options. The playtime is high for such a simple/light game. Also it has a lot of “take that”, a mechanism I almost never enjoy. The game gets old quickly so it has a low replay value for me.

Bottom line, Citadels is an ok game for me now. I don’t particularly want to play it, but will do if requested. It has way too much chaos/uncontrolled luck and the playtime can exceed the one hour mark. I downgraded its rating so it matches my feelings for the game with the BGG recommended rating system.

Current Rating: 5.5

RATING: 7
A good, but not great game of role selection.  Alot of interesting decision points but often clogs up with more players making it take longer than it should.  Interesting "take-that" play makes it a more casual game than a great strategic masterpiece - but its fun and that's what counts.

RATING: 8
Unusually, I've upped the rating after a long time. Works really quite well as a 2 or 3 player game. More isn't *bad*, but it's more chaotic and the consequences of your actions are pretty arbitrary.
---------------------------------
This game has become one of our regulars. Rating stands.
---------------------------------
After 1 play: For a purpose-built themed deck of cards, this game actually works pretty well. The role-drafting feels like a significant decision point where the consequences of the roles have clear impact on the immediate development of the game (unlike my feeling of Puerto Rico). Balance is good, player interaction is present and direct but not overwhelming. Play is simple and was quickly explained. The game would benefit from a second set of role cards to have face up for newbie reference.

I hate, hate, HATE the lose-a-turn mechanic in games.  Some games are fun to watch, but only if I don't expect to be one of the players.

I will actively avoid any game that features the loss of turns so prominently, because if I want to be doing nothing, I have many perfectly good ways of doing so without wasting my limited gaming time to do it.

Other than the potential lost turns, there are many elements to like about the game, such as the unique aspects of some of the other roles; too bad the fun ones get cancelled too often to really make an impact on the game.

Enjoying it a lot actually. Easy to teach, lots of interaction, tricksy hobbits--thieving hobbits!--fun, trickery, wild turns, and close finishes once people get cooking.

For some reason I've been seeing some Cosmic Encounter in the game...it's not the same in any real way I guess, but it's got a lot of the fun of Cosmic, but you get a new power every turn if you want.

This is a pretty good game and I even enjoy it with 2. Very good find and I'm looking forward to the expansion set too.

Clever mechanics put the emphasis on judgement, probability and bluff, rather than analysis to the nth degree - which puts it up my street!

Most significant decision is which character to play each turn. Get this right, and you can make real progress. get it wrong......

Because of this, only real drawback is amount of time players take to choose their character each turn - character choice can often take far longer than actual play.

It's worth it though, as it's full of suspense and surprise. It's a looker, too - the card artwork is exceptional.

Update Dec 2006: I've been playing this (a lot) for over 3 years now and have yet to tire of it. He's released other great games I've enjoyed since (Boomtown, Mission Red Planet) but this is still my favourite Faidutti (and one of my favourite game). Hence, updated to a 10.

Update Jul 2010: finally getting to the point where I've just about played it enough, but that took 10 years!

When I first started playing this game I loved it.  I think after the first five plays or so though it just got progressivly worse for me.  Sometimes I feel that when the character cards are passed to me I should pick blindly because I'd have a better chance at not getting stabbed or robbed from!  I'll play this game to please the group but I'll never pick it to hit the table.

Finally got to play this game after wanting to for a while.  We played a 6 player version of the UK Citadels with Witch and Alchemist included in place of normal Assassin and Trader.  Not sure whether I like the game or not.  Was victim of the often mentioned being on the right of the king for 5 turns straight.  Game seemed quite viscous - which is fine with the right crowd.  Game was a bit slow, but will give another go.  Played again and rating went down - sure I should like this!

First STOP comparing this game to PR.  Any similarities to the role-choice mechanic between the two games is purely superficial.  In addition to the private nature of the choice, there is the more important idea that only one person performs each role per round.  Also, the number of real choices is more limited.  Regardless of your role, there are only four possible things you can do:  increase your income, increase your building possibilities, thwart an opponent, or go first in the next round.  The meaningful choices in Peurto Rico are more varied, and more difficult.
More importantly, though, unlike PR, where the person choosing roles first rotates in a predictable way, in Citadels it is possible to play the entire game and _never_ have the opportunity to choose roles first.  (In fact, this happened to me in the aborted game mentioned above.)  While there are certainly ways to win in these circumstances (I was winning the game above), it does make the game feel chaotic.
Overall, a playable game, but it will never be more than "light" game fare for me.

Update - 7/3/05:  Finally played this game FTF, this time with 6.  This is a very chaotic game, requiring more tactical skill than strategic.  It is impossible to control what roles will be available to you unless you first take the king.  And it is possible to never get that chance.

Final update: 9/6/05 - This game is too long.  It is completely chaotic (don't believe me?  Then explain why the last winner at our table was the only newbie, and he was drunk!) and therefore should be a 30 minute game, but it's more like 1-1.5 hours.  Feh.

After one 2p game, there's no there there. Vastly overrated. The rest of the game after the roles seems incongruous, unlike, say, Mr. Jack.
I like bluffing and I like cards and I like rock-paper-scissors--so not sure what's up. Maybe just need the right group.  But for that, I don't like how you have to memorize all the character roles for such a simple game. If I'm going to do Rock Paper Scissors why not Snoops & Snitches or Resistance or even Xe Queo?

A fun, light card game where the best-laid plans constantly go awry -- to much laughter and amusement.  A game of guessing, counter-guessing, and hiding in plain sight.

I've now played this with 2, 4, and 7 people, and it is a lot of fun regardless of group size. The city building theme is pretty loosely coupled, you're really just accumulating points. The role selection, though, provides a great strategic element, and makes for a lot of fun player interaction.

2013-06-01 - Everything I said above still applies, but I find with more plays the city building mechanic gets a little old. Still a great game, but it knocks it from an 8 to a 7 for me.

2017-07-14 - And, we played this again recently. Too long and too much downtime. Going from a 7 to a 6.

is an 8 with right crowd were my initial comments.  They still hold.  However after playing it a number of times my comments are as follows -
The game can be too randomly nastly.  It is often benefical to choose the assassian (as to protect your gold) and randomly kill a character).  
Being stolen from in the first round is a huge disadvantage.  
If one player decides simply to be vindictive the game seems to collapse and be no fun.

There is a great game there, it's just surrounded by chaos.  It's not so much chance as the combined randomness of your opponents.  And this has gotten on my nerves.

I usually win this game, as my sons are too busy vying for the Assassin and Thief cards to use on each other.  Must be a 'guy' thing...  UPDATE:  It was getting quite ugly here so I had to replace the Assassin for the Witch card and am seriously considering replacing the Thief card as well.

My tactics must be too obvious because I get whomped every time, but it's just so much fun. Hoping for that just-right role, stabbing people in the back, stabbing people in the front, trash talking... good times. I feel like eight districts can sometimes be a bit much, but cut it down to 6 or 7 and you're golden.

Has lost a little bit of luster lately. Mission: Red Planet is my new go-to in the role selection genre, and Libertalia offers more choices and a more engaging theme.

RATING: 6
I think it helped that I wasn't expecting much going into this game, because I ended up pleasantly surprised. The game as two types of cards - character cards (8 of them) and district cards (a lot of them). The goal is the play district cards to the table for points. The game ends on any turn when a player plays an eighth card to the table. Before playing district cards, though, players pass the character cards around the table and select one to be in effect for that turn. Characters all give a special ability and/or extra money or cards. Character selection is the most interesting part of the game, but it is also the part that takes the longest, as everyone waits while players mull their options before passing the stack along. This is one of the big criticisms of the game - the downtime, especially when playing with slow decision-makers. But I thought picking the right character from what was available while considering your needs for that turn was pretty interesting.

After picking characters, players either collect two gold or draw two district cards, keeping one. Then a player can play one district to the table by paying the cost in gold. That's all there is to it. A character's ability will change things up a bit for that turn. The other big criticism for the game is the "take that" type characters that can steal another character's gold, "assassinate" another character so the player loses his turn, or destroy a district played by another player. People who hate to be messed with won't like this one.

My main concern with the game is that it takes too long for what it is.

It is really difficult to predict what others will take (at least with 6 or 7 players), so it is hard to put some strategy in your game. Being murdered and stolen from during the whole game is not fun, sometimes you can only hope that bad luck evens out. With 4 it is great, also because it plays much faster. Played once with 2 players, then you need to outwit your opponent, which is very difficult. The game is a bit too confrontational for my taste. (28 okt 06 after 11 plays)

Another game that would have been rated higher several years ago.  There is a bit of an issue that whoever is the King can keep selecting it or keep it, and the player who winds up with the last pick is screwed as a result.  (Agricola has this same issue when someone picks start player for the next round.)  One thing that irks me is how people think the game is best with seven; I actually think three (two roles apiece) may be the best number, because if one of your characters is assassinated, you can still make a play that turn.  The luck factor in trying to pick who gets assassinated/stolen from probably is one factor that prevents me from giving the game a higher rating, but when it first came out, it was fairly unique.

Good game which stands or falls depending on the group.  If people are interested in problems of the 'if you pick this and he picks that then I can pick this and then he will have to pick that and then ...' kind and they are also quick at decisions then it will be loads and loads of fun.  Biggest problem is if that there can be considerable downtime if some players can't choose their character quickly - then it drags.  I have played in both scenarios.  If you have a bad experience with this game then don't write it off!  Cards are wonderful and the game play is fascinating.  I am still not sure how much genuine strategy or tactics there are but I am enjoying trying to find out!
Update - played some 2-player now and it really works - probably better than with more players (too much downtime).  I would give it an 8 for 2 players and 4-ish for 5+ players, depending on how quick they played, although even if they DO play quick the downtime is still considerable.
Update - the downtime with 5+ people is horrific.

The beauty of this game is in the player interaction. While the character choosing at the start of each round does slow the game play down, the mind games behind it are well worth it. Watch out for some of the buildings in the expansion though. Some are great and make the game more fun. Others are too powerful for no extra cost and add an unwanted layer of luck for those fortunate enough to draw them.

RATING: 7
Classic role selection game that feels slightly dated.  Basically a race to build seven buildings in your city.  Citadels has a very small sweet spot: 5 to 6 players.  More than that, the game would drag.  Game is a little long for what it is, but a descent gateway game, if you don't mind a little "take that."

RATING: 5
Better on first glance than after repeated plays.  Too random with 2 and WAAAY too much dead time with 6-7.  Not terrible with 4, but still takes too long.  Have yet to play with 3-4.  

It's a great fun game for 30-45 min (and the expansion buildings help IMMENSELY), but games often go on much longer than that.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an alright game when you have a larger group of about 6 players. Players select various role cards with special abilities. Then on their turn they collect coins and build buildings. The cost of the building is also equal to victory points at the end of the game. The roles of thief and assassin add some chaos. Whoever takes the king gets to be the starting player. There is definitely some strategy, but it seems like there is a little more randomness and unpredictability. Still, there is some fun to be had.

Citadels is a card building game, with various variations due to each turn you will have different character(of your choice) and can be played up to 8 players.

I haven't tried any characters or cards from the expansion. Just by looking the ability and card effects, I think it'll give the game a lot more difference, my friends and I really enjoy this game.

Seemed a bit long for the 'fun factor', i.e. not enough bang for buck.

Received in trade for Magnifico. Have played 6 or 7 times as of jan 2017, I really like this game. It's quick and easy to explain, and the bluffing/backstabbing is excellent. It would probably change with more plays, but the King doesn't tend to change much which can be frustrating. It would probably change more in a >4pl game. I have yet to play with the other set of characters. Ashley doesn't particularly enjoy this one.

RATING: 8
This is a great little game to play, but for me really depends on the group. I enjoy playing the two player variant because it's quick yet still maintains good potential for strategy. With four or more players though, it has the potential to drag. I think the trick is to make sure that everyone chooses their roles quickly and that people don't restrict themselves to only building expensive districts. It's a great game, as long as you play it fast.

Fun Factor: Constantly changing secret roles every round

I've only ever played this as a 7-player game.  There is a lot of downtime -- especially with certain types of players -- but it is one of the few 7 person games we play where I feel like with played a somewhat substantial game when we are done.  We always play the "short" game to only 7 buildings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I've only played this in groups of five or more. I found the game very frustrating. Accumulating gold is crucial for building, but as soon as a player has two gold pieces she becomes a prime target for both the Assassin and the Thief. If either strikes, the victim cannot make use of that gold.

I found the game had quite a bit of downtime while offering me nothing interesting to do while other players take their turns. Hmmm. . . yup, the few cards in my had haven't changed and, yup, that small stash of gold is still a small stash of gold.

And to make matters worse, this seems to be promoted as a good game to play with newbies. And in my expeirence newbies have a terrible time understanding the role selection and variable player order.

This game simply takes too long for what it is. It usually takes over an hour for 5 or so players and it feels like you know the top 2-3 players within the first 30 minutes. I know this is more at fault of the players taking too long of turns and drafting, but other, newer party games are just better in every way. This game really struggles near the 7 player mark... which is probably where it gets played most often considering the lack of good 7-player games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I didn't like the two player variant. Unable to be able to build the same buildings really hurt and left too much up to luck. It was a serious problem for me.

Playing with lots of people is a little more fun, but some of the roles can be very annoying for the group and other players. I'm very mixed on this game.

I probably need to give it another try, though.

Mass psychology game: which of my choices is the best for me? If I choose this role, then my neighbour will understand it and he/she will kill me. So I'll choose the other role. But what if my neighbour thinks that I chose not the one which is the best, but the second best role?.. Or: He has a lot of money and the best decision for him is to choose this role. However, if he knows that somebody wants to rob him then he will choose this one instead... To sum up, you must think about what others think even though they know that you thing about what they think. A fun and not too long game. Simply do not take the bad luck too seriously.

Grupinės psichologijos žaidimas: ką pasirinkti, kad man būtų naudinga? Jei pasirinksiu šitą rolę, tai mano kaimynas tai supras ir mane nužudys. Taigi rinksiuosi šitą rolę.

Kita vertus, jeigu jis žino, kad kas nors gali iš jo vogti jis to nesirinks, o rinksis šitą... Žodžiu būtina galvoti, ką galvoja kiti, net ir tada, kai jie žino, kad tu galvoji, ką jie galvoja.

Crap game. I really wish I had my hour back. I spent this hour waiting, mostly. For three crap draws. Only to have the player to my left end up with a decision about who would win. Calling off the order of the roles (the roll call of roles?) was tedious as hell and made me feel like I was in study hall. The sort of player who likes to annoy his opponent by thinking way too long about his turn will love this game. He will have many, many opportunities to do so! The fact that this game is rated so highly really makes me wonder about the tastes of gamers in general.

Character distribution system is absolutely great and leads to the game's overall goodness. And even though the system is a bit luck-oriented it doesn't actually bother. It is rather nice when situations like "Why, oh why isn't that character among the ones from which to choose this turn" occur. Games don't last for too long and the endgame is usually very tight. Great opportunities to beat-the-leader, but it is not straightforward. Bluffing and seeing through it are needed here. The game also looks really pleasant. In emergency situation also playable with 2 players, but I suggest not to play with 3 players. It will only end up in one player picking assassin to protect himself from the thief. Then this same player either assassinates thief or picks thief himself. German version is highly preferred with its candycoins and  higher-quality cards. I originally had FF version, but decided to get the German as an upgrade.

In reality though, this is a great group game that appears to have some strategy elements to it, if nothing more than trying to out-think what everyone else thinks you are thinking.

It can get pretty nasty if people think they are being picked on.

Played one seven player game.  It was several peoples' first time.  It took an hour and forty minutes; too long!   But it was fun anyway.  If it always takes this long to play, then that's a problem, but if experience will speed it up, then this would be great.

It's simple, but very vibrant in what you can do each turn, and what happens each turn.

Pretty good game.  Lots of really neat game concepts in here.  Lasts a little bit too long for what it is.  Still, a very enjoyable, and highly replayable, game.  Not sure why it&#039;s called &quot;Citadels&quot;...Presentation quality is terrific.

RATING: 7
Rating based on 2-player play so far. This is a light and quick 2 player game that's very fun. Shares some elements with San Juan in terms of picking a role that lets you perform actions to benefit you or hinder an opponent (however your opponent doesn't share that role, they have their own roles they've chosen for the round). There is an element of bluffing as well, which requires players to second guess their opponent(s). Good bluffing will give you an additional edge. I can't wait to play with more players. So far it ranks right up there with my other top 2 player games but can expand for more players like San Juan.

A light resource management game with role selection as the central mechanic. There's potential for mind games but in practice this mostly seemed to come down to random screwage. Possibly not my cup of tea. Might be more fun with more players.

Update: Played it with more players. While the role selection mechanic just feels very clever, the game built around it is ultimately chaotic and tedious.

You must keep this game moving at a good speed.  A few people pondering deeply over their choices, and the fun starts evaporating.  

Better games with role choice include Glory To Rome, Mission: Red Planet, and San Juan.

Glory To Rome is FANTASTIC, though more complex than Citadels.  

San Juan is excellent, the same weight as Citadels but much faster, better, and gives a more satisfying feeling of building.

Surprisingly strategic for the number of players it supports. I defy you to find another fairly strategic 7/8 player game that takes less than an hour.

Unfortunately, the pacing of the game is often broken by slow players during the role selection phase. The entire table waits while players, one at a time, slooooowly decide which role they want. With a table of avid non-APers, I'm in!

Fantastic mix of building your estate by hand management / set collection and drafting different characters to get the resources and interfere with the other players plans.

The meta-game of bluffing and double-guessing your opponents is really fun, although a few deaths in a row by the assassin can really screw over your whole game and the fun you are having with this game, quite honestly pretty "90ies" in game design :)

Very nice artwork and plastic coins. So much game with just a few cards.

Our very first game was a 3 player, and my 16 year old daughter quickly found a way to dominate by using an assassin-King strategy. Turns out that the 3 person game is broken. Did anyone play test this?  Also, there should have been player help cards with all of the characters listed.

My friends really like this game. I don't  :( 

I respect the game itself, but it has incredible down time even though the tactical decisions are marginal. 

So Citadel has the problem that you're awaiting your turn without much to think about. If I play Agricola I still can use the down time to consider my next turns or about the opponents overall strategy. But in Citadel there happens not enough for me to be hooked all the time.

Fun little card game. The game is in the role selection, and second-guessing your opponents, I think. Will probably get my own copy some time in the future.

UPDATE: Bought my own copy 090629 at Games on Ströget in Copenhagen, as a nice game to play w/Robert & Dan while on vacation. It was very well received & I have no regrets paying full "tourist-trap price" for this little gem.

(Incidentally, this is less than a week after I recommended the game to a fellow browsing the game shelves at sf-bokhandeln in Stockholm, as I though he got somewhat sub-optimal advice from the clerk. Hope it turned out as well w/his party as with us.)

Good game. The rules are easily learnt so even newbies are up to speed after a few rounds.

The character role swapping mechanic adds the strategy and creates more player interaction than you get with a lot of Euro card games.

The goal of the game is very simple - build the best "Citadel" by purchasing up to 8 District cards, which come in 5 different colors.  There are other ), but the use of the different characters and their special abilities makes it fantastic. Plus, the way that the characters are chosen is brilliant.

The only drawbacks I see are that it is a little prone to analysis paralysis during character selection (especially for new players), and that it can get pretty long with 6-7 players. Otherwise, it's one of my favorites!

Play with Citadels: The Dark City expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Citadels is a good choice for getting your "non-gamer" group to advance a step or two in game complexity. Citadels has only a few important rules to remember, includes variable role selection and hidden choices, and with the right group, will play fairly quickly. But it is susceptible to analysis paralysis - if you have one or more people in your gaming circle that spend too much time thinking about their move, this game will bog down during role selection... big time. The game needs to move along at a good clip to keep people interested and engaged.

It's a good game with just three - the double role selection actually works quite well with three players and changes the tactics of the game, but in a good way. Not a great game for just four players - seems the game is ideal around 5 or 6 players.

I loved this game a few years ago, but it has been replaced in my lineup by 7 Wonders and more recently by Witch's Brew. I like playing with the Diplomat in place of the Warlord sometimes, but would never use any of the other expansion characters. The gameplay can get repetitive and it really sucks to be the Assassin's victim (wasted turns in games really bother me). I do enjoy its portability, though, and the little gold pieces look just like butterscotch candies!

Liked this game a lot more the second time I played, like it a lot with 3 players.
I don't like how easy it is for the king to hang on to the king, I think it should rotate, idk.
I include the dark city expansion with this rating as I've never played the game without it. There are aspects of this game you cannot control, because of what other people choose as their roles, what you're left with, or because you just get unlucky. There's just no super well planned killer combos though that this game needs, imo.

Been playing this a lot in my group. Excellent game. If you like Puerto Rico you should like this. Plays faster and can be a bit more diabolical. I prefer it to PR just because I like games that move and don&#039;t bog.

Scales from 2 to 8 players better than any game I own. Even better, it plays differently. For instance, the assassin is a monster card in small games but the more people who are in the less powerful he is. The opposite goes for the thief.

It is possible to get messed with several times in a turn and have little to nothing to do for those turns do to the role mechanics and who draws what role, and if you have people that can take things personally or get frustrated by this type of thing, would not recommend it for your group.

Role Selection and Tableau building give this a similar feel to San Juan and RFTG, but I enjoy this one not because of its game mechanics, but because of the intrigue and psychology that comes with it.

Citadels is outstanding.  I've rarely played a game so well balanced.  It works equally well with a small group or a larger one and is a very different game depending on the number of players.

Nice strategic (and little bluff and deduction) game, doesn't take a ton of time and it's hard to predict what your opponent is doing. You have to, because you both choose roles which affect the round. And the next round you choose the same (or other) roles with their respective advantages. Very good game.

While there are things about Citadels that I think could really improve it and I sometimes think I'm losing interest in it, I really do like this game. But more importantly, everyone I've played it with really likes this game and asks to play it again so for that it's a big winner in my book. One of the rare games that I'd recommend to people just because I'm so confident they'll most likely like it.

Of all the games I've played, this one most makes me want to design my own game and I love that about it.

Part of me really wants to get the 2016 version as well as I love that it has new roles, but I just hate that the box is so big. That was one of the great things about the old Citadels: it was a great portable game.

Fun game! I introduced this game to my friend, he got addicted to it, so I gave him the original "crappy" deck (I kept the "better" replacement cards (^_^)) The cards have magnificient artwork. One annoying thing is having to always redistribute the character cards. And yes, it's probably a good idea to get card protectors. Some of my characters cards have white "scratches" on the edges from our fingernails...Now people can tell which card is which! I don't have the English Citadels version, but I do like the gold pieces for Ohne Furcht und Adel. I've been taking German since I was in Middle School (now HS senior w/ same German teacher!), so the German wasn't too intimidating for me. 2-players is OK and we sometimes make our own variants to the game. Print out the card references for the game! Thank God Boardgamegeek has all these download goodies.

Citadels is a very good game with 3, and decent with 2 or 4 as well. I haven't had good experiences with many players (5-7), but perhaps it is because any time you have that many NEWBS it will kill a game. I will try it again with 5-7 experienced players and see how I feel, though I still suspect that the role-selection mechanism will be a great deal more luck-driven, etc, etc.

RATING: 8
Simply ingenious. Addictive with two of my favorite game elements, variable turn order and asymmetrical abilities.

I suspect this works better for 2-3 players with doubled-up turns than it does for single turns, where it might get frustrating and less strategic. I'd even suggest 4-player games add a 9 card so they can still play doubled turns if it doesn't lead to too much decision paralysis.

The addition of the Dark City cards is clutch - for each character rank they introduce something either less confrontational or more powerful than the original set.

Suggested House Rule: The Tax Collector should make buildings cost one more gold to be built, so that if you can afford to pay him you cannot build the building.

Hmmm

It's been ages since I played this game (introduction to this hobby) and I immediately knew this wasn't a game for me.
At least not with the group I've played it with.

The lovers say there are tons of strategies available.
the other says that in the end it is just a luckfest.

And I think if you can ever favor someone pretty unseen in a game this is the one.

I don't like favoritism in games where negotiation isn't a "listed" mechanic. 

Why is there favoritism because people  are practically telling which role they took. (by using limited deduction skills and look for tells)
and in the game I played there was no real variation shown.


Maybe I have to play it more to appreciate it more since  some say it takes a while to appreciate.
I however think there are way more interesting and challenging games out there and don't feel the need to play it ever again.

RATING: 8
The game is very unique due to its role selection mechanism. It is simple to teach, simple to learn and engaging at the same time. 
The expansion brings in a lot of interesting options and lets you change the balance. With the possibility of Warlord being replaced by Diplomat and Assassin by Witch every role is rewarding now and the tension is even better. New buildings are also cool.
The weaknesses of the game are: the lack of special features for most of the buildings (other than purple) and too few scoring options. 
Otherwise the game is great. It's great for getting people together even when they don't usually play board games- it's simple, light, entertaining and there's lot of tension and interaction.

Our first, own, 'true' modern board/card game. It's a really nice game, also for 2 people - and that's what I was looking for. Nice appearance, interesting (each round you choose a different character to play) and 'customizable' (by adding/removing expansion cards) rules. 

With 2 players - quite quick but strategic, with 6 players - 60 minutes of laugh!

The more I play it, the more I like it.

One of my favorites for every occasion.

It burnt out after a while... Sad, but along with my growing collection, this game just keeps laying on the bookshelf... Anyway, it's still great when thinking about playing with some friends on holidays.

This is certainly a clever game, but I always get [i]hosed,[/i] and it's usually my fault.  Like, I'm last in line to choose a card, and I'm handed the assassin and someone else, and I choose the someone else; then the person before me, who took the thief, steals from me because I didn't go before him, so I couldn't have taken the assassin.  I mean, losing is fine, but losing because you're [i]stupid[/i] is a little embarrassing.

I'll play this, but not too often, and it's not one I suggest.  Several people in my group really like this, though, and it gets asked for more than a lot of other games!

Getting picked on repeatedly by the Warlord is no fun, especially when you can't choose the Bishop or Assassin to defend yourself.  =(

The variants for different numbers of players can make Citadels into a completely different game.  Some players may require some pressure to minimize time spent on character selection.  It's best not to play with unreasonably vindictive people.

Game idea is great, different characters with their own abilities are fantastic but THE GAME somehow is missing: trying to get eight card and then the game is over isn't good enough (that part of game is stupid). I'm always ready for the game of Citadels, but I don't really love it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.

Dark City expansion is now included with the base game

There were 2 times we wanted to play, but it went too slow both times, some people are just thinking too much trying to find out which character to choose (especially newbies) so its downtime gets quite long and after 90-120 mins the game had to be finished without reaching its end.

[2007.Oct.16] Heavily based on role selection card games like Meuterer and Verräter, Citadels is light-hearted, fun game where each player attempts to build 8 buildings, while at the same time trying to avoid the other players efforts to sabotage their progress. Beware of the Assassin, Thief, and Warlord!

Goal is simple, mechanics are simple. By picking a different role each round, it does keep things interesting. Very simple for non gamers to pick up. I don't think I'd play this over and over, but it's a nice filler game or intro game for non gamers.

RATING: 10
Probably one of my top 5 games of all time.

The characters (in the original game, not so much the expansion) are all very well-balanced and there really isn't a character that is totally useless or weak. Every character has its use, and that's what makes this game so fun. 

The best part is guessing what roles your opponents chose and counter-picking them!

A cutthroat game, and a bit on the long side for time.  It's about having the correct card of power to overtake an opponent at the right time.  The true upside to this game is that it is a fun take that game, and can play up to 8 players.  Overall, if you don't mind cutthroat action, and a bit of a longer card game, then this game is for you.

Citadels are a really good game and especially fun when you play with people you know well.

I like it best with three or four players, not more - and surely without AP-prone players.

A bit too simple for my taste, it's still good fun.  With the expansion, it supports up to 8 players which place it in a class of its own.  Additionally, even with 8, it's so simple and streamline that it moves along nicely.  Of course, when I have smaller groups (less than 5), there's a metric ton of games I'd rather play.  Even with 6, Catan and Pillars are strong contenders (although they take longer and are more involved).  But for a large group in the mood for laid back lightweight fun, this the game of choice.

I usually only like to play this without the Warlord (#7).  Yeah, demolishing buildings is fun but no Warlord makes for a more progressive/buildup game that plays to a faster conclusion.  Otherwise, it could go on and on longer than necessary.  With a large group there is significant downtime and this is a bit annoying for a simple straightforward game so perhaps fewer players is more my cup of tea...

I probably do have too much of a fascination with the assassin...:-)  Has the liklihood of playing pretty slowly with large amounts of downtime with larger groups.  Good game for 3-5.  A game with the maximum number of players would be enjoyable if everyone playing has played before, but I would not attempt that if some haven't.  After playing with new characters in the dark city expansion, I think I prefer most of the original characters.  It might be interesting to interject just a couple of the new characters in place of a couple of the older characters...maybe....Bruno's game designs generally don't fare well with my taste in games; this one I do enjoy to some degree.  This game must be played quickly to be enjoyable - it is too simple a game to be played slowly.  If played slowly, I want to poke my eye out!

Eleinte nagyon tetszett, de aztán túl gyakran lett olyan érzésem, hogy tehetetlen vagyok, mert se pénzem, se felépíthető épületkártya nincs a kezemben, ergo valószínűleg semmi "eredményeset" nem fogok tudni csinálni a körben. Lehet, hogy csak kicsit szerencsétlenebbeket játszottam párszor, és azért érzem ezt, nem tudom, de tény, hogy most kicsit visszavette a kedvemet (és a pontszámot is: 8 -> 7.3).

Update: Továbbra is szűkösnek érzem a - pénzbeli vagy épületbeli - gyarapodási lehetőséget, de ezúttal egyszer sem fordult elő, hogy ne tudtam volna építkezni. Viszont meg kell jegyeznem, hogy a 8 szerep közül 4 támadó képességű (orgyilkos, tolvaj, mágus, hadúr), ami problémát okozhat akkor, ha valamelyik játékos a szívére veszi, hogy már megint megölték/kirabolták/stb őt. Ha túl gyakran fordul elő ugyanazzal a játékossal ilyesmi, az érthetően könnyen a kedvét szegheti. Más megközelítéssel viszont pont hogy érdekesebbé teszi a játékot, hogy sikerül-e túljárni a többiek eszén, és olyan szerepet választani, amivel megússzuk a támadásokat, támadás esetén pedig eltalálnunk, hogy mely szerep is a helyes célpont - hozzáállás kérdése.

Update2: Lehet ebben pénzt és épületet is szerezni, hiába tud elfogyni a pénz és a lap a kézből. Nem éreztem túl szűkösnek az erőforrásokat, pont jó volt. 7.3 -> 7.8 pont.

Update3: 7.8 -> 8 pont, megérdemli.

Interesting game that definitely has some tough choices going on.  The mechanics are built around avoiding the runaway leader in the game, and it almost has a paper-rock-scissors feel to it. The downtime seems to be a problem with how short this one should be. Maybe with more plays players tend to increase their decision making during the first phase of each round. I don't think will be in regular rotation for me though. The player order for each role is definitely brilliantly constructed as to make those choices agonizing in the first part of each round.

It's a fun game with some psychology and light M:TG style rules-breaking special abilities. 

Killing your opponent, stealing his gold, taking his cards, blowing up his buildings and suchlike nastiness are all great additions to the building race genre.  In Citadels, you simply can't ignore what your opponent is doing and that's great.

The card art is among the best you'll find.  It's a keeper.

I like this best as either a three-player game with the  mean characters in (Assasin, Thief, Warlord) or a four-player game with some of the gentler ones cycled in (Witch, Diplomat).

I don't find two-player interesting and with five you've got to play to 7 buildings and really hurry everyone up or it drags.    Haven't played with more, don't really want to.

UPDATE:  Actually been playing this as a 2-player and liking it a lot, maybe even my favorite way to play.  You have to keep the nasty guys in and then it's a balance between racing to 8 districts and bashing your opponent to slow her down.  Fun!

Note that I only like playing this game under two conditions:  (1) use the variant where players draft 2 characters per round.  This means that player count is capped at four, which is fine.  (2) Make the choice per turn "two gold or two cards" INSTEAD of "two gold or draw two cards and discard one."  I simply like having the cards flow into the game at a faster rate.  The effect of both these changes is to make it a faster-paced game that concludes in 30 minutes or so, which to me is perfect for Citadels.

If played by original rules (one character per player, the "draw two, discard one" rule) then the rating drops sharply for me, to a 5 or maybe even a 4.  Playing with more than five people under those circumstances is something I'd positively not attempt.

Oh, and I also never play with the Architect, as I consider him an overpowered character.  When he's in the game it simply revolves too much around him and you have to use the assassin / thief every turn to stop him.

Great balance leads to super strategical flexibility. 

Choosing characters for every round make it possible to counterbalance character abilities and to adapt different strategies each round, which simply enable a player to make his or her every move perfectly intentional and reasonable, rather than just random guesses. At the same time, any specific, deliberate action is not gonna have irreversible lasting effect to the end of the game; in other words, anyone with an advantage in this round does not guarantee a same advantage two rounds later.

Un buen juego de estrategia dónde la especulación, la conspiración y la traición hacen que sumados a su sencillez, su buena factura gráfica, precio inmejorable (que además, en su tercera edición incluye la expansión del juego), rapidez, facilidad de aprendizaje y la posibilidad de que puedan jugar hasta ¡8 jugadores! permiten encontrar un hueco en la estantería de toda ludoteca que se precie.

Consejos:
1. Una buena estrategia puede ser tener de entre los 8 distritos, 2-2-2 de 3 colores distintos y los otros 2 que restan,1 de cada color de los distritos restantes. De esta manera es más difícil que otro jugador tenga claro a qué personaje tuyo va a asesinar o robar´; así tienes más posibilidades de éxito.
2. Constuir distritos de coste medio-alto (a partir de 4 ó mas monedas) dificulta la acción destructora del condotiero.
3. Ser el rey te asegura en parte poder prever las posibles estrategias de tus rivales. Ser el rey al principio de la partida puede ser muy buena idea pues hasta que a nadie se le ocurra arrebatarte ese puesto pueden pasar varias rondas.
4. Tener una mano inicial variada de distritos de bajo coste de construcción puede ser letal si se combina con el Arquitecto. Esto puede suponer una victoria relámpago.

I've played this game many times with different numbers of players. It has a place in my gaming closet, but doesn't get a lot of table time.

The expansion cards remind me a lot of the roles/buildings in San Juan oddly.

I have the FFG edition with the [gameid=13291].

Update 26 Feb 2012: I think that my days of playing Citadels are over. I spent most of the last game I played hoping it would end soon. I'm actually sorry to say that as it's a game that I've had a lot of fun with over the years. Oh well.

Update 28 May 2012: I thought maybe it would still be ok 2-player, but I think the magic is gone.

I think this is a really good game, but I don't like it much.  I've played it with 5p and 7p and I find the downtime to be too much.  I'd gladly try it again, but haven't had very positive responses from the first couple of introductions I gave of it.

I expected this to be somewhat like a "light San Juan" or some light building game. It is more intricated than I expected, not at all hard or really heavy strategy, but you need a real sense of knowing what to do in the next 1-2 turns. Your plan will always be delayed, always, no matter what. You will have to balance the expect of loss with the screwage you need, to win. 

A nice, fast-paced game that a lot of people will like, I've already tested it with 6+ of my gaming buddies (in different games) and all of them liked it in some level. One of them even got hooked with the "internet version" (I'm not sure wich one).

One thing: never, ever play it with more than 5 players. I like it with 5 players, it gets enough conflict around the table but it's still a 1-1.5 hour game, but whe you add the 6th player it will get long and boring, even when choosing characters it gets tedious and overcomplicated, after 2-3 hours of pain you will notice that someone managed to get the 8 buildings, and be grateful that he did!.

[Played mostly with: 4-5, played best with 4]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Still one of my favorite games, especially when 5 players or more, actually less then 5 isn't advised. You build your plans on assuming/guessing, and when that goes wrong so much can happen, that's the real fun ! I don't tend to win this a lot but it doesn't bother me, we always have a good time.
Not a game you should play with people who aren't really focused though then it gets ruined, we mostly start a game evening with this. Too much talk can ruin it as well, but eventually players will learn not to reveal too much by accident.

In an early visit to a now regular Thursday night boardgame session I got lost in the blizzard of cards that is San Juan (on reflection I can blame my own gaming naievety).  So when a game was brought to the table and the words cards, roles and buildings were mentioned I had already started to think of escape routes ... maybe jump through a window or fight my way out ... but with no chance for getting a run up or no sharp objects to hand I was cornered and forced to stay.  And I am glad I did.

Citadels is now one of my favourite card games, it has a theme which appeals to me, balanced gameplay, very neat mechanics, easily understood rules, a 'try and read your opponents minds' element and strategy which becomes slowly apparent but never fully reveals itself which will add to replay value.  Played with 5 players (three discarded cards - 1 face up) there is the chance to bluff by taking the architect or merchant card early.  A very enjoyable and rewarding experience.

2 criticisms that assault the walls of Citadels are that it is prone to analysis paralysis - to an extent a game is as successful as the right mix of players for it, yes there is delay but even a few simple house rules can minimalise it and healthy banter should be encouraged during downtime.  Secondly, the role of the king means that hypothetically a player can have first choice every time but this would only mean dragging behind the rest and soon becoming irrelevant to the game and a target for assasination ... the more I think about it the more I like the theme.

Played only on BSW.  Extremely random with a very heavy dose of take-that.  This is not a formula for a game I'm liable to remain interested in for long.  I'm interested in playing it a bit more, but I expect my rating will go down, not up. 

UPDATE: dropped my rating to a five.  I expect to play this about as often as I play Settlers, and for much the same reason - someone I know on BSW wants to play, and needs a warm bit-body to fill a seat.

UPDATE: I haven't played this in months, and don't miss it at all.  I don't even consider playing it when I'm on BSW.  Rating dropped to 3.

UPDATE: Yep, I'm done with Citadels. Just thinking about playing it annoys me. A 2.

A good light game best I think with about 4-5 players (role choosing isn't as dynamic with two, game drags with more). While sometimes I feel like the role-choosing is too luck based, there is plenty of subtle strategy of weighing your opponent's risks/rewards for if and who they will assassinate and steal from.

Citadels is one of those roll deduction games. Its fun trying to determine what the others will take. This is also the games downfall since EVERYONE does this. The game drags and takes longer than it should. There is a lot of downtime when its not your turn. I wouldn't turn down a chance to play it. I doubt I would hunt it down though.

This is the game I use to introduce new people to real games, and the balance between bluffing, building, and attacks is almost perfect in the base set.  I have way more plays than this, many of them consecutive and with people of diverse demographics. It's also a great bridge between seasoned gamers and newer ones, thanks to how quickly the feedback mechanism kicks in for predictable decisions.  

If only more portable games were this full-featured...

This is a great 2-player game, but quickly becomes horrible with more than 4 players. With 2 players, turns move quickly, it's mostly about building, not blocking, and even if you're hit with the assassin, you still get to play your other roles.

The only reason I don't rate this game a 9-9.5 is because my friends seem to get irritated about not wanting to think hard enough to play based on what they predict the other people will take, but not liking the fact that I can predict what other people will take by thinking and then win.  

Hanabi has a similar problem - it's the players, not the game; but you have to have players to play the game.

Edit: Fist of Dragonstones killed this one for me. Traded UK Expo MT 2014 for Mystery of the Abbey. I have zero interest to play this, but if someone insists then I might give it a go again. It is a good game, just not for me. Down to a 5.9.

In some ways, it feels like a more interactive Puerto Rico (or maybe San Juan, as they are both card games...).  There's some great take-that moments, but the game is both overly-arbitrary and overly-long.  Fun for the occasional game, but not my go to for role-selection.

Great game, got me into board gaming by showing me the potential in the hobby. Love guessing which card my opponent picked of the ones that are missing, and trying to figure out if he would single, double, or triple bluff, or just take what he needs.

Now I would rather play Libertalia or BattleCon for something more meaty (and with less downtime) with the same element of predicting each other's card choices, and Skull and Roses for something with bluffing that is faster and more consistently fun. Citadels still has a place on a game night with 4-5 players where everyone is getting tired and doesn't want the brain burning or setup of Libertalia.

Some things annoy me about the edition I have:

1) The expansion cards seem really mismatched and on a completely different power level from the base game, and the art style has less charm and doesn't match.
2) The assassin is anti-fun, and the Warlord is a waste of a turn. (These are the characters most begging to be replaced by expansion characters.)
3) The only depictions of women in the card art are negative.
4) It doesn't *really* play 2-8. Four is the sweet spot. Five players drags. Six+ is insanely long, boring, and not recommended. 2-3 forces you to have two characters, which is awful for newbies and anyone looking to relax.

I like the idea of special powers and building up a city.  I love the way suspicions of one's opponents' role selections can dictate one's own.  Situations reminiscent of the great scene in "The Princess Bride" arise.

I appreciate the game for what it tries to do and the little thrill of someone getting nailed by the Thief (especially when said Thief was aiming for you) is all well and good, but I just don't find it that much fun.

I'd rather play most other things.

For anyone who has played more complicated civ-building Euro games like Puerto Rico or dominion, this one isn't going to produce any fireworks. But the mechanics do provide some tense, difficult tactical decision making and lots of dramatic tension, and it's very quick and dead easy to teach. One thing that truly does set it apart the absolutely gorgeous, richly variegated card art, which should make it a pleasure to play for even the most highminded strategy buff.

BLUFFING. This is such a simple card game but the "role selection" mechanic involves getting into your opponents head and trying to outguess them.  Mostly you are trying to guess which opponents picked which roles, and trying to make sure they can't guess which one you are picking.  Turns can sometimes take a long time while the opponent is trying to figure all this out.  It's a mind game.

I played this once where you have different roles you can draft each round and you have information based on what is left to choose from.  There is always one role leftover. Roles are resolved in numeric order

You are trying to acquire money to build buildings.  At the end of the game, you score buildings based on their value and combination of colors and numbers built.  

It is an interesting cross between a social deduction game and a Euro.  When I played the one time there were too many players and it took forever.  Fewer players would go more quickly, however, this is one of the older games around and I think there are newer games which have replaced it.

One of my favourite games. Best played with 3 people (taking the witch), as it reduces downtime and opens for turn tactics and between-turns strategy. the problem with playing it with 6 or 7 people is the downtime, but with skilled players should be a very tense game!

RATING: 7
A great filler game with enough variation to keep me interested. With the expansion pack a lot more options and fun can be had and is probably a needed component if you like the way the game plays. Best with 4-6 players. The 3 player game is also good (playing 2 characters each turn).

Fun and brilliant IMO.  A great game to have in your collection and it scales up to 7 players.  Players are competing to build the best cities to score points and choosing the right roles each turn to help them do so.  The fun is in trying to guess what your opponents are going to choose and trying to outthink them but trying to help yourself at the same time.  With more people the role selection tends to drag the game on a bit but this the only drawback.  Great game.

This game is ranked high, gets consistently great reviews, can play as quickly as 30 minute game when playing with the 2 player variant, and it can also be picked up by an 8y/o. A definite BUY!

Amazon reviewer offered the following suggestions:

TIPS: For your enjoyment and the preservation of the product, I offer some tips: 

-Put the role cards into plastic card protectors; this will prolong the life of them as they will be shuffled and battered by the players throughout the game 

-Get more gold counters; this isn't an issue most of the time, but with more players and with certain roles a player can stock up quite a bit of gold at times (this is important when using the expansion characters); quality of the gold counters depends on the version, from cardboard to plastic pieces 

-Print or write up a card with the numbers of each role; at times, people will forget who goes next and a card like this is not provided

RATING: 5
2004 A bit too simplistic for my taste and the random card-draw element is too dominating. And there's the dreaded CCG-feeling. A so-so filler-game. (Citadels)

3/2010 Initial assessment seems too harsh after further play.  It's easy to learn and remember the order and porwers of the different role cards, and which card you select depends on availability and your current needs with regards to possible building cards.  Rating up 3 -> 5.

This is one of a few games I hated from the beginning. There are so many uncontrollable elements in this game. Every time you think you have found a way to make a good game somebody steals your cards or your money or kills you... Too frustrating for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Best with 3 so that each player gets 2 roles, though the assassin and thief are eternally pesky, and questions marks over the level of interactivity - if one player gets a decent lead, it can be beyond the other players to stop them at times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Want to play this more often, as haven't had a really good go of it yet.  Seems like it ought to be briliant, but has never quite worked.  I think the Magician spoils it, and may try different roles next time.
Update: trying other roles didn't seem to fix it. It's too hard to get more cards to build, so after you've played your initial hand, the game bogs down and becomes a dull exercise in drawing random cards and hoping they're something worth building. The game has many ways to get money, but not enough to get more cards, and a better choice of cards.

Good card game for 5-6 players where you have to guess what caracters the other are choosing and play tactically since it always tends to be a lot of bashing the leader.

Pick your role and build the best district you can. Except, everyone else is stealing your money, stabbing you in the back and blowing up your Tavern. Reading people and deciding when to build and when to save make this a great game. Resources are tight, so making decisions can be difficult. 

Can be AP-prone with certain players. Also not for the thin-skinned.

This is a game about bluffing and deduction - don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The artwork is absolutely gorgeous, and the game is simple enough to learn that anyone can play. Plays well with up to four, but after that you'll see a big spike in play time. 6-player games overstay their welcome.

I'm a bit burned out on this these days, and rarely play it anymore, but I wouldn't turn it down if someone else requested it.

The roles of the Dark City expansion are a disappointment, they are not better than the classic ones as far as game mechanics.

I'm very positive about this game after 2 plays, but I can't help but imagine some situations in which my opinion would be drastically altered.  The king-making element was rather overbearing even on my second play, for example, and the non-screwage decisions you have to make seem to be somewhat obvious once you grok the basic mechanics...so in the final analysis you're looking at a game that relies a lot on random elements (getting the right cards) and hoping you don't get screwed over.  Not the sort of game I can imagine playing a lot of, but still pretty fun with the right group in the right frame of mind.

Fun card game with gold pieces where you secretly pick a role and try to build buildings and hurt your opponents.

Finally, a well played game and second place.  I think I even saw where I could have made a move to win it in the second to last round.

Fourth game, 8 players, a win by early pricy buildings, an architect in the middle to build the ghetto, then the Bishop to protect at the end.

Admittedly, the game can bog down with a lot of players, but 2-5 is ideal. Just simple fun. We have replaced our copy with the newer reprint, though I shied away from the ugly new art in favor of the grittier traditional art. I think that the changes made to it make it better.

Beauty and suspense in a small package (at least it's rather small for the german Ohne Furcht und Adel version).

INteresting game with clever machanic, but too long for what it is. When you don't have option to win you just disconect and want to finish the game as soon as possible. So you play for finishing the game soon, with ois not my idea of a great game. Playing this increased my interest for playing "Mission Red Planet" supposely an imporved version of Citadels

A lot of time invested for little reward.  Maybe there are subtlety and different strategies, but I don't see them. Since there's no disconnect between cost, building abilities, and victory points there's no real tension. Sure, it's supposedly all in the roles, but I don't find that interesting (or fun) enough to overcome the games mechanistic vapidness.

RATING: 5
It is a weird game. The main element of this game is "danger of doing something good for me." If I take a role which can give me much of advantage, it is highly probable that I might be killed or robbed. So it is dangerous to specialize in some role. But many of powers of characters and buildings encourage specilizing. So specializing in some role is encouraged and disencoured in the same time.

Of course the guess can be incorrect. But in this case, an innocent player is hosed and frustrated with right target not being harmed.

Of course possibility of killing being killed, robbing and being robbed is the source of fun, tense, and uniqueness of this game... but still such a mechanic seems awkward. The result of it is a game which is too chaotic to play strategically, too tedious to play lightly, which can give reward to not being picked (luckily) and no reward to careful planning.

If it was half-time short, I would willingly play.

Another great FFG Silver Line Game.

Simple mechanics that are easy to teach, colorful art, nice  components, and fun.

The fun that this game provides will vary from group to group. It really depends on how vengeful people want to be with each other by destroying their buildings, stealing their gold, or swapping their cards...as all these mechanics are the ones that generate the interaction within the group. Other than some of those wrinkles (and special cards that can be played), it is a pretty straight-forward game.

Overall though it never really becomes the MOST exciting game that will come to the table. It's good, but not great and does have some flaws...those being: it can be a little quiet around the table for periods of time which is a bummer, there really is a limit to what you can do each turn and how to approach your goal, the cards are made of flimsy paper, and this game definitely plays better with more people.

But it makes a great filler game that people will enjoy. Also I have yet to make use of the included expansion cards that it came with, and I have heard that those add some spice/variety to the game.

Definitely worth owning.

As a game for 2 players only it's not very impressive, too predictable. Well, have to play it more. With 4+ players it gets a bit longer but also more interesting and funny. Good party game!

UPDATE: played it with different groups of 2-6 people, mostly non-gamers. Was it a blast! Consequently, my rating goes up from 7 to 8

This game has one major problem : Downtime.  You wait for the characters to pass around the table and arrive in your hand and once you get one, you wait forever for your turn to come just so you can put down one card in 3 seconds.  Rinse and repeat.  Good artwork but players have to be monitored and play quick.

In our opinion, this didn't work well with two. It was too easy for one of us to guess what cards the other had taken and target them with the assassin and thief, essentially taking away their entire turn. We also found the building aspect to be slightly boring. Love the idea. Just didn't love the execution.

1 play:  Hmmm.  I don't hate this game, but I'm not sure yet what the appeal precisely is.  There doesn't seem to be a huge amount of control either.  Early assassin/thief plays will largely be random and you can get stuck by no fault of your own.  Some interesting ideas, particularily how the game seems to be a creative mash of a variety of old ideas (money -> buildings -> points... but set collection helps make more money... but diversity -> more points... special power roles... bonus for being first out).  I wasn't captivated by it, but maybe future games will move my barometer upwards.

I wish I could like it more, but must downgrade it after a few plays since it seems to "drag" with too much time waiting for other players to pick roles.  Maybe we should play with a "random role" variant.

October 2005 update: I broke down and bought the "Dark City" expansion and was able to fit both it and the entire base game into the little box. 

I  might upgrade my rating if playing with a house rule of replacing hated roles (*cough* assassin) with more interesting ones.

September 2007 traded away for Dead Man's Treasure.

A great interactive card game with lots of double guessing and back stabbing.  A great game for non-gamers if you can get past the explanation and some tricky rules.  For 6 players or more, the game takes too long and kingmaking becomes a major problem.  Take out the Warlord and suddenly the game is much better.

Played 8-10 times before logging plays.

Citadels has an amazing depth:size ratio. It's small, quick, and easy to learn, but man is there a lot going on in this game -- and its absolutely packed with turn angst. It's also just plain interesting and fun.

The role selection mechanic is brilliantly executed, and there's a lot of variability without veering too far into randomness. Add in a nice metagame that develops over the course of each play, and this is one stellar card game.

The one downside is the length of play with more than about five players; seven was just agonizing.

Excelent game by Bruno Faidutti. Somehow this author finds the way to make games that age good (everytime you play it, you find new layers, strategics). It has to be played with gamers with the same experience about the game. One begginer with experienced players can make it annoying.

I like the artwork and parts of the mechanics, but overall I do not really like this game.  The assinated person loses their whole turn, and if you get assinated more than once you might as give up.  I thought that the witch (from an expansion) might be a more balanced replacement of the assassin since the person bewitched (or whatever they called it) still gets their two gold, so their turn is not a total loss.

A good blend of light gameplay with a little bit of deduction. With 7 players, yes it went slow--the warning about high player counts is true.

RATING: 9
I was going to rate it "8" but all my friends, including not usual boardgames, really like this one. I trust them too, so here's a "9" for this really enjoyable game.
Rules are simple and gameplay can be really cruel. The 10 "extra" characters allow to have a different match every time (and different flavours and strategies). Always balanced due to the "choose character" at the start of each turn. Nice graphics for the cards, but 
a) essentially, it's a card game and not a boardgame
b) cards are too thin and so can be ruined fast (protective envelopes raccomended)

Rating:

Game quality: Seemed very okay to me. There is some interesting play going on between the roles, but there's a lot of games out that do something similar so even if it stood out at one point, it feels a lot less fresh now. I need another play of this as it felt clunky for us trying to learn this and get strategy down. 6.


Would I buy this again if I was starting over: Unless something changes, this would be an easy pass for me if I was rebuilding from the ground up. 1.

Do I want to play this if asked: Yes, do to wanting to get a better feel of the game and come to an ultimate judgement on it. I don't see it after that though. 5.

Overall: 6.15.

Rating potential: Maybe some additional plays help, but I don't see this moving up a bunch. Again, it feels surpassed already.

Update: A much better second play has me rethinking this. Four plays in and I need to up this. Clearly a better game than some I have ranked higher. I think some people are starting to see some of the aspects to the strategies the game offers. I can see this being a solid game within my game group. Might never be a Top 50 game for me, but it works. Upped to 6.43 until I can get something more official.

I've played this game 8 or 9 times prior to logging games on the Geek. I've won once ( a 4-player game at KSC 2005) . The game play varies a lot with the number of players. I've played with 9 players once. The game dragged. This game plays nicely with 4-5 players. I've played variants that only play to 7 buildings. This shortens the game a little too much for my taste. I think the Assassin can make this game very cut throat and un-fun for some players. The Witch makes for a more reasonable game. I really like this game. Citadels motivated me to look for other games designed by Bruno Fadutti.

2-p on 1-27-08. Excellent game!

Second play was better, but still not something I would suggest.

Ugh. Played only once with six people and have heard that it's better with fewer. The only real choice to make is the selection of characters as the choice of buildings to build or whether to take money or not seem pretty straightforward. Seemed long and very random.

This is THE gateway drug to eurogames. Anyone can learn it, like Carcassonne, but Citadels stays fresh for much longer because of the tactical role selection. IMO, the perfect number of players is 3. You get two roles per person. Although it is a surprisingly tense 2-player game as well. Large groups slow the game down immensely. The fewer players, the more strategy.

RATING: 8
Citadels is a really fun card drafting game.  In it players are attempting to be the first to construct eight buildings in their medieval town.  Buildings have various costs and some give players benefits once constructed.  To help you in your endeavour to build, and to slow others from building, you will draft character cards.  Each character has a special ability.

Citadels can be a bit of a dirty game, as some characters will really put you on the offensive if you draft them.  You can kill, or rob other players, destroy their buildings, or exchange your crappy hand of building cards for another player's better hand.  So, if you don't like the idea of in-your-face tactics then this may not be the game for you.

I, however, recommend this game.  I tend to like most drafting games.  It's fun to see what characters you get to choose from each turn, and try to figure out who may have taken which other card.  Then see how they all affect each player as cards are revealed.  Good fun!

RATING: 7.5
Good.
1. FUN for big group. Lots of laughter at the table.^^
2. Nice guessing, bluffing, "racing". I find racing as one of the strategy to win over players who tend to build high gold districts. I race to finish the game, trying to get all colors if possible for bonus.

Bad
1. Waiting for players to choose role. The downtime can become quite significant.

RATING: 6
Bluffing card game where you select different carachters for expanding your city using the best buildings available. In my opinion, the game is only interesting for 2-3 players, when you have the option to select two carachters each turn. As soon as you put more players in the game, it became tedious, previsible and scripted.

Ordered this after playing Puerto Rico, whose role mechanism I liked but was otherwise unenthused. Had to laugh when I found Citadels predated PR! And it's pretty much everything I'd hoped for: fast thematic role selection with nice components and a near-zero set-up time. Works well with two. I note it is called "Machiavelli" in some other countries - a much better name. It feels more like you're buying up parts of a city through nefarious means as head of an influential family than building your own city. Our friends went and bought a copy the day after introducing it to them; I think they were impressed with my "You. Bitch." when my wife magician-ed away my brilliant dealt hand for a 3-card hand of dross (she then assassinated the magician to stop anyone retrieving "my" cards).
I can't see me ever turning down a game. Quick and gripping.

Finally got around to playing this game with more than 2 people, and it was great fun.  I enjoyed it with 4 and with 5, and the strategies seemed to change quite a bit depending on who we were playing with and how many of us there were.  The "take that" elements might not be good fit for some groups, but with the right people this seems like lots of fun.

Besides the flimsy cards, this game is awesome.  I love the psychological aspect of it.  But it can take a long time with more players.  I still need to try the expansion characters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Deduction and city building.  Every round each player will select a role from those left available, which give special powers to activate in addition to collecting income and building their city.

Can be a bit nasty for new players as those with experience have a clear advantage.  A good game in the right circumstances.

Biggest complaint is that it tends to outstay its welcome.  Towards the endgame, it can become a bit of a grind where there is a clear leader.  While it is initially fun to try and catch what they are doing and counter it, once their winning position becomes obvious I find the game can drag. 

I also dislike the downtime during the role selection phase - easy to get drawn into analysis paralysis as it is difficult to plan one's move in advance.  I think the designer resolved this issue in his later game Mascarade, which shares common elements with this game but is much more streamlined.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun deduction elements, though prone to analysis-paralysis. Heavily focused on role selection, resource management and hand management. Tends to overstay its welcome. Being stabbed three turns in a row by the assassin can lead to a very frustrating experience.

Game has gotten better with a few more plays.  It helps that we have a few people that know how the game works now and it's great.  Not ready to bump it up to a nine yet, but close...

One of the best games i have played and for a low cost.  One of the only games I feel has mastered the mind game element with other players.

Good: 
This game provides information through limited roles, gold, and buildings to allow you to tactically guess what your opponents will be trying to do. Armed with this information you can attempt to make selections to counter them while benefiting from your role selection. Hands down one of the best "people reading" games I have run across. 

Excellent quality components all around. 

Fantastic artwork. 

Bad: 
If players can't get am accurate read on other player's actions they can be pretty much road blocked, which can be frustrating. 

This game is extremely take-that in nature so only play with even tempered friends. 

I really enjoy this game, but there are a few in my group that really dislike the take-that nature so it doesn't get played as much as I would like.

it's a good game in that you can play with a lot of people without adding a ton of time to the game. But I'm not a fan of games where the bulk of what you do is guess what someone else is doing. Still, the cards a nice, compact play, good theme. Just not my thing.

I like the mechanic of this game. Hidden identities. You cannot target a specific player because you `name`the character rather than naming the player himself. Strategic- you have to choose your character well. Like the fact that you can play with only 2 players or up to 8. Easy to learn!

One of my fav's. This game will not be turned down by anyone who has played it. Lots of bluffing ("I should take the architect, but instead I'll take the king... hehehe"), deduction ("If I am the thief, I need to steal from my neighbor who I suspect will be the bishop"), and luck ("I thought for sure the assassin was gonna kill me... whew!"). Every game is different, and those practicing thier poker faces will love this one as they attempt to "read" other's faces without being read themselves. Can't say enough good things about this game! Get it while you can! (Oh, and don't forget to put character cards in sleeves, they wear down fast if you don't).

Played 11 times.
Last play May 29, 2009

This is a very fun yet simple game.  I have played it with 2, 3, 4 and 6 players, and while different at each number it was still a fun game.  This game gets extra cudos because it is so versital to the number of people that can play it.  With 2 and 3 players the game is much more stategic and a lot more thought and coordination need to go into choosing your roles.  With 4  players the game is a little more random and has more luck in it.

It has been so long since this made it to the table I had forgeten how much I enjoyed it.

One of my two favorite card games. I prefer it with less players; perhaps chaos just isn't my thing. I like planning and the character selection. Luckily this one seems more engaging to people then bean farming, so it gets played more. New version with expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game makes you feel like you should be planning something big only to be completely messed up by the other gamers. With it being my first game, I couldn't get a handle on how to pick roles or second-guess the other players. It seems like a complete screwage, luck fest masquerading as a serious building game. I love chaotic games, but when they hide behind a dry, AP inducing, slow paced facade... I don't know, just not so enjoyable. The drafting is boring, role selection limited, and play is mundane. However, I will re-rate after another play through.

The role selection takes way too long, and the amount of info available to make those decisions is too small to be an interesting bluffing game, but that makes the selection of thief and assassin targets too chaotic, especially since they make you lose a turn (or effectively lose a turn's worth of work).

Fun game.  Plays much differently between 2/3 players and 4-7 players.  Both are fun, although downtime increases with more players.  The turn to turn planning and anticipation can be nail-biting.  As a 2-player, I'd give it a "9" rating.  With more than 4, it drops down quickly to a 6 or so.

First Impression: Very fun as a 2 player game. Easy to learn, a lot of variable strategy and a seemingly low index of repetition in future games. My girlfriend and I greatly enjoyed our first two games, and found the character selection aspect to be an interesting dynamic that injects a lot of variety into the game play. 

NB: Much of the criticism of the game seems to be that it's slow with a large number of people, and many of these critics (here on BGG) seem to have been judging based on first play through where no one knew the special character traits by heart and had to spend a lot of time reading descriptions, therefor slowing the game significantly. This should dissolve after a few playthroughs, and we finished our second 2 player game in about 25 minutes.

However, I have played this many more times than I have logged here, and while I'm burned out on it now I really enjoyed my first 25-ish plays.  This game was good value for the money.

I'm going to go against the grain and say that it's best with 2.  It's okay with 3, and it drags on interminably with 4+.

Very fun card game where every round you secretly choose a new role. Simple to play but there's a good deal of strategy. A big part of this game is playing your opponents instead of just playing the cards. 2 player is quick and fun but this game really shines with 4-5 people. Any more than that and it would be a bit boring with long waits between turns.

We often play this game when a lot of people are around, and will sometimes play it when we have a limited amount of time. I enjoy it quite a bit as a filler game.

The Merchant is flawed though, and sometimes the Thief and Assassin can unintentionally take a player out of the game early. 

Recently played with The Witch instead of The Assassin and The Diplomat instead of The Warlord. I feel like the Witch in particular was a massive improvement to the game.

Citadels was my first real hook into board gaming proper many, many years ago.  The game was unlike anything I had played up to that point with an blend of personal strategy and player interaction via deduction.  I took several years, however to figure out why the game remained so unique, and it mainly occurs in the way the game presents itself as one thing (a lite city/tableau builder) but then hits you with a core strategy (anticipation/deduction) that just so happens to be one that otherwise might not be palatable to most gamers, but nevertheless is always a hit.  For every instance of my game group turning up their nose at a deduction game, there is an equal number of Citadels games that have been greatly enjoyed.  Can get overly long with many players or an overly social group due to downtime.

Nice and quick deduction, hidden-information and deception card game loosely themed on a fantasy city where the players draft potentate roles to gain resources to build structures in a race to first reach seven buildings and the most points. The roles allow for different ways of shifting the turn order, activating and obtaining certain resources, protecting some buildings, or attacking the opponents outright. Short down times, little randomness nd high degree of player interaction, this is a nice little game.

Au début de chaque tour de jeu, chaque participant va choisir d'interpréter pour le tour un personnage doté de capacités particulières. Ainsi l'Assassin va assassiner, le Condottiere attaquer et détruire un quartier, l'Évêque puiser dans les troncs, le Magicien faire des tours avec ses cartes (et celles des autres), etc. Une fois son rôle choisi, le joueur qui interprète le Roi fait jouer les joueurs dans l'ordre de préséance. Chacun pourra soit gagner de l'argent, soit en dépenser pour construire un quartier de sa ville et utiliser son pouvoir spécial. Chaque carte de quartier possède un coût de construction et une couleur (les quartiers marchands en vert, les militaires en rouge, ...). Le joueur qui pose son huitième quartier le premier déclenche la fin de la partie. Les points sont fonctions du coût de construction et il existe des bonus pour les villes qui possèdent tous les types de quartier, pour le premier à avoir posé son huitième quartier, et ceux qui ont réussi à en poser un huitième avant la fin du dernier tour.

RATING: 6.5
Nice little game. Fairly easy to explain. Works good with more people too. Easy to take along too, so makes for a good holiday/bar game.

It's one of those games that I rarely mention when somebody asks me what to play, but I usually still enjoy it when I play it. I like it better with 2 to 4 players than with more, I think the interactivity and tactical options are higher that way.

Rating used to be higher, have played this quite a bit since it came out. And it's usually suggested by someone who doesn't play much, so their turns take way too long. So when I play it I get a bit bored by other players spending too much time on their turn. Which tends to lead to too much tabletalk, so the game takes even longer...

This game is great fun when played in 45 minutes. Last 2 plays lasted 90 and 160. Not much fun that way.

NL: Tactisch/strategisch rollenkiesspel waarbij je als eerste 8 zo duur mogelijke gebouwen wilt bouwen in 5 kleuren. Doordat elke rol een ander foefje heeft moet je erg je tegenstanders in de gaten houden, anders wordt je snel vermoord door de moordenaar, of bestolen door de dief.

I certainly enjoyed playing this game the first few times, primarily since the role selection presents an entirely new game mechanic that I've not experienced before.  There's so much double-think going on and seemingly lots of strategy in just a few simple role cards.  Granted, I have no idea what the strategy is, and I was a little frustrated that nothing really clicked during the first few games.  However, I'm definitely excited to play this one again in the near future (especially with more players).

One of my first game purchases, and one that I still enjoy, but I don't feel the need to return to it very often.  There's not much to the game besides the role selection, which I admit is fun, but there's other games in my collection that I like better for that.  The rest of the game is simple.

This game has worn out its welcome a bit for me by virtue of being played a lot.

After playing with 4 players, I increased my rating. The game is not so good with too many players due to too much downtown and the very high possibility that you miss 1 or 2 full turns in a row! However, with 4 (and maybe 5 players) the game moves along at a good pace and is a great bluffing game. There is actually some strategy for such an easy game to learn. If your group is 6 or more, I'd recommend Bang! instead.

RATING: 4
Very interesting core concept. The once around draft of role cards, and then the sequential action phase where each role does its "thing" plus the always available option of building / drawing / taking gold.

Very simple mechanically, but puts forth some interesting questions during play, mainly in terms of risk - reward. Some roles really punish players going for the obvious choice, so you really have to try and read your fellow players.

However, it manages to take a bit too long when not playing with four or less, so stick to that. Also, it has a bit of a run-away issue, you can quickly be out of contention through little fault of your own, simply by being collateral damage to a missed guess by the thief or assassin, perhaps not just once but twice in a row, then you will not be the one winning.  Alleviated some in a three-player game, not so sure with four, but maybe then as well, but more than that ...

Ultimately, I'd rather play something else most of the time, but I found this very interesting, and it certainly has a lot of schadenfreude - which I find fun in games, and this one has it in spades.

A decent / good game!

RATING: 6.5
Game in a Nutshell:  A simple city(citadel)-building card game made interactive by a character selection mechanic that allows players to mess with each other.

Played as: 2,4,5,6,7 player

Played with: 2,4,5,7 player Base-game only, 4,6 with parts of the expansion.

Pros:  The character selection really does wonders in filling out in a simple way what is otherwise an extremely basic game.  The hidden nature of it makes for some good times trying to read what others might select in order to steal their gold, abilities, or just plan foil their plans. Seems that new players can pick up on the mechanics after a few rounds and really enjoy it by the end of the game. Nice small form factor and a good price. With the inclusion of the expansion, there’s enough in one box to vary things up when it feels like it might be growing stale.

Cons:  Down-time can be a problem.  This is especially true with just a couple individuals who are either slow or easily distracted.  The other thing that can bring the game down is if you happen to, by accident or not, become the game’s whipping boy.  Usually the players who enjoy the game the least are the ones who get stolen from or assassinated the most.  Veterans of the game could probably take it with a grain of salt, but if it’s their first play... well, don’t expect them to want to play again immediately.  Finally, the character selection rules for two players, out of the box, can be serviceable, but probably not worth it if you have any other half decent options.

Other:  One thing this game lacks is something to keep players actively involved when it isn’t their turn. Usually that’s a deal killer for a game that supports this many players but for some reason it doesn’t bother me as much here. Maybe that’s because I’ve enjoyed the people I’ve played with and the light conversation in between. Or maybe it’s the mind-game aspect that leaves things open for some good old-fashioned, get in your head, trash-talking?  I’ve just started playing around with the expansion after 10 or so plays without.  The witch (replacing the assassin) has been the best change, due to evening things out for both the role player and victim, and one I doubt I’ll change back going forward.  

Best Use:  The game is good at 4-5 players, but so are a bunch of others.  Not as many games are good with 6-7, so that’s likely when I’ll bring this out.

Quite a nice game, if and only if the expansion is added. I play this game only with 3 players, and perhaps will with 4; any more and this simple ditty devolves into an endless mess of I-think-that-you-think nonsense (2 hrs not uncommon), where random factors decide whether you get your money, your turn, or basically your resources for the game.
Also, I play without the Assasin, Thief, and Soldier - the first two inject either randomness, or have predictable targets; the latter only lengthens the game beyond its welcome. Instead some of the Dark City characters should be used, making the expansion essential.

Es un gran juego. Pequeño, pero con enjundia. No se puede considerar totalmente un filler porque muy corto no es. Mejora con más jugadores y la mecánica de roles ocultos da momentos de cierto humor.

A casual, slightly cut-throat game that could be forgiven if the city-building mechanics weren't so dull, and the overall pace of the game weren't so tediously slow.  Although aimed at large numbers of players, this suffers significantly from only one player doing anything at a time, while being luck-based enough to remove any serious strategic interest.  There are several other games I would always prefer to play (e.g. Coup).

The key to Citadels seems to be that those characters which deal damage deal damaged to other characters, rather than directly to other players.

I greatly appreciate Citadels particularly in contrast to card drafting games such as Hero Realms, having drifted solemnly through many a game of the latter where players have chosen to inflict all their damage on the most outspoken player (which is never me, incidentally).

Nice game but sometimes too long (mostly due to the phase of selection of the characters) for the fun it can offer. We found the Assassin unbalanced for a two players game so we replace it with the Witch from the expansion The Dark City.

Love it on account of it being able to accommodate up to 8 people (no other game is that involving). It's full of opportunities to scheme and plot, and you never know what's going to happen!

A good game for teaching someone the mechanic of role-choosing, without getting bogged down in a more complex game.  It unfortunately has a tendency for the leader to just keep on winning, which reduces my enjoyment of it a bit.  But it's fairly light, doesn't take too long, opens people up to a different type of game, and can be picked up pretty cheaply with the Dark City Expansion included.

RATING: 5.5
Great when playing two players - really fast (usually < 15 minutes) and alot of bluffing and reverse psychology (the end game is particularly fun). 

The standard rules for three players are poor since they give too much power to the assassin (he has 100% chance of hitting someone if you take him in the first round in three player). http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/44757 has a proposal to resolve this. 

Recommended for 2 player - try before you buy for 3  (particularly for 5  since the game can drag on).

For 4 or more players, I'd go with https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129622/love-letter or https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/139030/mascarade instead.

My wife had gotten this game out at college before were were married and before I found boardgamegeek. I was surprised when I saw people recommending it, so I decided to pull it out. It is a fun game of light deduction/bluffing and feels best with 4-6 people.

Haven't played enough to use the additional character cards. Would like to try them.

Update: This is one that I would probably like to play more, but no one seems to want to try it. I personally think that the small box makes it seem less than it really is. Maybe that is just in my head, but I would like to see this come out more.

Very scalable card-based game.  Plays slowly with more players (6-7) as each person has only one turn (plus ability to screw over one other person).  Game has interesting balance mechanics for 2/3 people, making it a slightly different type of play (quite a bit faster, for example).  After repeated plays, the best feature is trying to out-guess what others are choosing!!

Very fun to play and easy to learn rules. The only downside is that the overall experience depends heavily on the gaming group. Newbies can win eventually, without even knowing what they are doing. Maybe a downside for me. In fact, the game only really works with  2, 4 or 5. More than that, its too much time for complete chaos.

Packs a big punch for something in so small a box. Can go a bit slow with too many players (particularly if they're new to the game), and is infuriating if your chosen role gets assassinated a couple of times in a row, but that also gives it real tension.

Already a classic. Works really smoothly and is a breeze to play. A bit too light for my liking. The character drafting and limited information flow from this make it interesting to guess roles.

RATING: 6
Not a lot to the game which is basically a primarily a tactical guessing game with a strong potential for screwage.  There is some deduction and room for some skillful use of the roles though with timing being critical.  When the game moves at a good clip, I enjoy Citadels, but it is also a game that I can begin to disklike if the pace of the game starts to bog down...

Don't do this to your game group, keep the pace of the game fast and light (limit to 4-5p) and fun can be had by all.  Maybe).

Decent artwork, and I particularly like the 2010 FFG Silverline edition of Citadels with the plastic gold coins, wood King marker, compact size and reasonable price.

Overall, a decent filler game, so long as player number are kept reasonable and players don't overanalyze what should be a fast moving and light game.

Went over well with a large group.  Will have to try some of the newer cards to replace the Assassin, Thief & Architect.  I find the Architect is much too powerful and the Assassin & Thief become pretty pointless when the number of players is large.  Burned out on 2 player in a day's playings.  Turns out my family and friends hate boardgames so this was one of my collection's many casualties.

Very mixed feelings on this. On the one hand, I love the psychological aspect of guessing the roles other people choose and basing your own choice on both what you need and what you suspect others will do to you.

If other players have you in their sights, take an unexpected role so they can't target you. If they have a role in their sights, don't take it! But you need one of those? Well go ahead, because surely the others know you would never be so foolish as to take the obvious choice, right?

On the other hand, it plays so slow. All action is deadlocked on the currently drafting player, so any AP is intensely felt. If played with a group you are happy to shoot the breeze with during the draft (think "sewing circle") then it will be fun.

Pretty good, fast-paced game. Has potential, but nothing terribly exciting. Downgraded after second play. The screwage factor is way too high for my taste.

Love it, but came to the conclusion that it is not a good 2 player game: the assassin becomes too important, what narrows down the different options you have per round. And killing and stealing are 50/50 guess games, when both players know the game and opponent well enough.

With more than 2 it is still superb!

And who cares I have enough other good games for two.

RATING: N/A
A game I’ve owned for years but only ever played a couple times. The theme of Citadels is slightly reminiscent of Dominion, as players attempt to earn cash to purchase buildings of various point values for their town, but the gameplay is very different. Players play buildings into their city from their hand by paying the amount of cash indicated, usually between 1-6 gold. They may draw new building cards from the deck on their turn, or collect more gold from the bank. Some buildings give added benefits, such as letting you earn even more gold on your turn. But the real hook of the game is the character cards. Each round, the players shuffle the 8 character cards, discard one face down, and then take turns examining the remaining cards and selecting a character to play as for that round. (A game usually last around 10 rounds or so.) Each character grants that player a special power. Some powers are straightforward; the King always goes first and collects 1 extra gold for each yellow building in his city, (each building card is designated one of five different colors,) while others are malicious; the Assassin chooses another character to kill, causing them to lose their turn. The trick is that players choose their character from the remaining character cards that are handed to them from the right, always starting with the current King, (if another player chooses the King, she will pick first on the next round,) so they never know for sure who the other players are until the round begins, and even less so if they are seated several seats from the King. Really getting inside your opponents heads, trying to guess who they’d choose, and how to either attack them or defend yourself from them, based on just GUESSES, is the real meat of the game. As you can imagine, also knowing well what each character’s abilities are and how they tend to interact with each other gives you a leg up in this game. If you are all basically new to the game, it is still a fair play, but the high advantage given to experienced players is what has soured me to this game in the past.

Draft and play district and character cards to improve your city for most points.

Plays: More than a dozen?
Type: VP race = a game where you race to collect victory points (fastest/most).
Complexity: Light.
# of players: 4-5.
Playing time: 15 mins per player.
Player interaction: Competition for unlimited resources – districts. Conflict and targeting – some character cards hurt other players directly and some target one specific player.
Randomness: Low – card draw.

Replayability: Not so high, once in a while is enough.
Fun: Building the city is just a VP race and not so fun. On the other hand, character drafting involves targeted take-that cards, which are devious fun.
Memorability: This creates some stories. You’ll remember being repeatedly assassinated, f.ex. And probably remind the assassin about it all game day.

Thematic integration: Decent.
Components: Good.

Who will like this: Gamers that want another strategy game. This is often second best.

This game quickly became a favorite of mine after I bought it. Easy rules but the game makes you think. I've played this game with both inexperienced players and hardcore gamers and it played great with both. Best as a 4 or 5 player game.

Great game of deduction.  Pretty much everyone I've introduced this to, gamer or non-gamer, loves it.  Revitalized my love of board games.

Awesome with 2-3 players due to the 2 roles.  Adds more strategy to the game.  

With 4+ players, the game suffers incredibly and the downtime is ridiculous (Rating = 5).

Bought for 20 from FLGS.

RATING: 6
I like this light, quick game for parties or small get togethers.  It scales well for a wide range of players and easy enough to explain/learn that new players can grasp some sound strategies within a few rounds of play.

If a person plays a random role every time, then interacting with that player is much more difficult as several of the mechanics require other players to guess which role they will choose.  It protects the player a bit from having gold stolen or being assassinated, however it also forces them from making sub-optimal picks thereby costing them gold and/or other resources.  I've found that when a player does this, they probably won't win and they will make the less fun for the other players overall.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excellent gateway game, a little too chaotic for deep strategy, but great fun with 4-6 players.  The middle third of the game is usually the most fun.  By the end you've usually worked out who's going to win--or as in Catan if EVERYONE jumps on the leader then second place will jump in for the victory--but generally it won't go on long enough thereafter to drag.

Suprisingly good for it's cost/size. I like that it's small, and that it fits in a bag pretty well. It seems to scale well no matter the number of players. It plays pretty quickly, and with the expansion included can vary each time you play. It's not our favorite game, but at around $14 it's well worth the price and the fun you'll have. Especially as you groan when the assasin kills you off.

Upgraded to an 8. 5 years later, I'm still usually open to playing a game.

Great idea, but doesn't really feel like a game, more like a chore, because it always seems to take forever to play, and the actual "game" aside from secret-role selection is super basic.  I don't mind it 2 or 3 player though- actually creates some interesting choices having to pick multiple roles, and doesn't completely destroy your game if you ever get assassinated.

Az egyik legjobb party játék. Szabályzata kicsit komplexebb, mint egy "hagyományos" party játéknak, de az élvezeti értékén sokat dob, hogy nem csak a karakterkártyákon, hanem az épületeken is fókusz van (és meglepő módon kell benne gondolkodni is, folyamatosan). Jól összerakták, minden tekintetben.

A dobozba pakolt plusz kiegészítő olyan nagyon sokat nem ad hozzá, egy-két karakter azért jól használható és színesíti az alapjátékot.

Kártyavédőzni kötelező, mert elég gyorsan kopik és pont az lenne a lényeg ugye, hogy ne tudjuk meg idő előtt, hogy ki-kicsoda.

Ja, és figyeljünk nagyon, nehogy véletlenül valaki bekapja a bogyókat. Túlságosan úgy néznek ki, mint valami cukorka. :0)

RATING: 6
Good game for approx five players seeking a fun/drunken gaming experience.  In my experience, playing with more than five players has the potential to produce a long drawn out experience.  Perhaps fixable by reducing the number of cities built which triggers the endgame situation (or some variant like that).  Fantasy theme, bluffing, deduction, theft, murder, merchantry.  It is all in Citadels

Citadels is one of my favorites. It works well with 2, better with 4+. I'd like to play this more than I do.

Citadels was one of my first hobby games and I loved it. Upon revisiting it after a long time away, I'm much less impressed. I do still like the role selection a lot, the psychology and cat-and-mouse aspect of it is great. The remaining card play (get coins and put out buildings) feels bland in comparison.

A game of bluffing and city building. Works, but not very exciting. Really dull, actually. Must play to seven districts only. When it comes to building cities with cards, San Juan is just so much better. I used to love this game back in 2002 or so.

Indifferent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The cat-and-mouse of character selection is tense and fun, the best part of the game. I've most enjoyed playing with just two or three (because each player gets to select two characters); it's a little too long with four, even with seven buildings as goal. There are some decent solo versions available here at the BGG. [15 plays]

Multi-player plays best with 6-7 players.  Good bluffing element and short duration makes this a pseudo-party game.  Too few players lose some of the redeeming qualities of this one.  Bad luck could see a particular player sit out a few consecutive turns - deadly to a person's interest in this (and possibly other) games.  The two-player version plays differently, and is surprisingly fun for a variant of a multi-player game.

I tried this game years ago and not got very far. Admittedly it was with a group that were more interested in socialising than gaming (and there's nothing wrong with that) where no-one had read the rules and no-one really wanted to take charge of explaining and running the game and it all petered out as interest waned. As such, I was a bit wary when my regular lunch-time gaming partner suggested that we try it; he'd recently picked it up with a gift certificate and was keen to give it a crack.

Anyway, memories of it all being a bit crap (I remember being on the wrong end of the assassin's dagger most turns) were put aside and we played a two-player game of Citadels.

I was pleasantly surprised by how the two player game worked. Quite an elegant design and role choosing mechanism where bluffs and counter-bluffs are vital to fox your opponent and get your Citadel built.

We just used the basic set of cards, but with a few more games under our belts we'll try the advanced/expansion cards and see how it works for us.

Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot more than I expected (perhaps proving my memory isn't what it used to be) and look forward to trying this one again soon and regularly. The lesson that it may be wise to give a game that didn’t impress at first another chance has not been lost on me*.



* Except for RoboRally and Power Grid, I have no desire to ever try either of those two games again.

Unexpected, Citadels wins high praise from my friends, who are all non-gamers. Some love the light strategy and some just want to try their luck. Do you know what she would do when someone targeted at her? Just pick one randomly and leave her fate to the God. Do you know why she killed No.3? Because it's her lucky number. No strategy, but still fun.

I've only ever played this 2-player. (UPDATE: I've now, unfortunately, played it with more than two.) I've heard it's about getting inside somebody's head. Except... it isn't, not really. It only seems that way. Because if both you and your opponent are second-guessing each other ad infinitum on which of two cards the other just selected (since when you get passed the role cards, you can easily keep track of which two are missing), it really comes down to chance in terms of role selection. So for me, the bluffing aspect really falls flat. And without it, the rest of the game isn't too interesting.

I enjoyed Citadels with my group because it is so darn funny to play the Assassin and Thief on each other.  Unfortunately, those two cards also destroy the game for me- it's too easy to be taken out early on in the game and never able to get back in.  That makes for a really bad experience and it's pretty much turned me off on this one.

If this one was a lot shorter, I might forgive the flaws, but it can be a miserable hour if you've been slammed early.

Upped my rating after successfully playing this game with co-workers.  The key is to keep the game moving and not let the character selection take too long.  At first I was worried that 6 or 7 players would slow the game down too much but we find it to be even more exciting than with fewer players.  Having the right type of players also helps.  Not recommended for young players who might pout if assasinated or robbed.

Great strategy, good with varying size groups.  This is the game that most people think they won't like but end up getting hooked on.  Probably the biggest hit in a varied group.

Leapin' lizards!  I owned this game for two years and finally broke it out.  My friends just about went berzerk.  I pulled 2 wins from 3 games, and they were all nailbiters.  The only reason it's not a 10 is that I want to see how it plays with different groups and how well it ages.

UPDATE:  Down a half point.  It simply needs to be played with the right group at the right time. It can fall flat otherwise.

RATING: 5
Occassionally fun, but the nature of the roles is such that almost everyone will be annoyed during the game at some point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A chaotic but fun game of guessing and second guessing other player's drafting selections. Probably not a game to be taken too seriously and players shouldn't spend too long agonising over their role choices as this will kill the pace of the drafting mechanism and hence the whole game. A good game for large groups or a family. It really is a chaotic 
game and not for those gamers who like to plan their moves. Reasonably good gateway game due to the simple rules but AP newbie analysis paralysis and the resulting downtime may kill it for some.

Update: Finding that although this game has a clever mechanism its problem is that although it is capable of accommodating large groups it drags on FAR too long when played by a large (ie >5) group. Most games I've played with have been with 6+ players and they all ran for 90+ min, with most of it being downtime. For a more strategic game with intervening player actions this would be OK but for what is really a medium-weight filler the downtime blows out to make a dull experience. Also, an early poor start (eg being assassinated, bewitched, getting stuck with a weak role is very difficult, etc) is difficult to recover from, quickly creating a runaway leader and making the game seem to last even longer for those in such situations. I now dread playing it with a group size of >5. Rating 7.5 with 6 or less, 5 with more than 6

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Loved by many, Citadels uses a role system , whereby every player takes a role with its own benefit and passes the remainder on. Building different structures is the key and various points are scored for owning multiple colours etc. I think much of its popularity boils down to the role mechanism and the fact it can accommodate a large number. I like it but am not infatuated.

This game feels a bit outdated by now, maybe? Well, it's my own fault playing it for the first time only now in 2015. 

It's not a bad game and I'm sure I could have at least some fun with it, but it feels too long & has down-time issues with 5-7 players and with fewer players the role powers don't work so well. The roles also seem to be the only interesting thing in the game, the buildings are just boring. There also seemed to be some runaway problems, since the roles are hidden. Some roles feel more important than others, which made at least the game I played a bit monotonic. 

I've heard the expansion balances the roles out a bit and adds some more flavour to the buildings, but it probably isn't enough.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very interesting game and exciting mechanic. But I have discouraged of the fact, that players builds their cities on their own. There is much interaction during Choose Characters step and during use power of SOME (but not all) characters, and lack interaction during [rather lasting] players' turns. Should be plaied with right company (players that do not such drag their feet).
P.S. Replyability is very high. Rules is simple. There is no much text on cards, so I can play it with players who don't understand English.
Самая универсальная игра! Хорошо играется любым составом (2-8). Скучнее всего играть вчетвером (хотя это лечится хоумрулом, по которому игра вчетвером идёт с 9-ю персонажами по правилам игры втроём).

I enjoy the mechanics of the role selection and trying to psych out the other players, but trying to juggle both that and keeping a steady pace of building going never seems to work well for me, so I don't enjoy this one as much as some other games.

Having read cfarrell's comments on it in his "overrated games" list, I think part of this is what he says about the game pulling in two different directions: the strategic, where you want to build up a strong position in order to win, and the tactical, where various roles make doing so next to impossible.

This is an awesome game.  The mechanic is so simple, yet the strategy is complex.

This game is great. It's fun being able to change your character because it can also change the game in a negative or positive way for you. You really need to keep a handle on your districts and cities. In my opinion, it's better to play with less people because it is more exciting and unpredictable. If you play with too many people you know that every character is selected and there isn't much mystery. I would play this game in a second if someone asked...it's awesome.

Very fun game.  Very cutthroat, and quite tense.  The role choosing is a great mechanic and often leads to circular thinking (think the chalice with poison scene in The Princess Bride and you know what I mean), which is deliciously mind warping...  If I choose the thief he'll choose the assassin, but then he might kill the thief, so if I take the assassin I should kill the king, but what then if the thief takes my money...  Great stuff!

I can see why people like this game, but I really feel like it's obsolete at this point. The hidden role selection is done better in both Libertalia and Mission Red Planet, and the building of structures using resources in a tableau-like way has been done in countless other games. That being said, aside from the assassin, this is perhaps Faidutti's least chaotic design. Because of that, I do think this is one of his better games. It's just a little too bare bones for me at this point. If there were more roles and more of the buildings had special abilities associated with them, this would get a much higher rating from me.

Initial rating: 9. Just awesome cards (9 because i don't like all the medieval stuff), i've immediately put them into sleeves. Artwork is awesome, colors are bright, backs of cards are also OK. Plastic "gold" is also awesome.

Rating after 2 PvP plays with my GF: 9.
Even though games were close, PvP card draft is what i like a lot. We scored 1:1 and i enjoyed playing most of the characters:

1) Assasin: Had cool assasination of Bishop whilst my GF had 3 blue districts
2) Thief: When i declared that King will be robbed, all the money was spent with Magician, so no luck for me:)
3) Magician: I used this card only once when running low on cards, swapped 2 for 5 cards. My GF also exchanged cards with deck, which i found very interesting technique to find cool districts
4) King: Two games I was a player with a crown (mostly) with no gold districts - so I didn't choose King.
My GF had 3 blue and 2 gold districts, and last two cards I passed to her were Bishop and King. I murdered Bishop, and she scored 2 gold. Nicely done.
5) Bishop: he is awesome if you have blue districts or you are about to play last round - so warlord won't be able to kill your district. That's how i won first game.
6) Merchant is best from colorful characters. Green districts happened to me all the time so having 3 gold and probably more from districts was awesome. Best move in first game was to get Merchant and Architector - 2 initial gold + 3 gold from Merchan't action + 3 gold from districts payed off - with Architect i've built 3 more districts with 10 gold. Uber round.
7) Architector is an awesome card to play. Not just you build 3 districts (more than enough if you aren't going to build a lot of cheap ones), but also draw 2 cards. Awesome that you don't only have Magician and primary action to draw cards.
8) Warlord: didn't pick any time. My GF tried once, but i had bishop.

Didn't touch any Dark City expansion cards yet.

RATING: 8
Brilliant game, one of my favorites. It's so simple yet deep and the bluffing on the character selection is amazing.

The only down side about this games is the cards wear very quickly, we only played it 3-4 times and there was marks on the cards (we are very careful and never had problems with other games). If a character card gets marked it can really spoil the game so would recommend to sleeve the cards.

"Un Muy Buen Juego"
 La verdad es que ciudadelas es uno de Esos, que sin duda merecen el puesto de pertenecer a culquier ludoteca: Un precio justo, unas mecanicas excelentemente bien implementadas y que sin duda funcionan a la perfeccion entre ellas, unos compontes de buena calidad (en el caso de la tercera edicion en España, por que la ultima  de 2016 deja muchisimo que desear) y la diversion en grupos de 4 a 8 jugadores esta garantizada gracias a los "roles ocultos" que sin duda es lo mas divertido.
 Es tan sencillo que directamente "no tiene fallos", facil de aprender y dificil de dominar.
Sus aspectos menos destacables, en mi opinion, es que es un juego que a 2 y 3 jugadores se queda corto y pierde parte de la gracia, esta pensado casi para un ,minimo de cuatro aunque ba muy bien tambien a dos y tres. El arte es muy bonito, aunque a mi personalmente no me gusta demasiado (parece como si estubiera hecho de diferentes piezas no relacionadas entre si) y por ultimo, como ya dije, la ultima edicion en España, es desastrosa tanto en calidad de componentes como en el hecho de que no hayan inluido la expansion.
En resumen: 100% recomendado (salvo la ultima edicion, que al menos que querais tener algo caro que quemar en la chimenea no os la recomiendo)
Un saludo a todos

This is an interesting and quite ingeniously devised city/VP building card game with nice art (and controversial nudity - zoinks!), fast playing turns, cunning tactics and devious treachery, and low-ish overall game time where you’re constantly guessing at your opponent’s moves to maximise your own.  Actually really enjoyed this as a sort of filler game, though I could see how it could go long.  Worth picking up for less than £20, but not sure it would get much play in our collection as it's just not meaty enough.  Another top bloke James Fallows taught us the game, and soundly kicked our arses too – thanks for that James if you’re reading!  You’re going to teach us Magic Realm next time whether you like it or not…  :)

There are tons of people who have gotten over this game at this point. They've been playing it long enough that it lost it's flare perhaps. Or maybe there is a newer game that does the same but with a little more to it, Libertalia perhaps. I was actually only recently introduced to this game and it rocks. Don't play this game down for a second just because it's been around for a while. Super solid game that I'll keep in my collection for a while.

RATING: 6
Citadels is a clever game, and I like the interaction of the roles. I have played most of my games with only 3 players, and when you get to see the pile of roles twice each turn, it really adds to the brain hurting.  You are able to make more intelligent decisions, but it also weakens the thief and warlord.  With more players, the game is still quite fun.

I have 2 main problems with Citadels.  The first is that the game really depends upon the people you play it with.  People who will get offended or upset by what happens in the game should not play, because they will ruin it for everyone.  This means that Citadels isn't always the easiest game to get to table, despite being playable by a wide range of players.  The other complaint is that luck can play a big role, as the quality of the building cards you draw can have a large effect.  But this is a pretty minor complaint, and the game is still enjoyable.

A very basic premise of having to build 8 districts before everyone else, but with a few layers.  Very good game for a mixed crowd with non-gamers.  The rules are fairly easy to pick up and the game comes with cheat-sheet cards that make each round go faster and scoring pretty painless.

RATING: 7
Good. What a great game. It requires a lot of player interaction, wits and tactics. The luck factor is present , but the fun, intrigue and politics give you a marvelous experience.  Playing time is short (about an hour). Highly recommended.

2006-12-25: An excellent game for 2 players!

2007-03-09: After many games, Citadels becomes repetitive. I still enjoy this game very much, but it does not have what it takes to remain a 9 for me. Down to 7
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Simply put, this is a painful gaming experience. I did NOTHING for three turns in a row, and each turn is probably about 5 minutes long. Any game that can allow a player to be sitting around doing nothing for 15 minutes while your opponents advance automatically loses a lot of points, in my book. It's just not fun to cross your fingers, hoping that someone doesn't assassinate you this turn, or steal your money, or do some other god-awful thing to you that sets you back beyond any help. There aren't that many interesting decisions to make, either, beyond choosing your role (which I find frustrating anyway). Do I take money or take cards? That's it. And I also notice that you run low on both a few turns into the game, and you're never really able to generate a full hand of cards again, making your decisions even less exciting. I'm sorry, but it will take a lot to make me play this game again.

RATING: 7
I love Citadels. It keeps me on the edge of my seat. There are so many mind games that take place during the game that I love. "I wonder if she took the thief or the assassin?" "I hope they think I chose the architect instead of the noble". And so on. The art is also incredible, especially on the manor and the park. I LOVE those cards. But this game also has some flaws in my opinion. In the two and three player game, especially the 3 player game, the assassin and thief are broken. They seem to be the strongest characters so they always get chosen, which is annoying. And if you are playing with many people, you end up waiting a really long time for everyone to choose their character. I think this game is best with 2,4, or 5 players. The 2 player variation is super strategic and fun. Anyways, this a solid game that I can get new gamers to enjoy.

(After 3 Plays) 10/21/16: Citadels has been a big hit with my friends. It is often requested on game nights and never disappoints. I love the choices you have to make by keeping in mind the role you are choosing as well as keeping in mind the target you may be putting on yourself. The only downside is that it can run long at larger player counts (This could be exclusive to my group though as some point really pour over which card to select.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The fun, interesting dynamic in this game is choosing roles: assasin, thief, magician, king, priest, merchant, builder, and soldier. The trick is that you do not know who chose what role, as it is a secret choice from the remaining cards of roles. These characters have special abilities and you interact by doing something against another character (e.g. assasin announces they will kill the merchant) so you cannot specifically target another player, only a role that was chosen. There is a lot of double guessing in that aspect. Victory is obtained by building to 8 buildings anc counting VPs. However, there is lot of luck with hands being switched, the soldier burning down other people's buildings, the assasin not killing the right person, etc. so it should not be played strategically, since one could get assasinated multiple times or robbed, taking away the fun factor. English version of the game introduces the witch, and takes away only one action from the chosen character, which seems more balancing than someone getting assasinated and losing their whole turn. On the plus side, this game works with 7 people.

[b] Citadels[/b] by [person=125][/person]

2-8 players

A race to build a city. Medieval fantasy setting. Best with 2-4 players. Becomes more chaotic and slow with more players added.

Apr 2, 2014 note: recently played 2-player game. Played very similar to the 3-player. Very enjoyable!

A very interactive tactical game, with lots of second guessing what your opponents shall do next, mostly which character roles shall be chosen on a given round. Each role offers up a different ability which aides in building your city, or destroying your opponent's.

Rules are simple.

Note:
Purchase card sleeves for the character cards, which tend to wear down quickly (due to constant character card shuffling), making it easy to spot and differentiate the original character cards from the expansion's character cards, which might not be used as frequently. It's very important that players cannot spot the variance, since the character roles are secretly chosen, and not revealed till played. 

This is one game that truly needs the sleeves. 20 would be needed (expansion characters included), so one pack of sleeves should suffice. I use MayDay Premium USA Chimera Game Sleeves (57.5mm X 89mm, pack of 50).

However, if the original cards are already worn down, and the new expansion character cards are not... you should purchase sleeves, which aren't totally transparent. They should have a black backing.

This is a fun little 'filler' game - light, but with enough going on to draw me in.

My experience of Citadels has been that it's a real 'zone' game. There are some games I've played where I'm just 'in the zone'; I know exactly what characters other people have chosen, I gracefully feint and dodge, and generally feel omniscient. Then there are the games where I feel totally clueless and get knifed every turn by the assassin.

RATING: 6
A game that strikes little chord with me. It is often being pushed as an excellent 7-player game but I find the downtime too long for what you get out of the game in terms of strategic thinking. In the end it is a fairly simple bluffing game with some mean streaks of screwage. For bluffing games that suits more than five players I think both Bang and Werewolf. Does not work at all with 2 or 3 players.

Mechanically and even theme wise (though some of the theme is a little abstracted ... how exactly do you "play" as so many different people, what does that mean?) this is a pretty tight game.  Simple, light, no noticeable flaws (though I hear high player counts can be labourious). For many an ideal filler and gateway.  I just could not stomach the assassin, warlord, and thief roles.  Probably from watching too much Mr. Rogers as a kid (I don't actually think it possible to have watched too much Mr. Rogers, that guy was awesome).  Violence and vice doesn't always bother me in games, but in this case it did.  It all seemed so ... personal.

Citadels just does not do it for me. Seems too tedious for a fun filler game but not enough decisions to make it a real game. In principle, it is better with more players as more characters will be in play each round but then the selection process can drag quite a bit. After that playing out the roles is more of a bookkeeping act than gameplay. Even worse for the player who became victim of the assassin and is out of the round.

This game is balanced around the fact that the Assassin exists. Otherwise, the Merchant and Architect can run off with the game, because they circumnavigate the limited resources Citadels plays with. However, the Assassin is a "lose a turn" mechanic that can often revolve around pure guesswork. "Lose a turn" mechanics are not acceptable design, and so the design of this game is balanced on such a poor foundation.

One of my first euro-type games.  I love it, however new players find it hard to distinguish which character to grab when and why.

A role selection game that gives you benefits depending on what role you choose.  Your ultimate goal is to build a city of various colors and buildings to grant you end game bonuses, but the heart of the game is in the role selection.

If you are able to read your opponents and determine what roles they are going for, you have a clear advantage and might come out on top in Citadels.

Heavily depends on the composition of the crowd -- if you can't play backstabby games, avoid.  With the right group, it's a fun, cutthroat game.  (Definitely play to 7 buildings in a 5+ person game, and yes, get the card protectors.)

A ideia é construir sua citadela, construindo diversos tipos de prédios. O primeiro a fazer 8 leva. Para isso, é preciso obter moedas e cartas de construções - nesse meio tempo, cada jogador escolhe uma função entre as cartas que chega na sua mão. E as funções vão mudando a cada rodada. Dá para impedir outro jogador de jogar, roubar todo o dinheiro, trocar de mão... Muito legal, principalmente para novatos. Só depende um pouco de idiomas no começo - depois, todo mundo memoriza o que cada carta faz.

I introduced this to a couple of guys at work.  We are all cutthroat and intense gamers.  We thoroughly enjoyed the three player game.  I particularly enjoy the ebb and flow of the "take that" and solitaire play that occurs.  It has surprised me greatly how quickly one can get back into a game (that's a good thing).  The components are ok - I can understand why card sleeves would be useful, particularly for the characters.

Why this is not a 10:
-> It does not grab me enough to want to play all the time
+ I definitely would not turn down a game

RATING: 6
A pure role selection game, it can feel a bit like something is missing now that other games have taken the mechanic further and/or blended into a bigger game.  There is a ton of screwage as the assassin can cost you a turn etc...  I need to try the expansion characters.  One thing that annoys me about the production of this game is the characters have a lot of text, so much so that it cant all fit on the cards.  Fine, but why is the only place with complete text in the rule book?  Player handouts with the full text should be a MUST so as not to slow the game to a crawl when certain interactions come up.  Also, if you are playing with a larger group use the shorter game variant as this game can go too long for what it is.

Building card game. The fun is all in the role selection; killing the right person is very satisfying and killing the wrong person is hilarious!

It scales well and is one of the few games which support 6+, though downtime can drag at those levels. 2p often devolves into repeated Princess Bride standoffs.

Like all Faidutti's games Citadels has element of chaos in it. Role Choosing is interesting element in the game, but rest of it is pretty straightforward. Roles and who takes which is definately the fun part. Play with 4-5 players max to have decent playing time. Game gets boring if played too slowly.

RATING: 6
A superb game that is part deduction, part bluff, and part building. Highly interactive, as the actions of some characters can affect others, and (mostly) beautifully illustrated. A game that seems to improve with each play. I will say that 4-6 players are the limit for my taste, as less make it more of a race game and more tend to turn the chaos factor up to Gehena (or "11").

I absolutely adore this theme, and to me every game feels more like a fantasy story than a board game.

Roughly played 15 times between 2007 and 2014, started tracking mid 2015. Never play this without the expansion. 
Lately have been playing the newer Dutch version which also adds event cards. Like the concept, but the images seem off from the overall theme of the game.

This version is without the expansion, so incorrect in database.

The role picking mechanism is great, but ultimately the city buidling part is a little dull. Usually only play to 7 districts as otherwise it begins to drag. I see it as a quick game, but with a lot of players it always seems to take longer than I expect.

RATING: 3
Ugh... any game where you can lose turns or progress due to another player's arbitrary decision (thanks to the Assassin and Thief roles) loses major points in my book.  It's possible to lose multiple turns in a row if you're particularly unlucky.  One annoying opponent claimed to me that you have to use "psychology" to win, so I guess the game is *supposed* to be a fractured mess of second-guessing and analysis paralysis.  And really, what else is more fun than watching opponents scratch their heads trying to decide what roles to pick?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Attractive game based on players choosing different roles to carry out actions while searching for the most valuable combination of buildings, and quite possibly the game who took this mechanism (hitherto not used that often) back to the masses, ending up in Puerto Rico, Caylus and so on. While for many players it depends too much on who starts the round the game for two to four players is nice, tactical and quite malicious.

Bel gioco, anche se non molto profondo. Valutando comunque che si tratta di un gioco di carte (ad un prezzo oltretutto molto basso) devo dire che è un buon acquisto. Le regole sono semplici e si adatta a qualunque tipo di giocatore, le spiegazioni durano relativamente poco. Buona giocabilità anche in 2 usando le regole speciali. La riedizione comprende anche l'espansione che lo rende più longevo. I personaggi originali secondo me però sono i migliori, ma il mio consiglio è di sostituire nel corso delle partite i personaggi che vengono scelti più spesso. L'ultima edizione non ha le monete di cartone e ha una scatola molto piccola, le carte invece rimangono un po' delicate. Consigliato!

There's something rather beautiful about Citadels. I don't know whether it's the bluff and backstabby elements; the strategic but not overpowering resource juggling; the simple economy; or having a King who will read out the character list as if he's introducing pro-wrestlers (thanks, Stu!), but there's no better time to be had for a table of 5-7 people. Easily explained to beginners (who will become cut-throat powermongers after the first half-dozen rounds) and perfectly enjoyable by seasoned gamers who know the cards and can speed a game through. Best of all with a dedicated group of Citadels-nuts who can indulge in devious groupthink.

Faidutti has produced some first-class games, and a couple of absolute stinkers, but this is a work of genius.

This game requires multiple plays to grasp more than basic strategy. Then again, I've only played this with groups of 6-8 people. I think it's different when there are fewer players.

However, Doreen doesn't like this game that much, so 2-player games of this won't happen often.

UPDATE: Shafi and Eric loved this game as a 3-player game. However, 2-4 player games are much different from 5-8 player games; the effectiveness of the Assassin and the Thief is different, and the effectiveness of the Architect seems to be increased greatly throughout more of the game in a 2-4 player game.

This is a good building / card game.  There is enough interaction to keep the game interesting for all players.  There can be some runaway for the leader and its hard to bring him back to the pack.  The Dark expansion really adds a lot to the game.  There are replacement characters and special buildings.  The original printing has cards that are just too flimsy.  I was able to get a reprint that includes the base game and the expansion and the card stock is ok.

This was one of my favorite games when I first got into gaming.  I played it alot before I started recording plays, and was always happy to see it hit the table.  However, it has slipped a bit for me.  I love the hidden role selection, but think that other games do it better (Grimoire and Mission Red Planet), and the length of Citadels along with some of its problems such as Kingmaking mean it doesn't hit the table much now. I have really enjoyed it at 3 players.

Excellent game I am always willing to play. It may not seem like a really deep strategic experience at the first glance, but the brilliant thing about it is that the tactical part does not come from complicated mechanisms embedded into the game, but from player interaction. You have to guess what other people want and it can turn into some nice mind games and can reveal the way how other people think, when you discuss who picked which character and why (which is my favourite part of the game). It has also nice pace, but sometimes can be a little slow if people can't make up their mind in character picking phase. Also, I always thought that this game is only interesting in higher number of players, but recently my wife and I have been playing this game in 2 and we enjoyed quite a lot!

Also, the issues that people sometimes have with this game are easily solvable, luck of the draw could be mitigated by using the magician and a little longer than necessary playtime by simply agreeing on lowering the limit of buildings to seven.

Interesting decisions but there is a lot of down time with a large number of players as you go through the sequence 1-9 every turn. Can be chaotic, but I quite like the second guessing element, except that you don't know who you're targeting. One player might have her chances  completely hosed by getting hit several turns in a row. 

It's a shame it takes an hour-plus to play, if it were 20-30 minutes I would like it a lot more. Call me ADD, but my beef is that in that hour, you'll only get to play at most 8 cards (if you're lucky).

This game is underrated. The rules are very straightforward, but playing optimally is still always fun and sufficiently challenging. Played many times and haven't even begun to get sick of it. Dark city expansion is definitely worthwhile as well, it came together with my copy of the original so I've actually never played without the expansion.

I used to like this game but mostly find it a tedious slog now. Missing turns from the Assassin, losing gold from the Thief and the downtime between picking and calling roles is vastly irritating. Always die inside when this is suggested as there are so many better and more streamlined games. Each game just seems horribly long.

A very evil game.  I like that the roles attack other roles rather than other players.  Get to do a little detective work while trying to be clever yourself.  Game plays fast and scales from 2-7.  Base game and expansion come in the same box for cheap, pretty much a must buy.

RATING: 5
One of my favorite role-picking games. Doesn't hit the table often enough, mostly because I own ye old Deutche edition (Ohne Furcht & Adel) and nobody likes memorizing cards or grubbing through a xerox of Rio Grande's translated rules. A friend owns the English-language edition, complete with the secondary role set, and it's one of our favorite 7-player games.

That said, it's hard to feel like you're getting any better at this game. I've never recovered from a poor draw, and the ultimate outcome always feels very luck-based to me. This is typically a showstopper, but the whole "I know what you picked but I can only make educated guesses about everyone else" stuff is really compelling.

This is a nice power selection game. To get the right timeframe we play to 7 cards, only allow destroying a building on the last turn if it directly improves the soldier's position in the game and keep it to 5 players max. This keeps the game ticking along at a nice speed and allows us to get through the bad part faster (the slow character selections) and to the fun part faster - the character revelations, especially the killer and the thief's targets.

Nice role/character choosing card game where to main aim is to gain gold with a view to build buildings in your city. Best aspect of this game involves how the roles actually target each other, many of the roles ask you to name a character to affect rather than say the person on your left. This gets you thinking and guessing who grabbed what role and stops people from picking on say dad every round :-) or the leader per say. It's pretty easy to learn/play and the price with expansion now included is very reasonable.

Truly a perfect and fun game. Unique card game to build a city in medieval times. Bluffing. Variable turn order and powers. Conflict. Great artwork and components with the FF edition which includes the the Dark City expansion. Everything about the gameplay that I enjoy about this game, some people absolutely hate. Every gamer needs to experience Citadels with a group of 5 or more. Besides, it plays much shorter than a 90 minutes game, especially if you play the 7 buildings variant.

I'd rather play this, than Coup, or Resistance.

Can play up to 8 players with the expansion.

Tableau building along the lines of San Juan with simpler buildings, but with actual money. Each turn, each player selects a role in secret. Half of the roles are nasty and destructive, but since you target a role rather than a player, the effects are unpredictable. 

So: Tons of screwage, with tons of second-guessing. two of my least favorite mechanics. However, it's a well-designed game (as I figured it would be), and I didn't hate it quite as much as I thought I might. But I still really don't want to play it again.

Weight 2.1 seems about right. I would probably give it a 2.2.

One of my favourit cardgames next to BANG! cool character select system and awsome design. The way players atempt to guess the opponents' choices is what makes this game shine, and since all players select character cards from the same deck... you can guess, thing is that one is always left out, so the secon player has only a 50% chance guessing which character the 1st chose... you can see where this is heading after the 3rd player is chosing, and then the 4th, and 5th... etc. Fantastic little card game with a great fun intrigue and "back stabbing". The illustrations are fantastic.

A good game with interesting interaction and game play.  The theme might not be strong enough for some, since the game is relatively abstract.  Throw in the potential for some strong swings in the game due to the "luck of the draw," and there will be some that don't get much enjoyment out of this game.

However, the strategy and mechanics work quite well for me and most in my gaming group.  Play can get a bit long sometimes, so there's a preference for other games, but this one frequently comes out on game day.

12/30/11 - Citadels is an interesting game with hidden roles to benefit you in your goal to build 8 districts. The artwork on the cards are beautiful and I don't mind the chaos the game causes. It also should be said that this is not a friendly game. You will be stealing and halting players choices.

My major complaint is the game length. Most people think of it as a filler and if it is a filler it should play in less than an hour. This game falls into the same area of games like Bonhanza and Farm Cards. They are fun but have a tendency to drag mid-game. Citadels also is a game prone to cause AP in players as the mull over which role to take.

I initial enjoyment has dwindled and I only like to play this occasionally. I am lowering my initial rating of 7 to a 6 because it describes how I feel about the game.

Good card game that can accomodate lots of people, though it can slow down at large player numbers.  Role mechanic forces players to constantly guess which player has which role.  Random factor is pretty large, but the game is fun nonetheless.  Being assassinated is not fun, especially if you're losing anyway, but since the assassin doesn't know who he's targeting, it does happen.  Many of the tokens that came with my printing of the game are completely unnecessary.

Citadels: a game where card drafting, identity deduction and special player powers all blend together to create a great social game. The objective is to build districts and earn points, but the core of the game is to "read" your opponents and balance between optimal/safe play. Play the merchant to quickly get much gold, but risk getting assassinated? Which character is that person who's stockpiling gold? Solid party game, great replayability.

TRY Aug/04: Light & good fun!  Great game of trying to out-smart your opponents, and full of second-guessing with the hidden roles.  I love it!

OWN Nov/04: Can be a tad too long, if role-choosing is not done reasonably quickly!  But I've only really encountered that occasionally.  Very nice game.  I have some homemade player-aids (shrunken card photocopies with colour-matching for roles that it matters for).

Added to BSW Jan/05.  Implementation could be better, especially for the 2 gold vs. 2 cards/keep one.  The addition of English text was a blessing.

Aug/06: Tried with 8 of the expansion roles.  Still fun, but a different twist with no stealing or building destruction.

This is quite a fun game: nice artwork, and difficult decision making.  The choice of which person to take is a fine balancing act between taking the "best" for you (but, at the same time, most obvious for the thief/assassin) or a character that makes you less of a target but also provides fewer benefits for you.  So far, we have only played with 4 or 5, and after an initial struggle to get the special rules straight, we have really enjoyed it.

RATING: 7
I have played this game only with 6-8 people and with that much players the downtime is terrible, and not much else to think about while waiting for your turn (or chance to choose character) than about who will choose what role, while others try to counterthink that guessing. So in the end it feels rather random. Being assasinated and building destroyed in one turn, robbed from money and cards on the next turn while you are well behind in points is rather frustrating. I like games where you can screw other players, but if it is totally random, it is not so cool. Willing to try out a 2-4 player game.

update - if game goes in a good tempo as couple of last plays have been, it´s a quite ok game. rating 4 -> 6.


Update 2014-05: First play with 4 players - game works well and does not take long time. Rating 6->7

Would play it with 7-8 players again, but only if no AP players are present. It´s a light game afterall.

Played 2p with my wife while waiting for our laundry to dry (our dryer's still broken, despite my completely taking it apart in order to 'fix' it).  She was skeptical at first, but after the first round she exclaimed "Oh, that's it! I like this!"  She proceeded to destroy me, and fun was had by all.

7/27/09, 5 plays: has become our go to quick 2p game, though our opportunities to get a game out have been spread thin, rating up to 7.5 from 7.

3/15/15, 14 plays total (none within the past year): rating down to a 6, I rarely am interested in playing this, though I know it would be fun with the right group.

After a little practice (this game is not immediate at all) it's big fun and contains both strategic and psychologic elements. Cards are very beautiful but risk to get easily damaged. It is good (but not great and very deep) for usual players, too difficult (and very slow) for non-players. Who should play this then?

Another true classic of the gaming world.  Citadels was the first successful game in the genre of secret role selection games. Each round a hand of characters is passed around. On your turn you choose one and pass them on.  After everyone has chosen, characters activate in a determined order, using abilities to ultimately gain cards and victory points.  This game has the added benefit of playing up to 8 - though it adds quite a lot of time to the game.  There is a new edition out this year (2016) with updated artwork.  If you don't have this in your collection, it is worth the investment

I had a hand-me-down version of this in my collection for years and never got around to playing it. I've since played a few games with two and four players and really enjoyed it.

Now that I've played with 4 players, I have to revise my comments.  I think this game is decent, and could be great with the right group, but its uses are pretty limited for my gaming life.  It has a weird niche between "easy-to-learn" and "passive-aggressive enough to fail with a family-gaming group".  The two-player variant is ok, but there are much better 2-player games out there.  I think it would be great as a medium-light filler game with a serious gaming group.  I also think it would shine best with 4+ players.  But since the bread and butter of my gaming is 2-3 players or family gaming, I'm content to play it at a friend's house, I don't think I need to own it anymore.

Quite interesting game, allowing wide range of amount of players (2-8) what makes it very flexible. While the randomness plays the main role, helping yourself win requires good guessing what the opposing players are going to do.

The biggest disadvantage of the game becomes visible when playing with larger numbers of players, like 8. Each players actions takes some time and it's quite easy to get bored while waiting for your turn.

What is surprising the duel play, which uses different rules like allowing players to control two character is very playable and much more dynamic. Also the randomness is decreased in this variant.

This game probably (maybe) deserves a 4, but based on BBG rating wiki and the fact that "I plan never to play this again" -- game gets a 2.  So boring, please make it stop.  I am inclined to want to like a game and have a good time, but something about this game makes we want to never play a game again.  I wish I was just being dramatic and joking, but I hated every second of playing this game.  Not enough depth and what decisions you do have seem random and boring.  I love random, but this game is the epitome of when random is not fun.  I also love games like this where you have to read your opponents (see: Battlestar Galactica), but even when I successfully guessed my opponents moves and blocked them -- I didn't really care.  Thinking about it now, maybe the theme (or lack of an interesting one) is what really hurts this game on top of finding the passing the cards mechanic slow and tedious.  I am not an AP prone player, but this game makes you feel like you need to be one... so screw you game!  Like this review, I can only think of one thing when picturing playing this game again -- please make it stop.

This one is great. Getting the right character at the right time and minimising the influences of the other characters is critical...A real feeling of intrigue ensues. Plays well with 2 or more. Can have some downtime over players choosing their characters for a turn. Plays out quickly :) with a good theme. Good quality pieces and is better  with good players so anyone under 12 wouldn't be that fun to play with.

Liked the extra roles in the expansion. Don't care for games that so heavily rely on people making mediocre decisions.

No está mal este jueguecillo de cartas de adoptar diferentes roles en cada ronda de juego, que te permiten realizar diferentes acciones. El vencedor será aquel que consiga construir la ciudad más rica y bella del lugar.

RATING: 6.5
What I enjoy about this game is the fact it's a great role-guessing puzzle game. There is, however, a trick to teaching the game. When introducing the game to a new player, introduce each role two to three at a time, with the Thief and Assassin being last, and it's a smoother transition to the more nuanced aspects of the game. It plays quick, has plenty of brain burning moments, and has many opportunities for table talk. It's probably one of the highest rated game here that has a genuinely significant bluffing aspect to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'm having trouble getting this one to balance between "boring" and "hard-feelings".  Play with the Thief and Assassin and people get really upset, but play with the Tax Collector and the Witch and it seems too nice.  Add to the fact that it plays best with 7 and yet 7 takes the longest, and, well, I'm not that nuts about it.

I've found the secret to not hating this game: not caring.  But that, in itself, is part of the problem.

While not too complex, this game works for almost any group of people and also functions as a decent 30-60 minute filler.  However, the quality of the cards is pathetic.

I see Mike's concern that the game can play too long, but worry less about the screw-over issue.  Don't mind games that can get nasty.  This is a classic setup:  simple basic system, and a ton of rule-breaker cards.  Probably the pre-eminent example of that?

RATING: 7
The role selection remains one of the best parts of this game. In the right crowd it's a lot of fun. Given the 60-90 minute play time for groups of 5-7 there are other games of that length that hit the table more often.

That said, it was one of my earliest purchases and was the game that got me onto BGG in the first place. Was sad when I had to pass it along to make room on the shelf. (RA)

RATING: 8

Can sometimes suffer from kingmaking in the mid-to-lategame, if roles are badly used. But still an elegant game, best with 6+ (if people play briskly). 

A chatty gaming group helps to alleviate the slow turns as other people pick their roles; this is a double-edged sword, though, because without dialogue it can seem like a very slow game.

The challenge and depth of the game (as well as making correct reads on your opponents) is variable to the skill of the people with which you are playing.

The game also comes with extra characters making it replayable.

Fun with the right people, but repeated assassination/theft can embitter folks who take things too seriously.  

Note that the English version of the Smithy card has a typo that makes it too powerful.  House rules say it should read "pay three gold to draw two cards" (as it does in German), not "pay two gold to draw three cards."

Card sleeves strongly recommended at least for the character cards.  The edges will become worn.

NOTE: Want-in-Trade is in reference to the Russian version only.

RATING: 8.5
Solid game. I would of enjoyed it more if I would of never played San Juan before which shares similar mechanics. Contrarily to SJ, Citadels has players intervening against each other (which can really set you back in the game when you get robbed and assassinated a couple of times in a row) but the various characters and actions available seem less interesting than the actions available in San Juan. Both games have their share of luck of the draw, but they are manageable. I'm glad I bought it for 20$, that's what I feel this game is worth. A nice change of theme and a little deduction play when we want some variety.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Such a simple game, with so much neat interaction. The different characters, their selection mechanic, and the fact that you can be any of them makes this a very satisfying and fulfilling experience. For such a small price, you get a game that is sure to keep a good size team (up to eight players) going at each other influencing the noble to be able to gather enough power to construct the buildings in their section of the city. Very good social game, and as opposed to other games that pit people against each other, the character selection here makes it hard for "grudge" matches to occur. It is everybody against everybody, so in the end, no one is particularly targeted. I would think someone on a budget or just figuring out if board gaming is for them, this is a great inexpensive way to start.

I think this game is super great. The one gripe that I have is that if the King is unfamiliar with the order of calling out the role cards, turns can feel a little stretched out. It also stings whenever you are the target of the thief or the assassin, but the fact that the attackers is selecting a role, as opposed to the name of a player, makes the attack feel a little less personal, which is nice.

I Love the role-selection with the weighing of pros and cons and trying tu guess what the other players are up to. And I just love games that manage great gameplay and replayability with few/"cheap" components, small boxes and not too complex rules.
Although, this one is probably better with more players than less.

Interesting little card game; there's plenty of suspense and second-guessing for those who enjoy bluffing games like Hook or Crook (aka Hoity Toity) and it's definitely competitive and fairly easy to teach.  Yet so far, this hasn't been brought back to the table as often as I'd hoped...and in the few games we've played, the game suffered a bit from "Act 2 Syndrome": kinda slow in the middle.

Update:
I actually traded this.. Wish I could say that I missed it, but truth is, I just don't play games with groups large enough to create a good game of Citadels.

Enjoy the game. The strategy is by round you try a process of elimination to guess what others moves may be and counter.  I'd agree with some others comments that player in last place can targeted heavily which can bring you down a bit (unfortunately in the 1st game I played I was able to receive first hand knowledge of this phenomena).

Citadels is the most appropriate gaming recreation of the Princess Bride's classic scene between Wesley and Viccini ("All I need to do is deduce from what I know of you...").  The gameplay is simple and easy to understand, but the amount of impact each role choice has on others causes constant turn angst.  Nice and fast, keeps the non-gamers playing games

City-building card game with secret role selection & plenty of opportunity to be nasty to each other. Can be great fun with the right group.

For 2-7 players (or 2-8 with Dark City expansion, included with latest FFG edition). Mid-length playing time. Plays quite differently with 2-3 players.

WARNING: Can take several plays to grasp how the roles work for new players. May be long down-times with lots of players if everyone takes a long time choosing roles (improves with familiarity).

WARNING: NEEDED CARD SLEEVES (lots of shuffling of character cards)

At first this game appeared far too simple to please my tastes, but the more I played the more it grew on me. I discovered a rewarding system that provokes constant thought into trying to determine what your opponents are thinking and how to react. Each draw phase is filled with tension and many choices. My problem with most card games is the enormous luck factor usually associated with them, but I do not feel this way with Citadels. Many people complain that the same person can have the King throughout game, though this is a losing strategy.

RATING: 7
Originally played Ohne Furcht und Adel with 5 and 6 players, so language accessibility and quick game pace wasn't there for me. 3 years later and playing this version with 4 was an improvement, but still suffers from the downtime feeling due to most of your evaluation being enforced on your turn rather than during the turn of others. You really don't have much to consider except the district values of your opponents. So this really is a social/lunchtime game which allows casual talk and eating to pass for entertainment, which isn't too bad a thing. I love the game play which is simple and smooth. In some ways I prefer this method of role selection (rather than the way it is used in Puerto Rico) as not only is there deduction and bluffing, but with 4 players causing 3 characters to be put aside, evaluation of what's available in each round is less repetitive. Now have played with 3 which is no better, but with 2 players this game truly shines, with less downtime. The assassin is less of an issue, and the discarding of characters introduces bluff and double bluff. But my brain needs two things to take this game over the 7 rating: a scoring track to take the strain off counting individual coins (why not numerals)and a memory/deduction aid to cope with recording and chaotic resetting of character selection (I much prefer the permenant role selection in Bang, then you can focus on other things).

This is a party game with good player interaction. It is not a strategy game, just requires some educated guessing, minor deductions, and minimal tactical play. It can be too long for a party game and you definitely need to have some player aids (the list of characters and their special functions.) The game should probably be played with 5 or 6 players. With more it will be too long, with less it is not very good.

My g/f liked it, even though she was sick and I demolished her in our only game so far. That's a good sign.

RATING: 6
Fairly simple card game, but there are a variety of strategies available. Since most of the mechanics rely on guessing who chose what card, there's a lot of potential for bluffing.

Game would be better if there were more role cards at once, though. I know the expansion gives you more role cards, but they're designed to be replacements. If you shuffled the role deck and then drew 8 and those are what people had to choose per round, I think that would be a bit more interesting.

Also, I wish there were more district cards that had special functions, and that the ones with special functions weren't always purple. I'm thinking of San Juan - having all/most buildings do something special would make this game MUCH more interesting.

A fun game, one that introduced me to the genre of board games with mind games. However, it's a mean game, you can get unlucky, you can get ganged up on, and ultimately it's going to end up a kingmaker. The 2 player game will test the strength of your relationship with your opponent, as a few "smart" or lucky turns can completely shut them out of playing themselves.

The first tabletop game I played in a board games cafe. It became my first geek purchase on this list. What I didn't like is the Assassin role. The Witch in the expansion makes life less difficult for the victim.

For Dark City: New districts with abilities definitely increased the rating for me. What I didn't like was that the rules state that I can only place a few new purple districts to the base deck and if I want to add more I would have to replace with those already in the base deck.

So I went ahead and shuffled all the new purple districts inside and had great fun but it also made me realised why that rule was in place. Because there will be too many purple districts and I'm not getting gold for building most of them when I have a role that gets gold for building a district with the same color as my role(e.g. Merchant/Bishop/King/Warlord)

RATING: 8
This game can be a lot of fun under the right circumstances.  For me, those circumstances include the following:

1) Not a large group.  5 players is probably pushing it.  There's just too much down time during role selection with a lot of players, and the game can really drag.

2) Play with the right players.  The game can be very unpredictable, and it's likely that some players will get hit with the assassin and thief a lot more than others.  Don't play with somebody who is going to freak out if they get assassinated while in last place.

3) Don't play too often.  I don't enjoy this one nearly as much if I have played it recently.  I think with this game the frustration level builds up to a certain threshold and then the fun quickly diminishes.

In the right setting I really enjoy this game.  There is so much second-guessing with the role selection, which lends the game a certain degree of subtlety.  It's generally a bad idea to take the role which would give you the greatest benefits.  Instead, there's an art to choosing one that is non-obvious and yet still beneficial.

I consider Citadels a good second-level gateway game. I think it is best played with 4-6 players. It takes at least a few rounds at least (or a couple of games at worst) to get the hang of the gameplay.

In Citadels, you aim to be the first player to build 8 districts. To do so, in each round, you choose a certain character such as King, Magician, Thief etc. Each character comes with associated special powers and is useful at different stages / situations in the game. There is an element of luck, but knowing your fellow players and working out their strategy and tailoring yours appropriately plays a significant part in how well you do.

This game introduced me to the "role selection" mechanic and I loved it. The rest of the game is pretty simple and straightforward. This makes the game easy to explain while keeping it challenging enough even for experienced gamers.

The main downside of the game is that it doesn't play well for 6-8 players despite what the box says. Games tend to be super long and slow paced which can bore out a lot of people. There are usually better options for 6-8 player games imo.

A nice combination of hidden roles and card buying, with none of the bluffing that I don't particularly care for.

Much of the game is "take that" - but generally the "take that" misfires and hits the wrong target.

Mechanics are simple but doesn't give many decision points.

This one is a true classic. There are a lot of strategies and counterstrategies to be played. In my opinion, the Assassin's a bit too good in the 2 or 3 player game, where you can pick him and then get another chance to see what your opponent didn't pick before deciding who to target. With four or more players, Assasin is fine and people need to learn to live with it and play the mindgames that make Citadels so good. This game is small but deep, and great from a monetary-value perspective.

EDIT: After further plays, this game really doesn't work with 2 players. It kinda works with 3, but I'm still not impressed. 4 or more is fantastic though.

Tentative rating: 7.5/10. More plays needed at higher player counts. Also consider Masquerade or Libertalia for similar games.

Juego perfecto para 6 o más jugadores con ganas de darse puñaladas traperas. Es el que más horas de diversión acumula (+ de 200 horas) y aún así no se quema. Ideal para una gran tarde.

I've still only played this once, but thought I'd add a comment. The game is overall nice, but unwieldy and weird when done with 2 players, though the game says you can play it with 2 people. It seemed rather... illogical to do so, especially as the rules seemed to state that your character classes are secret until they are called... I mean 2 people, that's 2 classes each... Come on, how many options ARE there?

Great idea for a game that loses some points for the times when the assassin chooses completely at random, or something lame like that.  It depends on having the right types of players, something I seem to rarely have for this game.

I love the bluff and psychology of the role selection mechanic.  The endgame seems to sometimes just be a hope that no one screws you over while you try to finish your districts rather than any great strategic decisions.  The downtime is kind of a bummer, man, but not too bad if you have a lively group.
 
 
This is easily the most played game I own outside of Tichu. It's easy to pick up, and I play with a lot of people who enjoy fantasy themes, so it hits the table a lot. I enjoy it even more lately, it's just fun.

RATING: 8
Nice amount of bothering-other-players combined with trying to get ahead. I think it works better as a two-player variant we made up, in which each player takes the place of two normal-game players, player 1-and-3 and player 2-and-4. The assassin and thief seem like strategically poor choices in multi-player games, especially the assassin (*maybe* costing *one* other player 'one' at the cost of definitely costing yourself 'a half'), but a valid choice with only two players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I prefer this to a bunch of hidden role games because there are lots of ways to mitigate the inherent variance. Each role is, at the very least, pickable in some situation, even if there are some that are really good overall. The Architect has been on the wrong end of the Assassin's blade probably more times than any of the other roles combined.

The biggest problem is that the game tends to drag excessively with more than about 4 people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
As good as it gets when it comes to card game design which pushed the boundaries of card games. The core is the role selection and a winning condition which makes the endgame rather frenzy and tactical (who will get there first). Rounded up by a nice light fantasy theme, which is not too silly or high fantasy to put any games from the extreme spectrums off.

EDIT: I found that my sweet spot for this game is three players (just like 7 Wonders). More than four makes this less enjoyable for me

This game plays well no matter how many are playing. The two player game is one of the most tense gaming experiences I've had. Adding more people seems to significantly add to the length of the game (perhaps an additional 10 minutes per person, in my experience). Larger groups are fun, but more chaotic.

seems like an authentically easy and enjoyable game.  Better than Lost Cities.  Better than Puerto Rico in terms of more people will like it.  I do not think this game will get old.

"Let's play that game with the pretty cards" - my wife when requesting Citadels.

Haven't even tried any of the Dark City cards yet and we're pretty certain this game will stay in our rotation for quite a while. We've only been able to play it with 2 so far, but we're looking forward to trying it with more.

Starting at 7.5 but I suspect this will go to 8.

Yet another gem purchased solely on BGG recommendations.  A game you don't need to be ashamed of when you push it on your casual (party) gamer friends.  Rules can be explained in less than five minutes, and after a round of play most players "get it".  It's deceptively simple, and new strategies are constantly emerging as you play.  The theme is very fitting and gameplay is intuitive.  Loads of player interaction (it can get a bit nasty with all the backstabbing possible, so don't play with sensitive types).  The dullest time in the game is waiting for other players to pick their characters; use this time to plan your strategy for the upcomming turn.  Other than that, there's barely a dull moment in the game.

We don't play this game enough. I see where a lot of people rate this very low, saying it doesn't work and takes way too long. I also see these people usually have played with 7 or 8 people.

We have always played with 4 or 5 people. This means that some of those potentially problematic roles may not be in play every round. The "assassinate or steal from the Merchant or Architect" doesn't work because it's likely one of those cards isn't available in the round. Which lifts the danger of picking those roles a good degree.

Based on 1 play. I wouldn't say Citadels is UNbalanced, but the mechanics do not have a buffer to prevent IMbalanced, frustrating, unfair play. Namely, the 1st player was King for 5 straight rounds, through choosing it and it being the 1 buried role. This inability to change start player leads to inequitable and inferior play. While I can accept this design flaw, I do note it and how it decreases the quality of the game.
Would like to play again to get a different session to base opinions on.

A fun and interesting game that I like quite a bit, but opinions in our group are sharply divided.  I like the fact that there are a lot of small strategic descisions to make throughout the game, but our group has found that it tends to bog down with the expansion cards.  There is also a problem in our group with "analysis paralysis" regarding character selection, which can really slow things down.

Great game for 5  players, good interactive fun. Don't think it works as well for less than 5 players, and it turns out I was playing by someone's house rule -- passing a random card back to the last person to select a role -- that makes the game MUCH better but isn't in the original rules (apparently).  Without that rule, and with only 4 players, I'd only rate it a 5 instead of the solid enjoyable rating I gave it for more players and more uncertainty about the roles.

A game of resource management, drafting roles, and victory point race with some screw your opponent mechanics.  I played the FFG version, One game with each set of role cards, and while the gaming table company was good, I did not enjoy the game mechanics because it knocked people out of contention pretty arbitrarily, and once you took the slightest knock, it was so hard to recover.

i really enjoy playing this game with two or three players*. im not sure how balanced some of the character powers are, but you have to be willing to switch gears in this game and sometimes not make the best play, in order to throw off the players who select the thief and assasin. this game is very tactical in nature, but that's what keeps me intrested in a good card game-tough tactical descisions. i really like the bluffing aspects in the two player game. i never play until 8 buildings, no matter the number of players. 7 is a fine number of buildings to play to as far as i can tell. 

*arguably, the 3 player game needs a few tweaks to work well. played with the rules out of the box, the player who is the king has too much of a strategic advantage over the other players. i find that removing the assasin in favor of the witch and adding one of the expansion characters--the navigator, tax collector, or alchemist--as a ninth card dulls the starting advantage well enough. i play with my cards in sleeves, so it is easy to alter the number of the card by placing a sticker on the front of the card with the new number.

It's good to be the king, unless you're playing Citadels. I don't mind being assassinated, it's the tediousness of trying to build your city one card (or two if you're really lucky) at a time and then having some lucky sod destroy a card or steal all your money that gets me annoyed. Even with 2 players I found the game slightly dull. The characters are interesting and I like the second guessing, but the slow play annoys me. 

Update: Using the optional rule of one less building card to quicken the game up has worked really well. Completely different to the snore fest of previous games.

The missing piece of this game is any kind of role playing / charcter development element. Quest for the Faysylwood is more satisfying in that regard.

But hey I got the game for free and it is still fun.

I could imagine enjoying this more if I knew what I was looking for in the card deck.  I had a hard time remembering what all of the action cards did and I didn't know what I was looking for in terms of cards to play in my tableau.  My rating would probably improve if I were to play this game more. Even so, I've got other card games that I'd rather play, so Citadels is not a game that I need (or want) to buy.

Also, it makes me feel like a jerk!  Either I'm terrible at the game or I am great at the game and I know just who to target to get the maximum amount of their stuff.  It makes me sad.  I don't play games to feel sad.  That's why I'm not a huge fan of Citadels.

Yet I can see that it is a good game for someone who really enjoys a lot of take that! in their games.

RATING: 7
When I first played Citadels I was completely blown away by how good it was. It instantly became my favorite deduction game and I truly loved the role selection mechanic. After playing a few games my rating dropped down because I found the game to drag on for too long. As soon as someone was close to building their 8th district everyone would go after them making the game take longer. It got to the point where I would select the warlord late in games so no one would be able to destroy districts. I will never play this game with more than 4 again, just takes way too long in between turns. I will also only play if the house rule of needing 7 (not 8) districts to end the game is in play. Would like to try it with 2 people.

Update: I finally got to play this as a two player game.  I think being able to discard one of the roles after you pick your own is brilliant and adds another layer to this game. In my opinion playing with 2 is the only way to go with this one.

I like this game, but only with the right group of people and in the right mood. There are a lot of possibility to backstab each other, and it's very painful to be on the wrong side of the knife. You have to double-guess your opponents and prevent them double-guessing you.

This is a game I push to play as often as I can, and have only managed to play twice.  The first time I won handedly, and the second time, despite being the constant target of assassinations and thievery, I still came in second.  I really enjoy the thought process of guessing who took what, or even better, what people are going to think you are going to take, and acting accordingly.

As an update, I've managed to play this a few more times, and still love it.  Even if I lose horribly, I still take great pleasure out of figuring out what everyone will take.  It's hard to beat that feeling when you predict how an entire round will go and swing the entire game as a result of having it figured out.

This was one of the first games I played in my gaming career and one of the oldest in my/my wife's collection. It is quick and easy to play, but it got old after a while. I may be ready to make the transition to Libertalia soon, but I heard that game can by pretty cut-throat.

This game is so frustrating. I hate playing with more than 3 people. Even then it is a trial most of the time. So much is dependent on luck and all you really have to do is keep your mouth shut and be quiet to win. There is very little actual player interaction and that just bores me. If I wanted to sit in a room with 3 or 4 other people and not talk I would watch TV.

RATING: 6
An interesting role choosing game.  There is some ability to try and get in people's heads, but there is also a lot of collateral damage along the way.  That is perhaps the major strike against the game: being assassinated or stolen from too often can put you out of the running, but it might happen with you as only be an innocent bystander hit by bad luck or incompetence.  The game can support a large number of players and is fairly straight-forward. I think I'd rather play Adel Verpflichtet which feels a bit less vicious, but still fun.

RATING: 8.455
Really fun game.  Can teach it in 5 minutes and the new players can really enjoy the game.  Good interaction and anticipation in this game.

Every time I've introduced this game to a new group they've either requested an immediate replay, or asked where they could buy a copy of the game, or both!

I can't think of anything negative to say about this game!  (edit:  I had one semi-negative experience where I played with a big group all of who were new to the game....it took WAY too long.  But that was an anomaly). 

The mechanic that everyone looks at the available cards, chooses one and passes the others has the potential to take a long time (especially when newbies aren't familiar with the cards).  If players read every card, every time they get passed to them, it will be slow.

Highly recommended.

I love playing this with a large group. It's fun with less than 7 too. Even my non-boardgame friends have been able to get into this game. Always a good time.

EDIT: You know, after having played many more games other than Citadels, I actually don't like Citadels with 7 or more people. Turns take way too long, which I guess isn't a problem for some. I'll take Libertalia any day over Citadels.

EDIT EDIT: The more I think about it, the less I actually like Citadels.

The role selection element in this game is interesting, but the game itself kinda' leaves me flat.  It also takes too long for what it is.  At first I really liked it, but with more playings I've wanted to play it less and less.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

RATING: 7.5
Description: Secret role selection, drafting, medieval fantasy city building, bluffing, set collection, tableau building card game.
Weight: Medium to light.
Number of players: 2 to 8 players. Best with 5 or 4.

Impression: Very interesting tableau building card game by Bruno Faidutti, in which players are choosing secretly a role from 8 (or 9) different roles numbered from 1 to 9 and passing the rest forward. After all roles are selected first player is calling their numbers starting from the lowest, at which point the player with that number reveals his selected card and performs corresponding actions. The goal is to build a city by playing city district cards in 5 different colors in your tableau by paying gold (usually). The first player to 8 districts triggers the end of the game after which the highest score wins. For every character you can chose, and all of them are fun, there is an alternative character in the expansion to keep the game fresh. 

Likes: Different roles with variable player powers. Bluffing. Purple districts with special powers.

Dislikes: Too long for a light game (with more players). Not good with fewer players. Large downtime. Possibility of players losing their turn against their best effort. King making and player induced imbalance.

RATING: 1
Too long, too boring, too frustrating (assassin + thief combo; hooray!). I played this a few times and always had a bad time hoping this game to end soon (which it did not). My absolute least favorite game. The fact that this is not a trashy or a light-hearted game, in which you could have fun mocking the game or opponents, but that you just silently wait till everyone has picked their roles, makes it my absolutely least favorite game of all time!

Yes, this is a hater vote, 'cause I hate the game! (As much as you can "hate" an inanimate object that causes no physical harm :))

Based on a single seven-player game this is a mediocre game.  Although there could be some potential here I just didn't feel that each turn offered many significant choices to make.

RATING: 7
This soon became one of my favourite games when I first played it way back in 2011 - and while I now prefer heavier games, I still think Citadels is excellent as an occasional game when you're looking for something light but not a mindless filler. While I hear that it can go on far too long with 7 or 8 players, we rarely play with more than 5, and it's about the right length with 3,4 or 5. In my opinion, it ranks alongside 7 Wonders as a quickish game for more or less any number. And 7 Wonders doesn't have mind games and "bluffing" like this. (I still prefer 7W, but Citadels, despite being very different, fills a similar niche.) Table talk is a must with Citadels (provided of course it is not overdone to the extent of giving away information to players that they shouldn't have).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Only played this a few times with 3 players. Everyone seemed to like it and I'm positive Citadels will have plenty of play time in the future.

Update: After several sessions with 5-7 players the game seems to be a winner. Mixing things up with the optional cards brings lots of variety.

For me Citadels has all the right ingredients but suffers greatly from inherent flaws that make it a "I'll play (without great excitement) but never suggest" gaming option as it's a game with potential that rarely transforms into an enjoyable gaming session for all involved.

Most notably, with 5 and more participants, you will often see a player at the bottom of the table with no option to remedy the situation early enough to have a fighting chance. He will often then play kingmaking throughout by sniping whoever he happens to be fairly sure has selected a role, whether that player is in a good position or not.

... thinking about it just now, this game is depressively broken, yet too cleverly fine-tuned to be easily 'fixed', despite the dozens of house rules that can be found on these forums. I can't think of any other game that can claim to be more than a prototype yet feels like one.

The first game in my collection and rather good one. It was Citadels that turn me into the board game geek :) Having lot of games in my collection now I play it sometimes mostly when I try to attract friends to the world of board games. Citadels is one of the best games to start with, I believe

It has been a very long time since I have played this. It's a great large group game with fun varying roles and pretty simple mechanics. I remember this being a good game to share over several rounds of beers.

Theme is okay. The expansion is required (IMO).

This game is at the top of my list to play for good reason. There are so many strategies that it boggles the mind. Should you try and out build your opponents, steal their cards, take their money, or just assassinate them. You never know who has which role and the roles change each turn.

People with great intuition for what the other person will do seem to always win or at least have a great shot at winning.
Most games are close and I keep the game moving so it does not drag on. I have yet to play this game and not enjoy it.

not enuff fun, too much pure 2guessing and buildings r dull

While some the games I have played have been somewhat enjoyable, the randomness of the thief/assassin taints this game a bit especially as the game is a bit on the long side.  (Repeated targets of the assassin fall behind the others in progress, but must stay to contest a losing position.)  Games that have spread the assassin/thief targets around have been more enjoyable than games where the same player seems to get hit over and over again.

Played with 4 players. Didn't like it all. Game felt long and unexciting. Maybe we played with a poor strategy, but there seems a big flaw in the game: The king of the previous round will choose his character first. The other players can do nothing of stopping him to be the starting player again. Even if one player picks the murderer and murders the king, he will be the starting player in the next round again.

Note, that in the 4 player game the murderer was not chosen very often (in fact, only once at game end) because his character is one of the less powerful ones.

Boring!

One of my all-time favourite games. Exellent with anywhere from 2 to 8 players, and it's easy to teach. I really like it as a 2 player game in particular, but the dynamics with a larger group can be equally entertaining.

My only small critism is that in a 3 player game, if you're paying attention, you can always name a character chosen by an opponent in a given round (when using the Assassin and Thief abilities). Because you see the character deck twice, whichever two cards are missing from the first time you saw the deck are necessarily the ones your opponents picked. You won't know which opponent chose what, but that doesn't matter that much; you'll be setting someone back for certain.

To correct this problem, in a 3 player game I suggest adding in the Artist (from the Dark City expansion) to the character deck. Then, before the starting player chooses his or her second character in a round, randomly discard one of the remaining characters face down. This means that the Assassin and Thief have a chance of naming the wrong character.

Played the Polish edition Cytadela, after hearing about the game for years.  It's clever, but is chaotic and too luck-based for my taste.  In the second game with 6 players, I lost 4 out of 8 turns and of course came in solidly last with no hope even for 5th place.  Not a lot of fun being a spectator for half the game.

Now this is one great card game. I never imagined that I would play it so much, but if you like to steal your opponents money, assasinate him or even raze his buildings to the ground, you will love it. The characters make the game excellent, the purple district cards add a very nice advantage if you can build them. So far, this is one of my favourite if not the most favourite card game. 2013 - Still my favourite :)

Oh, Citadels! This game got me into the hobby initially and it has earned a special place in my heart. Something in Citadels always creates an enjoyable mood, both relaxed and tense at the same time (save for occasions when somebody just doesn't accept the game). Antisipation of other players choices and desire to see if you'll be able to execute your plan for the turn mixes with unobtrusive friendly talk, which usually occurs due to short turns with long time between them, and it all results in a very pleasant atmosphere. It's not for everyone's liking, but when you have the right group, this is one of the best games to play.

--Dec2003-- Don't really mind the random factor that some have complained about.  Not too bad with 2, either.  Fun, and not particularly serious:  appropriate, given the author!
--Oct2011-- After a few years of not playing, my view has changed.  Today, it seems unfortunately capricious to the degree that I'd usually prefer to play something else.  I enjoy the game for a half hour, after which the continued knocking down the leader begins to manifest as tedium.
--Nov2014-- With the advent of [thing=170340]あやつり殺人事件[/thing] (which takes the character selection mechanism of Citadels for something shorter and admittedly sillier) I find myself even less inclined to play.

A card game about building your own citadels by hiring different helper each round. Those helpers have cut-edge special power which is more dominating than assisting (like the assasinator, who can stop you from an entire round!). The key is to survive from the assasination and to play large (expensive) cards. Once you succeed in playing the University, the game is yours. This game has down time, so prepare for an in-game dose ^_^

While sometimes one player can be accidentally hosed by other players, and there can be kingmaking problems at the end, this is still an entertaining game.

This game and Bang are the two best card games I own.  This game is a ton of fun, even though there is a bit of chance involved.  One game my poor friend got thieved or bewitched every round but once.  The poor guy just couldn't pick something that nobody wanted to not tamper with, so he finished the game with only a few districts.

My $20 copy came with the expansion that included doubles of the main card numbers for a completely flexible game.  And I think it plays 8 people instead of 7.  Including this expansion in the box set makes this game a must buy IMHO - the game has a lot of bang for your buck.

Recommend Adjustments: When I play, I always swap out the 1. Assasin card for the Witch,  and the 8. Warlord card for the Diplomat.  I find that these two expansion cards aren't so mean spirited as the originals, so players targeted by these two cards aren't hurt so badly.  This helps keep it fun for everyone.  Again, this is a great game!

I've only played the German version (Ohne Furcht und Adel) without the expansion cards, and only with two players. 

Of the two-player games which I have played with my girlfriend, this is probably the best. It's not complicated; it's the first game in which she has gone beyond understanding the rules and actually started thinking about how to win. In particular, I like the game of bluff and double bluff as you try to convince your opponent that you have taken a different character to the one that who have actually taken. I also like the fact that in the two-player game you can choose two characters each turn, making different combinations of skills possible. Overall, good fun.

EDIT: That said, the whole 50/50 guess with the Assassin is beginning to get a bit tiresome. I'm dropping my rating from a 7 to a 6.

Gave away when I left Germany.

An enjoyable game of city building. The 'hook' of choosing new roles each round really makes this game, as it provides the player interaction. I appreciate that you can tell how well you are doing as you go along (unlike, say, Ticket to Ride) but there's still a little suspense as to who will win, based on the 'first completion' and 'one of each type' bonuses.

RATING: 8
My favorite role-selection game. Easy enough to play with non-gamers as well (most of the time).

One drawback is that it sometimes ends up in a "stuck" situation where it drags on before someone finally triggers the endgame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like this game for two big reasons:

1) It can be taught to almost any non-gamer and grab their enthusiasm. (In the past half year, I've 'inspired' at least two non-gamers into buying their own copy).

2) It's a relatively small box and relatively short playing time, so it can be taken with me on many occasions.

The bluffing aspect of this game is what makes it so great. Bluffing about the role you're going to pick for your turn, bluffing about the 'quality' of the building cards you hold in your hand.
It works quit well as a two-player game too. My girlfriend loves to play this with me and kicks my ass all the time.

After many years and many plays, Citadels has shown itself to be a special game. It remains Faidutti's masterpiece, a great piece of design that feels more and more like it's been forgotten. It's a shame too, because some of what's done here is astonishing. The eight roles all feel so well considered. They pull at each other perfectly, and the game is such that all of them are picked at any given time.

The only downside is that it can sometimes run a little long. But in my experience this is more a function of people playing poorly than the game itself.

In all honesty this game is fantastic with 2 Players; about four playthroughs like this. If you're looking for a relatively quick 2 Player game this will do the trick. I've only played this once with the maximum amount of players (8) and I would never recommend playing this game that way: ever. By adding too many players the game's downtime increases significantly. There are way better board games that fit this 8 Player range than this. I have not played this with 3-7 Players but I would suspect this: I would try with 4, maybe 5, and feel 6-7 players will bog it down way too much again. All in all, I do not pull this game out too often.

I liked this game a whole lot more once I stopped playing it with lots of players. At this point the max number I play with is 5, and I prefer 4 or 3. With a condensed group, the wait time is reduced and the mystery of the role selection isn't lost. Add too many people and it becomes a dreadful chore, where the same roles are assassinated every turn and the game lasts way longer than desired.

A good light filler that creates some interesting stories to tell (man that assassin killed me 5x in a row!).  You can get locked out via some bad luck or cruel players, but it happens infrequently enough to not drag this down.  My only complaint is that the city building portion feels much less interesting than the role selection and interaction.

RATING: 8
One of my first 'real' game purchases and largely responsible for getting me hooked. The poker-like reading of people, coupled with the fact that you can actually apply logic and strategic thinking, this is a great game for a group of friends, and works well with 2 players to 4 players, but decreases in fun towards the high ends...

RATING: 6
I like the secret character selection each round, but the character you get drastically affects your ability to get things done. If the king stays in one place too long, the folks at the tail end get the shaft. Also, the assassin can make the game very boring if he kills you multiple times.

One of the early role selection games, with an enjoyable dose of bluffing and doublethink.

This is one of those games that depends on the group having the right attitude. The idea is to crush the other players, not to build your own little kingdom solitaire stylee.

I find that it is difficult to explain the game at first, but after jumping in and playing, everyone has a great time. It really is a simple game to understand once you get past the formidible explanation of how things work. It can drag, however, when people take forever to choose a character, or - even worse - they pick the assassin or thief and then take forever deciding to to kill/rob...DECIDE THAT WHEN YOU FIRST PICK THE CHARACTER!!!

I really enjoy Citadels - fun and clever with a huge bluffing component.  For me, one of the most interesting aspects of the game is how it runs with varying numbers of players.  For instance, a two player game is COMPLETELY different from, say, a six player game.  Both are totally unique (yet extremely fun) experiences.  My only complaint is that my cards are already showing significant wear-and-tear.  This is very irritating after barely ten plays (especially when there are expansion cards that have visibly different levels of wear).  I don't like card sleeves - better card stock (or maybe just edging the cards with white instead of black) would have been nice.

RATING: 8
Social interaction, light resource management and building.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Citadels is a role-based card game where players are racing to be the most prosperous city by building districts into your own city and possibly sabotaging the efforts of your rivals.  There are 8 different roles in the game, each offering a different power including, causing another role to lose its turn, stealing money from another role, swap hands with another player, get first pick of roles, protection, earn extra gold, build 2 districts in one turn, and destroy a rival's district.  Each turn the King shuffles the roles, discards 1-3 roles at random (one face down), then chooses from the remainder; each player then chooses a role from the remaining roles.  Each player acts in the order of their role which are numbered 1-8, with the lowest number going first.  In addition to acting on their special powers players must decide to either collect 2 gold or draw cards on their turn, then they have the option to spend their gold to build a new district.  The game ends when a player has built their 8th district at which time the value of each district is calculated and the player with the most points wins.

Citadels is a lighter strategy game and once all the players know what each role does the game plays fast.  The hardest choice players have is choosing which role they want from those available.  The roles are varied enough in power that no one role is superior to another in the long run.  Player interaction is limited to affecting another role (not player), with the notable exception of the ability to pay gold to destroy rival's district.  The distinction between stealing from a role and a player keeps the game from having a "take that" attitude, as you don't know who picked which roles until it is that role's turn to act.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Initially exciting, but has lost a bit of its appeal to me (after about a dozen games).

Some of the characters feel a bit too much like no-brainer choices if you get to pick first i.e. assassin (can't get killed/robbed, might take someone else out, get to act first).

Feels like it should be a light snappy game, but always seems to take a bit too long for comfort.

Need to play more and try the expansion cards before forming a full opinion.

Might be better with a larger group - with 4 people I feel like the king doesn't get picked (or even not in the deck) as often as he should be, meaning that the picking order gets static quite quickly.

Mostly played two player with Mrs Schkff, who loves it provided she wins. I sympathise with people who hate this game, as I would usually play something else. Really does scale very well from 2 to 7. The person who hates playing the most always gets assassinated on the first round, and then sulks for the remainder of the game. Tiresome in large groups if peole are stricken with AP - just choose the f*ing architect and pass the deck!

Citadels is a "hidden role" with "role slection" game for the slightly-less-than-casual gamer. It involves a lot of second-guessing and trying to read other players, but actually doesn't offer much in the way of game talk. It is not a difficult game to learn, although leeway must be given for the first play. It is a city building exercise, though three roles, the assassin, thief and magician add player interaction by killing, stealing gold or stealing cards from other players in that order. This is a game that I play with non-gaming friends alongside Resistance, Telestrations and Dixit. I would definitely recommend this game if you don't have a similar game with hidden role selection like Libertalia.

Great for a large group of players who know the rules well enough to keep this ticking over at a quick pace. It's not rocket science, just good fun guessing what others are playing amongst the chaos.

5.12.12 - Didn't play this for two years then bought a copy. Just played a couple of 2 player games. Not sure if it's worth playing 2 player, especially when I've got Battle Line, Haggis, W:I, BB:TM, etc that are better card games.

UPDATE Jun-27-2010:
Very nice with 4 and 5. 5 is probably better. It gets frustrating to be the target of "ad hoc" assassination, which can happen when someone picks assassin just to avoid being assassinated, and they randomly pick just your role for no specific reason. It would be nice to have some consolation prize for the victim. I have no similar problem with the thief, whose victim seems to receive more analysis. But maybe I just need to play more.

This game is one of the first that I owned and has hit our table numerous times. 
Apart from the game itself there are 2 main advantages which give it a TEN. 1st it can be played from 2 to 8 people giving an extreme flexibility. 2nd it can grab ALL kind of different people, from the strategic player to the newcomer and satisfy them as one of the most interesting games that they have played.
It is a mix of strategic play, psychological understanding of your opponents and screwing them at the same time and I have to admit that for me it is very difficult to win but the FUN compensates every play. Keep in mind that IMO it's also a WOMEN'S game and they almost always win:) The screw factor is their game. Beware of them...

Played a solo walkthrough of a 4-player session to learn the game. Stopped after building five districts (instead of eight). It looks like it could take awhile to get through a proper game of this. I can usually tell what I'll think of a game after a walkthrough, but this one left me uncertain. It's more than a 6 and less than a 10, but I'm not sure where it'll end up rating. It might be fun with the right group, I'm just not sure I know anyone who belongs to that group. Also, while I definitely like the butterscotch coins, the card quality of this FFG version is - as everyone else seems to mention - truly abysmal. The character cards are showing signs of wear after only half a session...Inconceivable!?!

A great, nasty tableau building game in which other players can destroy your buildings and assassinate your role for that turn. Very in your face and cutthroat.

This game has roles (and special abilities) associated with turn order, and  every round you draft which role you want to play.  Some roles are more likely to effect other specific roles directly, and some roles won't even make it into the drafting pool.

Very cool that this game can play up to 7 players, and it's not too hard to explain.

Has gradually slipped in my rankings with more and more plays.  Still, a lot of fun (group dependant).  Especially when you say "Assssasssin" in a slithering voice.

A lot of chaos, and a whole lot of fun, although I like to only play to building 6 cards - the end game can seem to drag on forever sometimes which can really start killing the good times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great game for 3 or 4 players. A good game for 5 maybe, and a sort of lame game for 6 or more. On the up side, not a lot of games can be played AT ALL with 6 or more players, so it's nice to have that option.

I loved this game at first, but it seems to drop in my mind each time I play it, which makes me feel guilty. I love the drafting of roles, but there's not enough skill in winning. I've seen great players lose simply by bad assassin luck and horrible players win for no good reason. This would be ok if the game took a LITTLE less time, perhaps.

RATING: 7
Too much downtime and the potential to have long gaps between actions if you get killed too frequently.  I'll play it again, but it won't be my suggestion.  Not to mention that the decisions don't seem to make that big of an impact.  I finished with 15 points and was pretty close to players who had played much better than I had.

I have amended my rating due to how quick it plays in the free online version on Citadelles.net.  Against the AI's, it allows the game to just flow much better without all of the downtime.  A solid little game online that gets a 7 online as opposed to a 5/6 live.

A great game with 6 or 7 players. The uncertainty of what role everyone has chosen is lots of fun. With a crowd that enjoys conversation the down time while everyone is choosing their roles isn't a problem since you can totally ignore what's happening in the game when it not your turn.

I really enjoyed my one play of this and look forward to being able to play again.  Unfortunately, 2 of our players didn't seem to intent on the game which made for some difficult situations.  I suppose that might be true for most games, though.  I really like changing roles as well as the city building aspect of the game.  It really did not seem to me that luck was all that deciding of a factor.

If you have the soul of politician and skill of poker-face, than check out this great game. There are several (or better say many) rule variants, both oficial and unoficial, to try out.

RATING: 7
This works better that it has a right to: It's very simple to pick up and play as theme makes rules intuitive. The interaction level is quite high. The roles make the game dramatic - Assassin more or less makes the game (thief and magician mop up the rest of villainy): the stakes are high as both negative and positive cards have strong aspects. 

Now, who you shouldn't play this with. As the bluff and doublethink are in the forefront, the game is actually better with seasoned gamers, though not necessarily seasoned in the game, but being mature, able to take on conflict and not to delve into some personal agendas or pure randomness. Also: while not necessary, the game is better with the right atmosphere that rides this drama I described - better with people who know each other and are loud.

The first game (with 7 players) was quite chaotic. Afterwards I've got into it a bit more (with less people). Personally, I like the 2 and 3 player version the most (to me it offers the most in bluffing and strategical thinking). It takes too long for what it offers.

RATING: 6
Played 1 4P game. Of all the hidden role selection games I have played, this has the most 'take that' moments. It takes quite a bit of time to play because of the constant building up and destruction going on.

The role drafting mechanism is good, but also rather clunky in how it is executed. When playing with big groups, it takes a while for players to select their roles (as they have to pay attention to the possible roles taken, and the ones remaining) and it isn't very fun calling out numbers and waiting for players to respond.

I'm told that this game requires the right people to play it. I've always found it a lot of fun, with backstabbing that is somehow light enough that it doesn't tend to make people angry. Also good with the expansion. The version I have is from Europe and is called Machiavelli. I think it's a better name, and I don't know why the English one is called Citadels - the name has less character.

[4 plays] This has some depth, is very portable, plays quickly, and the role selection mechanic is nifty. There is some psychology here and some tactical considerations. But this can easily be treated as a light social filler game and enjoyed on a level similar to Bang!

I wasn't overwhelmed the first time we played this, but a lot of it has now clicked for me. I think I really like it now and look forward to more. 5 players seems like a very good number for this game. 3 players was also interesting.

#91 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

Citadels was one of the first modern games that I learned, and I still think it's a great game. Players select their own role from the available characters- each of whom have a special ability. Everyone is trying to get the most points by accumulating gold and playing city cards into their tableau. Some of the character roles mess with other players, such as the Assassin (kills someone for the round) and the Thief (steals a characters money), so there is a lot of bluffing and double think that goes into choosing which character you take each round. Maybe the Merchant's power would really benefit you, but it might be too obvious that you'd select him, making yourself a target, which could mean you'd get no turn at all. Some of the cards also have powers that effect the gameplay. Games are usually fairly quick, though the ability of one character to destroy cards can extend the playing time. But this one has never overstepped its welcome with me.

Updated: played again recently and while the role selection mechanic was groundbreaking for its time, the game rewards experience and players who have no idea what they are doing tend to give the game away to others. Still, it's a simple system that works really well. Clever.

This game is just fun.  It will also leave you with stories to tell long after the game is over. You have role selection combined with the tactical prediction on what each of your opponents will select on their turn along with double bluffs.  It is also a game that can handle a large group with a short rule explanation and is good if taken seriously or played just for fun.

Rating depends on number of players. Sweet spot ist three or four. With five or more it is terrible, unless players really concentrate, which is unlikely with this game. Takes too long for what it is with more than five.

I've played this with a group of four and a group of seven.  Both times were immense fun, but I had issues with the number of roles available and selected.  I think the sweet spot is either five or six players.

Citadels can be played by 2-7 players, but with 5 or more, our games have bogged down horribly. After playing some fun 3 and 4 person games, I actually turned some newbies OFF to European games by trying to play a six person game of Citadels.

And the game gets really predictable with 2 players. So, I'd play it with 3 or 4 if requested. Those games were a hoot. It can be a lot of fun, but I still don't like the downtime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Wonderful game: one of the few that works great with larger groups.  A unique round structure: everyone secretly chooses the roles of Assassin, King, Bishop, etc, each blessed with a special ability.  The round is then played out not in the order of players, but in the order of roles, with the Assassin going first, the Thief going second, and so forth until all the players have moved.  Being predictable and choosing the role best for your situation can be deadly, as the Thief and Assassin target roles, not players.  To speed up play in larger groups, we recommend that new players think about the role they want as soon as they're done, as there can be a lot of downtime waiting for people to read about and select roles.

Only reason I haven't gotten rid of this one is that it's tiny. I like the role drafting concept, but it's layered on top of probably the most boring game possible. Haven't played this one in ages and will likely give it away at some point. It was one of my first games, and i would still recommend it to new players, but I just find it very dull. Maybe if it were 15 minutes long instead of 45-60 I would like it more? I dunno.

Tried for the first time with three players and had to give up, because it just wasn&#039;t working well at all.  After months, nobody was at all interested in playing again, so I just sold it.  I am sure that it is a good game, but it just wouldn&#039;t work for our group.

a myriad of strategies to try and pick through to gain victory. Actions of the other players must be taken into account. I certainly haven't got the hang of it yet as I'm yet to win a game.

Additional: Still haven't won, still can't seem to get a good break which is lowering my enthusiasm and dropping the rating a point.

Theres little point me playing this game ever...

Additional Additional: Further plays of this game leave me with a feeling of deep frustration. The point of playing games for me is to have fun. This game only annoys me. Bon Voyage to it.

Nagyon jól eltalált játék. Körönként más-más szerepekbe bújva feladat a legtöbb pontot érő birodalom leghamarabbi kiépítése. Változatos, izgalmas játék. A szerepválasztáskor adódhatnak hosszú gondolkodási idők.

Egy játék van bekönyvelve, de nekem gyanús, hogy játszottam én már ezzel többször is. Arra is rosszul emlékeztem, hogy szapultam volna a játékot, de most ennek tényleg eljött az ideje. Egyrészt bármikor véletlenül megölhetnek és kirabolhatnak a játékban. Az ellenfél se tudatosan teszi legtöbbször még az adott szerep választását sem. Ha ez megtörténik veled nagy valószínűséggel nem tudsz nyerni a játékban. Simán megtörténhet akár, hogy megölnek és még a lapjaid is elveszik, ezek után tulajdonképpen már csak végigasszisztálod az egész játékot. A kezdeti épületek véletlenszerű kiosztása is nagy szerencsefaktor. A királycsinálás a hadúrral szintén a játék része. Aki ebben a játékban nyer az biztosan tudja, hogy nem a jó stratégiája, taktikája miatt nyer, hanem a szerencséje okán. A játék partijátéknak túl hosszú sok személlyel, óriási a holtidő. Kevés játékossal meg kevésbé lehet jó. Nagyon nehéz bármi jót találnom ebben a játékban. Nem szívesen játszanék többet vele. 6->2

RATING: 7.6

Cons: the game I think has a tendency to allow someone to perpetuate being the lead player - but this is offset by the character abilities and if you "hog" one character you can suffer as you limit your playing scope. I find the warlord & magician is a bit odd as its the only ability characters that allow for 'player' targeting rather than 'character' targeting which is the way on which all the other characters such as the assassin and theif work so it can feel a bit personal at times - though its a nice mechanic to stop a leading player from winning.

Pros: this is a ripper of a game! In all, its interesting and easy but complicated enough to allow for fun player to player interaction and for 'secret strategies' which I always liked in a game. Pretty art work and some of the district cards have fantastic juicy abilities. We had great fun playing this with 4 players. The theme is nicely intergrated too.

Drafting/character-selection game. Some of the take-that characters can have a negative effect on the game, and if they hit the same player 2-3 times (even by accident), it is almost impossible for the person to still win, as resources are scarce. Combined with the 1 h game length, that makes this game less attractive for me to play. Used to like it quite a bit though.

Abilities which target a role instead of a player offer a nice change of pace, opening up bluffing and alternate strategies.  Game length is a little long, though no doubt play speed would increase with experience.

Brilliant little cardgame, classic Faidutti (enforced player interaction). This is one the best-looking (card)games available, and features elegant gameplay. 
Will never turn down a play. 

Interesting bit is, it is fun with any number of players, although allows much heavier strategy if playing with 2 or 3.

RATING: 7
This is a clever card game that plays more like a board game.  One reason that I love this game is that it works so well with a wide range of players.  I have played 2-player and 7-players and just about everything in-between.  They are all good.  (Although 7-players can have too much down time.)

I heartily recommend this game.  It's small, so it easily fits in the bag, and it gives you a depth of options from 2 to 8 players.

I own a copy of the original Ohne Furcht und Adel, but I recently picked up a copy of the Citadels.  The Citadels version has 10 more characters, which can be used depending on your whims.

RATING: 5
Seems like a solid game, and I could appreciate the deduction and strategy here. Unfortunately I think it's just "too long for what it is." Can't see ever really wanting to play this over other 90 minute time slot games. Too few players seems like it wouldn't work, but too many takes too long. I played with 4 players and that was probably actually ideal.

I think most games with good players will end up with perceived winner getting railed on until someone squeaks by, which makes the late game pretty tedious. 

In my one play I actually lucked out by the "King" being absent so many times in a row while I held the Crown that I was able to straight up dominate my opponents without them being able to pound me into submission (and probably kingmake someone else). But I got lucky.

Most of the cards (buildings) are boring. Half of the roles are boring.

I love this game both played with two players and multiple players.  It remains one of my favorite two player card game.  Addictive.  The two player version has a tendancy to be played over and over and over...  For some reason I feel this game works best with 2, 3, 5, 6 & 7.  With 6 & 7 play to one less city or it can really bog down.

Scales well with small and large groups, and is pretty easy to learn.  The cut-throatedness isn't a real problem with a midly tolerent group of people.  Its also a good game for a mixed gender/intrest/familiarity group, largely because the player interaction isn't direct.

I've only played this with two or three players at this point, but at least with those numbers it is very mind-gamey. Figuring out what roles your opponent has, while trying to choose roles that they can't figure out (and therefore can't murder or rob) is very fun. My only complaint is that the game tends to run a little long for the amount of stuff that actually happens, mostly from doing role selection before every round. I can forgive this though as the role selection mechanic is quite fun.

BSW play (where it's known as Ohne Furcht und Adel) is brisk and pleasurable. Rewards repeated play. Familiarity with roles and turn order is critical to decision making and takes a turn or two at the board to "master." That said, it pretty much feels like the same game over and over; always just a question of which card you GET to pick and which card that someone else picked is gonna nail you to the wall. . .strategy appears elusive and takes a "back seat" to tactics.

A very good game. It's easy to learn and if you like player interaction and role-selection - this is a must try.

The core of the game is the character selection phase, where each player secretly chooses a character with different abilities. it's all about guessing which character the other players choose and then choosing the character that benefits you the most. With the wrong character you can loose you entire turn or all your gold and with the right one, you can either receive bonuses or screw your opponents.

After playing online at http://www.amarriner.com I have gained a new appreciation for this game. It's always fascinating to speculate about who is going to do what, and immensely satisfying when your own guile pays off.

I've had good and bad experiences with this game.  Advanced buildings permit complexity in strategy.  Guessing how your opponent will play is a key factor in winning.

I really like this game with 2-3 players and dislike it with 5 or more. Every additional player further slows down the game. The special rules for 2-3 players make the game more dynamic and strategic since you can make nice combos when selecting 2 characters each turn instead of 1.

The extra characters are a nice plus since you can play a different selection of characters each game, by replacing a few of the original ones for the new ones.

It's usually recommended for big groups but I do the opposite and would never choose Citadels when I have a big group at the table, too slow and boring, play it with 2 or 3 people, 4 MAX!.

Just fantastic if played with the right group (people who can see this game as a fun one, not a serious "i have to win this" game) and with people who won't take it personally when they get assassinated or burgled. Fantastic artwork too - which I didn't know about, but was really surprised by. This is an easy game to teach, as you just tell what stuff does and in a few rounds people generally figure it out. Of course, the way the roles all work together is brilliant, as has been stated many times before. The only caveat I have is that I don't like this game with too many players - even though some people think that's a strength of this game. With more than 5 the game can take too long for what it is, in my opinion. And, I love this game as well with just two players - very snappy and fun. There is luck in the card draws, as this is a card game, but again, if you go in without being too serious there is a ton of fun to be had here.

Light chaotic fun in a pretty package.  I can see where this might get a tad formulaic with repeated plays.  Good, clean implementation of ideas.  I imagine the expansion would help keep it fresh for several more plays.  Pluses: easy to teach, opportunity for fun table talk, some challenge.  Minuses: getting stuck as last player for several rounds because the king is building royal buildings and getting asassinated, multiple levels of chaos prevent any meaningful planning.  Relatively easy to utterly destroy the leader.

It is not terrible for what it is, but I suggest that to maximise the fun in this game, one has to limit the number of players (to about 5, or 6 at a push), keep everything moving and be prepared for downtime while roles are being selected.

First play was in less-than-ideal conditions, in dim light and with only one experienced player among the six of us.  I do like some of the psychological aspects of the game (who will choose what?), but the game was a bit slow and tough to figure out.  I'll have to play it more and see if it moves up in rating.

UPDATE: While it does have some quality psychological aspects, it's simply a bit long for what it is.  Meuterer is a faster moving card game, but unfortunately does not accommodate as many players.

Casual game with surprising strategic depth in the role selection mechanism. Pervaded by bluffing and conflict, Citadels is good, though long. Best played with an outgoing group, or with friends; downtime can be an issue with serious gamers. With the right group, in the right mood, it's great fun; with the wrong one, it falls flat. It's a bit like Bang! that way. My enjoyment of both is inversely related to the solemnity of the room.

It's hard to know exactly where to place Citadels in my games collection. The concept is pretty simple but the selection of roles means that there is definitely strategy involved. My parents are a good benchmark for introducing games to those not fully immersed in the hobby and they enjoyed this.

Players select roles and take turns in order building buildings of various types, some of which modify basic game play. Game ends in round when anyone builds 8th building. Get points for variety of colors, being first to build 8, etc. Most points wins. The key feature is the role selection where players take turns choosing a role, and everyone has imperfect knowledge about which roles were available for everyone to choose from (earlier in turn order know more, and have more choices). Roles do various things, like steal from another character, get a bonus income from specific building types, become starting player, etc.

The game takes ENTIRELY too long with more than 4 or so players. Also, it really stinks when you keep getting hit by the Assassin, and just sit there for much of the game!

Fun game, though it can get rather chaotic at times.  Scratches a similar itch to Puerto Rico, but I can't take it nearly as seriously.  Probably a good thing, really!

Edit 11/15/09:  Citadels has certainly eclipsed San Juan in terms of my urge to play, and the two games fit into a similar niche.  Citadels has a screw-you factor decidedly missing from either SJ or PR, but it's light enough it doesn't matter.

Edit 01/08/13:  Revised up to an 8.5, which I suspect will be a constant rating going forward.  Top notch game, and a go-to title when I've got 3-5 players looking for some strategy but not too many rules.

RATING: 7
I love the blend of mechanics for this game.  Card drafting, role selection, money management, tableau building, and hidden roles.  They all work really well together.

The biggest complaint I have about the game is the kingmaker aspect.  Every time a player manages a good turn and ends a round with a stockpile of gold or nice special building the whole rest of the table sees blood and they can find themselves not having fun as they're robbed, razed, or forced to skip their turn only to see another player win unmolested with the "slow and steady" approach.

NEVER play this game with less than 4 players, it's awful.  Having the roles go around twice allows the first player to pick the assassin or thief and guarantees he will hit one of his opponents.  I think there needs to be at least some gamble that the assassin and thief completely miss to make the game balanced.  The thief is weakened a little bit unnecessarily too.  If the thief targets one of the roles that goes later in the round, since you play two roles you can use up all your gold with your first turn and give the thief nothing.  There are several other problems with Citadels when played with less than 4 that we've encountered as well, it is just not at all well-designed for that number, but I still think it is a good game for 4+ (although I have yet to play it with 7+ which I think would include the same early-pick assassin/thief issue as with less than 4).

Had a game where one player basically had like 3 real turns because he kept getting hit randomly by the assassin. I won that game because I was tied with another player in the last turn who would've won with the tiebreaker and someone who wasn't even close to the lead was left with the Warlord and had to make a decision. There are much better games than this now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Superb game with 3 with each player taking 2 characters per round. Can get draggy with more players, scalability questionable. Gateway material although new players do take awhile to familiarize themselves with the different characters. Only willing to play with the original mix, expansion characters feel somewhat overpowered. A 7 with 3, a 6 with any other number of players.

RATING: 7
Only played a few 2-players so far, and quite good fun (though not exactly the wife's favourite style of game); looking forward to getting some 6-7 player action soon, as I think it's got real potential to be a riot.

Update - now played with 6 on hols; wow! Felt quite slow moving, but we had a stonking ending with Dan playing a blinder - warlording F on the turn he would have won, and then assassinating the warlord the following round as he proceeded to build his 8th district. Classic.

...(ooh! my first session report!).

A classic role selection game. Sadly, this game suffers from tons of downtime, where there's absolutely nothing to do. It can also overstay its welcome, so I recommend playing to 7 points and replacing the Warlord with the Diplomat (from the expansion). Libertalia and Mission: Red Planet do role selection much better.

This was my favorite game for a while. I actually haven't played it in some time, which is too bad. I like the role selection, and the mechanics seem to work well (although we do play with a slight variation that I feel improves the game: no matter the number of players, play with the 7 player variant). The artwork is beautiful and gameplay is pretty quick. I haven't played with any of the bonus characters but hope to.

This used to be my favourite card game before I really got into trick-taking games. Reverse psychology is the central issue in this game, building comes second. I think it's best with five. With less, too few characters are used and with more it drags severely.

RATING: 5
This game would be higher on my ratings if it didn't take so long.  I usually play with a home rule of 9 victory points, because that 10th one seems to take forever to get.  With 4 or 5 players this game can easily drag on for 90 minutes - far too long for a game that's essentially a stack of cards.  If you can manage to endure the length though, this game does role selection very well, and can lead to some tense and competitive decisions.

The real part of the game is the role selection. It is ostensibly a city building game but it doesn't work. I hate it as a 2 or 3 player game.

The role selection part feels like half a game to me.

After playing this game a few times I have revised my initial rating of it.  I love the concept of the game but it can have a lot of down time with a large group (i.e. more than 4 people) particularly if some players are not familiar with the roles you can choose.  Still, with a smaller group this is a good game with a good mix of luck, strategy, and player interaction.

RATING: 5
Way too much downtime.  Probably more time spent doing nothing than any game I can think of.  Game mechanics are decent, if nothing great.  Main strategy seems to be do just be something that you don't think anyone will assassinate over and over again until you win.  Which isn't all that fun.  Overrated simply because it is cheap, and because it is fun to assassinate your friends.

[Based on many plays]  Easy to learn, plays fast and is pretty fun.  Although it plays lighter, more chaotic, and random than my favorite games it does provide good entertainment value.  A great filler game with a larger group of people.  An all around good game for a gaming group a person to have because it fills that 7-8 player nitche well.  Every once in a while you have that many players and it is hard to find a good game to play and this one works good.  It has some similarites to San Juan if you are familar with that game, but this game has a lot more confrontation and ability to mess with other people.  Some will like that some will not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun, game with variable roles that works out to be very well balanced and just the right length for what it is. Something all card games should aspire to. 
As a gateway game: some people may not like the thief and warlord and find the "take that" aspect too nasty, so it needs the right crowd.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
[FFG 03 edition w/o expansion] {Medieval, city building, fantasy; double-guessing, variable-player-powers, role-selection, utility cards; optimal 4p} Citadel is a thematic card game. Each player chooses a character to help him each turn and tries to be the most successful architect in a fantasy land. The artwork is good but the quality of cards is average.  Besides, there are many unnecessary components in the box, which makes the game larger than necessary and expensive! :(

There is a lot of player interaction in Citadels.  The character selection is the core of this game, which provides the fun, decisions and even intrigues.  The game time is just right for 4-5 players (around 30 minutes) but it easily run long for 6-7 players (longer than 45 minutes). 

Citadels is balanced between luck and tactical moves in 4/5p game.  If a player is in short of a particular resource (building, card, gold), he can get characters to help himself.  It also offers several strategies for scoring - have 8 cheap buildings quick, opt for expensive buildings, opt for a collection of buildings, etc.  However, it becomes chaotic and has strong down time in 6-8p game. Thus, I prefer the short version (7 buildings) in a large group.

[Expansion] I won't buy the new expansion because I don't think it has any thing special. USD8 for the extra new 14 purple buildings is somewhat expensive. I would rather FFG can just provide a cheap package of the new 14 cards like Bang! A fistful of cards.

[Update] The new edition has nicer bits: color card-back, king-pawn, smaller box and color rulebook. It's more attractive.

It plays differently depending on the number of players. With 2p more tactical, with 4+ more chaotic. 3p has problems with drafting mechanics (you can be sure which roles have been taken, making them easy prey for thief or assassin).

With more players I suggest shortening game to 7 or even 6 buildings.

[comments on the German edition components only] The HiG edition had excellent components compared to the 1st French edition. Cardstock of good quality, nice gold coins, and a plastic device used to hold the cards during the play ('sabot' in French; 'Shoe' is the English term from the Baccarat)

I like the drafting part and most of the game. I really don't like the assassin. Losing an entire turn seems kind of brutal. Not only do you lose your turn, but then you are waiting quite awhile before you can play again. And, guess what? You can be assassinated multiple times if you're really unlucky. I don't like games where there is too much "waiting around" to play.  I would like this game a lot better with a little modification to that one card.

The Assassin mechanic in this game is the single most frustrating mechanic in any game.  It's common to get assassinated three times in a row when you aren't even the intended target.

Have both Ohne Furct and Citadels and have not played the former since getting the latter.  (Though I prefer the foreign edition components.)

Awful with 6, 7, or with even one slow player.

EDIT:  Played a couple times with 2-3 and it is better that way.  It moves much more quickly.  Still, not a whole lot seperates this from other guessing, bluffing games like Hoity Toity.  And that is not a genre that strikes me as having substantial replayability.

Crucial to enjoying this game is that you can play it with a group (the larger the better) which gets the roleplaying aspect of this game. Playing it "abstractly" (not building a city, but acquiring victory points; not assassinating an opponent, but forcing a player to skip a turn) is possible, but makes the game much less worth playing. Sadly, the character cards wear out quite fast -- consider using sleeves for them.

Two-player games are awesome as well.

[u]Key Words:[/u] Medieval - Secret Role Selection - Card Drafting - 2-7 Players - 1h

[u]Summarized Opinion:[/u] 4+ players = too chaotic! Need to try with 2-3 players.

[u]My Rating Explained:[/u] Comment needs update.

[u]Verbose Assessment:[/u]

I've only played this game with 5 or more people, and the game is definitely too chaotic for me with that player count. People don't know what's going on, just do something, and invariably someone gets killed or mugged all the time. It sucks to be that guy.

But the design intrigues me a lot, and I can't help but wonder what it'd be like with 3 or 2. It seems to me that control would be a lot better, and I might enjoy the game more that way.

So I definitely want to try again.

RATING: 6
A decent role selection game.  I like a lot of the double-guessing that goes on, but I don't like how the game practically refuses to end.  It's a lot of fun up until someone gets close to winning.  Then it becomes "beat on the leader".  Reminds me of a Steve Jackson game in that regard.

It seems to run a little too long for the relatively straightforward gameplay. If played in smaller (4-5) numbers by gamers taking 30 seconds per turn, it can move along nicely.

Role selection city building card game. At the start of each round players select one of eight roles, each of which provides a special power e.g. the assassin allows you to murder one of your opponents' roles, the king becomes the starting player, the warlord allows you to destroy one of your opponents buildings etc. Once this is done, cards depicting buildings are placed into the players' tableau each costing a certain amount of currency to construct. Once eight building cards have been placed, the game ends. This is a relatively fast paced game and some thought has to go into which role to select and when based on what you are hoping to achieve and what you think your opponents are planning on trying to accomplish. On the negative side you feel somewhat constrained by the limited number of buildings available to you each turn and their isn't a lot of variety offered beyond the role selection which leads to games lacking in strategic depth.

So far this game has scaled well for 2-4 players.  It does so much for a small game.  Very well received even with the nastiness of Assassin and thief.  We tried playing with the witch and tax collector substituting but everyone missed the originals so they went back in.  I very much enjoy predicting people's actions and one uping them with the perfect character, much to their dismay.

this is a game that starts off slowly so it might benefit from some sort of jump start. Also the building aspect seems rather simplistic compared to the quite interesting role selection aspect; it's like the vict pt system was simply tacked on. What impresses me most is how well the roles work without rule issues, I dont think we had any. So this game would be an 8 for design and mechanics more like a 7 for how much I want to play again. It takes a little long for what it does but its worth the experience at least once.

What impresses me most is how well the roles work without rule issues, I dont think we had any. So this game would be an 8 for design and mechanics more like a 7 for how much I want to play again. It takes a little long for what it does but its worth the experience at least once.

Fun interactive card game with substantial depth and playability I suspect.  It helps to have played it a bit I should think, so you get to grips with the cards and the rhythm of the round.  But a simple premise and minimal components makes it an easy game to pick up and play.

Played this at a regular all-day gaming marathon with 4 other players. Only one of the players had played it before (and he is pretty autistic) but another player from the group came over and was able to give us a quick tutorial. Didn’t play with the expansion but I did like it and think it was good for a gaming group, but doubt it would be good as a two-player. All and all, I am pretty happy with the trade (traded Mr. Jack Pocket).

8->6
I like this game for 4 or 5 players. It seems to be a very easy game. But it has a second ground. Chosing a character is very interesting. When you choose always the best character for you, someone could block you (for example with the assasin). But when you never choose the best character for you, you won`t play efficently and will not win. So in Citadels you have a psychologic game. 

For 2 or 3 players the game changes its character. You choose 2 persons. The game looses his psychological aspect and becomes a card combo aspect. I don`t like it. It`s not so original and interesting like for 4 and more people.

For more than 5 players the game has a too big downtime.

Edit: Could be frustrating if you`re few rounds in a row the target of the thief or the assassin.

Just got this really enjoying it but might have overdosed with online play.  Will have to revisit this again in the future

New: Dec 2010 score 9
Still loving this, I gave up the online play pretty soon it was good to learn that way but face to face play is o much more satisfying.  There is a lot of depth to be found here in what is a simple game at heart.  I've upped the score to 9 as we recently started to use the dark city role cards and the game just got a lot nastier.  Lucy loves this too game which it a bit odd for someone who dislikes conflict in games as it just so darn nasty sometimes.

Citadels is a fun small card game you can play with a surprising level of depth for such a simple card game.  I liked the theme and the building of structures and the idea of the role selection and turn orders.  We had some interesting things happen with the King since a player can effectively get stuck with that role which seemed to expose some flawed mechanics, but all in all the game worked.  If it felt a little more balanced and polished I would bump it up a point or two, I really do like the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simply put I haven't played a game of this I didn't enjoy. Tried it with a number of players, it's mechanics work brilliantly and it has a "You bastard" quality that I (but so few of you) enjoy. The changing turn order works well as does the secret role choosing creating a wonderful mechanic. Generally its an easy game to teach people with some hidden depth making it well worth anyone’s collection. The Dark City expansion keeps it interesting and fresh!

Unmatched with the right players.  A key problem can be if there's one or two people who are the type that have to re-read what every character does, every single time they're choosing, the game will drag on forever.  Barring that, I haven't found the game to drag on like others have stated.  Not too many plays; with more play, this rating might go up.

Revised in January 2010 from 7 to 6.  I enjoy this game and have said for months I want to play it.  Then I don't.  I look at the players around me and I just don't think the people want to play it either.  As I choose the games and game night attendance is often contingent on making sure people enjoy themselves, I hold off.

I bought this one in Munich, as a souvenir.  Thankfully, I managed to choose a good game - even though I didn't speak the language (and had yet to discover BGG).   

My copy is now well-worn, and I've marked up the cards with english translation to make it more accessible.  

Although I've moved onto other (and better) games, this one still hits the table every once in a while.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Game really starts to drag with 6 or 7 players.  Each player has so little control over how the game plays out that the winner seems fairly random.  It is rarely a close game for more than two people.  I also think that the rule that you cannot use the warlord on anyone who has 8 buildings is terrible, but I can see how it creates kingmaking due to open points.  I think the warlord is a bit weak, since spending money to reduce another player's score helps everyone else at the table at your own expense.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Semi-entertaining, screw-your-buddy type game. This doesn't hit the table so much for my group because we only tend to play with a large number of folks.

Also, everyone playing needs a thick skin, because it seems that its inevitable that one sucker gets killed from or stolen from the whole game and has a really bad time.

My experience with Citadels is surely described in Dante's Inferno - which I could have read during the downtime.  We played with 8 players and through losing my turn on consecutive turns, I once went 45 minutes without doing anything.  At the end of the game, the "Dodge" Diplomat character got to choose the winner among three suitors.  Absolutely NO catch-up mechanism.  I was out one hour into our three hour game and had to endure.  No incentive to draw good characters, who are either bewitched or theived.  No incentive to build good structures - which are theived or destroyed.  I'm bringing a book to the next gaming session just in case this hits the table.

Am I really ranking this below Candyland?  You can play Candyland in less than 2 hours and the random nature of the game is more apparent.

Citadels is heavily chaotic, but in a good way.  You never know when you are going to be assassinated or have your hand or money stolen, so it doesn't pay to be too serious or plan ahead too much.  However, it can be quite a lot of fun if you just roll with the changes every turn.

This is a great game.  The variablility of of what character controls your (and your opponents) city makes for a delightfully fluctuating game.  Also, the management of city district cards add a thoughful turn to the game - i.e. just &#039;cause you finish first doesn&#039;t mean you win.  My two knocks on the game would be that 1) you need to play with other people that can adapt to the strategy of this game.  2) It is possible for one player to continually get screwed by the assassin or thief characters.  Still, I love to play this one.

RATING: 6.5
There is some really good stuff here, and I can see why people like it, but it feels so light yet with a high player count drags on. But the worst part is the potential to essentially not have a turn for no good reason but mostly bad luck (I admit there is some skill in bluffing here), but that should make for a very bad game. Really not a good idea. Assassin tension is sometimes fun, sometimes annoying. The drafting is really good, the tableau building is simple but works, and the ability to mix up the roles is nice. Unfortunately though, the assassin and thief cards are simultaneously the worst and best parts of this game, as they both make it interesting and kind of nerf it.

Another old classic that we haven't played for years, and has now been dragged up out of the vaults. Quite good fun, though not as great as I remember, from the days when we hadn't been spoilt by playing all the best Euro-games. Rather longer playtime than I remember too, which makes it difficult for our group. We tried a variant to hurry things along. This sped things up considerably, albeit at the cost of a little strategy. On balance, the variant is probably slightly better than the original. Still difficult for us to fit in a lunch time though, so unlikely to be played regularly.

Fairly good game. The role selection and city-building combination is fun, with the role-selection providing a good amount of player interaction and the city-building scratching the itch to try out different strategies and combinations for the most effective, efficient cities. The rules vary quite a bit depending on the number of players, which allows it to scale nicely (two players can have a good time with this!); however, the length varies significantly. With two or three players, this is done in 30 minutes or less; with more, you're looking at a much longer game, and because it feels pretty light, it might drag a bit. Also, the repetition in your limited actions--take two gold, take one card--can get stale, so it's really the player inaction that makes it worthwhile.

There's a reason Bruno Faidutti has acquired a large following of late ... this is it. Update: More than a decade after Citadels rocketed to fame, I find I like it less and less as a big multi-player affair. It's just too long and random that way. Pretty interesting as a two-player game, though, and it hangs on in my collection because of that alone.

Before there was Dominion, there was Citadels.  The comparison really isn't fair, only because Dominion was so revolutionary.

I wasn't crazy about it at first, and I'm still terrible at it, but Citadels has grown on me. The included expansion adds variety and lets you customize your game based on the number of players and the playstyle of your group (by choosing the witch or assassin, or the warlord or diplomat).

Update: Libertalia, Mission Red Planet, and probably a few other games use a similar mechanic but are more enjoyable.

I have become addicted to this game. I pretty much bought it on a whim to make up an online order, and it's ended up being one of my favourite games. I like that you can choose to either ignore everyone else and concentrate on building, or you can choose characters that will bitch-slap other players and their citadels. Of course, I usually choose to harass other players, as that's more fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Citadels is a card game that uses a role selection mechanic similar to San Juan.  In the game, you are attempting to build up your city one structure at a time and prevent other players from doing the same.  The roles you pick from can decrease your building costs, increase your income, and (one of my favorites) prevent another player from taking his or her turn (the assassin).  This is a fun game, not heavy, but not a light filler either.  If you enjoy it, get the Dark City Expansion as that has replacements that broadens the types of roles you can have in the game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Finally got around to playing this a couple times with larger groups (at least 5 players) and it was a bit of a let down. Seems like it should have been great at those higher player counts but it just wasn't.

The core dilemma of the game is that you want to build valuable buildings but collecting lots of money means you are risking the thief stealing from you. And not only that, by having lots of money you draw attention to yourself, so you have to be extra sneaky in choosing a role.

This in an of itself is great. The problem is when the player count gets high, and therefore the interplay of roles is most interesting (since most roles are out there) you can often just get by on luck. And when you do get caught it really hurts. Almost certainly, a couple players get picked on our of sheer luck, and are totally taken out of the running through no fault of their own. This is one of my least favorite features of a game.

The basic mechanic has nice intrigue, but I view the thief/assassin as pretty fatal to the enjoyment of the game. The best games are the ones where fun is had by all and in this game you have the opposite: a near-guarantee that someone will not have any fun.

What a great game. One of the most versatile games I know of. It scales really well from 2 to 8 players (no, really, I've tried them all!). Plus it's got some great backstabbing fun. Unique mechanics make for an interesting departure from other board games. My wife says she hates it, but every time it comes out, she's up for a game.

Having the expansion packed-in is really nice. It lends a nice bit of extra flavor to an already great game. The different roles allow for a different style game that plays very fresh. It's on my "must have" list.

Rating increased from 7 to 8.

My wife and I travel a lot for weeks at a time so I love "flexible" games.  This means compact,  scales well to a wide range of players, enjoyable for gamers and non-gamers, and doesn't take much space to play.

Citadels certainly hits a sweet spot for flexibility.

Update: Rating goes down from 8 to 7.  I just don't enjoy it as much anymore. All the above about flexibility is still true and I think this might also be a game every collection should have.  It is just not as fun as it used to be.

Many disagree about how many palyers is the sweet spot, but it certainly does accomodate a wide range of players at least adequately.

It is very compact.

It can easily be played on a card table-sized table.

Enough game for gamers, but non-gamers can easily figure it out and have fun.

Beyond its "travelability" it is just a good game.  It has beautiful components, great replayability and expansions, a fairly wide range of ages can enjoy it and it is also "fun".

If I could keep only one game in my collection this might well be it.  Not because it is my favorite, but because it is so darn easy to get to nearly any table.

Update:  I just never choose to play this.  It takes too long. I need to try this with less buildings required.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 5

I don't see why every Portland gamer I play with dislikes this game.  Random elements in other games can get to me, but I like the guesswork in this game - sure, you could end up being horribly unlucky, but I actually like that better than "screw the leader".  I enjoy this with three players and have played this quite a bit with my family.  We have the FFG Silver Line edition including the Dark City expansion, but mostly play with the base set.

I like playing with three, since you get two characters each turn and can plan for combinations of actions - the same kind of feel I get with two-player Race for the Galaxy.

My first experience with Citadels was terrible. There were too many players and too many had never played before. I was not able to even establish a working strategy before the game ended, which is a foreign feeling for me regardless how obtuse the game might be. After reading some reviews I decided to give the game another shot but as a two player game rather than with a group. This went over very well. My wife and I played together several times She enjoyed the game more than I but primarily because the bluffing/guessing mechanic is something she does well with (I HATE poker and can't stand bluffing games). After a while we both started to tire of the Assassin playing such a central role in the game and so stopped playing. I have the expansion but have yet to try the game with the alternate characters. This is a great game for the right people. I enjoy the occasional play, but I'm not the right people.

The system is elegant: the game mechanics step aside to allow lots of player interaction.  This is its blessing if your group is talkative and cunning it makes for a particularly interesting game.  Play time can significantly increase with more players, and is audience-dependent enough to make me wait for the right moment to pull it out.

The basic special-power selection game.  Everyone chooses a special power each round, and then you do basically the same stuff.  Minor negative-interaction with thief and assassin.  It's not a bad game, just not stellar.

More strategic than you'd think at first glance, although it is somewhat subject to the chaos of newbies having no clue what to do and being unable to remember the different roles.  Plays by far the best with 6 or 7 players; one of the few games where I feel there is much MORE luck with 4 players than with 6.

RATING: 5
Easy to learn, hard to win slow deduction game with solid player interaction. 

It plays well with a variety of players (from 2 to 8 with the included exp).
With 4+ players the game is exceptionally tense, and you need to constantly make tough choices and guesses.

The theme is a bit too dark for my taste, and it's really a "my death"-"your life" game. So it's not a family game, new or "bad" players tend to make some pretty random choices spoiling the balance, and players get pissed-off/dissapointed a lot due to the cutthroat gameplay. The major flaw however is downtime, which can increase exponentially the more inexperienced or ap prone players are.

In the end, this game is excellent with players with a lot of nerve and patience, the kind the average player lacks.

I may need to play this one again to get the full flavor of it. There should be more opportunities to influence what your opponents can do. Since only the warlord can attack holdings and have to pay for it, it is quite a sacrifice to play that benefits your opponents.

RATING: 5
An OK game, but not more than that.  I used to rate it more highly, but as I've played more games its shortcomings have become more evident to me and I have now traded it away.  One definite negative is that it can be dreadfully frustrating if you spend an entire game getting killed or robbed (which happened to me in my second game) -- especially since these events are (at least at the beginning of the game) fairly random.  My biggest criticism is that it always seems to take a bit longer than it should (or is welcome).  I'll still play this on occasion if it is suggested, but I've moved beyond the point where I want to play a game just because it has one or two clever twists on tried and true mechanics if the game overall doesn't measure up.

Fun fun fun.  Controlled chaos.  I think the group you play with has alot to do with how much you will enjoy it.  The balance between the characters is incredibly well done.  I can't recommend it for less than 5.  I also recommend playing to 7 districts.  This is our closer on game nights for two reasons.  One it allows everyone who attended game night to play(we normally get 6-8 people), and two:  everyone likes it.  This game is responsible for the success of my game night.  6 with the addition of the queen is the sweet spot for this, in my humble opinion.  The perfect beer and pretzels game.   Really funny to play, when taken too seriously. Creates some classic moments in gaming.  Not the usual fare I fall for, but it does what it does really well and in an enjoyable manner.   With 7+ players you should play to six districts.  This avoids the game "bogging" down to a finite amount of cards at the table.  If the game devolves into this it can drag... but its the best social type game around if this does not occur.

The assassin and trying to avoid it makes the game shine for me.  The game is at its best when you are in the lead, you receive the character deck and the assassin is missing.  You know the assassin is gunning for you and the think/double think emerges for this very important decision.  Similar feeling with the thief, but not nearly as scary.  The tension and decision point at these moments is unlike any other game I have played.  

I have been thinking of end game variant.  I think if the number of district cards in hand becomes sufficiently low the game should end.  The game can drag when the number of district cards in hand become sufficiently small.  Playing to 7 districts normally fixes it, but an alternate end game trigger would address the exact problem that I have experienced.  

A unique game which creates a great social experience for players.

WOW! If you haven't played this what are you waiting for.  It's a FF Silver line game so it's going to set you back $20 brand new.  Find it used for less.  FANTASTIC game.

UPDATE: After a few years and Mission Red Planet coming out which handles the role selection process better I've moved this down a notch to an 8. Still a cool game. No doubt there. 

UPDATE: Another couple years and this doesn't hit the table much. Got to play it recently and it's still a good game but gotta drop the notch a bit more. Now a 7.

When I've played, it's best as a two-player game. With a full run of eight or nine players, there's too much down time between plays. Also ignore the rule about limiting the number of purple districts you can substitute from the expansion.

Great game, non-gamers enjoy it, but can be quite boring when people are taking a long time to decide what to do.  It doesn't have the clip of other games I like, such as Ticket to Ride or Puerto Rico where you have something to do almost every turn.

RATING: 2
Played two times, and I have been assassinated by accident way too many times for this game to be fun at all. This game was so bad that we were joking about making the game's goal to be killed as every character. And it wasn't just me.

Someone kept picking the King, and kept getting assassinated by the same other person, who just felt like killing the King over and over. The person who was the King wasn't even winning! And this person who kept picking the king sat one seat to my left, so I always had to pick between 2 roles, usually the magician and someone else. 

Just horrible. And way too long. It took us 2 very long and slow hours to complete a 6 player game, half the time not doing anything due to being assassinated.

Somewhat interesting role-selection card game.  Works best with 4 or 5 players.  While it claims to work with 2 to 7 players, I find that there's too much downtime while picking roles and between turns with 6 or 7 players.  Also, the bluffing mechanic doesn't work as well with only 2 or 3 players.  Like Bohnanza, I find the 2-7 claim is a bit overstated.  All that being said, this can be a fun and engaging card game if you have the right mix of people, but it has the tendency to get bogged down and take far too long for what it is.

Great bluffing game that scales well (and makes a very different experience) from 2-7 players.  I might prefer it with two though since the bluffing aspect definitely gets harder to make targeted choices with more players. Another worry is that the "just build every chance you get and you win" strategy might be all there is to the buildings--but there is a bit more to it than that I think. Minor issues really as this is a fun game that I'm always happy to play.

Someone had once mentioned Citadels to me as a game they thought I wouldn't care for.  Spoiler alert: They were right.

At first blush, the game seems like something that would be fun.  It's a role selection and deduction game about building buildings.  Unfortunately, it's a high conflict game where other people can muck things up by stealing all your gold, assassinating you for the turn or tearing down your building.

When we got to the fourth round and I had already lost two turns to assassination, I knew that I didn't like this game.  The game lasted maybe 7 rounds and I accomplished very little.

The game is pretty, but the gameplay didn't suit me.

I like many things about it:
- the role selection is fun (there is tactic, (low) strategy, attention and guessing elements on it);
- the gameplay, once everyone knows how the game goes, is somewhat fast, though downtime can be an issue with 6+ players;
- the artwork is gorgeous;
- an all the game fits a small box, even when the cards are sleeved!

I [i]really[/i] don't like the game when playing with more than 5 people. Five is the limit for me, as I have some terrible plays with more, I strongly recommend against it.

First impression is not too good. Few interesting decisions. If players ignore each other it's a very simple solitaire game. Attacking other players is either direct or at worst limited by a guessing game (attack a role rather than a player). Pretty hard to solo play...

In my game the winner was the person who was in second place prior to the leader getting bashed the turn before. Scores were close, seemed like a very arbitrary win.

...If you take out the role-guessing attacks it's hard to perceive any strategy, any interaction, any game at all.

A role selection game where you are trying build a city and earn the most victory points in the process.  I love that your choice of role effects when you take your turn.  It sounds straight forward, but has some social aspects that make it a lot of fun.  I prefer it with 4-5 players.

I don't really understand the appeal of this one.  Most of the game is waiting.  First you wait for your turn to pick a character, then you wait for your turn to come up or everyone else's turn to be over.  This would be fine if the other player's turns were engaging enough to keep your interest, but the only time they're interesting is if you're being assassinated, stolen from, or having one of your buildings destroyed.  Choosing the right character at the right time and guessing which characters the other players have chosen is interesting, but that's the only thing this game has going for it.  Everything else is kind of a drag.  It is also way too long for a game this small.

The rating is given based on 2-player variant. I have tried it twice with my Significant Other and on both occasions, I did not enjoy the game play.

The selection of role cards felt a bit restrictive to me at times. I almost felt that I have not much choice but to choose a particular role card especially when I am the first player choosing my first card. I am not sure whether I have missed out something here. 

The effect of the Warlord is even greater in a 2 player game. The reason is one is always the target as compared to multi-player game. It can be quite frustrating that your buildings keep getting destroyed after you have built them. 

After the 2 plays, I concluded that this game may be more suitable for 3 or 4 players instead.

Only ever played this once, and won my first game with 5 players.  It's too chaotic for my tastes and there seems to be no direct relationship between quality of play and likelihood of winning. Alas! I'll probably play it again if the opportunity arises, but likely won't enjoy it any more than the first try.

RATING: 6
Players seek to build a collection of districts worth from one to eight points. Once someone has built eight districts, the game is over after that round ends, and the player with the highest total value wins. However, to facilitate the process (and make the game interesting), players sequentially choose a character from a rapidly dwindling pool of eight each turn. The characters give players special abilities for the turn.

Citadels had a separate expansion, Citadels: The Dark City Expansion, but the new (3rd Edition) Fantasy Flight editions come with the expansion included (the Hans im Glück tin box also included it). With the newer version that includes Dark City, or the Dark City expansion purchased separately, this game can take 2 to 8 players.

Citadels is a pretty fast and easy game to play.  I found it quite repetative after a few games and saw that the game ended up feeling like a Puerto Rico style game but less strategy was involved.  It is good, but it is not a highly interactive and social game that made me want to play more.

This one is about to shake up my list of top ten. I enjoy it very much, but contrary to popular belief, I think the game plays better with 2-4, as opposed to 5-7. There's more deduction, and each turn feels more tense than the last. Update: I've burned out a little on Citadels, players take WAY too long to pick their roles, and the game drags on too long. I keep a copy around because I figure I'll return to it someday.

No he tenido muchas oportunidades de probar el juego pero lo que lo he jugado ha sido divertido y te asegura unas cuantas risas. Me gusta el tener un rol y tener que intentar adivinar el rol que tienen los demas para putearles. Muy buen juego para jugar con amigos. Lo malo es que si se está al cien por cien con el juego se puede hacer aburrido el tener que esperar desde que es tu turno hasta que te vuelve a tocar. Sobre todo si somos más de 4 jugadores.

RATING: 4
Sometimes this game plays OK (even though it's mostly about guessing and bluffing), at other times the endgame ruines everything. The higher the number of players, the greater the chance that you will lose interest halfway because of the downtime or the inability to end it. It is really easy to become stuck in some sort of status quo by the end of the game when playing with five. Charming game, but not my cup of tea. By the way, I also feel that the game became redundant with the introduction of Mission Red Planet (by the same author) - a better game and very similar with regard to mechanics.
UPDATE: Played it again after 4 years (7 players) and really disliked the choatic nature of the game combined with the long playing time and the limited controlability. Games have really evolved in the last couple of years!

Use to be the best all-around game in my collection. From purchase to play, this game never disappointed me. Was incredibly fun, cheap to buy, and great with 2-3 players. One of my best gaming experiences. Love the different roles and drafting mechanism.

One of the games that I really enjoy, but noticed that many female gamers dislike it. A guy's game I think.

Upon further plays, I noticed that the game really bogs down with more than 6 players. It becomes a tedious chore rather than an enjoyable outing. The game is slowly getting pushed aside 

4 player seems to hit the sweet spot. I believe 4 or 5 player Citadels shines.

A nice, quick playing role-based card game. Simple mechanics, but a healthy dose of intrigue with the hidden roles. Have yet to have a bad play!

Edit: Highly diminishing returns on more than 4 players, downtime becomes exceedingly frustrating. As a game for 2-4, however, it's still one of the best role-selection games out there.

We played a half game once and I wasn't too impressed.  We mostly just picked characters for the extra money they would give, so it wasn't that interesting.  The second time we used the different roles much better, and the game was better as a result.  Unfortunately, it also took a surprisingly long time to play, so it does have that one mark against it.

We played again last night, and I have just decided that the decisions in this game aren't that interesting to me.

Seems to have fallen out of favour since the arrival of Love Letter and The Resistance: Avalon (depending on numbers), but I'm not giving up on it just yet.
One of those games that plays a lot better than it sounds.

One of the guys in the group recently asked to play this so we gave it another go.  After some initial scepticism (a couple of people who are new to gaming thought it looked a bit 'dry') everything changed with the first incidence of backstabbing, then it was game on!  Seems there is still room for this and the above mentioned titles in my collection.

Card game playable up to 7 players which uses a variable-power role-selection mechanism at the beginning of each round. The goal of the game is to build districts and score the highest possible of points from them. Many of the buildings just provide points while others also give a power that alters the game. A little hard to get into on my first play but it proceeded fairly smoothly once I got the hang of it. Can't say I was really taken by this on the first play but I didn't dislike it - I'd give it another try if in the right mood. I also found it too long for what it was.

RATING: N/A
Rating on 1st play with 5. The group I played with seemed to enjoy it, and table talk was fun. It would seem hard to knock a game with that going for it right? Usually I'd say yes. Yet the game itself was just really not fun for me. I'd rather play a better game with the same great group. Here are my gripes: (1) the role-selection process feels tedious and drags. Worse, the decision to be made with this mechanic often feels trivial by the time it gets to you (if you are not within king 2 or so.) I don't mind downtime for a good cause (brain-burning, mmmmmm), but lots of downtime for trifling choices is annoying like muzak in a broken elevator. (2) The assassin, thief and magician insure that long-term planning will be useless, and the special cards are distributed too randomly for how seemingly important they are. 

**I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT WE HAD A RULE WRONG AND THE COMMENTS BELOW ARE ACTUALLY A FUNCTION OF OUR INCORRECT PLAY. SO, IGNORE THIS COMMENT AND I'LL UPDATE WHEN I GET A CHANCE TO PLAY AGAIN!

But even if I ignored those knocks on the game, I'd still give it a 2 or 3: In our game, the top three players all were within a few points of each other; I had no chance of winning and yet as the Warlord (my final role on the final turn) I had the power to choose the winner. ***I hate, hate, hate, Kingmaker situations.*** What is the point of playing a game for 2 hours if it ends on a Kingmaker play? No one feels good ending like that: not the Kingmaker, not the winner, and not the should-have-been-winner. Yuck.

Citadels plays like an extremely over-complicated version of "Mafia".

There was a lot about this game I really liked, or wanted to like, but the stiff gameplay made for a lack of real strategy or decision making. There was often a lot of times I wanted to do something strategic but the role choices left me no choice at all. I would have liked more goals and meaningful choices here.

Probably best with 4 or 5, and I think I like it a lot better with the right character mix as well.  IIRC, switching out the Assassin, Architect, and Warlord makes for a much better game.

7 yo twins: Favorite. My parents took out the "thieve" card because we got upset over it too much. We obmit the Warlord's destroys things. Fun, fun, fun.

Me: They play 2 person version and love it. When the tension of losing/winning occurs, we just don't tallie the points at the end. It's nice to see them reading the cards and giggle :-)

Great fun, with the right people - not too numerous, tolerant of being killed and stolen from, acquainted enough to have some insight into how their opponents will react to events.  The end goal of building the highest-value city becomes secondary to the fun each round of out-thinking the other players.

1st update (Dec 2012)[8]: Pretty good game. As a 2-player it made me sell Mr. Jack, as I got the same itch scratched in guessing my opponents character card game. Not very good as a 7-player game, waaaay too long. Have yet to try other combinations.

2nd update (Sep 2014)[7]: Love Letter filled the playstyle with fewer players, and it was a slugfest with more - sold.

Enjoyable romp. Well balanced character powers. A nice bit of groupthink with easily grasped stategies. Our group always has fun with this one. Always results in laughter and plenty of "take that"!

Your plays have subtle consequences.  Understanding these may help you defeat your opponents.  Unfortunately, the outcome of the game is usually based on things outside of your control.  A player that is behind can easily change the balance between the frontrunners, so it may end up being a popularity contest.

I can understand how some players may not care for the amount of doublethink and second-guessing that goes on, but I think it's a hoot!

At one point, this was my favorite 90 minutes or less multiplayer  game.  I still like it, but it's been downgraded from something that I wanted to close every game night with to something that I will merely ask for occasionally.  Still one of the best of its type.  Great guesswork.  Beautiful art and just the right amount of screwage.  The flurry of short hidden-role games that have come out recently ([gameid=131357], [gameid=139030], etc.) owe a lot to this venerable title.

If you're looking at buying a copy, make sure you get one of the newer editions, as the money, king counter, linen-finished cards and the included expansion make it a much better value than the old version.

Rated after 5 games (there might be some more in the dark history) and if I remember correctly, I have never won. The game is good (would be better if I would know a good tactic or two) with lot of interaction and being nasty to others.

One game and one year later I dropped the rating to 6. I didn't find the game that nasty or interactive anymore. The game does not feel exciting anymore, it is ok, but I don't have any special need to propose this game.

One game more and I dropped the rating to four. It is just amazing how much downtime there is in this game! You wait and wait to pick your role, then you wait and wait to make your move and then wait again to start to waiting again. Of course you can follow what others do and what they have built and speculate, but still there is more than enough time. With experienced gamers it might be faster, but still the content feels quite light. Not necessarily a bad game, but something that I don't enjoy much.

I presented my copy to one of my fellow gamers, I usually play with, because he wanted it badly.=)
Can't give this one more then 7. Even though it has all factors I search in games - descent artwork, well disigned mechanics and replayability.
It's a definitely a "gateway" game, if you search for one.

I haven't played much, but it seems to me that the flaw with this game is that it can't decide how serious it wants to be, which is a typical flaw in Faidutti games. There are ostensibly  strategic options to pursue, but chaos overrides these in an obnoxious way, but taken as a casual game of sorts it isn't exciting enough (to me).

This game is all about knowing your opponents, and guessing how they think.  If you're not into bluffing and out-thinking, or if you're playing with some new people, this game might not be for you.  The game seems to be better with fewer players (though with three, the mechanisms get ... weird), but 5 players seems to be the sweet spot here.  It's important to play with the right people in two different ways -- those who don't get their feelings easily hurt, and those who can keep the game moving.  If you take too long to pick a card, the downtime can be excruciating.

The psychology of this game is great. "I need the Merchant but you know I need the Merchant, so you'll probably kill the Merchant with your Assassin, so I'll take the Bishop instead, but you know that I know that you know I won't take the Merchant because he'll get killed, so you won't kill the Merchant, so I'll take the Merchant." Plays 2-7. Fun with any number. Good game for relatively new gamers.

The players must try to build the most valuable, or the most useful districts. However, the core of the gameplay revolves around role selection. Players secretly choose a character card and pass on the rest - starting with whoever has the crown. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. If you are too obvious in your movements, you may meet an untimely death at the hands of an assassin, or a thief may whisk away all of your precious gold.

Once someone has built eight districts, the round continues until all other players have taken their actions, and then the game ends. The player with the most victory points wins. Victory points are determined by the gold value of buildings, but it is also important that players have a varied city, and complete their districts with haste if they are to see any bonus points.

This game's rating has sunk dramatically over the years: I once suggested this often as a filler game, but it's always been much too long for a filler. It's a curious game -- there's very little in the way of long-term, or short-term planning; very little in the way of meaningful player interaction. Will you have fun playing a 90 minute beer and pretzels game? For me, not so much; I tend to try to steer away from playing this game now.

Great wee game. A lot of game in a small package and with a pleasingly simple central mechanic. Still to try with a group larger than 3, can imagine the game plays quite differently in these circumstances. Really like the wide ranging player number and the fact that although it is not a very heavy game it can keep a heavier gamer satisfied.

Number of plays to reach Silver value*: 14

Citadels is the award winning game by Bruno Faidutti in which players are attempting to complete their city first. Each turn, players choose a secret role from eight choices: bishop, thief, king, etc. Each role has a special ability and allows the player to attempt a different strategy. Players must always beware of the deadly assassin, however, and players must constantly seek to double guess their opponents. Each city is made up of different districts, some of which also provide special abilities to the players. When combined, the game is an interesting bluffing and tactical game. This card game provides a ton of enjoyment and can handle up to seven players!

Well, 2-p and 3-p are just broken and horrible - let's get that out of the way. You pretty much always pick the assassin, and then kill the king. Boring.

The 4-p game isn't much fun either. Generally the person perceived as being ahead tends to get screwed, and I don't like that element in my games.

I haven't played with more players, so it might be more fun in a chaotic environment. I don't really know if I'll ever try it though, because the game has not impressed me so far.

EDIT: Actually played a big game of this and it was agonizingly long.

A fun, very social (or anti-social, if your group loves the assassin) card game that plays fairly quickly once everyone becomes familiar with it. It's a bit simplistic compared to other card games I regularly play, but there is still quite a bit of fun to be had with the right group. It's rarely played around here anymore, but I keep it in the collection because of the tremendous influence it has had on the design of so many other modern games...Games that I do enjoy. 

I'm a geek that way.

To be fair, the game is extremely fun for people who like it. I happen to dislike the fact that the game is too long or difficult to win with a careful strategy. 

The WORST factor in the game is that 'smash the leader' is not only present, it is dominant.

A very good game for 4 people, I'd rate it 6 or more for groups of 4. Five players or more: I'll pass.

Oh, the art is kinda weird on some cards, but good overall.

Great fun! Any non-party game that can support 7 well is OK in my book, and this one fits that bill quite nicely. It can be a little chaotic at times, but this isn't meant to be a brain burner. The player interaction leads to a lot of laughs; I could see certain personality types getting really angry about being assassinated and the like, though no game is good for every group, so I don't consider that a fault. It's an enjoyable, light game that is a nice bridge between fillers and deeper games.

I do think this is much better with 4+ than with 2 or 3. It's more strategic with less than 4, but also extremely take-that, and not as good as many other games with a low player count.

Easter vacation was approaching fast and I needed a lightweight easy game, easily transportable and playable. I checked it out at the hobby store and I decided to buy it since the price was affordable. It turned out to be a diamond in the rough. During our 3 day vacation we practically "melted" the cards from usage and I had to buy plastic sleeves to protect them. In the end I've made many fans for this game who didn't previously have any gaming experience. A nice light weight card game which  can be player by a maximum of 7 players. A typical game lasts about 40-50 mins.

I include the Dark City expansion in this entry, since it came with the base game.

It is a card game where each player picks a role every round, from king to assassin to architect to bishop, etc. The mechanics reminded me of Race for the Galaxy. However, this game has a bit more interaction, from stealing other's cards and money to destroying their buildings. Love it.

This games really depends on people you're playing with. I had excellent games (and I mean unbelievably fun, as in 10-rating fun) and I had slow, boring games.

RATING: 7
Only played with two, but it's a perfect combination of simplicity and depth.  Supposedly more players cause considerably more chaos, and I can definitely see how that would come about.  But with two it's a great combination of tactics, reading your opponent, and second guessing.

Make sure to go into this game expecting to get screwed.  If you, or your friends, can't handle that, this game isn't for you.  The assassin in particular is vicious, but he's also the main cog in the strategy (at least in two player games), and thus essential.

---

Update: Now played a few times in big groups.  Frankly, I vastly prefer the two player game.  With seven this game is just way, way too long.  It is also very chaotic.  Shorter, tenser, and more strategic with two.

This is one of the most polarising games I know. Whilst some of my group really like it, the others hate it with a passion. It&#039;s very easy for someone to find themeselves serially assassinated or stolen from. Of course I would say this is due to bad play on their behalf...

This is a true classic. Citadels was one of the games that introduced me to modern board games back in the day. Initially I gave it a strong "8", but it has lost some of its charm after repeated playing. It can get frustrating if you are constantly getting robbed or assassinated.  Still, I'll give it a shot from time to time.

I enjoy the mechanic where you choose your character in secret each turn, it gives everyone a chance to try out different powers and causes people to guess each other's strategy.

Also, I like how there are only a couple of ways to attack other players and it is very difficult to "team up against" or "take down" one player.  You are trying to win and not trying to make others lose.

RATING: 7
The current gaming group seems to like this one.  This isn't a short game for us though - it seems to take two hours (4-5 players) to three hours (7 players).  Then again,  our plays number in the single digits so far,  and we've always had new people.

Gameplay is probably much deeper than it may seem at first - in addition to outguessing meta-game, the action choices are far from trivial - I've been trounced most of the times we've played this game.   Long-term planning is probably much more important than I thought at first - the game really comes down to how efficient you are at converting gold to districts.  Or so I think now.

Yay!  I've finally won a game...and then I promptly came in last place again...but I think I'm getting a better grip at the strategy for this game.

What I love-
2-player game with selecting two roles per round. The second guessing of whether or not the character you are selecting will be assassinated or thieved. The feeling of outsmarting your opponent when you correctly determine what they are doing. Building my citadel. 

What I dislike-
Higher player counts can make the Game drag between turns. Increased random assassinations can feel unlucky at higher player counts.

This game just isn't that much fun.  Sorry.  There are way better games for every niche that Citadels might fill.

Citadels is notable for its role-selection mechanic which, to me, is the best part of the game. It is fun to see the interactions between the various roles and to strategize based upon which are available and which your opponents may have chosen.

The game itself takes a bit too long with its surprisingly light gameplay and I think the key experience (role selection) would be better serviced with a more engaging game tied to it. As such, I think Citadels is a decent game but one that would probably be easily dethroned by other, similar game designs such as Mission: Red Planet, Libertalia or even Lost Temple for most people.

The concept of this game promised more than the reality for me. I love the idea of second guessing other players and trying to work out the roles they will choose. Where the game falls out of favour is the long periods of inactivity between turns, especially with a big group. If you're assassinated a few times in a game of eight of you, you'd better bring along a good book.

As a matter of principle, I'm not dropping down the rating for this game. It's done such great things for me in the past, especially as a two-player game, and it's the reason why I still think character selection is one of my favorite mechanics to date. With more than 3 or 4 players, it tends to drag on way too long, though.

RATING: 7
One of my favorites.  The hidden player roles can make strategizing difficult, but there's always the right level of tension and excitement when you make your selections each turn.  Do you go for economy or card count?  Assassination or thievery?  Lots of different strategies make every play unique.

This game's greatest asset is the large range of players it supports. And fortunately it's also a great game. Lots of tough decisions to make on your turn with just the right of luck involved.

Hasn't been played recently, but this is a role-selection game at its best. A game about knowing your opponents more than trying to build the 'city' itself. I suggest playing a shorter variant - 6 buildings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Players seek to build a collection of buildings worth from one to eight points. Once someone's built eight buildings, then the game is over and the player with the highest total value wins. However to facilitate the process (and make the game interesting), players sequentially chose a character from a rapidly dwindling pool of eight each turn. The characters give players special abilities for the turn.

Citadels has a great theme but gameplay is so focused on getting one or two characters screwed over and usually by round 4 or 5 everyone has a good idea of the character cards each will take.  It allows for a basically losing player to screw up who actually wins.

I'm told that I would like this game if I played it with different people. Well, I get to play with different people at festivals and cons, and when I'm at a game festival or con where I can play "big" games all night, why would I play this shallow, vaguely tactical game? You can't "plan" with this game because each turn is completely dependent on the randomness of the cards and - as far as I can tell - the random last minute decisions of your opponents. The main object, it seems to me, is to be vindictive as you can, and try to screw with the guy who screwed you last turn. Not fun.

Een rollenselectiespel dat mij niet echt weet te grijpen.

In dit spel kiest iedere ronde alle spelers een rol van de 8 beschikbaar en die worden dan op volgorde uitgespeeld.

Opzich is het best een leuk bedacht systeem, maar het duurt naar mijn idee te lang voor wat het is. Bovendien is het wat mij betreft iets te vaak voorgekomen dat een speler een paar keer achter elkaar vermoord wordt en daarmee meteen kansloos is voor de overwinning (en daar komt ook de speelduur weer om de hoek kijken).

Toch een 6, want er zitten een paar leuke ideëen in.

Like an interactive version of Race for the Galaxy, where everyone builds their own tableau, but players can mess with each other.  This is a really nice design where each role has unique abilities, and none any more powerful than any other, so there is no single role that is always preferable - it depends on what you need to do.  Sort of a 'tweener - not really a full meaty game, but more than a typical filler.

I'd rather mash up a five-player game of Pit and a two-player game of Go than play a seven-player game of this again.

Played several times face-to-face (2-7 players) and on BSW (mainly 4-5 players). A game I enjoy probably more than I should, considering that it can be quite random (mainly because of the other players' decisions) and you can easily be out of the game with no real control. However it is quite pleasant, assuming players are reasonably quick in choosing their roles and taking their turns.

One game with seven.  Obvious problem was downtime.  I felt the game dragged on quite a while, but at least it came down to a tight race at the end.  I believe the final scores were 33, 30, 30, 29, 29, 28, 27.  Obviously I believe it would play better with less, perhaps 3-5.

RATING: 7
[b]This is not a game for people who care about fairness.[/b] But, aside from that, the game is a lot of fun and plays very well with younger kids (my almost-6-year-old loves it!) It's got a lot of second-guessing of other players involved. Lots of laughs, because you can try to screw over another player, but often your attempts misfire and hit an innocent bystander instead of your intended target!

It can sometimes take a little bit too long, especially with lots of players, but that can be fixed by playing to fewer buildings and/or by replacing the assassin with the witch. The assassin is more fun, but having it in the mix does slow things down.

Good social game, and plays fairly quick once you're familiar with all of the character abilities.

Scales well based on number of players, and is a very different game with two players than it is with five or more.

Be sure to check out the character info in the rulebook - there are a handful of extra abilities that aren't mentioned on the individual cards (we tend to forget about them.)


It's good to be the King.

It's a good game, though it can be slow. The mechanic of changing roles is the main attraction and the slowest part of the game. I typically play with 4 - 6 people, though you can play up to 8.

Another thing I would recommend is putting card sleeves on the role character cards. After 20-ish plays the cards are looking worn. Admittedly, the plays were rough

I like this game. I am a sucker for building games. I have had some really good games and some poor games of this. I have played it with my 8 year old girls and they had fun, although assasination can be frustrating. I have had good games with several groups of people and my older sons. I have tried it several times with my gaming group and they just do not get into it. They think too much about each move and do not have fun with it. Middle amount of screw the other player can turn some people off. Some reviews complain about the randomness but careful money mangement seems to matter more than which specific cards you get and generally seems to pay off.

Update: For all of it's flaws this is still can be a really good time. I am not lowering my rating.

A game I really played a lot when I first got it. The cards show their battle scars!

As you might have guessed, I liked the game back in the year 2000-ish. But even now, the game still feels great. I like how each character has their own special ability and how easy the game is to teach.

The murderer card does feel overpowered as it has been picked every round if possible. Perhaps that balances out the Merchant, who would otherwise be picked every round consistently.

The game has a good length and player turns don't take too much time, so a big group doesn't seem to increase the play time too much.

I've often heard a "Let's play another round!" when I play to game with people, which to me is a good sign.

Analysis of a Meaningful Decision in Citadels

A card is burned. The King is looking at Assassin, Thief, Magician, King, Merchant, Architect, and Warlord.

THE KING
"Merchant is clearly the best card here. And I'm playing a Green. Nobody can refuse that money. So should I take Merchant? I dunno - the person who picks Assassin is likely to target the Merchant because he's so powerful. And the next guy knows I either have Bishop or Merchant. But maybe the next guy also knows that I know taking Merchant is extremely dangerous! So he'll figure Merchant was burned because there's no way I'd take something so risky! So I can take Merchant because he'll assassinate Bishop! But wait ... maybe HE KNOWS that I KNOW that he knows Merchant is risky! That means he'll choose to assassinate Merchant after all! ... ... ... In that case, what happens if I take Architect?"

Five minutes later.

THE KING
"Whatever, I'll just take Thief, which in retrospect is one of the most broken roles because you can name not Merchant or Architect and always succeed. Additionally, you force someone else to take Assassin and perform the communal necessity of naming Merchant or Architect."

LAST PLAYER
"Hmm, Merchant or Architect? Merchant is more powerful, but more likely to be assassinated. So I'd better take Architect. But wait! What if the Assassin knows that I know--"

I like the rotating role mechanic in this game, and some roles like the Warlord allow for people behind in the game to catch-up, although sometimes there is an element of 'gang-up-on-the-leader'.

This game, to me, still holds its' weight in the Hidden roles category. Light and fun, you build your city while assuming the identities of its' very denizens. The assassin is fun at first, but after so many plays, I prefer the Witch. That way, the player gets a basic action at least. This is a fluid-paced middle weight game.

RATING: 7
A bluffing and deduction game with reasonably simple rules. Game play has some depth, arising from the different combinations of roles on hand.

The nature of play is such that downtime increases linearly with the number of players, making it unsuitable for larger number of players. The artwork is not very consistent in style from card to card.

RATING: 6.1
Citadels is a game that gets better the more you play it with the same group. Once people get past just taking the king and then choosing the assassin to stop losing first player the game opens up into some interesting areas. I never play to 8 districts though, 6 is a better game length in my view. Prefer Libertalia for this kind of game. 

Got rid of this in the end - moved on to other games.

Surprisingly solid game for 6 or 7 players, despite its faults. Don't enjoy it as much with only 3-4, as there's even less interaction between players. Gameplay should ideally be quick, dastardly and exciting to the very end. Or at least, should be -- but with the wrong group, it tends to drag on. I dislike a few character abilities (assassin, warlord) which lengthen the game considerably without adding anything to compensate.

My wife picked up on it pretty quick so that was nice.  Rules are simple, we only had to refer to the book the first game.  Not one we'll play too often but light enough to get a game in if we had a busy day and don't want anything too involved.  But the different characters and their abilities give you enough strategic choices to be fun and interesting. playing with more people is definitely the way to go with this game.

Citadels is a very cool role selection game, in which roles are selected in secrecy, with some being removed each round at random, leading to a fantastic double-bluffing element and lots of "well I can clearly not drink the wine in front of you" lines of thinking.

The theme is city building in a medieval-like fantasy setting, and it has very good components for a card game. I also love the old Silver Line boxes.

We played this with 2 people and it was quite fun.  I think it would be more enjoyable with at least 4 players.  I like the aspect of being able to see exactly how many points everyone has so you can strategize a little.  However, since no one knows what character you will choose, it is hard to directly affect someone unless using the Warlord or Diplomat.

RATING: 10
+: quite easy to learn
+: short (possibly very short), easy to learn (not to master) 
+: none of your wealth is certain (money, buildings, hand of cards) and you cannot protect it all..
+: interactive/conflict-rich: leader-bashing, will you take benefits and maybe lose them or have no benefits and maybe hinder others?
+: predict the choices of other players
+: tense until the end as there's rarely a clear winner who is unstoppable
+: very flexible number of players, but best with 4 or 5
-: quite some randomness in luck with buildings or characters that are left out in the final round (but prediction/deduction is way more important!)
-: kingmaking possible (either let emotions run free, or try to do what is 'best' in a neutral way)

The goal is to build a city of cards each worth a number of points.  The role you select on your round either effects you (gains you more gold or cards...) or effects another player (Theifs steal from other players... Assassins make other players miss their turn!).  In the end I find this takes too long to play with way too much down time... and I don't really care for the Assassinations (who likes missing their turn in a game that already has too much downtime...). I'd much rather play Mission: Red Planet!

RATING: 9
This is currently one of my favorite card games.  Its not a CCG, and new gamers have a much easier time picking it up.  

Its also a tense game on a psychological level, especially when you play against people who really know you well.  Choosing the right role can be agonizing and the thrill of picking correctly is exhilarating.

Citadels takes role selection and variable player order and simplifies gameplay down to its most essential elements.

RATING: 5.5
Here is a decent game that can ruin friendships. The concept is easy enough to learn and play - pick a role, then either get more money/cards or use said money to build a new building.

The assassin role is exploitable, particularly in games with fewer people, as you can use it in tandem with the king to permanently be the start player, which carries advantages. I prefer to play with some of the alternate roles.

With too many people the game can drag way too long, especially if you have roles in play that can punish the leader (like the Warlord). Also, with more players you tend to lose a bit of control over your game, as the power shifts to whoever has the external effect roles which can target whoever.

Every time I play this game, it is a major disappointment. The last time I played this game, it dragged on for about 3 hours, i.e. as long as a typical heavy euro game. The game is simply too long for what it is. The tedious slow progress is baked into the game because of the character murdering, money stealing, card exchanging, and building destroying. The same mechanisms also give a feeling of lack of control. During our last game, we also saw a player get so far behind by the time the game was half way, that his chances to win were negligible.  Nevertheless, that player had to endure another hour of limping behind the rest, which was of course no fun. There are so many other shorter and far more fun games to play on the market, that this one is simply not worth considering.

Beautiful cards. Gameplay is reminiscent of San Juan. Not sure if this one is better. The jury, for now, is out.

A classic card game.  The re-release adds more to the game, as our group had gotten burnt-out by the end of it.

RATING: 7
one problem with this otherwise great game - new players need some plays to learn the roles, before that it's a big disadvantage for them and significantly less fun for others

RATING: 8
The rating is for the two player game. I can see it getting progressively worse the more players are added, but I could be wrong. With two, though, it's *the* bluffing game you've always wanted.

Constantly-shifting hidden roles, cards, and some blind luck.

Got it because it can be played w/ 2 players and has many mechanics I typically enjoy. 

In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.

2-8 players though. 8!! I imagine that would take a while. I would totally try it sometime though.

A very subtle and satisfying card game, thats quick and fun to play. I find that it works equally well with a small group compared to a large group, and the new characters introduced in the Dark City expansion add a new level of intrigue to the game.

After Bang my 2nd choice for big groups. A bit chaotic but plays fast and is fun for almost everyone. Both hardcore players and newbies like the theme and the mechanics as well. Don't take it too serious.

Might check the new edition and see whether it improves on that aspect.

Great fun and plays well from 2 to 7.  With 3 players I prefer the &quot;house&quot; rule where the assassin does not kill another character, but only deprives the character of using their special ability that turn.

RATING: 7
A dynamic card game with interesting personalities and beautiful, brooding artwork. 

What keeps it from a higher score: It can take too long with more players.

RATING: 5
Played mostly in large (7-ish) groups. Not sure it works well with that many. Mostly one way to win, the special buildings are unfortunately too hard or sub-optimal to use effectively, and the effect of the few interesting role powers are a bit too capricious for elaborate long-term planning.

This is another quick and fun card game. The artwork is beautiful and the game play very deep. The 'guessing' mechanic doesn't become old, and having a good poker-face is a key component towards winning.

I've only played this game as a two- and three-player game, and I think I'd like to keep it that way.  I really enjoy games where you have to get inside the head of your opponent, and, from what I've seen of this game, that works better with a smaller player count.

Good because it can be played with many. There isn't many games for 7 players. But missing the real strategy. Is fun to kill a king.

Cada ronda selecciona un rol cuyo beneficio depende de tu ciudad. Comienza la ronda quien tenga al rey (rol Nº1). Si eres muy obvio en tus intenciones podrías ser asesinado. Intenta construir los distritos que otorgan más PV sin ovidar la variedad.

Good game but prefer PR for the role-mechanic (though the bluffing is nice!) and (at the moment) Alhambra for the city-building theme

Best artwork ever seen in a card game. Plays very well with 2-5 players but has a very different gameplay based on the number of players.Too much downtime while choosing the characters with more players.

Perhaps there was too much randomness for me in a game that was supposed to be strategic. Or perhaps I am just very bad at it....

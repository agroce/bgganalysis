Another Tom Wham game all the way up here? To be honest, I haven't played this in ten years I guess, but sometimes I love such a sprawling attempt at narrative strategic empire-building (with dice, yea). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
When I played it, I was thinking that its the worst game I'd played since Twilight Imperium 3rd edition.  But then I decided its probably worse.

My starting hand had no two cards of the same country, and since I went last, I couldnt claim anything since all the things I could claim were gone, except one, but it had absolutely no defense (so it was soon taken).  Some people who had gotten ahead (because they went early in the turn order), got more money and then got further ahead.

Then, somoene who had been screwed for a while finally got some good stuff together and got a couple kingdoms, tying them for the lead.  About 5 seconds later, a peasant revolt came, they lost the die roll, and all of their cards except for one got wiped out.  Whee!

The only problem with this game is that once you've punched all the pieces out you can't get it back in the box.  Thank heavens for ziplock bags

RATING: 7
Fun game of creating army melds. Cards don't fit very nicely in the box after they have been seperated, the magic isle is too mpowerful.

RATING: 7.5
Altough there is a moderate random factor, the gameplay itself is very entertaining - especially when players involve their diplomatic skills, too.
The characters and the atmosphere are also funny.

Another Tom Wham classic.  This game look silly, but is quite involved.   Lots of fun and cool graphics.  Can replay a couple of times during an evening.  Can drag out on occasion.  Hard to find now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
One play, very swingy, but not necessarily in a bad way, could see this being really fun with some laid back gamers just looking for a medium-light world conquest/take-that game.  Lot's of randomness and players seem to have to regulate each other so one person doesn't runaway with the win.

Two games with three players.  Really want to try this with the full compliment of six players.

RATING: 7
Another Tom Wham classic.  There are some balance problems with Isle Brodick and the wizard; otherwise, most people who have gotten past the artwork have been surprised by how fun this is.
The biggest problem is that there is no way to fit all the cards back into the tiny box.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not sure how it relates to Forgotton Realms (or D&D at all, for that matter), but the art and names of cards/locations are humorous. 
I found it to be way too long for a game that has this amount of swinginess and randomness. Combat takes too long and slows the game down quite a bit. It also is tedious as you have to scan the other player's cards to analyze whether or not invading or couping is worthwhile. 
Best part is the cute factor of the cards.

I've recently dusted off this classic (because of the recent Typhoon Milenyo left my home without power, thus needing a way to preserve my sanity) and played it with my regular gaming buddies. We were all surprised that it was a great blast! One thing we found out though: the appearance of The Historian card is very frustrating. Despite what others have been saying about this game being too long, my gaming group are looking into ways to increase the game length (once, we even drew the Historian right after resolving the Shuffle event...)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It is like a typical "set making" card game (eg Rummy).  The Wizard of Brodich is what really makes the game interesting.

Bought it, forgot it and discovered it in my bookshelf years later. And what a discovery!!
Very funny and excellent game mechanics that keeps you playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A game ultimately very similar to King of the Tabletop. There is a huge pile of Things like leaders, armies, monsters, magic swords, etc. In this case there is a gin-rummy element used to draw cards, play sets onto the table, and sometimes steal sets from opponents. But at the end of the day, you are mostly staring at a map of the Whamite Isles and sending armies of Eskimos or nobles to battle for supremacy. Chaotic Wham fare with more rules overhead than most of his titles.

Recommend playing without the spellcasting rules from Isle Broddick.

Good.  Goofy, random, sprawling rules, but great art and good opportunity for psychological gameplay makes for a good time. I love how it's ostensibly set in the Forgotten Realms, but has no real connection to that pinched-off loaf of a setting.

From my youth, and I still have this game. I'm not sure if I have all the pieces. It really isn't that good of a game, but when you are a kid and the games you have access to are limited (no game stores near me when I was a kid), then you just be happy with stuff like this and play it all the time with your friends. I'm in no rush to relearn it and find out that it really sucks.

After first play, I thought it was a bit interesting, everyone else hated it. Too random, crap if you're stuck without leader cards, etc. I'm not so sure-- I think it may take a few games to see the possibilities, especially around negotiation. Bad if played as a euro.

Picked Up PDF version Oct 2006 from RPG Now

Printing out the cards and the map, but I will probably use glass stones for the tokens and gold.

ARRGH! The pdf images are really crappy...the card sheets are all different sizes and the map is missing a strip in the middle. I have had to redo all the cards so they are now well formatted and at least legible and I repaired the map so it is now seamless.

Some things need fixing apparently:
1) Control of the Isle Broddick is too powerful. The effect needs to be toned down.
2) The game could drag on if the Historian card is near the end of the deck.
3) Combat is too fiddly. A Dune type system was suggested.
4) A few event cards are way too powerful.

If this could be tweaked to play well in 90 minutes or less with 4 players, this could be fun.

RATING: 8
Thom Wham's best game.  Not too fiddly, very refined, somewhat euro-esque. A light wargame combined with a set-collection medling game which is quite clever.  Some things, like the Isle of Brodrick are simply overpowered.  However, it doesn't seriously detract from the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Excellant card driven fun game. Loved by my young teenagers and my 25 year old. Plenty of action, comical cards, alliances, fantasy background, political coups, warfare, with no one knowing when the game will suddenly finish. One of my all time favourites.

RATING: 5
Ownership of countries is rewarded with money each turn, with which you buy cards. Cards belong to a country and may have politics or armies on them. If you have more politics in a country than the player who currently owns that country, you take it over (you can do one coup each turn). You also get to do one war each turn to take over an adjacent country (or if you have boat symbols on your cards, you can take over anywhere) and the winner is decided by a dice duel (1 die for each sword, and you hope it's decided within the random number of rounds). So countries go back and forth as the cards allow, the leader gets picked on by the other players. The game ends when the game-ending card comes out, which could be 10 minutes in or 210 minutes in, which is completely ridiculous of course, but in keeping with the completely random nature of the game. This is one you play for the ride. The problem is, with only one coup and one war each turn, you don't get enough opportunity to engender the big swings of fortune which are required to make ride games worthwhile and memorable.

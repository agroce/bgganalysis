RATING: 6
A gamification of the classic pen and paper game, [b]Dots and Boxes[/b].  It seemed a little unbalanced, even for an asymmetrical game, since you draw 3 random ability cards from a (likely) balanced deck.  Fun, but I wouldn't play it with 4 again...too chaotic.  The sweet spot is probably 2-3 players.

I wanted to love this, and I'm excited to play it some more,  but the lack of control over when you can build coupled with the extreme ease of moving tokens around makes you kind of scratch your head...our first game came down to the flip of a card that was a 25+ point swing.

Essentially the dot game but with restrictions on when and how you can draw lines, and some asymmetric player powers.

Many have said this reminds them of a child's game, dots.  I can see the comparison.  However, the asymmetrical abilities of each player add a level of flavor.  I still feel like certain players have more strength than others (I prefer purple), but no one has walked away feeling they were gamed.  Easy to learn, but plenty of choices.  Really good game to smack around your friends.  I took maybe a point or two off because it's not THAT deep, but that could be just what you are looking for.

First impressions (2p)
PRO:
 -Fast, easy to learn/teach.
 -Visually interesting (artwork+board).
 -Used to play dots and boxes as a kid and this is similar.

CON:
 -More character and varied regular programs would have been good.
 -With 2p the amount of swaps and access point moves in the deck is just too much (6-6 pieces). There were times when 3 of the 4 accessible programs were moves...
 -Looks like its more balanced toward 3-4 players than 2 (see Shift complaints) tough at that player count i guess its too chaotic...

Overall we didn't like it very much.

RATING: 7
An asymmetric abstract game for 2-4 players where each player's moves are determined by a common pool of cards as well as 3 (out of 5) unique cards in each player's possession.

Filler asymmetric, abstract, spatial, area-control game with some interesting card mechanics thrown in the mix.  Cards make things less predictable and somewhat random, which in turn makes the game more friendly to people playing for the first time.

RATING: 7.5
This is essentially a glorified version of the dot and box game everyone played as kids. The moves available to place barriers are drafted a la ticket to ride, and you have to choose whether to add barriers or add another of your marks. This succeeds in having more strategy than rules, and is the type of game to choose your battles wisely. An early lead may put a target on your back, and your areas can be stolen if the barriers haven't been closed yet.

--------------------------
An interesting puzzle game, but probably too chaotic with 4 players.  The special cards you get are neat, but are something you really need to know what its possibly out there to prevent large point swings.  Interested to try at 2 & 3 players, and could see this one rising in score at those player counts.  Really nice production, even if the theme is totally pasted on.

Remember the dot game. Put line out wait to make boxes than score. Well add some cards and abilities to remove and changes lines that are not boxes yet. Can be prone to some AP but it just ok.

RATING: 6
Quick and fun 'abstract' area control game set in the Netrunner universe. Easy to pick up rules, and relatively deep strategic choices. The character cards and flip up generic cards make this game: without them the game would be way too dry. A solid 7 with a good chance to climb on a few replays.

Edit: Have bumped from a 7 to a 6. Just don't feel like playing this one very often, despite the short playtime. May look to sell.

Nasty, fun little tactical game. Turn-by-turn, the game is basically about trying to make things as awful as possible for your opponents so you don't set them up to score. This means the board state changes rapidly and you have to be really tactical since you can't plan for anything.

Normally my husband and I hate these sorts of in-your-face abstract games, but since you're always screwing each other it doesn't feel so mean. The card play also adds just enough randomness to make this less of a battle of wits (as in other abstracts) and more of a raucous brawl, which we like.

Best with 2.

Not a lot of "wow", but workmanlike and interesting - sort of channeling Domaine and Through the Desert, although more chaotic and fluid.

Probably not high-ceiling, but clever and fun and nicely thematic.

Notes: 

Easy, fun with a bit of a challenge. I would say that for the best experience the game needs to be played with 3 players. I think 4 players would make the game just a bit too chaotic. Production quality is good, but I was a bit frustrated with the plastic bits not fitting flush in the tracks on the board. I found that the each Netrunner's unique programs are not balanced. I have some ideas how to improve the game. I do foresee an expansion or two in the near future for this game.

I need to join a subscription service for these smaller square box FFG games, dollar for dollar they have provided me with the most bang for my buck. Playability is a big thing for me, I love complex games but getting that fourth or fifth game in where you can really start to get past the rules and playing the game is hard. Which is why I love these smaller box games because typically they offer a bit more game than usual lighter fare but not so complex that they never get played. Mainframe falls on the lighter side which is fine. Mainframe has a theme completely tacked on, again which is fine. A straight forward area control game with a bit more flavor than a game like Through the Desert but less intense. TtD I think is better but this I feel has wider appeal. I really look forward to more plays of this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'd probably have rated this a point lower if it didn't play so fast (~20 min per game). Plus my kids love it and ask for it frequently. It's very easy to teach which is also a plus. I want to like it more than I do, and I think the problem lies with the number of swap cards in the deck. If there were only 2-3 such cards in the game, it would play better imo. Admittedly, this is an easy fix as some of these cards can simply be removed. These are essentially "screw your neighbor" cards and the high number of them makes for a high degree of chaos, undoing even the best plans. The game is at its best with careful tactics involving planning, building, and blocking--not all the chaotic "teleporting" of the swap cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A straightforward game that really capitalises on its theme (which is pasted on initially, but actually works). It's basically lines and boxes set in the android universe. It's huge Netrunner overlap makes me enjoy it more than I should, and my score balances this - probably a 6 if themeless, but gives me about an 8 enjoyment-wise. Definitely want to get more games on, but worry that others will see it for the 6 it is rather than the 8 it is to me !
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros
--Very quick player turns
--Easy to explain to new players
--Rewards varying strategies, which will create games that tell different stories each session
Cons
--Can be hampered by random common program draw
--Could offer kingmaking due to how situational some of the powers are, where your absolute best move could have nothing to with the current leader......but that could also be a "pro" if you like being thrown into those decisions.
--Needs more variability, but, could lose some balance (is it balanced anyway?) by adding too much content.

Overall, very solid game that I will not turn down if that's the offered filler.

RATING: 7
The evolution of 'Squares' or 'Dots and Boxes' (That game you used to play in maths class on a piece of paper, when you weren't paying attention to the teacher) evolved.

Easy enough, if you can seal off an area with only your player marker inside, you get one point per square.  The player with the most squares secured at the end of the game is the winner.

There are three options on your turn; play one of your characters special cards, play one of the communal cards or place another character marker on the board.  When the communal deck is emptied or there are no legal moves left, the game is over.

I thought the four player game would bomb but with the right people it can be really interesting and while you sacrifice a fair bit of control (as a lot can happen between turns), however, if players are fairly equal in skill and no players are feeding the player after them points, it can be quite a thinkie and clever little game.

Dang. As much as I'd love to have an accessible Android themed game for my collection, this one just doesn't do anything special. Ultimately, I don't think the mix of generic and unique programs do quite enough to allow for clever or creative play. There is a very obvious "tug-of-war" that happens as players make very similar steps toward victory, which makes the randomness of card draw way too apparent.

Ok, ratings many times are often very subjective. And certainly, I am no stranger to this. Even if the game itself is decently made it still can go to the bottom because of how much I dislike playing it. This should be a bit obvious because these are my rankings. I bring this up to offer a counter. That is Android: Mainframe. I don't hate playing Android: Mainframe, it's too stupid to make me care. However Android: Mainframe has to be the worst designed modern board game that I have ever seen. 

Pasted on theme that applies way too strongly to a popular board game base (sci-fi lovers), boring mechanics based off of a game that was played when people were kids (and should have stayed there.), lack of depth, luck based move choices, asymmetric cards that lead to a lot more luck in what one can do, forcing people to clean up other's messes (the whole well I'll force the player before the player doing the big threat to handle the big threat.) The choices of what you can play are mostly random and useless. It varies so much depending on what's out there and even then half the cards are just token shifters which just delay the game out to annoying lengths. 

This is the epitome of terrible modern game design. If you are a game designer look at this game. If anything you're designing comes too close to this game think about why that is and try to change it. And if you're going to paste on a theme can we please not have it in any of the overused genres?

Yera

es un "semi filler". se acuerdan aquel juego de cerrar los cuadraditos que jugabamos en el cole? pues esto es tres cuartos de lo mismo, con piezas de plastico (el tablero tambien) y tematica pegada del android netrunner. 

el juego esta guapete. la tematica a pesar de estar evidentemente pegada (aunque el juego las llame "particiones" y hable con jerga informatica de "programas", "puntos de acceso", etc. el juego al final es poner barreras para cercar una zona y quedarnosla, y eso se puede hacer igual con senderos de un poblado, corrales de ovejas o dibujando la linea con un boli) queda bien implementada, de materiales esta suficientemente bien. y lo mejor: el juego es divertido, facil de jugar y vicia. el dia del estreno jugamos 3 partidas y eso es muy raro incluso entre fillers. 

jugablemente yo le pongo un 8. el "pero" que le pongo es que me parece un juego algo caro. 30-34 pavos por: 1 tablero de plastico machihembrado mediano, 1 paquete de palitos de plastico, 48 counters de carton y 2 barajas de cartas de calidad bastante estandar. es claramente un juego de 22-25‚Ç¨ al que le han a√±adido un empujon por el nombre android (android el juego de cartas LCG, ojo). 

Creo que va a ser un habitual en las kdds porque es uno de esos juegos que por ser basicamente abstracto y rapido de jugar, no importa repetir.

Fun abstracts that play more than 2 are a bit rare.  The Android theme could very much be replaced with another theme and the game would be the same, but I happen to love the Android setting, so it elevates the game in my eyes.  The special cards for each character don't feel very balanced, but it plays quickly, so changing up your character for the next game is easy enough.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (August 2016)

I love Android: Netrunner, so I was keen on trying Android: Mainframe. Sadly, the game was a huge disappointment for me.

The game components are ok and the art is great, in fact, I really like the thematic ties that join both games. It is neat to play the same cards you play on Netrunner but with different effects. The art remains the same. Sadly you don‚Äôt feel the Netrunner theme anywhere, it is pasted on :(.

The rules are pretty easy to understand and teach. You can teach the game under 6 minutes. It, mercifully, plays very quick. That is its better quality.

On the game description it says ‚ÄúAndroid: Mainframe is a fast-paced strategy game set in the not-too-distant future of the Android universe!‚Äù but it isn‚Äôt a strategy game at all, your ability to plan is very low, it is mostly a tactics game and it is worse if you play with 4 players. When your turn comes again all your moves were unmade. There is a ton of uncontrollable luck with the cards (both the private and public ones). I think that perhaps it can work for me as a two player game, in this setting, you can respond immediately to your opponent¬¥s moves. As it stands, it was a very boring game for me (even though I won!)

Bottom line, Android: Mainframe has a lot of uncontrollable luck, a lot of chaos so you can‚Äôt plan ahead. I hate this, so I heavily dislike the game. I will do my best to stay away from it.

An abstract game with a rather paste on theme. The gameplay is somewhat luck dependent as card-draw is quite important. This factor is going to exaggerate esp for 4 player game. As a 2 player game, the gameplay is tense and super-fun. My wife enjoys playing this game very much and the 9 point is given based on 2 player game. Would be a 7 if played with 4 players.
1 point to note is that the character's powers do have some variation, some are quite powerful with full player count while some are more powerful when played as 2 player game. It is a brilliant design that only 3 cards out of 5 would be played in a single game, making this game much more replayable and narrow down the power difference between characters.
I expect this game is going to be played many times more with my wife.

A pretty bad area control game set in the Android universe. I was really looking forward to it, but in reality it was too luck-dependent for the cards that came up.

RATING: 6
I understand it's based on Bauhaus (which I haven't played), but for an abstract game, I think the theme fits well enough.  After a high scoring first game, subsequent plays were tight and tactical affairs, and finding ways of creating/breaking tempo (especially with your character specific programs) becomes key.  The level of randomness is relatively high for an abstract.  By itself, it didn't cause anyone to win or lose, but as players become more familiar with the game, it's not hard to imagine chance deciding games.

The component quality of the interlocking plastic board, with slots for the plastic partitions, is quite good.     

I've only played this as a two player game, so I'm not sure how higher player counts would fare, but I imagine you'd have to be more opportunistic.

Essentially the "make of bunch of dots on a piece of paper and then draw lines to make boxes" game.  It's got a nice aesthetic and was pretty straightforward.  Cool variable player power too.

A:MF is a well-produced game that is extremely easy to teach and pick-up.  It's a light tactical game that has a mass-market feel: it's in good company with games like Stratego and Othello. For gamers, however, it's pretty dull.  It doesn't feel like a hobby game.

The framework is not bad, but the generic programs that swap & move access points completely destroy any ability to develop long-term strategies.  If these effects were nerfed & the game were more strategic, it would be significantly better.

RATING: 7.5
Pros:

Basically a board game version of the old arcade game Qix where you're trying to close up squares with your tokens inside to score points.

Cons:

Theme is pasted on and doesn't add anything to the game which is a huge shame since I love the cyberpunk aesthetic.

Really like this game, it reminds me of the games i used to play with grid paper and a pen, which it's only objective was to be the player with more squares "dominated".

Tactical game, best with 2 in my opinion. It adds too much chaos with 3 or 4 players

RATING: 5
As much as I love the theme, this is decidedly an abstract game. It sort of reminds me of the classic game, Squares, but you are trying to get larger enclosed areas if possible. I like that each character has some unique abilities, and that there are more characters than players to choose from. The gameplay isn't super interesting, to me, but this is one of the better abstracts I've played.

Dots and Boxes but it's accessible, strategic in some ways, and nearly anyone can pick it up and understand it without much effort. Great gateway game and great for anyone who is interested in games but doesn't know where to begin.

Nice abstract game, but with more "take that" than I would have liked due to a lot of token swapping cards. It might be better with fewer such cards. Components are great, as also is the main core concept of the gameplay.

RATING: 4.9
Nice components and plays quickly, but less a pure abstract than a game where the cards determine one's fate. Ultimately it's impossible to be strategic, especially with more than 2 players, so this feels less brain-burning than even the old kids' classic Dots and Boxes.

Played once with 2 players. Feels broken. The tokens with the player faces and any action that affects them is just vastly superior to placing or moving the blue lines. "Have to be alone in an area rule" forces you to score tiny areas, which in turn pretty much changes the game to a (biased) game of chance.

Nice abstract puzzle game. A bit of take that which left Ron feeling sour on the game. Variable player powers which also might be a bit unbalanced, hard to say with the options we had in the game. Ron felt they were not even. I enjoyed the game just fine, but since he did not I don't think it will be one that I pursue further. Worked perfectly well for me and is a game I would try again if it showed up on the table.

A simple game of lines and dots, with a cyberpunk theme.  Cards determine what shapes can be played per player in order to surround a "node."  Victory depends on the number of controlled nodes each player controls.  Different playable hackers have special shapes and abilities unique to that character, which helps with replayability.

Nice abstract game which has been skinned with the Netrunner theme. Production quality if very high (the board is very cool). The game has a simple rules set and is focused on strategic play. Abstract lovers will dig it and fans of the Android franchise should find something that entertains them too.

I'm really into the theme and I own all Android universe games - so naturally, this one is more enjoyable to me with the cyberpunk-clad characters. Gameplay is basically like a less complex version of Carcassonne (is that even possible?) where you try to lock down your zones to score points. Very short, very easy (also very easy to teach), would definitely play and suggest as a quick filler.

The addition of the individual role cards is a bad thing. If you exclude those you have a mildly entertaining area enclosure game, with too much randomness for my taste.

When it comes to abstract area enclosure you are better off with games that offer perfect information, such as Terra Nova, Fendo, Amazons, Go or Oklahoma Boomers.

Will only play with three. The four-player game is a little too chaotic. The board can change a ton between turns, so you really just have to do the best you can do and hope you get some points. With two players you you can pull off an awesome, smart, surprise move... that your opponent can just undo on his very next turn if the right card comes out. The two player game is just too prone to randomness.

I wasn't expecting too much from this game to be honest. It's simplicity is very apparent, but it's depth was stunning. I was happy to say I felt mentally drained after a couple of rounds with my friends. Of course I hope for more Runners and programs, but this game is just great regardless.

Reminds me of the old pen-and-paper game of squares. Definitely not for everyone as it's a rather an in-your-face game of area control. There are lots of entertaining opportunities to turn the tables on your opponent. Probably best with two players. Three player games lead to king making and four players games drag on a bit. I really enjoy this game, it's very underrated on bgg.

Doesn't drop Tash-Kalar off its throne as my go to abstract. But it is a good game. Just suffers from the exactly same problems as Tash-Kalar, it just works best with 2 players, the chaos in 4 player games makes it all situational instead of a planning game.

Advanced version of the 'Dots and Boxes' ('Squares') that you've probably played as a child.  Surprisingly good at adding extra dimensions to the game without it seeming 'tacked on' (but the theme is very thin; nothing about this game made me feel like some kind of cyberpunk hacker).

You can probably pick up a cheap plastic copy of [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/image/181642/cathedral]Cathedral[/url] at a Goodwill near you.  It's not more fun than Mainframe, but it's a lot less random and has micro-textured pieces. Which means that it is actually more fun.

If you're really in need of a short filler, just make out with someone for twenty minutes while everyone else argues over which longer game to play next.  I'll even offer up my own lips and tongue if it'll stop more copies of this game from being sold.  Watch the herp, though.

Also, I can't wait for Android tic-tac-toe to be released.

6 after 1 play

This is more suitable as a 2-player than a 3 or 4-player game. The cards that turn up can be pretty incidental and just happen to suit a player's needs. A simple tweak to improve this may be to open one more card, so that player knows what will be coming into the four available. Player interaction is rather negative as it is driven by sabotaging one another. Artwork is relatively simple and game component quality is ok.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really appreciate this card-driven abstract with a wafer-thin theme. Mainframe plays fast (even with 4), and can be explained in mere moments.

Some of my friends are 'meh' on this game, but I'm a cheerleader for it. Yes, your fate hangs on the random, suite cards, but I enjoy games whereby you have to manage the 'bad things' that come down the pipe.

Deduct a point or two from my rating if playing with two.

Here's one that will probably disappoint folks going into it without knowing what they're getting. It's very much an abstract game, and I'm not even sure I like the layer of Netrunner artwork that's been added onto it - but I guess it helps sell the idea of unique player cards, so I'll take it. I've enjoyed my plays of this and it's one I look forward to sharing with the right players.

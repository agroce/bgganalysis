An interesting little drafting game with a completely pasted on "theme."  Too simple, repetitive, limited and abstract for me.  Love drafting, did not love this game.  My wife and I played twice and that was enough.  Feel no need to play again.

A decent two player game where you are playing through three rounds of set collection. The trick is you play a card then trade hands so you are constantly balancing advancing your interests with impeding your opponents.

Meh - There was a slight bit of a mechanic for a game here, but it's very random and arbitrary.  This felt like a piece of a larger game, but by itself, barely an activity.  I'd rather play Sushi Go as there is some good round-to-round strategy and cute art.  The art in Tides of Time is actually it's strong point though.

We really like the mechanic of Tides of Time, but the icons, information layout, and poor readability of the text really take away from the quality of the game. The names of the cards are written in a very thin scratchy decorative script font and are very hard to read. This is a thinking game and it's really fun trying to figure out what your opponent will do and how you can stop them while helping yourself. We'll play this game again and again because it's fairly deep, but quick.

Το Tides of Time είναι ένα drafting παιχνίδι για 2 άτομα. Το παιχνίδι κρατάει 3 γύρους και σε κάθε γύρο επιλέγουμε συνολικά 5 κάρτες. Κάθε κάρτα δίνει πόντους με βάση το ποιες άλλες κάρτες έχεις επιλέξει. Επίσης στο τέλος του γύρου επιλέγουμε μια από τις κάρτες μας για να την κρατήσουμε στους επόμενους γύρους καθώς και μια κάρτα μας για να την αφαιρέσουμε από το παιχνίδι. Προφανώς νικητής είναι αυτός με τους περισσότερους πόντους στο τέλος του παιχνιδιού. :p

Γενικά είναι πολύ απλό στην εκμάθηση και παίζεται ταχύτατα. Έχει πολύ ωραίο artwork και μεγάλου μεγέθους κάρτες. Έχει περισσότερο βάθος και επιλογές από ότι θα περίμενε κανείς σε ένα παιχνίδι μόλις 18 καρτών. Και δεν είναι από Ιάπωνα σχεδιαστή όπως θα νόμιζε κανείς.:p

Τίμιο και αξιόλογο φιλεράκι 2 ατόμων. Πολύ καλό value for money. Δώστε του μια ευκαιρία.

drafting game 

Each game consists of three rounds in which players draft cards from their hands to build their kingdom. Each card is one of five suits and also has a scoring objective. After all cards have been drafted for the round, players total their points based on the suits of cards they collected and the scoring objectives on each card, then they record their score. After three rounds, the player with the the most prosperous kingdom wins.

This game is pretty bland. I had heard a lot of good things and picked it up to play with my wife, but neither of us was impressed. It isn't a bad game. I'd definitely play it again if someone asked me to, but I don't really have any desire to revisit it. It was just boring.

Neat micro drafting game that manages to have more depth than its length or components would suggest. Seems to be something nice to play as you wait for something meatier.

Ár-érték arányosan nem egy főnyeremény, de végül is nem katasztrófa. Gyakorlatilag egy folyamatos draft az egész, egymásra hivatkozó kártyákat kell jól kombózva lepakolni, sajnos nem túl változatos stílusúak a lapok (kb. annyi, hogy 5 szín van, és ezek egymást díjazzák kb. 3-4 különféle módon). Előnye, hogy pörgős, bárkivel játszható, de amúgy semmi maradandó. Nem értem, mit keres a top500 környékén.

An elegant game.  I don't pull it out too often because, as a microgame, it can easily grow stale. But if you don't over-play it, the options in it area really intriguing.  The play and counter-play is simple, but surprisingly deep.  It isn't the most amazing game in the world, but it is fast, easy to learn, and surprisingly difficult to play perfectly.  Plus, you add beautiful artwork, and you have a very nice staple of a two-player game.  If you play a lot of two player games, this is an excellent one to have in the mix!

Plays pretty much how one would expect from the description. Like Patchwork, I think the relative values need to be internalized before the gameplay starts to shine. Could go up to an 8 or 10 if the drafting/counterdrafting choices become interesting with repeat play.

Another quick 2 player Brian and I played waiting for our third to show for game night. I got handled mightily, 74-48. 2 player drafting really sounds like it wouldn't work, but it does in this. Which cards to keep in score areas, which card to discard each round are all interesting decisions. Brian got a killer combo early of the break ties card and the majority of suits winning with 1 card. I think Flo is going to love this one, so this will be a keeper into my stupidly vast 2 player only game collection.

Tides of Time is a 2 person micro-game focusing purely on card drafting. Yes. 2 person only... card drafting... micro-game. But wait!!! It completely works! There is plenty of depth, the cards are tarot size with absolutely gorgeous artwork, the decisions are very interesting throughout, and the 10-15 min play time doesn't overstay it's welcome in the slightest. 

Though this has since been replaced for me by it's Lovecraft sequel (due to added mechanics, not necessarily theme), this is still an excellent game and I still typically bring this out with someone if they haven't played either, before going up to Tides of Madness.

I don't play much two player stuff as I don't get too excited about playing games unless there's a group of at least three to play with, but Tides of Time is a good entry in the two-player list of options.

The game definitely hurts your brain a little as cards often both have a scoring method on them, but also a symbol that counts toward scoring methods on other cards. So, you try to keep cards that will score well for yourself while denying cards you know your opponent needs.

Overall, a neat game that I'd consider pulling out if there are just two players.  I don't love it, but I liked it well enough.

2p drafting game, which is quite a feat to create to begin with. A good memory is quite handy here (especially when you pass your cards) and even though it's only 18 cards, the amount of variability gives it a huge replay value imo.

A very simple pass and play game. Reminds me a little of sushi go, but a little more simple and with beautiful artwork. You're trying to put down cards that will work and score for you, well keeping your opponent from putting down cards that will score for them. 3 rounds of this at the end of each round you gather up cards keep One Forever And then discard one. Then add two more to your hand. So every round is a little bit different. Really quick and easy. Travels easily, too, and doesn't take up too much room on a table.

RATING: 6
Woah, this game blew me away! Not that it’s one of my favorite games, because it isn’t (which you can tell from my rating), but I went into it with no expectations at all, and it turned out that it is an excellent game. It’s a drafting game for 2 players (?!) which takes a maximum of 10-15 minutes to play! It’s so easy, but it really does have some depth. Oh, and did I mention that the game consists of 18 cards… Yes, that’s right, 18! I feel that this is the most game you can ever get out of 18 cards, and no, I don’t like Love Letter. 

You play 3 rounds, and whoever has the most points, shockingly, wins. You get a hand of 5 cards in the first round, choose one card and pass the rest on to your opponent who does the same thing. After the last card is scored, you tally up the points and record it. Also, you get to keep one of the cards you’ve played for the next round, and you discard one card (which means your opponent is never sure which cards are still in the game). This means that you have a hand of 3 cards left, so you draw 2 new cards for the next round. Very. Simple.
The cards often feature an icon and a way of scoring; i.e. a card gives me 7 points if I have the most of the red tower icons after the round. The card itself never gives the same symbol as it scores, so you need a couple of different ones. Also, there are cards that give 3 points per symbol of a specific type, 5 points for a pair, 3 for each symbol you haven’t played and a card that gives you 13 points if you have all 5 symbols – hard, but definitely not impossible, to pull of as your opponent will try to snatch the last card you need! There are also special cards which grant you abilities such as winning ties and scoring an additional 8 points if you have a card that scored the highest etc., so there are many options to consider in each round, and it’s always a tough decision which card you choose for yourself, and sometimes “hate drafting” can be the better call as I described before.

Now, your plans can get somewhat messed up (partly because of your opponent, which is fine!) due to the random card draws – i.e. if you’re going for a certain type and no cards show up in the hand, or if you go for a majority in a type and your opponent randomly chooses that type of card as his first card etc, but I don’t mind that in such a short game. Sometimes you just have to take a chance, but overall I find that the game rewards clever play! Just be aware that some games can be very swingy; I’ve won a game 76-29, but also lost a game 55-56, so it varies a lot.

It honestly is one of the best meaty filler games for 2 players on the market, and I highly recommend it. Time will tell if the replayability becomes an issue, because you do use the same 18 cards in every game, but 1) I can imagine an expansion will be published, and 2) due to the nature of the random order the cards show up (and which cards you choose to keep between the rounds), no game will be exactly the same. Oh, I can also imagine that knowing all the cards could lead to card counting, but those I play with almost never do that, so it’s not an issue.

Oh, and I don’t really care myself, but I know a lot of people do and that it might be one of the decisive points in whether one wants to play it or not: the artwork is stunningly good!

Card drafting with two players is always a bit odd, which is why we rarely play Fairy Tale that way anymore. So I was a bit unsure if it could work in this game.

And it really does feel like just that, except there's less of set collection here and more of the aspect in Fairy Tale where you try to maximize your points through good card combinations. Each card in the deck scores a different way. One unique aspect is you set aside one card permanently for the rest of the game, so you have something to rely on.

It's curious - we neither loved nor hated it and are willing to give it more plays to see how we feel about it. I will warn you that this game will definitely favor someone who's played it before vs. a newbie.

What I really like about this game: it's small, portable, but still packs a punch. It's definitely a game that gets better and better with each play (the first time feels a bit like a shot in the dark); once you know what cards are in the 18 card deck, you can start to see what your opponent is going for and balance getting cards that reward you with a high score with trying to block your opponent. Lots of fun!

It's ok. Get's too "thinky" for my taste. You must assess if its better to hurt your opponent by "hate-drafting" or to work on your own combo. This decision must be made every round and is thus basically the game.
On the plus side: Its small and can even be played on train or plane.

I do enjoy drafting and I don't mind the memory aspect of this game. But somehow Tides of Time doesn't really grab me. It doesn't rise above the pure mechanical level. Whenever I  have the need for a short two player game, I would always prefer something like [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3201/lord-rings-confrontation]Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation[/url] or [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/54043/jaipur]Jaipur[/url] which manage to entertain me a lot more.

There's nothing wrong with this game, it's just not really something that I do enjoy playing too much.

Surprising how this game brings depth and strategy in 18 cards! When drafting, you need to take into account the symbols you have, the ones you target, what you don't want to leave to your opponent, and you need to remember what is in each hand so you know what to expect back. Three rounds, and the end of the two firsts allows you to influence the next ones by keeping and removing cards. Absolutely great game.

Tides of Time is a fast 2 player micro-card game which plays in minutes and has a surprising amount of depth.  It reminds me of many-a Japanese game with an elegant simplicity about itself.  The card drafting works well, although there is a degree of memory required which can be easily overcome by playing openly.  

When you have had enough of Braverats, move on to Tides of Time.

My only criticisms are the pointless thematic overlay (this is a purely abstract card game) and that it is packaged in an oversized box when a Love-letter sized pouch would have been so much better.

It's got one mechanic, and it aces it. The way the suits and scoring/abilities interact on each card makes for incredibly interesting decisions for a game this small. At round end, choosing which cards to discard, keep, or turn to relics is surprisingly deep and impactful to the rest of the game. A little bit of memory can go a long way in this game, and is my only critique. I'm not sure how many plays it can muster, but totally worth the price tag.

Two player only card drafting micro game. Great art and component quality. The rule are on one folding sheet, so that's annoying. Commendable for how much crunchy gameplay is in such a small number of cards. Very nice innovation where at the end of each round you keep one card and banish one card. When it comes to small drafting games I think I prefer Fairy Tale, but Tides of Time is better than Sushi Go for only 2 players.

Wow. What an amazing amount of game in just 18 cards. Bit of a learning curve as you become familiar with the cards. Once both players are up to speed, play becomes balancing scoring for yourself while foiling opponent. Wins can come down to a bit of luck in your pseudo plan(s) working out.

Feels like Roof of the World card may be overpowered. Not sure how you counter this card if it shows up in round 1 and sticks around.

RATING: 5
The two player drafting doesn't quite work, indeed the whole game is more memory orientated than expected. There are only 18 cards of which you see 16 in a game, and to be honest a lot of the cards are incredibly similar.

I like that from round 2 you pick up the cards you previously drafted and they go round again as this means cards that work well together must become split up.

Meglepően sok van benne, ahhoz képest, hogy csak pár kártya draftolásáról szül a játék. Jó játék, de nem feltétlenül az én stílusom. Egyrészt a kétfős játékok szerintem fél játékok, másrészt itt fontos lenne minden kártyát megjegyezni a szettekből, és abból előre tervezni mindent, amihez nekem nincs annyira kedvem, amikor játszom.

A clever little drafting game with just a handful of cards. It's interesting to see the split into monster games with ever more components on one side and the minimalist school of trying to to more with less and less on the other. As much as I like the general idea, though, I believe this will fall a little flat after some plays. The card interactions simply aren't all that exciting and mostly just mirror each other.

Excellent, small drafting game that might not seem like much at first glance (aside from the fenomenal artwork), but really is more than meets the eye. The "Relic of the Past" mechanic is very cool, and even though there are only 18 cards in the game some of them will be discarded between rounds and become unavailable to either player, which forces you to plan ahead for which choices will remain in the cardpool, along with trying to stay ahead of your opponents strategies. Quick and engaging, a great package.

Excellent minimalistic drafting game for two players that is easy to learn and has a lot of replayability.

Can you still call Tides of Time a microgame when it comes with such big cards and box? I'd say so, because at its core there are 18 cards and 4 tokens. 

If so, it's by far my favorite microgame.

At only 18 cards, and little other components, this is the smallest game I own, even if it's not in the smallest box.  But I never would have thought that those 18 cards could contain a surprising amount of depth and replayability.  For a simple card drafting game you can explain and play in under 30 minutes, this game is perfect on the go.  Play in  bar or while waiting at the doctor's office, just shuffle, deal, and go.

Fine filler for two, reminiscent of "Fairy Tale" but even simpler. Basically, you draft and score cards for three rounds. The all-or-nothing nature of some cards can cause scores to be swingy. The theme is nothing but an excuse for the amazing artwork that definitely pushes my rating up a notch.

Wow. Very impressive for such a tiny game.  It's almost as small as Love Letter, but the mechanic is pretty much Sushi Go.  Like Sushi Go, it's fun to play.

Mine, recomprado a D.A. en 06/2017, y tambien Yera. 

Es un "filler" 1vs1 en el que los dos jugadores tratan de obtener la mejor combinacion de cartas a lo largo de 3 rondas. 

La seleccion de cartas se hace mediante "draft" (al estilo de 7 wonders). y bueno... la idea es conseguir el mejor "combo" posible, y/o evitar que lo consiga el otro jugador. 

Todo esto aderezado con unas ilustraciones preciosas. te puedes quedar embobado un rato solo mirando los paisajes. 

En lo suyo, de lo mejorcito. (por eso me lo agencié, ahora a ver si consigo encontrar gente para jugarlo :p)

We use this as a filler or compact travel game.  It was very easy to understand the rules and mechanics, but it took us a few turns to develop a strategy and awareness of how to employ that strategy.  It is definitely more enjoyable to have the players matched in skill (either both have never played, or both have played) so that it does not feel unbalanced to either side.  Keep up the great work Portal!  Cheers all!!

An okay draft game that seemed to rely way too much on memorizing a small set of 18 cards (that most of which were just slight variations on each other).

I appreciated the idea of the twist (retaining cards between rounds), but it didn't do enough in our actual play.

I thought creating a good, non-party game with just 18 cards was not possible.  Quickly boring Love Letter being as far as you could go.
BUT here it is - a serious 2-player design with amazingly - for such a simple game - complex and interesting decisions.

EDIT: The replayability is REALLY good.  The game surprises me with the consequences of my choices every single time.  Amazingly, you need to master it o_O.  Such a simple game...

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2015)

Tides of Time is an ok drafting game. Easy to teach and with great art, but nothing really exciting. 

The rules are easy to learn and the playtime is rather short. The theme is almost nonexistent but it does have, somewhat, interesting decisions and can be fun. Great components and very fast play. I like that it is a drafting game for two, so memory plays a huge role here.

Bottom line, I would play again if requested, but I already sold my copy of the game. It is too light for us (although it has some depth).

Players draw five cards, play one, pass the hand, play one, pass the hand... and so on. The cards do typical and boring stuff, like giving points for having a majority in a certain suit, having the highest point card, multiplying your strongest suit and *YAWN*, I'd go on but I'm sleepy just typing this. Feels like I've been down this road before and the drive has become ever more dull. #jadedgamer

A fun little 2-player draft game. 2-player drafting games are weird, as you have complete information regarding what will be "wheeling" (aka coming back to you) when you pass the cards. Each card has a set of rules on how it scores. Players play 3 rounds, keeping a card in between each round and selecting a card to remove from the game for the following rounds. Still, for the time investment you can't go wrong with this one.

Two player fairy tale.

The quality of the cards is excellent.
the gameplay is boring to me because in the end it boils down to remembering which cards are in play and building your score combos based on that memory aspect.

since it is two player and after the first passthrough in each round you have open information of all cards in that round. You just don't know where they will end up.

I trashed my opponent.

I'm a Portal fanboy, and have been looking forward to this. It's pretty neat. It's Portal's stab at a "microgame" which is a genre I'm growing tired of hearing about, but this one is a little different. It's a drafting game with only 18 cards. We played twice and enjoyed it, though I'm not sure if this is one that will survive the long haul.

consider my rating much higher than what I marked
the reason its not a 10/10 is it did exactly what is was designed to do, be a small quick game.

2 player only, and that works well
fairly straight forward rules to learn and play
simple draft and pass mechanic
short game but feels like a full game
surprising amount of replay-ability for using all the cards each game
great looking artwork
game chose to go heavy on the art and components, even the inside of the box has nice looking art

the only negative I can think of applying is they could have a cheap version...maybe in a few years it'll make sense to do.  Maybe like s super slim pnp version for a buck or something.

anyways 10/10 for actual rating
my rating number is more of a scale saying I'd play other games before it....but idk if thats fair, you can knock out a game of this in minutes.

First I thought that is gets a bit boring after a while. Then opening the box again after some time and while starting to play again I thought: This has aged well and it is a really good in-between-game. Lots of "Kitsch" in the illustrations but a nice feel overall.

RATING: 8
Normally, I'm not a fan of microgames.  Really can't stand Love Letter.  Almost passed on Tides of Time because I wasn't sure 18 cards would make an interesting game, but Gencon impulse buying prevailed.  I was wrong, there's a lot of interesting little decisions to make in this game.  You have to evaluate the cards you have, the ones your opponent has, plus the cards available for drafting.  Add in the fact that Card A may benefit from Card B, but Card B would benefit from Card C, etc, you have quite a bit of things to consider when drafting.  Love that you throw out a card and permanently keep a card every round, too.  Pretty clever game!

I like this one quite a bit. The artwork is gorgeous, it's got a lot of thought going on in a short game, and it plays quick. But my wife never liked it, and she's my main 2P opponent, and the kids never wanted to try it.

And... I tried the next generation Tides of Madness with Ignacy this month, and it takes it to the next level.

Played Gen Con 2015

The cards for this game were beautiful --- but it was odd because the card names were a tad challenging to read both in color and font and oddly the names were in cursive -- which is a surprising choice given how many individuals under the age of 30 can not read script. Needed to know card names when looking up descriptions for game help at beginning to understand some of what a card could do. 

The descriptions of the card actions are not always crystal clean and could have done with some rewording on some of them --- but are several interesting combinations and most were easy to read.  

Being able to permanently keep a card was a cool quirk but the permanent discarding option was more random due to not knowing future cards. However both added a cool dynamic to game. 

Each player receives 5 cards-- plays and passes the hand so  you have to always remember the cards in the other hand and be able to remember the combinations. I just didn't like it due to that -- it's not a bad game at all,  it's just a game that heavily draws upon memory and I don't tend to enjoy those as not very good at them. This is a cool little game and I think a lot of people will like it,  but it's not for me.

Egyszerű, de nagyszerű taktikai kártyajáték, gyorsan felfogható szabályokkal.

Két hibája van:
 - ha sokat játszol vele, unalmassá válik, olyankor javasolt visszatenni a polcra pár hónapot és csak utána elővenni
 - csak két játékost szolgál ki, tehát nem egy (nagy)családos játék

Harmadik nem hiba ugyan, de van sok hasonló játék már a piacon, ennek ellenére üde színfolt, már csak a szép kártyák miatt is (a szövegek betűtípusai viszont gyalázatosak).

I liked it, and the art is gorgeous, but whoever picked the font style should be shot. Ultimately, I don't have a lot of room for 2-player games and so I passed it on.

Mechanically, this brings absolutely nothing new to the table. It's a simple card-drafting game with set collection based on different suits. The artwork is nice, yes, but it feels like they had these pieces of art that couldn't be used in any other game, so they decided to shoehorn them in here. For the price point, however, this works well as a 2-player micro game. It kind of feels like 7 Wonders: The Micro Game, though I doubt I'd play this over 7 Wonders Duel. Still pretty fun for what it is, and simple enough that just about anyone can play.

Perhaps a little too thinky for its own good, this is a sterling 2P game nevertheless. The real cleverness is in realising that an 18-card deck can be quickly learned, assimilated and replicated in just a game or two. Ultimately, though, it's just a little sterile when put against free-wheeling modern 2P games such as ACBaS.

[b]Tides of Time[/b] was traded away for the NY 1901 Flatiron expansion 11/1/15.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

I'm just not a fan of most microgames since they lack staying power (Love Letter being an exception) and Tides of Time is no different. We had fun for a few games, but never felt the need to come back to it after that. 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

Tides of Time is definitely a fun 2p drafting micro game, but it's still a micro game. The game play is clever, there are plenty of choices to be made when it comes to the end of each age and you need to decide which card to build (and permanently have in your tableau) and which one to remove. It's a testament to the designer that he could pack in so many decisions into an 18 card deck. I have enjoyed my plays of the game , but in the end I am left wishing that this had been developed into a full fledged game instead of a microgame (selfish I know). 

All that said I would definitely recommend checking ToT out, especially since it is so inexpensive and portable. It is by far the best micro game I've played (but I'm realizing that micro games just aren't my thing).[/i]

RATING: 6
This is a beautiful, sophisticated, and timeless 2-player microgame. It plays "fast", but each decision can be an agonizing one. Tides of Time is a modern day classic. The tight game design, the stunning artwork, and the smoothly integrated graphic design make it so. Well Done, Portal Games.

Though it an excellent game, it feels dry or abstract, but that would be a positive note for many people. But as for me, alas, I would rather play Eminent Domain: Microcosm or Love Letter.

As I have not played Tides of Madness, yet, I cannot comment on comparisons.

Based on one play: A simple drafting game that left me thinking there should be more here. The cards have symbols and a scoring rule on each one, so you must select the one you need to get the most points while also blocking your opponent. A nice idea that is common in many games but at this simplicity it is fairly dull.

Decent game, but it has nowhere near the replay value of some other 2 player card games such as Battle Line or Lost Cities. I admire what the game is able to do with only 18 cards, though. But I don't see anyone playing this more than about 20 times or so. I have played Lost Cities hundreds of times and still enjoy it.

Tides of Time is a very light card drafting game and set collection for 2 players. The deck is very small, such that over the course of 3 rounds players will see all of the cards available. The interesting twist here, however, is that at the end of each round, players can choose to keep a single card in their domain that will provide the seed of strategy for the drafting in the next round. This is a novel idea and I quite enjoyed it, but I'm a little concerned that it will not have a long play life on the table due to its overall simplicity.

Interesting 2-player drafting game.  The problem with it is that drafting games kind of depend on the idea that you might forget what's going around the table in everyone's hands.  Tides of Time doesn't require much in the way of memory, so it becomes more of a "adjust to your opponent" type thing...which isn't bad, necessarily.  It just isn't very exciting.  
Good art, high quality, but a little pricey for what is basically a micro game.

Tides of Time is a clever 2p drafting microgame but I found it too mechanical and the card powers lacking in diversity. For a 15-minute 2p game I'd much rather something where the rules get out of the way and the psychology really shines, like Khmer.

RATING: 3
Played this in the hopes of loving it and getting Tides of Madness, but no..this game severely lacks depth. I'm sure that after a dozen plays, you can start seeing the right moves and come up with a strategy, but for a short 2 player strategic game, I have tons of others I would chose over this. 

I should also mention that the art and cards are awesome and I loved them, but the game itself is pretty much an abstract game of points and suits. If you like this or are thinking of getting it, there are tons of better 2 player games out there with similar weights and playtimes.

RATING: 7
An enjoyable drafting game for two players, it has beautiful art and allows for great ways to try and out think your opponent. I find the biggest flaws stem from production value. The instruction sheet is a little too large for the box, however the components feel too loose in the box and would prefer a snugger fit.

Card drafting set collection game. Each card has instructions (and award) for if that set is collected. Cards are nice, big, and colorful. Short 2-player filler game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really appreciate this game from the perspective of game design far more than actually playing it, as by simply having three moving pieces (drafting, suits, and scoring conditions) and having their interactions produce a game is quite clever. It works particularly well I think because it is designed for only two players, as the addition of more players and more cards would only bog down the game's ability to be comprehensible within the first play.

That being said, considering that this is for all intents and purposes a micro-game, it seems to be presented as if it is something much bulkier (which feels like a recurring thing with Portal products, as they tend to either be heavy or surprisingly tiny).

The art and components in this game are very nice!  The game play is solid and the decisions are fun.  The scoring makes this game quite strategic.  It's quick, easy to learn.  Very solid.

Here's the problem.  My wife and I played this game once and thought.  Ok, this is really good.  Now they need about 30 more cards.  The problem is that you will quickly memorize which cards work together well and know how to optimally build your kingdom based on the cards in your starting hand.

How many plays until you will have determined the optimum play?  I'm not sure; but I can say that once you determine this, the game will start to play you, rather than you playing the game.

Not bad compared to the playing time. I don't like the fact that the game is so much based on the memory aspect, essentially the downside of any 2-player drafting game. Drafting(passing cards to each other) with two players is just a bad design choice. In essence ToT is a memory based guessing game with little luck.

Good as a travel game or if you have little table space. In any other scenario I'd rather play something else.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Clever short reasonably enjoyable card drafting game. The rules are basically clear, and if anything is confusing, you can probably find it clarified in [[Tides of Time FAQ]] which I created. :)

But:
1.  Portal [i]again[/i] makes unnecessarily too-small text in harder to read typeface on the cards, and you need to read not only your own cards but the opponent's cards lying across the table. The vast majority of the card real estate is just the art! Sure, the art is pretty, but I really dislike when pretty art trumps usability. And there are 5 suits with various symbols (some clear, some a bit odd), in green, gold, blue, and ... [i]two shades of red.[/i] Why two shades of red? I have no idea. I'd have probably rated the game a point higher if the card design and size were better.
2. The cards themselves are awkardly large physically, so harder to shuffle and it also takes up uncomfortable amounts of table space.
3. It's a "microgame", so you see the same 18 cards every time you play. With a "microgame" like this, that goes with the territory, but it does make it feel a bit repetitive sometimes.

We acquired Tides of Time in a math trade after binge-playing Greed and deciding to try another 2-player drafting game. But in the end we both prefer Greed (which besides having more readable and normal-sized cards, also has the advantage of working with 2-5 players.) They can both be played in about 15 minutes.

Still, I expect to enjoy playing it occasionally, even if less often than Greed.

Clever little game to bring out when you're on the road. Takes about ten minutes, but it's ten minutes of decent planning and choices. Easy to teach in one minute. No idea if it's hard to master or whether there's some really clever way to play, but let's not overthink it and just enjoy playing. Just for a bit of fun and as a break from Love Letter and the like.

You're constantly gambling on which route you should pursue, while denying your opponent suits that'll reward them big bonus points. Throw in a few special rule breaking cards and you might be trying to engineer your opponent a big win in one particular suit... but they'll see that coming and grab the three points per suit card... but... but... but...

Yep, it's got some good guessing, double guessing and painful decisions wrapped in 5-10 minutes play. Clever. I like the way it builds over three rounds as you retain one card card and remove a card from the game in the first two rounds. I feel that gives me some semblance of control.

Not sure why Portal decide to completely overproduce this one. It could have been packaged in a portable little box or AEG type bag for half the price. It definitely deserves to be in the hands of more gamers. The big box is just asking for people to print off their fan editions. I like the space themed fan made version more than the official release hard to see graphics.

2016: n/a. Only a couple of plays under my belt so far but impressed with what I've seen.  Plays very very quickly, but the decisions are tricky and there's a really great state of "flow" as you play this game, new options or subtle aspects of the game open up in front of the player in a really smooth way, lots of "a ha" moments.

2017: 7, to start.  Want to play more but for now think it will sit here.  It plays fast, easy to explain, has just enough tough decisions...the very definition of a great filler game.

This is a cool little micro game of sorts, like [thing=606][/thing] but a bit more complicated. There are 3 rounds. Each round, you draft a hand of cards one by one, adding the chosen card to your display. The cards are in 5 suits, each of which score (at the end of each hand) in a different way (e.g., most cards of the suit, specific points on the cards for having most cards). After the round, leave one card in your display (kingdom), draw replacements, and draft again. The player with the most VP after 3 hands wins!

It's a neat little game, quite fun although I prefer longer games.

Love the drafting mechanic and how you keep one card in your kingdom for the rest of the game while also discarding one (for the remainder).  It made you think about your possible cards to build, but also kept you on your toes while watching your opponents kindgom being built.

This is similar to Love Letter in that is has very few components, but some strategy. And I'm pretty sure I like it better than Love Letter.

There are three rounds of drafting 5 cards each ala 7 Wonders, but you mostly reset each round. Each player removes a card from the game and keeps one in front of them permanently, so you end up with 6 and 7 cards in later rounds. the cards each have a suit and scores points depending on which suits you end up with. It all comes together into a solid game with a nice balance of luck, tactics, and strategy. Wouldn't mind playing this again, although I don't need to buy it.

Nice little game and it shows how a few cards can be used to a clever yet very swift drafting game. Nice addition to your collection if you don't have fast 2-player game. Thanks to it's small size it can be carried anywhere, just another plus of this game. And art is very nice.

Astonishingly thinky micro game - just 18 cards, but you have to think about each and every selection all through the game. Quite fun to play and definitely deeper than other micro games. And it is a drafting game for two players that actually works great. Footprint is very small, you can play it on the train or at the cafe, easily. Be aware you need some way to count points between rounds, though - the german version comes without pen and paper.

I was curious about this game as soon as I heard about it. There's not many two player drafting games in the first place, and it's a 19 card micro-game to boot. I don't get to play many 2 player games but having one as a quick filler makes a lot of sense.

The game is played over 3 rounds. Each round you have five cards from which to draft, after which you score the round. After the first and second rounds, you select one card to become a permanent part of your tableau (which stays on the table until the end of the game) and another card that gets discarded from the game. Four new cards are added to the game, bringing the card count back up to 10. After the third round the game is over.

Cards come in five types of suits (3 cards in each suit), and four unsuited cards. Most cards have a scoring objective. One type gives you 7 points if you have the most of a particular suit. Another type gives you points for each card of a suit. Another type rewards sets (5 pts for 2 suits, 9 points for the other 3 suits, and 13 points for all the suits). And there are cards that do things... like break ties in your favor, double the suit(s) you have the most cards in, give you points for having the single card that scored the most points in the round, etc.

There's actually quite a bit to think about in this game. After your first draft pick, you know exactly what cards are in play for that round, and which you won't see until later rounds. You know what your opponent has selected, what he probably is going for, what scoring opportunities exist, etc. And your goal is to craft a plan to get the most points for you, while denying your opponent what they want. And as your opponent takes cards, all of that might change on the fly. And then you have to decide which card to make permanent and which to banish from the game, which sets up the long term strategy for you and a chance to nix the opponent's strategy.

For a quick filler game there's a lot to think about. This game works both as a micro-game and as a two card drafting game. I was pleasantly surprised.

Cool game - played a couple of times - seems to have a LOT of depth the more you play.  Looking forward to developing my skill at this game.

Good example however of how crappy graphic design can ruin awesome illustrations.  Amazing artwork ruined by 2 x awful and unreadable fonts, and really chunky icons, all of which don't match the painterly and epic scope of the art.

The cards are nice to look at, but after just a handful of plays I've gotten pretty bored of it. There isn't any variety, and it just lacks excitement. Luckily, it's a short game, so if someone request it, I'll usually play.

A 10 minute Euro based on draft scoring with breathtaking art. Kristian Čurla managed to pack in much more interaction between players than most other big box versions of draft and build Euro games.  Unlike others of its kind players often find themselves considering a draft to stifle the other player more than seeking to build or score.  Make no mistake, this is a true micro game in the size and length range of Love Letter.  However, this is a well measured Euro that requires skill and precision over luck to defeat your opponent.  My pick for best Micro game and two player game of 2015.

For a small box, 18-card, two player filler, ToT is surprisingly decent. I am impressed that this card-drafting game works with two, as is my wife. Neither of us love card drafting as a mechanism partly because we feel card drafting feels swingy, has a memory aspect and can be unpredictable. It helps that ToT is short and two player, which usually helps. 

I am sure after a few more dozen plays, the sheen will come off and this game will fade into the background. To be sure, ToT is not Lost Cities nor will it have the longevity of LOTR the Confrontation, but it is nonetheless a good distraction.

Played this a few times tonight and it's a fun, simple, easy game to learn. We did have to read some of the card clearifications for the first couple rounds to make sure this worked with that and that with this etc... but no big deal. The games has some strategy but I found that 1 wrong card and your round could be forever lost. However being 3 rounds in a game that is mitigated a little. 

All in all I had fun with it. If circumstances called for a quick game I might pull it out. If someone asked to play it I'd happily pull it out, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice if I'm given some other better options.

The game sounded interesting on paper, but when I played it, it was too random and chaotic, even when I focused on a certain strategy. The artwork/theme did nothing for me, it could have been anything. Also, some of the card powers weren't explained very well. With such a limited card pool, I expected more variety but most of the cards did similar things. I really don't get the hype.

Surprisingly enjoyable, probably mostly so just because of how quick and isolated it is.  All the "fun" of 7 Wonders packed into 5-10 minutes.  Mind you I'm not a big fan of 7 Wonders, but this cuts it down enough to where it's just pure quick decisions that I enjoy it.

This is a neat little two player drafting and set collection game.  It plays very fast and has a surprising depth of strategy and tactics for such a small number of cards.

Rather basic set collection game with drafting mechanics taken from 7 Wonders. It's very repetitive, lifeless and it just doesn't grab me the way other "micro games" do.

The cards are way oversized, they should be at least 50% smaller. This game could be a decent train or plane game, but the cards just take too much table space for that purpose.

RATING: 6.5
Played in Essen (2015). Simple 2 player strategy card game. The game is played in three ages/rounds of card drafting (the hands alternate 7 Wonders style). Sadly, I failed at getting a proper picture.
 

Each card has a colored symbol (5 different symbols) and an effect that either scores points or changes how points are scored. For example: one card with a yellow (crown) symbol has the following effect "score 3 points for all red (towers)" or "score five points for each pair of blue and green" and so on. The more difficult the condition the more points it scores.
 

In each round each player gets to play 5 cards. After each round each player selects two cards, one to keep as a relic (and it stays in play on your side until the end of the game) and one to remove from the game. Then each hand is filled to 5 again and the next age starts. Points are counted after each age.
 

There's a total of 18 (beautiful) cards. The game is played in under half an hour. I would definitely play again but with the limited amount of cards we were both afraid it would quickly become repetitive. At 12 euros however that would have been a risk I might have taken but ... my co-player wasn't having it

OK game, similar in a certain sense, to Fairy Tale. 
The artwork is very nice, but I don't like much those huge cards when all you need to play the game is written in small fonts on the top of the cards.
There are some mechanics that I don't like much (for example, revealing the chosen card every turn instead of doing that at the end of the drafting phase, keeping one card each round for the entire game), but the game is quick and enjoyable. Maybe I'm just a little bit disappointed by the huge hype that was around this game.

In Fairy Tale, you draft cards, and then just score what you drafted. Tides of Time is very similar, except you lock one card in each round, and remove one card from the game each round, replace those two in your hand, and keep working with your 40% different hand. Simple rules, mildly convoluted scoring, and phenomenal art.

This is a fun and light game to learn and play. The nice thing about the game is it plays quick, but in all my plays I have not found one optimal strategy to use to play and win. Good as a nice light couples game, or a board game night filler. Also works well if you play the best of three games, as each game has three rounds and takes about 10-15 minutes a game, so about 45-60 minutes in total.

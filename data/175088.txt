RATING: 8
Excellent children's game. Entry level strategy with good dexterity component.  Children have a natural advantage due to their smaller fingers. This edition is wholly better than the original Gulo Gulo.  The addition of the mummy and beetles provides slightly more tactics.

Another game that's fun due to the enjoyment of my younger children while playing it rather than the game itself.  The inherent advantage it gives to smaller hands is just so marvelously clever.

The copy we received for our daughter came with no mummy trap and duplicated tokens.  So we were able to substitute a small bowl to try it but the missing colors of tokens made it unplayable.  We contacted HABA and hope to have this corrected shortly, but hopefully our daughter is still interested by then...

HABA corrected the mistake and everyone enjoyed the game.

The best part of this "game" is trying to remove the marbles from the cup.  The board and game part of it are horrible.  This is made worse by the absolute shit show of a rulebook.  For a children's game it should have been clear, concise and straight forward.  The "examples" in the book were also crap.  Not many kids playing this by the rules, since they're terrible once figured out anyway.

This is a great family game where the kids' smaller fingers can deftly remove the "stones" while parents can really struggle.  Makes for alot of laughs and the game plays fairly quickly.

Gulo Gulo rethemed. There are a bunch of minor differences that don't really detract or add to the original, so I'd consider them equivalent. 

The spheres are slightly more difficult to extract than eggs, and more prone to slipping further in. There's a halfway point that acts as a safely net. The board it a bit easier to set up. There's a marauding mummy that may stall you, and a requirement to stop at a few spaces before making a run for the win. 

The one subtle change is that the rod tends to fall out sooner than in the previous version. I remember some long streaks in the original and those streaks are rarer here... most of your moves will feel like close calls, So there's a bit less of the push-your-luck anticipation than before.

This one is more for the kids. If you have large fingers, forget about it. Usually you are able to only pull like 3-4 balls out max before the trap is sprung so the game can lag. Excellent production quality though.

Surprisingly difficult for adults.  The boulders are super slippery and the curvature of the bowl really makes it hard to get a grip on one.  Getting the alarm stick to stand up is its own challenge.  The game took too long for my 4.5 year old and we kept failing over and over again.  There was some rules confusion, so I'm going to have to look up what we may have been doing wrong.  The box says ages 7 and up, so maybe he's too young, but I don't think so.  I think we played something wrong.

UPDATE: We weren't resetting the bowl with every landslide.  The rules weren't clear.  Playing where each landslide resets the entire bowl makes it move along way faster.  My 4.5 year old asks to play this game regularly now.

UPDATE after 5th play: We were moving the mummy wrong, but it didn't affect our fun.  My son barely grabs the boulders with his tiny fingers and somehow still manages to get a good grip on them.  Kids are at a definite advantage in this game.  Geez.  I lose ALL the time.

Pharaoh's Gulo Gulo unique and interesting.  Well, unique to me anyways.  I know it's based on Gulo Gulo, but I had never played that before.  I really like the unique way that players move their pieces.  That little "mummy trap" is a blast to mess around with.  I think my only little gripe is the mummy.  He just doesn't seem to do much and seems a little tacked on.  In any case, a great little game I'll be playing with my niece in the future, I do believe.

RATING: 7
A dexterity game with some tactics piled on top.  As an adult you'd better be good at the tactics because a child will whup you every time on the dexterity part.  Those sticky little fingers can pluck a stone out of the cup without a problem while your big old adult fingers can't grip one even if you can get to it.

Another nice family game from Haba.  Components are top notch, with a nice wooden bowl and ball set, chunky wooden pieces, large board, etc.  Kids will have an advantage with their little fingers finding it easier to reach into the bowl than larger adult fingers.  And that's how you work the word "fingers" into one sentence twice.

I actually liked this more than Gulo Gulo. I like the mummy part and needing to have the scarabs at the end. It gives you a small and minor goals to complete in order to succeed at the end in addition to the dex pulling from the cup. Very cute and very fun kids/ family game. HUGE box, or I would likely own it.

Initially I thought this game was one of the best young family games, with a far better narrative than the wolverine version, especially when tactically trying to move the mummy to block or slow down others . However over time especially playing with my 2 young nieces my enthusiasm diminished: I think this is strictly a 2 player affair as the alarm, although has an inbuilt handicap for big fingers, isn't as dramatic as perceived compared to say Operation or maybe Riff Raff. As I have Pyramid with similar patrolling mummy I find that game far more enjoyable.

The best game for small children (as young as 2 or 3) that you'll still enjoy playing yourself. And the kids have just as good as chance at winning as you do since their little fingers seem to be able to pull the boulders out of that bowl so much easier. For the smallest kids, make the decision of whether to flip a tile for them, and just tell them which color boulder to get - they'll still love it.

Re-implementation of the original. I think this theme is much more fun for kids. There are a couple very minor rules tweaks that can add a tiny bit more complication (the mummy), but I think they make it better for all but the youngest kids. And you can always just play without the mummy anyways.

Pros:
Excellent game for kids and adults.
The rules are straightforward and kids can actually compete.
The components are high quality.

Cons:
Crazy big box.
I think it runs a bit long for younger kids. 

Other thoughts:
I would just start inside the pyramid and go from there. Maybe only require 1 scarab to enter instead of two.

Unique dexterity game tied to a race game tied to some convoluted Egyptian thingy (it's a kids game, so not that convoluted, but adds complication). 

Main idea - you want to reach a certain spot. You have to pick an ball of a matching colour out of the bowl. If you push any other ball out or topple the stick stuck into the bowl, you get penalised. 
The beauty of this mechanic in a way is that it gives advantage to kids as they have smaller, nimbler fingers and thus they can beat their parents. 

Additional idea - Egypt - now it's also about grabbing scarab token. The board is in two parts and if penalised you're sent just to the start fo the half you're in. The big idea is the mummy in the second part - certain actions move it, so it can be manipulated and whenever it catches a player that player pays with scarab token. Or else. 

However - the additional complications I'm not sure are worth the bother. I mean they turn the game into more of an adventure type game, but increase the rules complexity. Furthermore I'm not sure the mummy lives up to its promise - namely of tension. At a certain level the mummy moves through the player tokens, turns around, and seem to be to far back to catch anybody and scare them. Maybe an a group which would aggressively push for mummy movements could get something more out of it, but I'm not that convinced. 

So this is Gulo Gulo - bigger, longer, more complicated and I dunno. It's more of an adventure game anyhow, but neither the skill nor the ride seem that much special (as bgg fae would suggest). Probably best with smaller kids.

I currently own this game.

I'm inconsistent, but I try to grade games based on how they are for their intended audience.  In this case, this is a game that reimplements an earlier game, but changes things entirely to create a whole new experience.  And because the original is OOP and expensive, I'm going to rate this game not just on what it itself is, but on what it did to the original design.

The original Gulo Gulo, according to many BGG users, could be played down to age 3.  It wasn't just the simple rules, it was also the theme which could be easily understood by a small child.

This current version is rated but he publisher for 7 and up and by BGG users for 6 and up.  They made the game a little more complicated, but you can still play the game with younger kids.  The problem is the theme.  What does a 3 year old understand or know about mummies?  They don't.  And this game would only create needless worries at such a young age.  

The problem is that there are a ton of games parents can play with 7 year olds that are still interesting for adults.  For under 7, not so much.  And just about zero for 3 to 4 years old.  The original Gulo Gulo was the exception.  So Haba took a game that was exceptional and rare and joined in with a crowd of other games.  

Which brings me to another problem based on what it's trying to be - a game for 7 year olds.  If they wanted a game for 7 year olds this theme should have been about dinosaur eggs.  Kids love dinosaurs.  Mummies?  That's something for adults.  So at age 7 I don't even think the current design shines that much at all.  It's middle of the road for its intended audience.  It's certainly not the tip of the top of its genre like the original was.

So between what the game is - acceptable, but no outstanding for 6-7 year olds - and what it did to the original - taking it from 3 to 6 years old because of theme - I think it deserves a 1.  Yes, this is protest rating in some ways.  But the reality is that I do have better games for 7 year olds that are still interesting for adults.  And I have almost nothing that's interesting for 3-4 year olds which is what the original game did, but this one does not.

If Haba wanted a great theme for 7 year olds the game should have been about dinosaurs.  With mummies it's clear they were trying to appeal to adults and in the process ruined the whole thing.

Edit: A better mummy game for 7 year olds: Pyramid/Fluch der Mumie

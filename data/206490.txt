GAME: An Infamous Traffic
RANK: 2825
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
From the 3, 4, and 5p games I've played; Getting revenue can be moderately cumbersome to downright impossible at times, but spending/losing it is super easy. There lays the crux of the problem I think we have with the game; for a rating that is so critical to accomplishing something, it's almost impossible to acquire more of it in any serious fashion. It's not an issue of engine building (thankfully there is zero engine here), it's just part of the design. Having leaders be invincible to being undercut seems mildly intuitive from a game history perspective, but un-intuitive from a game balance facet (in that they sort of run away with the designation unless you invest a ton into maxing out that competition). The rules aren't long, but the rulebook still needs work in terms of clarifications, typos, examples, etc. A few terms are either not defined at all (but one can insinuate the answer if you read between the lines) or are only defined on the map and not in the rulebook itself. 

Component wise, the game is mixed; the counters are some of the best counters I've ever seen in a boardgame; thick, shiny, and almost a laminated plastic coating. The map as a paper map doesn't bother me, but that they split it with only a tiny overlap and it runs through one of the player aid sections is a peeve as I want to spend more time than I should getting it lined up under the plexiglass... I wish the map had been done on a plotter and just folded instead of being split. The PnP edition is a *deal* if you don't mind doing your own counters on something lesser than the Blue Panther counters.

Thematically, the quirk is not lost on me that when religious people come to town, it makes people want to take (more) drugs. I thought the inner harbor (and open port merging the two) was a nice touch given what that represents in this model. Same thing with ports never closing (think Hong Kong Island and other concessions). Mechanically, preliminary results to me feel like a cross between a more delicate shared incentive management similar to Container's initial starting machinations of produce/warehouse/ship binding, and (in the instance of AIT; more pressing) objective/scoring balancing act of The King is Dead's different end game scoring setups. The later in particular because the conspiracies, prizes, and dice pool are random environmental effects and compensating for that requires players to be nimble in what (and when) they commit to a desired objective. If players commit to either avoiding/causing revolution too early, its even more obvious (and difficult to recover from) than it is in TKiD.

You *must* play quickly. The game nosedives if it overstays it's welcome. Second, it's reminiscent of Food Chain Magnate or Terra Mystica in that one bad choice sort of sets up someone else and it's difficult (to put it mildly) to come back.

edit: I have one more 3p game in me (the best count I've seen so far), but this is ultimately a pass; there are other shared incentive games which work better for our group (a group which loves the Pax series, TKiD, and Container, hence our original optimism). As someone else said "it's a neat game which is an econ game with wargame sensibilities." I agree, it's a work of art in terms of subject matter and option to study, but we're not seeing the emergent alliances; they are too thin to be the focus of player's actions. Why build an empire (even if that's what's rewarded) when it's easier to destroy your's? The common complaint is that there just isn't enough here in terms of a game to warrant the time or effort. The use of revenue forecast in lieu of straight cash is a linchpin to both the design and my beef with it. It's simultaneously innovative and infuriating as it kills most of the reason for doing a ton of what you can; go ahead, have the country degenerate into war, it won't matter since you can't afford investments to win that way anyway. I don't know if it's our group being especially mean with blocking or what, but having revenue go up to 18 is absurd. Most I've ever seen it hit for anyone was 6 and that was extremely short-lived, didn't make it back around to utilize it. It's a lot of dickering around (hence why I advocate you play fast) and having revenue sit at 0, 1, or negative numbers. Our games just don't seem to go anywhere cause we blow up any successful chain we aren't involved in.

We see moments of brilliance, but not enough of them to invest much more in the design. As others have said, niche appeal and requires a group who is less invested and/or interested in dragging others down.

Very very interesting, needs more plays for sure but excited for them to happen. Felt tight at three, I can imagine at 5 it's well beyond a knife fight in a phone booth. Only concern is that it looks very hard to be able to come back late, although the tension between a revolution happening or not could keep this on a razor edge the whole game, though you are somewhat at the mercy of random chit draws for that to happen. Lots of interaction, lots of potential for deal breaking and screwage, but this can definitely get played quick as well when everyone knows the system. Very cool.

The game checks off a lot of my boxes for things I look for: the rules are not excessive; the mechanisms don't feel as if they were put there for the sake of complexity; every decision is meaningful; no two plays will be alike; it's tied to a moment and place in history yet it does not shy away from making a pointed statement about its horrible nature; it marries politics and economics. Best of all, it is immensely satisfying to pull off a win.

I really enjoyed this, even though we got a couple rules slightly wrong. The game isn't complicated - it's actually fairly straightforward, simpler than a high-end euro these days - but it's just delicate enough that it's important to get everything right and the rules are OK but not great and so maybe not helping we much as they should. Anyway, if you like the Sierra Madge Games aesthetic of Pax Pamir, Pax Porfiriana, or High Frontier, absolutely check this out - it's got a similar feel at a much lower complexity level, much better playability, and a brisk pace and short playing time. This is the kind of game we really need more of IMO. Maybe not on drug trafficking specifically, but this kind of elegant, playable, but historically interesting and faithful game design. Ken Hite says, and I agree, that the most interesting subjects for games are in the real world; anything you make up is almost certainly going to be far less interesting than real history. The endless streams of euros either set in generic fantasy worlds, or which pay nothing but lip service to their settings, are getting tiresome.

RATING: 6
A bit dense to get into at first, but once you play through the first round, you'll see how everything works and comes together. So, don't worry if you feel like you have no idea what the heck is going on when you start playing; it'll be clear soon enough.

The game has a lot of neat stuff going on, as you need to work together with the other players in some areas, while simultaneously cutting their throats in others. There's a lot of ebb and flow to the game, as situations will rarely stay static. There's always maneuvering and posturing going on.

So that part is fun, but the game is rather rules-y, and there were many things to remember to do in various situations that weren't very obvious. And, if you forget to do one of these things that are very easy to forget, it can really ruin the game. We caught ourselves on the verge of breaking the game by mistake several times. I'm sure it would all become second nature with repeat play, but I'm not a person that returns to any game very frequently unless I loved it, and I wasn't super in love with this one. So, it's probably just a game that I won't really return to, as the lack of rules smoothness and intuitiveness is a detractor for me.

If you like a game with lots of tense decisions, and are also the type of person that will put a game on repeat to where the rules can be second nature to you, there's likely something rewarding here. I'm just not that person myself, even though I still thought it was somewhat enjoyable..

I do NOT like the scoring system. Or the beat you while you're down and kingmaking mechanics. All players need to be equally skilled in order for this game to be balanced. Wasn't impressed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very tentative rating of 8 after one play with four. I liked the coarse scoring - only a max 17 VPs to be divvied up in a 4 player game with 11 or 13 being more likely. 

The opportunities to be destructive are abundant. Being constructive is much harder since it requires tacit agreements in a pretty volatile game space. But that is what makes it interesting.

The economy is interesting in that opprtunity decays rapidly with undercutting of prices. This puts a premium on timing big VP grabs. But those grabs can hobble your game since, to them stick you often need to throttle your income. 

As for the binding of theme and gameplay, Cole does it again. Being a bureaucrat myself, I love their role in this one - and how they can get wiped out, ruining whole supply chains. 

There are some rough edges, but I feel like repeat plays will determine whether they add or detract from the design.

RATING: 9
Highly confrontational planning/sequencing game, with a unique historical theme,. The game is as unforgiving as any Splotter, Winsome or 18xx, and it requires a solid bunch of gamers to shine. People complain that it suffers from runaway leader syndrom and kingmaking, which is true, but the game requires constant self-balancing and emergent alliances against the leader. It is amazing how short these alliances can be, but also a wonder of design. 

Given the right crowd, the game is highly tense, very tight, and full of agonizing decisions all the way. The rules are a bit of a mess, given how short they are, but nothing insurmountable. The components are functional, the countersheet is high quality and very thick, although in my copy the hidden VP chits were not well cut,  which this affects gameplay if one cares to remember them. 

Short, razor-edge balanced, quite fragile, and unique in its design. Together with Pax Pamir, it has solidified Cole Wehrle as a designer to watch. Play without negotiations for full effect. Bonus point for the wonderful, and quite cynical, history lesson, I just wish Cole shared more of his historical notes. Worthwhile seeking it out.

Only a five player solo game to date, but I like it. It's mean and delicate, and the prizes can be a bit swingy. But it's short enough to keep any of those things from ruining it all. 

Probably gonna be solo-bait. Not a lotta peeps are gonna join me on this.

Nov 2017 - played my third solo session. Three players allows for more planning, and I was surprised that all three players didn't end up with Leader Counters. Completed a few internal chains this game with the help of special envoys and smugglers, but 3 of 3 games now without wars. So, no open ports (except for the Open Port in Area A mandated in the five player game setup).

RATING: 9.5
Brutal economic game where anything and everything can, and most likely will go wrong. Some games will promptly end in a revolution, while some will never give you a good opportunity to break into mainland China. There's always a chance that you will have absolutely terrible luck and will need to rely on special envoys to get anything done. You need to decide whether you want to be an asshole to others by destroying fragile supply chains, or reluctantly allow their enterprises to flourish so you can expand elsewhere with merchants. This is not an engine-builder, it is an engine-annihilator. An Infamous Traffic is akin to wanting to maintain a BDSM relationship, and should be absolutely avoided by anyone who cannot handle "mean" games. For everyone else who doesn't live in that delusional bubble, it is absolutely brilliant.

Sadly, I've yet to play a 4P game of this. I imagine that's where the game really shines. 2P games should only be used to teach people how to play the game. My only complaint is the fact that the game came with two paper maps for the board instead of one. I'll be purchasing the single-map upgrade when available and looking to see if I can mount the original maps on a board.

Cole Wehrle has a beautiful mind. This an incredibly rich interdependent game. Further, not only is the game is aesthetically pleasing and highly functional, it also  offers a rich pedagogical pivot that differentially connects players to the project of Imperialism without being prescriptive (i.e., in order for players to explore the inter-relation between Britain and China during that particular historical period). The fact that the game allows for histories that were but possible possibilities to unfold really make this a rich text.

Not impressed.  The fact that the values of the point tokens you are competing for each round are unknown (face-down) is an awful idea.  You can have a great round, but get zero or -1 points as a reward because the tokens are garbage.  Overall, very brutal with opportunities for king-making.  At least the game isn't very long.

There is no coming back if you make a missatake in the first round. The game is about 3 hours on 5 players and a early misstake could let you get about 5 min of "your turn" per hour.

RATING: 8
Cole has made another great game. 
2p= Useful Learning Games
3p= Better than 3p but someone's likely (as in many 3p games) to have  a bad time. With that said the more intricate interplays of the game balance come into view if not exactly focus at this player count.
4-5p= The Sweet Spot. Tough decisions, plenty of opportunities for gamesmanship (aka screw your buddy) and the opportunity to form alliances of convenience allow this game to shine at 4+p

The random Victory point factor (mitigated by the ability to check (rumors) gives a sense of flippancy not usually welcome in a meatier game but the shorter playing time combined with the opportunity for deep strategy make this a win.

The component quality could have been better but the map is functional, as are the counters. If you enjoy this game you'll want to upgrade it with some PnP bells 'n whistles. Having said that - It is a huge coup to have made a game of some depth that accurately models both the morals, logistical supply chain and colonial reality into a cohesive gaming experience that is not only fun (your definition may differ) to play but eerily and almost uncomfortable historically accurate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
preliminary thoughts...

Interdependent to the point of near total lack of control. Very opportunistic with lots of incentive manipulation, emerging alliances, and just downright nasty play. Revenue can and will very likely fluctuate wildly, impacting your investment (action) capabilities from round to round. Overall the game feels quite thematic and mechanically representational, particularly in the conspiracies. 

I really liked how balanced the game felt beteeen its endings and methods of generating victory points. Underselling for instance robs revenue but can create industry leaders which give VPs. Getting out of the turn early and bidding high for prizes is a VP crap shoot and leaves you vulnerable to the actions of others including a potential revolution push. In the end I felt nearly every decision mattered and was likewise opaque in its ramifications.

Update:

Is the game too interdependent, opaque, and dare I say obtuse? I LOVE me some fragile designs. And opaqueness? You bet. But the combo here plus the unique ruleset has made learning, teaching, and retaining very difficult. I’ve only gotten it to the table once in over a year and my group was split between liking, mehing, to outright annoyance. I’m not sure if I can rationalize holding onto this.

Arguably the most interesting game I’ve ever had to let go.

A completely different take on economic games, An Infamous Traffic represents logistics through positioning and tactics. I think it's weight might make it challenging to recruit players, but the shorter playing time (for a heavier game) helps balance the scales. My first play ended very quickly due to a rules error on my part which brought a very early opium war and a lot of stranded demand dice. From a conceptual perspective, I love that the players can impact the game like that, hastening the endgame to capitalize on position, but it was a bit unsatisfying to have a shorter game given the difficulty of getting players. I might be able to recruit some more from my regular game group.

One play (Dana's copy), and it was sufficiently rough that I'm not sure it's going to hit the table again.

Part of this was the Conspiracy draws; the player who passed first in turn 1 blew his revenue down to -4 to try to snag the 3 prize he'd seen--he was about to be knocked down to -1 anyway, so why not--but no police showed up at the start of turn 2, so everyone else's supply chains were safe, and his game was over.

Part of this was the prize draws; with 4 players, the last turn's draws are known, so we all knew they were a 1, 0, and -1, making the last turn more busy-work than fun.

Even without those factors, though, the game seems to have some rules which are bogo-thematic, un-fun, or both:
- Industry leaders can't be undersold; why?  (I saw the historical note about economies of scale, but having a fleet 25% larger than yours means I can command 3x the prices??)  In our 4-player game, we had one Opium leader, one Fleet leader, one Merchant leader, and one [i]victim,[/i] and I don't see how it would play out differently: the victim can never place his enterprises higher than the minimum, and so will [i]always be[/i] the victim.  Without this rule, industry leaders would have to compete on price just like the one loser who diversified.
- You can't move units from incomplete chains; why?  Your dudes are going to sit there, not making money, for [i]another[/i] 10 years?  Is that really how businesses operated in this period?
- Maximum scion value is 7; why?  Knowing you can blow out as soon as you can get to the magic 7 seems gamey.  (In the example of play, upon seeing a -1 prize, the player thinks, "I'm going to watch how so-and-so plays," but... why?  Your first indication that they saw a 3 is when they lock it down with a 7 scion; at that point it's too late to do anything about it.)  It just feels like a limit artificially imposed by... not wanting to provide a second counter, or a scion track on the board?
- What the heck is the basic structure of the Conspiracy draw supposed to represent?  "Well, we can see that there won't be an opium war in the next 10 years...  we see that there's one band of smugglers not-exactly-for-hire, because they're free unless someone has passed, and one of us gets to decide where they operate," etc.; I'm not saying that aspect isn't [i]fun,[/i] but it feels surprisingly gamey for a game which one review describes as having "incredibly thematic" mechanisms.

(I'm wondering if 4 is not a good player count; because of the industry leader rules, it's probably better with 3 or 5.)

Also, the basic turn structure, combined with not being allowed to move units, seems to lend itself to... unproductive play: "I need this smuggler at this port so that I can place my ship there and make money... but if I place the smuggler there, [i]you'll[/i] put your ship there and make money instead of me... and if I put my ship there before the smuggler, you'll put the smugger at a [i]different[/i] port, and then put your ship there and make money... I can't have that, so I guess I'll put the smuggler off in the hills so that [i]no one[/i] makes money."

Also, regarding component quality--as a paper-map wargamer with half-a-dozen differently sized sheets of plexiglas, I'm telling you, the Hollandspiele components are [i]bad[/i] even by my standards.  (Side nubs: :angry:!)  The paper map is two sheets: not one sheet cut in two, two sheets with mismatched cuts, leaving a gap in the middle of half the map.  The counters were mis-cut (making the prize counters identifiable), and the replacement counters were differently mis-cut; from the two sheets + a red sharpie we cobbled together one usable set.  Both sheets were hard to read because they were blurry.  My usual disdain for component quality presumes that the components are at least [i]functional.[/i]

Anyway, I hope this game gets another shot, because the first game is really [i]really[/i] a learning game.  I doubt it, though; we have a lot of games, and two of the four players (including the winner & owner) did not have much fun.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is a fascinating game with quite a few opportunities to mess with your fellow players and seek to form partnerships as well in forming trade chains. I do wish the board was mounted but understand why it wasn't. In our first play, we made several mistakes and the first couple rounds were mostly bumbling around trying to get a handle on how the game mechanics interact with each other. This is not a nice game! Two different winning conditions insure opponents must balance game play to maintain the direction they want the victory condition to move towards and the different types of conspiracy chits really affect the game heavily as they will make each game quite different depending on how they come out. There's a lot to think about here.

This is one weird game. I think it is really well designed and super tight. But it is a hard one for new players to pick up. I really wanted to love it and it SHOULD be exactly the kind of game that I and my group are normally in to. As it is, I'm not sure how to feel about it. First time players find the game very opaque. In the end they think it's "neat" but I think it takes too long for the fun of it to emerge.

Some comments about this in the Advance After Combat guild led me to the online rules.  Reading the rules revealed an economic game which looked intriguing (and out of my comfort zone).

And indeed this thing is intriguing:  it is mechanically reasonably straight forward (but let's not get carried away and call it simple).  But it is full of subtle interactions which I can see are there, without pretending to really comprehend them properly, much less be able to take advantage of them.

This might end up being too much of a good thing:  great for gamers moving up the decision making complexity tree from more straight forward Euros, but perhaps too much by way of subtlety for we wargamers, whose natural inclinations to solve every problem with more might be out of place here - where sometimes the answer is going to be less.

Will I end up respecting it more than loving it?  Too early to say.

A very interesting, but strange, game. What to do is quite opaque and even though you're limited to one action per turn, that one action is can greatly affect other people (and this is definitely not a game to play if you have qualms about wrecking people stuff, because you'll be doing that all game). It felt a like it *should* be a long-term strategic game, but it ends up being very tactical, and for my tastes, perhaps a little too much so for a game in which your income can be destroyed so easily. Glad to have tried it, would play again, but wasn't grabbed.

The theme is really great, and it prompts me to look more into the events of the era.  The artwork is evocative, and the gameplay has a lot of interesting features.  The building and maintaining of chains of production and the threat of being undercut reqlly is delicious.  I am not sure three is best, as it pretty much dictates each player become leader of one of the three categories.  With more, there will be more undercutting and constant need to watch over your shoulder.  The dice mechanism to dictate placement is a good one.  The one problem we ran into was the runaway leader.  Once he had a lead, there was little to do to reign him in.  He always got first choice on the victory points because they were always farther up the income track.  Almost impossible to undercut because with the extra actions could always acquire the extra unit leadership so thy could not lost the majority.  We had a few ideas how to improve the situation, and perhaps it is not as bad with more than three, but this may be a bit of a stumbling block for the game.  Still, I would not mind a copy for myself, maybe even to fiddle with.

I love the loose connection between the opium game and the london season game. How the demand system interacts with the placement restrictions leads to more tactical depth than there appears on the surface. I think with 5 it's a little too weird though, and with 3 it's easy for one player to get a lock on a leadership. At least, I haven't figured out an effective way to counter it.

Needs good players or the game gets silly. Players need to be able to think ahead a couple moves or the state just whips back and forth.

Tentative rating based on first couple of games. AIT is a doozy. The long term game state is so far difficult to parse and this makes the decisions opaque and hard. Really looking forward into delving further.

The more I play, the more I like it. I think four players is my favorite count and it really does demand good players who are trying to win.

Early impression after 3 plays:

Perhaps the most unique and interesting new game I've played in 2016, An Infamous Traffic is an economic game with war game sensibilities. It's a subtle game which drives players up against each other in interesting ways, including emergent alliances and cutthroat conflict. The game emphatically will not hold your hand; it's quite possible to find yourself out of the running with little to no chance to work your way back into the game. If you appreciate out-of-the ordinary game experiences and tactical play with shifting game states, you must try this.

Hopefully will have more to say after further plays.

Somewhat bizarre. First two-player game left me mostly puzzled. Second game with three players was more interesting. This isn't a game to be taken too seriously: the scoring seems fairly random and then revolution may come and ruin everything. But as an experience, this is splendid. A bit like a mixture of Food Chain Magnate and Greed, Incorporated in many ways.

Suggest.

Interesting game... it has some intricacies that you don't grasp at first and only while you are playing you understand how it works and how it can screw you or the others!

Very nasty game!!! :p

EDIT:
Improved rating after the second play... once you grasp the small points of the game it becomes more interesting

Economic strategy game - Opium trade in 19th century China

The design was inspired by Northern Pacific, Brass, Container, Locomotive Werks, and Greed Incorporated. [url=https://hollandspiele.com/blogs/hollandazed-thoughts-ideas-and-miscellany/an-infamous-traffic-development-by-cole-wehrle]Designer's blog on development[/url].

Note: The pdf is supposedly for US letter, not A4, but supposedly this is not a problem when printing everything at 95%, so it is scaled down slightly, and it is also possible to ask the publisher for the map file. (The other possibility is to simply purchase US letter paper via Amazon, if your printer can handle it.)

It would be great if the publisher provided some instructions/advice for assembling the PNP version.

Description from the publisher:
[i]
It’s 1833. The East India Company has just had its monopoly of trade revoked by an official act of Parliament. You, and others like you, see a golden opportunity for profit in China. For too long the Company’s polite deference to the Qing has smothered progress and stifled trade. There is real money to be made here and you intend to make it.

An Infamous Traffic is a brutal economic board game for two to five souls brave enough to conduct the opium trade in the fracturing political landscape of 19th century Qing China. Initially, you will need to rely on smugglers in order to get your products into the interior, but, if Parliament can be swayed, perhaps an open war can make the trade more secure. At the same time, you’ll want to be careful. If British aggression goes unchecked, the region may become a failed state, which could jeopardize your hard fought gains.

Of course, the massive wealth you’ll earn won’t be enough. Trade is still a dirty word among those in the top rungs of society. You certainly haven't forgotten how your business holdings were sneered at by some prodigal baronet during your brief stint at Oxford. They don’t understand. The empire they enjoy was built on trade, not pedigree. So, you’ll play their game, snatching up the precious symbols of nobility with your hard won cash. Perhaps you can restore a beloved castle and stuff it full of the latest luxuries. The right marriage or government post would certainly guarantee your place in society. You might even be tempted to rob your own firm to get that extra edge back home.

In any case, there’s demand for opium in China, and you intend to meet it.[/i]

Very different game to most. Rule book is very challenging to read and ingest. Excellent gameplay though, with several different approaches possible and an alternate win condition, which is excellent if you get squeezed out if contention for the main prize.

RATING: 5.5
I'm glad I tried this (twice), but I would never suggest it and am happy not owning a copy. I would play it again, if someone keenly suggested it. 

After the first round, everything clicks and makes sense. It's nice to have a heavier game that's quick to play. But, it has serious kingmaking problems. The winner, for both possible end conditions, will be pretty clear by the start or partway into the final round. And while it have variation from one play of the game to the next, the replay value isn't high. I can see this starting to feel very samey after even just a handful of plays.

It's too bad Cole Wehrle adopted Phil Eklund's style/approach to rulebook design, layout, and writing. This, more than the nature of the gameplay itself, makes learning to play difficult.

Also, production quality is low given the price tag. That said, it is a smaller boutique publisher..

Wow! Simple, deep, highly thematic and deadly. What more can one ask?

RATING: 6
The rules explanation is initially like a brick wall... but like Pax Pamir before it, once things start clicking into place you realize that it's actually fairly simple at it's core.   The complexity really just comes from a myriad of inelegant contingencies on when you can or can't perform certain actions.
Once you *get* it, play is fairly fluid!   I like the balancing act between managing your finances, while looking for a clear moment send your Scion home with what money you've earned.

That said, I have two MAJOR complaints:  First, victory points in this game are a massive struggle to achieve, but are random.   You might set yourself way back financially on a massive bid for VP only to end up with surprise NEGATIVE points, while a friend spends almost nothing and gains 3.  (That's a huge bump here.)
Second; in a game that's centered around managing finances and struggling to create profit, there is no penalty for going bankrupt.   In fact, it's actively beneficial to just spend every last dollar you have each turn just as a method to prevent other players from meddling with you.

RATING: 3
This is a fascinating combination of novel mechanics ruined by a convoluted scattered rulebook and high degree of directed spite in an opaque environment.  I suspect there is a deep and subtle game going on here, if only it were explained clearly and not obfuscated by complexity & randomness.  That is to say, this is a euro game designed like a wargame.

The game boils down to earning revenue to bid on VP, but you don't know what you're bidding on and it might be negative.  There is a huge amount of take-that spite, but not enough info about who is winning, too much complexity veiling who is winning, and too much randomness to predict who is winning.

But the biggest issue is the rulebook.  The revised rulebook seems to be complete and not too long.  But it is very fragmented.  It takes multiple passes of the rulebook to answer simple questions, and there are lots of little fiddly rules to remember and constantly be looking up.

I'm not convinced the game works at all 2 player.  It's too zero sum and progress is nearly impossible, and then only by luck.  It surely works better with more players, but I worry it will still boil down to "hope the other players don't mistake me for the winner and spite me".

Even if I'm wrong about all of that, you do so little on each turn and so much can change change between your turns that the game is an AP-crawl to play even by quick players.

Your first game will be very wobbly. It is hard to lift your head from the wheels within wheels of intrigue and conspiracy. The ultimate goal is fancy hats, and revenue is the most direct route to that goal, but your levers to affect the game have difficult to predict consequences. The limited information about prizes leaves players in a bit of a fog, where coming in next to last can be worse than coming in last. In any case it was fun if a little brain-burny (not for the math, but for peering through the crystal ball). Cole is an exciting designer that has yet to be served well by a good rules writer.

This took time to wrap my head around and I was really on the fence about keeping it but it's a game that I always get a smile on my face when people bring it up in conversation.

I'm only one solo-ed three player game in and I'm replacing the thin cardstock chits I made with thicker illo-board-backed chits... I want to play more of this, and definitely want to get it to the table with the game group.  Intriguing design and fascinating extension of Cole Wehrle's game exploration of British colonialism.

Edit: one multi-player game... I'm still a big fan, others want to wait for John Company.

RATING: 7
Weird economic game based on completing opium supply chains into late Qing dynasty China (opium source, ship, smuggler, seller on the ground). It's a dirty, cut-throat business, and a player can be knocked out of an existing chain if, say, their opium source is undercut on price. Or perhaps a police action -- a tip whispered in the right ear -- will arrest their smuggler and disrupt the chain entirely.

When a player passes they can build their legacy by sending a scion home to London (earning victory points), but if the game ends in revolution then victory points are worthless.

The general idea is to build revenue in order to get the best London prizes, but players individually have very little control; the favourable label is "incentive management", but it is unusually swingy. Availability of police actions very much changes the calculus around setting up a supply line and when to pass; there is no point gaining 6 revenue if the next player will dispose of it before you get the chance to use it. There are lot of delightfully nasty tricks to play to disrupt or obstruct the enemy, with the most brutal literally involving all out war and opening of ports by force.

First impressions are that I'm not sure what I think. In theory I like opaque games, but I'm not sure that this one will work without significant repeat play with the same group; it seems like it is probably fragile in the face of groupthink and mixed experience. Like Pax Porfiriana etc., I suspect that the random elements may lead to wildly diverse games -- with pathological extremes that can make any individual game a frustrating exercise.

The historical chrome adds glorious thematic flavour but also some complexity. It's already not particularly intuitive.

Around five games in we finally had one that really, really [i]worked[/i], 10/10 fantastic. Every dirty trick in the book to block expansion, placement and generally ruin plans, leading up to a final turn where the starting player's best move might have been to immediately pass -- his choice resulted instead in inevitable rebellion and loss. If only every game could be this way.

RATING: 5
Rules are shorter than I imagined, and include clarification updates since the initial release, but a few obtuse (and important) things are still unclear, e.g., better definitions and emphasis are needed.

Ingenious design with a fascinating series of interlocking mechanics, this is not a 'nice' game at all. The Dice Pool mechanic is interesting. Dealing with the randomness of Opportunity (matching dice, Pool/Region) can also be challenging (Special Envoys can mitigate Opportunity).

Different victory conditions (depending on the board state) are most welcome as players drive towards their goal. But make a mistake on the first turn, and you could be out of the game (just brutal, quite unforgiving). Runaway leader, no catch-up mechanic? Hard to say definitively after just one play, but yes a concern that this one is just too fragile.

Graphics are average at best, not too appealing to the euro players in my group, but thankfully gameplay is valued more than bits (they liked the game more than I did).

Going to need more plays, I'm not sure if initial rating will go up or down -  just don't know what to make of this fragile design. However, I do admit to being intrigued (great theme).

[update: my interest in this is fading, I'd much rather play John Company (same designer)]

RATING: 5
This is a very strange game, I'm at a loss for what to think about it. Flow of play is so herky-jerky, it's almost non-existent. The cadence is... sit and think for a while. Then take your action, which takes three seconds or less. And so on and so on.

For a game of its type, it has to be among the clunkiest games I've ever played. The rules need to be checked and re-checked after almost every turn simply because there are so many details, exceptions, and restrictions.

The decisions are interesting. Warrants more plays to get past the stickiness of the thing, but unless you have a group breaking this out on a regular basis, the game will never play smoothly.

Note: I want to play this but don't have the environment. The need to negotiate - talk - breaks the silent wall that has been such a part of the strategic gaming zeitgeist that it's transgressive. In next plays we need to talk more. For me, that wall is generally there for a reason, one can play so many games of Diplomacy & such and the betrayal/bullshit grid becomes tiresome. But this one is different. The one to open that up again?

Also, I find the player-driven co-op vs destructive competition it allows a fascinating set of questions. I love Wallace & Herman's (think Emerald & Churchill) successful games along these lines, but An Infamous Traffic doesn't manage that for you. On the table, it reads as a more cutthroat Brass-like game, and in our 1 learning play the jockeying leaned toward the destructive mode and it formed a runaway win. I'd really like to play a run of games to see if we can learn to see the these subtleties, it strikes me as a great cultural comment that current (interactive) Euros are sharpening our teeth and conditioning an instinctual viciousness. And it would be true to the subject of British imperialism in the East if we could learn to disguise our greed a bit better. :)

First play thoughts....

This is where Euro gaming needs to be going to fulfill its own ambitions in terms of form and substance. Cole is a burning bush over there in Texas. Lordy.

It's random elements have the variety to set up all sorts of situations to untangle, and these are the sorts of twists that require emergent alliances that come & go like sudden squalls. 

The game opens by throwing you into the action (I love this immediacy) & wrong moves or a false idea will pull you down with an undertow that's quite brutal & uncaring. The cross incentives are drawn so damn sharp; mind you, my first game & I can't wait for the next play & hope for the in-game awareness it will pull from you if you want to fly. 

It's a player-driven Chinese finger-trap; you must work together to frame the economy but oh the paranoia...  making a situational proffer is risky yet necessary, one who is destructive for its own sake can pull you down without any strategic payoff for either of you, and parsing this sort of thing is not something many Euro's prepare you for. So all in all you're up for a dicier conditioning process in An Infamous Traffic than, for example, Brass. 

There's dice too, so its dicier than Brass in that way as well. I love how they're used, and along with the incomplete information of the prizes that are split between players, it's got lovely contingencies that will subvert those who must have total control to feel a win is properly 'earned.' So... a bit of a mind-fuck & a nice dose of the real world to match the real subject; and here another theme that suits its commentary, which is to give you a gut check on your comfort level with trusting & then relishing that you'll survive (or even win) certain moments well even if you can't wholly control them. None of this undercuts strategy or tactical decisions. There's an interesting line drawn there in this design, and even confronting that realization (one way or the other) is a good reason to play it. So be careful grasshopper. Self-knowledge can hurt.

The whole tension in how & when to collaborate vs being destructive is recalibrated every move because the differing end game conditions destabilize things and riffle shuffle the incentives just when you thought you'd tied all that down.

The subject & themes, well, it's an amazing cluster & even if you don't play the game go read the designer notes & try to listen to Cole talk about it on a podcast, because if you can't get the right environment to play it sometimes its important just to know projects like this even exist. 

The map & bits design is a wonder of form + function. Beautifully spare, the intensity of what's going is coherent and that's remarkable. I'd love a focused run with the same table & have a chance it could happen.

By the way, I got my ass kicked

The design is easy to teach new players and has quite a bit of depth. The artwork is well done, but the production quality left a bit to be desired. Player aids needed to be recut, The two-piece paper map needs to be overlapped just so prior to play. Very nice thick counters, but for the price, I'd recommend  players pick up the wargame vault version and create their own mounted map, player aids and counters.

Make sure to read the living rules!!

Almost comically fragile- there will likely be runaway winners and losers until everyone gets a few plays under their belt. But that's OK, I like games that are opaque, and the decision angst in this game is really good. Bravo to a unique, interesting and entertaining design.

Slim and lethal like a stiletto, "An Infamous Traffic" is a medium lenght game which is extremely deep and complex (maybe even too much) to wrap your head around. It reminds me of some earlier Wallace designs where the simple mechanics hid layers of possible pitfalls for the unwary players.

This has become a favorite game of mine. It has a strong "take that" component to it and it never seems to play out the same way twice. I hear a lot of people say it is an opaque game(ie you do things and are not sure why you are doing them). I honestly do not get that evaluation of the game. Having investment and placement as separate actions, I feel, makes your moves and opponents moves seem telegraphed and easily responded too. As such anything you build in the game tends to be torn down by opponents quickly. This is certainly not a game for everybody, proponents of engine builders should stay away. Bonus points for the historical theme. It plays fairly quickly. Not quite a filler, but maybe more of a nightcap.

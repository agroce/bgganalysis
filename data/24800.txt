RATING: 9
Based on 2 plays of Firefight One.
This is an awesome game and astonishingly easy to learn.
The two of us had not played it before and we managed to learn it in an evening and play the first scenario twice.
Looking forward to Firefight Two, but can already see the very clever way that the game elements are slowly added.
Fantastic!  If only more wargames were structured like this (and if you know another one that is, please geekmail me!)

Update: Played Firefight 2, a definate step up in complexity.  Loved it.

What an amazing game.  Brought it home last Friday, already completed six games.  Every game was decided on the last turn.  I am still a fan of ASL, but COH will be played often.  Taught my son, who was home on leave from the Navy, how to play the game in ten minutes.  He beat me on the second game with excellent support by fire, bounding-over-watch tactics.  This game will do for wargaming what SL did back in the 80s.  Can't wait for the next game in the series.  First game I ever rated  a 10.

Seguramente está todo dicho de este juego, pero para mí ha sido un descubrimiento reciente y no puedo dejar de señalar que CoH ha demostrado de modo sobresaliente que no estaba todo dicho en materia de juegos tácticos. CoH ha dejado claro que no hay un único modo de recrear los combates tácticos a escala de escuadra, y que el camino del detalle a ultranza (seguido por ASL) es simplemente una visión del campo de batalla táctico, pero ni es la única visión ni tiene por qué ser la mejor. CoH se centra en el Command & Control, reflejando las habilidades de las distintas tropas mediante el sistema de puntos de acción –que reproduce la actuación individual de las tropas- y puntos de acción de mando –según la mejor o peor calidad de mando-, puntos que se consumen con distinto coste para las diferentes unidades cuando ejecutan la misma acción, reflejando las distintas doctrinas tácticas de los ejércitos. Y todo ello mediante un turno de juego enormemente interactivo y unos escenarios rápidos de jugar e interesantes. El juego no abruma en detalles, pero ello no significa que sea tosco, al contrario, resulta ágil e intenso. El éxito del juego está más que justificado

RATING: 10
An Excellent Squad based Tactical wargame. This being the first in the series and I already can't wait for the next. 

    You know that this game will be a hit with your wargaming geek friends just by feeling the quality of the box even before you open it. Anything with this kind of quality has to be someones work of love and passion to say the least.

   Inside you will find high quality larger then normal components. Great for younger smaller hands as well as for older folks like me who have a hard time reading the small print on other games components. The maps are a work of art, well constructed and have a nice bit of weight to them.
 
   The game is very easy to learn as the instructions are built in a modular fashion so you learn a few things, then you are told to play a Scenario, go back to the insturctions to learn a few more things and told when to play the next scenario. A very nice guided approach in my opnion,

   Instructions are very clear and consise with enough examples and pictures to get the exact points across.  

   Play is intense because of the action/reaction factor you are not just sitting around waiting for your opponent to complete his turn. 

   The Action Point/Command Acction Point system is Brilliant to say the least and makes it extreamly easy for any newcomer to Hex and Chit based Wargames to grasp in about 5 to 10 minutes time.  Expect a bit longer for some of the advanced concepts while teaching a newcomer.  

   This game also has outstanding replayability of scenarios I have never had any of the first few scenarios playout the same.
  
   I find that if you use the Optional rule to Roll for each units Action Point allotment upon activating of the unit adds a bit of uncertantiy to the game.

   If you are looking to get some of your non-wargaming friends hooked to this genre of games then run out and purchase this game.

Uwe --- Best of Luck to you with this Series. Personally I think you have a real smash hit and a winner here!

Military tactical board games with dices aren't my favorite category of games, however this one is the best from this kind. To win you need to thing, to use the strong points of your troops, to use the terrain in the best way. Rules are easy to show, the time of play is not very long. But still if you are unlucky, you will lose against equally experienced player because of dices... But overall I like it

The only wargame most of us will ever need.  Elegant rules system keeps the game moving and allows one to develop a sense of tactics without getting mired in boardgame minutiae.

Beautiful game.  Fun to play, but beset with problems.  The one I can't get past is the winning tactic of waiting for the other side to spend all it's units and CAPs, then walking up and killing his units at leisure.  Also, I like the unit pictures but why don't they face the right way?

This is about as solid of a squad level wargame as there is. Absolutely a wonderful game with great component quality. The rules of this game are what really makes it shine. A lot of effort was obviously put into avoiding all previous efforts at similar games and just coming up with a good rule system that makes sense. It really shows. This is the way a wargame should work. Gone are all the traditional wargame concepts that are only there because the designers were too lazy to come up with something better. You won't find movement phases, combat phases stacking limits and many other traditional wargame concepts. What has taken their place are concepts that really make sense and work perfectly. Probably the best value for dollar I've ever spent on a wargame.

I'm torned.... I think this game has a great potential but has not been designed at its best. Strategy and tactics are too easily vanished by dice rolling and the forces on the field are not well balanced (movement costs of soviet tanks are too high, you either move them or fire with them). However, I love pieces like the mortars and the variety of markers you can use (bunkers, smoke ecc). The quality of the material is very high and probably This game has the best counters I have ever seen: beautiful, easy to read and very eye-catchy. I have been wondering for a long time whether should I keep it or not since I haven't played it in a very long time

Lots of chaos with damage chits, die rolls, cards and more die rolls. It took a few scenarios of ass-whopping before this old dog got the tactics right for these rules. The components are certainly not the greatest ever, later LnL games are much much better, the cards are outright ugly and poorly written (=errata). Quite fun and fast playing though.

Simply a fantastic game. This game will sharpen your skills as a tactical leader.

Awesome wargame. The action point system works great, much better than the card driven wargames. High quality components. The map tiles and the unit counters are excellent. Thumbs up for the orientation of units, the random injury tokens, hidden units and the various attack modifiers depending on the distance of target. There are some things that I slightly dislike like the set number of turns each scenario lasts and the fact that you know beforehand when and where reinforcemants will arrive. These things are done better in Combat Commander series.

Fantastic 2p wargame. Easy to learn, with plenty of depth from the beginning, yet pretty fast-moving for a game of this type. Gorgeous components. Lots of maps and scenarios means lots of replayability. CAPs help to mitigate randomness when it really matters. Would like to get this out more, and plan to buy all the expansions. 

(From now on I plan to use the updated counters in PoH, so to play the AtB firefights, remember to take the PoH box too.)

Not sure what to think about this one. I had hoped for more of a euro experience considering it's kind of mentioned as a euro-wargame. I haven't had the time to explore it yet and even though it involves lots of dice-rolling and other random elements it still seems to have lots of potential and I've enjoyed the few times I've played it...

The game has depth and it is one of the best tactical combat games I have ever seen, if not the best. It takes time to fully understand it and be able to make sound decisions and it is not easy, especially after you start using all the units and the cards. Fully recommended for those passionate by WW2 battles and for war gamers in general. Rated after 1 play, waiting to play more

Ah, uh, hrm.  Only played the first scenario, and did so a long time after I read the rules.  The control marker victory condition made me think of mediocre breakdancers alternating between turns on the cardboard doing unimpressive moves.  Not a lot of flavor to go around with base units, no cards, and all of that.  Reserving judgement until I re-read the (constantly updating!) rules, think about it, and play at least one more time.  Snap judgement is that A&A minis was surprisingly more fun, been a long time since I played that though.  Update: it languished on a shelf and never saw a second play, so I traded it.

+ I liked it a lot. Easy to learn and realistic enough.
- There are some weird things happening with "close combat" and "rear atack" rules. These may lead to some bizarre manoeuvres.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I like the game's straight forward play and the clean feeling of the rules.  The counters are large enough to read and combined with the smaller number needed to play a scenario - do not make the game too fiddly.  I'm not convinced that all scenarios are completely balanced - especially some of the earlier ones and that can make the game feel like something might be wrong with it.  I don't think this is the case as it is likely a combination of players and tactics and the 'simplified' rules the early scenarios use to introduce the game play.  Need to get on the table more and if I were successful at that, would definitely consider the new expansions that are coming out.

12/23/2014: Note 2nd edition has its own listing.

11/23/2013: Tentative rating based upon 1 play.  Very accessible, large pieces, hard mounted boards and great graphics.  I need to play more than once to learn the subtleties of the pieces.   The # of action points to fire various pieces was counter-intuitive, a lower number is better unlike the other numbers.  It's a fun quick high intensity firefight without a lot of maneuvering.  I've only played to scenario 2 and maybe when you get to the vehicles maneuvering becomes more important.

My friend who hates ASL because of the complexity loves this game.  If you aren't experienced, the defenders seem to have an advantage.  Need to get better at rushing defensive positions.  

Looking forward to getting more plays.

A great introductory, squad-level, WWII game.  I LOVE the way the rules slowly ramp up as you go through the first few scenarios.  I wish more games did this.  I also really like the "facing rules" which really encourages maneuvering much more than Tide of Iron.  

Component-wise it can't hold a candle to "Tide" but the game-play is a bit more satisfying.  Hard Core ASLers probably won't find much to love here and there ARE some places where it can get more "Gamey" than "sim-like", but it still packs quite a historical punch in an attractive (and FUN) package.

RATING: 5
A játék elég nagy csalódás volt, de én ezt főleg annak a számlájára írom, hogy 4-en próbáltuk, pedig láthatóan 2 fővel sokkal jobb lehet. A gyári küldetések közül a legnagyobb pályát választottuk, ahol majdhogynem két teljesen független német-orosz párharc zajlott, játszhattuk volna akár egy időben is a kettőt, mert így nagyon nagy volt a holtidő.

Pedig a játék rendszere nem rossz, a cél pedig több más hexáshoz hasonló: bizonyos célhexák birtoklásáért, és ellenséges egységek megöléséért jár pont.

Ami itt plusz: a felhasználható akciók-(reakciók) típusai: egyrészt minden egységgel cselekedhetünk körönként egyszer, emellett 1 adott körben kiszemelt egységre külön elkölthetünk x akciópontot, és van egy központi akciókeret is, amit tetszőlegesen oszthatunk szét az egységek közt. Ez utóbbi egyre kevesebb lesz, ahogy fogynak az egységeink. Kártyák is szinesítik a játékot. 5 tábla van, ezek kombinálásával állnak elő az egyes küldetések hadszínterei. Van benne titkos tervezés is, ami tetszett! Kivitellel is elégedett vagyok, ez az igényesebb wargame-ek közül való, bár nem GMT szépségű, de a táblák és lapkák minősége elsőosztályú! A szabály végül is könnyen befogadható a viszonylag sok módosító ellenére is. Tetszik, hogy opcionálisan csomó szabály módosítható kedvünkre.

Az egyetlen gond, ami megöli az egészet, az a holtidő és unalom, amit nem feledtet az egyébként jónak tűnő harci rendszer. Mindenképp szeretném kipróbálni a 2 személyes változatát, mert szerintem a 3-4 személyes küldetéseket csak a nagyobb eladhatóság érdekében erőltették bele, egyébként teljesen életképtelennek tűnik a dolog így. A 2 személyes kipróbálása után viszont akár több pontot is javulhat a szememben játék, mert a hangulata, külleme, és játékmenet is szimpi, és biztató! Kár érte...

Még egy megjegyzés: elhangzott a játékunk során olyan kritika az asztalnál, hogy brutális a szerencse szerepe, és szinte mindegy, kinek mi a koncepciója, csak buta dobálás az egész. Ezzel nem értek egyet, sok taktikai lehetőséget sejtet a játék így 1 parti után, bár tény, hogy a szerepe szerencse nem kicsi.

Initial Impressions: I love the CAP/AP system as I feel that it leaves you with decisions during your opponent's turn.

I need to explore this game some more.

After three plays, I REALLY like this system.  We played the first three scenarios (1-3, in order), all won by the Germans (me).  I had some luck on rolls, but I think that my unorthodox strategy to attack where the enemy would least expect it foiled his defensive plans.  Especially in the 3rd scenario, where i was able to round up the enemy mortar team and avoid the heavy artillery barrages.  The Russians  probably put one HMG too far forward, and I easily outflanked it.  This is going to be a fun game to play, can easily be taught to "non" gamers.
It's here! (9-08)
Used the 'variable AP' rule on the third scenario; it added a lot of uncertainty to the game, and will definitely make it more re-playable.  My heavy mortars could do virtually nothing after the first turn, as they pulled low chits; guess they were tired.  So you have to factor in that things don't always go to plan, and have a flexible one.

A light wargame somewhat more complicated than memoir 44. Only played once and it didn't quite hit the spot, but i'd like to give it another go.

Components a nice size but I really didn't like the use of wargame miniature photos on the counters; seemed to make it too 'toylike'.

No way this game is better than the Combat Commander series but I suppose its high rating reflects the fact that it is a sort of 'euro' wargame like M44.

Going to give this another go with something other than the first scenario and using the SoS rules.

Upgraded to a 6 after a further play using the new SoS rules. Will revisit after a game with armour.

Some good fun, but !
As a former Infantry Officer, I can tell you the firepower numbers are way way off.
"all i know is the Pentagon study of small arms during the 20th century, stating small arms accounted for only 5% of total casualties".
 Historically, more combat deaths have been caused by indirect fire weapons than by any other means, hence the designation of artillery as the King of Battle.
And do not forget artileries little brothers, the mortars , with plenty more punch than several rifle and MG squads combined.
In spite of the fun, this game fails to portray this, by a very wide margin.

If there were ever a fast-play version of ASL, this is it. I'll admit that I have no desire to keep track of action points for a unit—but that's the game and it works that way. (This mixes a lot of steps that appear as individual phases in ASL into a continuous series of friendly/enemy actions that appear to happen continuously. That's good!) I still prefer the narrative that Combat Commander offers, but at least this game DOES work guns and vehicles into the system.

First few games were a blast. Can't wait to play again!

Edit: Further playing has stalled my enthusiasm for the game a little bit. Often the outcome depends on the first few die rolls (or maybe it's poor play). Still a very good game though with outstanding component quality.

Just an awesome game... The reaction system makes it feel like an RTS, sometimes. There is a significant luck factor, but bad strategy will cost you much more than just an unlucky roll.

(sold it because I just couldn't get it to the table, and unlike other games that I love that I can't play but still keep this one every match was a learning session including to me)

Excellent entry level hex-and-counter game with component quality beyond anything else I've seen. Not fond of some game mechanics (e.g. CAPS), however, and personally, have evolved into block games which better convey "fog of war" a greater granularity of component damage.

Tactical combat at the squad level. The theatre is Russia during WWII. The system is reasonably detailed and well thought out to facilitate play without a lot of the book-keeping you often find in games set at this level. The rules are colorful and well laid out although a bit of an eye test owing to the small font chosen. A number of scenarios lead you by the hand as the various types of arms are introduced (foot soldiers, wheeled and tracked vehicles, and aircraft). Provision for off board elements are also included as well as various categories of cards (games have to have them these day, right?).

This appears to be quite a succesful series as a host of expansions and alternative theatres are available. Although I'm not a big fan of these tactical level games, this one played cleanly and I can see why they could be popular.

Only played first 2 scenarios few times. Fun game though some nuances to learn. This game needs to be played with appropriate opponent (i.e. someone who likes WW2 games as well) otherwise hard to get in to the "feel" of the game if one person not interested. Definitely worth trying and playing though

Really lovely.  

Easy to learn squad based wargame.  The rulebook completely guides you through learning this game.  This makes it appealing to some of my non-wargamer buddies.  It is again a squad based game,so I find myself preferring more operational type of games but this has its place.

It can seem a bit to favor sides that gain a little momentum but the company has edited the scenarios set ups to address some of this from what I understand.

Unplayed rating so based on components and a read of rules. Best quality maps and counters i have seen, though i had to cut out one sheet of counters due to them being unpunched, didn't turn out great. Rules look very good, i'm glad i won't have to refer to the giant flimsy rulebook too much. Any amount of handling will see that go down the pan quick, what a bizarre size! I'm fairly certain it's similar to Attack of the Mutants rulebook from back in the 70's...big thumbsdown from me, you need a table just to read it.
Strange game so far, big positives hindered by a couple of negatives.
Upped the score after first game, seems to have that elusive gameplay to it, very nifty tactical system. Looks like this'll be a 10 if the AFVs play good.

I had several problems with this game, but the thing that really got me was just how much the Germans were "ubermenschen" compared to the Soviets. Surely there are better ways to show the disparity between the two sides without resorting to crude methods like downrating every Soviet unit or ordinance compared to its German counterpart.

OK, I'm finally ready to do a little more than nit-pick on this one. I like Conflict of Heroes, and it's definitely a lot better than its near-competitors like Tide of Iron and Combat Commander, and it's meatier and more authentic than Memoir '44. Conflict of Heroes definitely gets a boost due to the lack of any serious competition in this space.

But really, it still ultimately feels rather raw and amateurish, and the new game (Kursk) appears to have made things worse and pushed me over the edge from liking the game to being skeptical. By biggest beef is the extreme unevenness of the action cards, ranging from worthless in many situations to the occasional complete game-breaker; the one that allows you to immediately spend a unit of your choice for a mere 2AP can immediately ruin any sense of play-balance in small-ish scenarios. The impulse system as used in the game is OK but not great, and not very evocative of WWII combat. The game in general lacks nuance, especially in smaller scenarios. The probabilities are pretty raw and the results lack range. It has its strengths, especially in the area of playtime, but as a game it's a spare parts game without much imagination or design skill on display, and both ASLSK and the new PanzerBlitz offer better gaming options at comparable complexity.

Another big frustration is to see things in Kursk like snipers being introduced as counters rather than cards. This is silly. Snipers have done right, in ASL, and it's always frustrating to see a designer revert to a model that has been proven to be grossly unsatisfactory when other models that are known to work much better exist.
---
After pushing 10 plays, I'm knocking down my rating just a touch. Still a very solid 8, but the scenarios have some balance issues (some quite serious), there is a lot of luck, and I dunno, the game just lacks some texture - results tend to be very binary (OK, dead, or mission-killed), the CAPs are a little gamey, and leadership and morale, such key elements of small-unit tacatics, are a little abstract.

These are nit-picks, Conflict of Heroes is a fun, fast-playing system that I enjoy and look forward to the new Kursk game, and it's vastly superior to its competition from Tide of Iron and Combat Commander. But really, the gold standard in this space is still ASLSK and ASL, both as game designs and as history. A little unfair to compare the more complicated ASLSK to CoH, but still, CoH isn't as simple as it appears either. Lots of little rules ambiguities.
---
Funny that after so many games of this I still have never won. Especially funny since this is  pretty chaotic game (I thought I might pull the last one off, but two back-breaking special action cards - the ones that allow you to mark an enemy unit as used - took out critical powerful units at critical times), and you'd expect to win one just on the dice and cards. But not yet.

Part of it I'm sure is that a background in (A)SL is very bad training for CoH.  The types of decisions in Squad Leader are totally different from the ones here: the key CoH decisions are about prioritizing actions, and activating units with "hot" actions before actions that may be critical but are not "hot".  (A)SL is much more about tactics and fire and maneuver and deciding how much force to put where, elements that are downplayed to some degree in CoH which is more about the tactics of sequencing. I think this is why (A)SL(SK) feels so much more authentic to me; but CoH is still a really good game at an excellent complexity and time investment level.
---
At 5 plays, my rating is holding up well. The thing that makes Conflict of Heroes great is the playing time, just 45min-2.5 hours, combined with the fast pace. I'm sure some of the bigger, later scenarios will take longer, but the early scenarios are good fun, action-packed, and quick-playing. And the game is exceptionally playable and intuitive. Compared with the lurching Tide of Iron and Combat Commander, this is a huge improvement. The scenario situation doesn't seem awesome - scenario 2 seems particularly hard on the Soviets - but it's good enough and [i]far[/i] better than ToI or CC.

I only have a few minor complaints: the rules could be a little tighter, some of the gratuitous examples pad things a bit and it's not quite as clean as it could be, and there are a few minor problems (how exactly do I tell if a vehicle has a turret? And what happens to a berserk mortarman?). The action cards are a little generic, and the weapon cards (like hand grenades) are not great ... how come my company has exactly two chances to use hand grenades? I assume that if/when the series moves on, we'll get more robust rules for panzerfausts and the like. And while I think the game does a great job of differentiating the Soviets and Germans without rules overhead, it would have been nice to get some Americans (or maybe French or British, given the time frame?) as well, just to round out the package and so we're not *always* forced to play evil totalitarian empires. Speaking of which, the title "Conflict of Heroes" was not particularly well-chosen, in my opinion. The old Squad Leader games had some good, fairly non-judgmental titles (Cross of Iron, Crescendo of Doom, G.I. Anvil of Victory).

Somewhat better than Combat Commander or Memoir 44 IMO but not as good as Up Front, although comparing CoH to Up Front is a bit of an apples to oranges comparison given that their mechanics are so different.

Good quality counters and mounted map boards. Well thought out introductory scenarios and rules booklet. The revised rules (from Storms of Steel) improve the flow of play and raise my rating by at least one point. Lots of neat stuff incorporated into a fairly basic game such as hidden units and minefields, artillery strikes and the chit mechanic for hits. Uwe does a fantastic job supporting his games here on BGG. I look forward to more in this series.

Minor things I'm not keen on: I don't like the front and back defence values being the wrong way round and being able to assault a position, knowing that the enemy has run out of points so the attacker is completely safe - it doesn't feel right. The board and counter artwork is just 'okay'. I much prefer the counter artwork of 'Lock'n'Load' to photographs of miniatures. If a Stalingrad board is ever produced I hope it will look suitably ruined and urban rather than an entrant in a best kept village contest.

RATING: 7
Very smooth and impressive design.  So much of the chrome is built into the game without requiring any extra rules complexity. This is not a flash in the pan, its a legitimate break-through in squad level consim design.

What I like best about the game is the interesting choices you face in terms of tempo, in particular in deciding when/how to use your CAPS and whether its worth it to take a opportunity action. 

Some may quibble that its not a good simulation. I think you need to envision things happening simultaneously rather than in sequence to really generate the narrative. 

I'm looking forward to playing this one much more. I'm interested in the coming expansions, too.

A gateway hex & counter game with a [u]clever[/u] design, focused on simplicity and a very good combat resolution system (avoiding tables). High quality components.
I did not enjoy the action point system of CoH - the continuing manipulating the AP/CAP table in an unrealistic and not enjoyable way. Also, the opportunity fire is too weak, so units can "walk in the park".
I play it using the original rules (single activation) but simultaneous activation feature can be used too - both rules are playable.
[i]I use two useful house rules: 1. use 2 opportunity fire (instead of one) during an enemy unit activation, if each cost no more than half APs!; 2. eliminate the stupid Berserk counter from play![/i]
Suitable for [color=red]solitaire[/color] games but only the few scenarios without hidden units.

RATING: 7
This is a nice wargame. I am an advocate of decision-making games (as opposed to drawing a card or having some other mechanic dictate what you can do instead of giving you options and letting you choose) and CoH gives decisions to make each turn with the utilization of the Action/Command Point systems.

I understand the developer's intent on making the game accessible, but it is exactly that mindset which has kept this from earning a higher rating from me. A bit more detail wrapped around these basic concepts would have made it a much more engaging title.

Really, don't believe the hype. Too expensive; shockingly high quality components for such ugly art. The art director, or whoever, who signed off on this should be horsewhipped. "Queer" is the only word that describes the representation of firepower.

The "heartbreak" ASL question: this is one of the lesser entries of the also-ran versionistas (I didn't like Combat Commander either--at least this one models vehicles, however badly.) Lock n' Load is what you've probably looking for as it is a better game than either.

Basing this on two disagreeable playings, So maybe I'm missing some sublime experience hinted at by other reviewers. Really can't be arsed to find out, however.

Fairly lightweight as wargames go - kind of like a eurogame wargame, but there's enough meat to satisfy a grognard for a nice change of pace.  Can get tense when you run low on action points, trying to figure out how you're going to accomplish something.  Pretty good game overall and production values are amazing.  Mounted boards and thick, large counters.  Streamlined rulebook with progressive scenarios that add new rules.

Picked this up in a weekend e-store sale. Excellent production values, great components  (except for the very substandard cards),counters and maps are simply brilliant and the rulebook, in colour, is easy to read, replete with examples and designer notes. I like the cardboard counter storage trays that ship with it, nice touch. Rules are simple and it plays smoothly. It appears to be a system that will take some time to learn the finer points of. 

I look forward to playing this some more

First play rating & comments.  I really like the way CoH challenges you to manage your CAPs to maintain your battlefield flexibility.  I like this approach to the "command confusion" problem - it adds a nice level of tension to every action.  I also really dig the more aggressive tactical "historicity" built in to the scenarios - "this is what the Germans need to do" and "this is what the Russians need to do." No more Germans holed up in all the buildings the whole game (do you hear me, Jim?).  Looking forward to continued plays.

Thinking "Tide of Iron" has the "best squad/tactical level war game spot" locked up, along comes "Conflict of Heroes" into my collection and trumps it.  Easier to pick up, more interactive, and features more intuitive rules.  Lacks the pretty component/toy factor but I believe the heart of a better game beats underneath.

While I still think that this is a great game, I do have to lower it's rating a bit. The problem is that it doesn't really go well with my severly limited time to play games. Since there are a lot of small rules in the later scenarios, everytime Conflict of Heroes (CoH) hits the table, we have to consult the rules for quite some time. CoH is really a game that rewards repeated play and unfortunately I can't find the time and motivation for this to happen. As a result, the rating drops a little. But still: CoH is a great game whose rating might rise again if I ever find the time and an opponent to play it on a regular basis.

Comments:
--------------
* Conflict of Heroes is just plain fun. It is a non-linear game in which it is completely up to you how you collect your victory points. Do you try and destroy your opponent’s units or do you secure the victory point generating spots? However you decide, it doesn’t feel scripted. This is a quality I do like in a game.

* While there are quite a few rules, they aren’t that hard to remember. The rule-set feels rather elegant and streamlined without a whole bunch of exceptions and fiddly extra rules.

* Conflict of Heroes is a meaty game, so it might be hard to get it on the table.

Having bought this I didn't get round to playing it until after Storm of Steel came out which superceeded many of the rules. Following which 'Price of Honour' rendered many of the pieces obsolete.

Not entirely impressed by how quickly this became redundant.

As a tactical WWII wargame it has some very clever ideas, particularly the initiative/activation system, and the production is very well done (verging on the overdone). It is however simply not as good as ASL (either 'full' or Starter Kit) nor as flexible. The battles seem puzzle like rather than tactical combat.

SOLD

And now 2nd ed has replaced it completely - glad I sold up. Will steer clear of Academy in future.

Very very awesome.  The AP/CAP system is so entirely fun.  You really need to play with the 3d6 drop middle system though.  Makes everything much more organic and allows for once-a-game heroics on a fluke 12.  The components are the best I've ever seen, and the damage system is great (Berserk and NoDamage are hilarious).

ASL has a long and storied history, but damage and turn order are simply done better here.  Progress has been made.

Combat Commander came out to be an accessible WW2 game, but this game is just as accessible (played with complete board wargame newby and had like one rules question) and is way more fun and less frustrating.

The only thing keeping this from being a 9 is the lack of a scenario generator.  Canned scenarios are for teaching a game.  Once you know what is going on, you need to play your own games to have a system last forever.  

Update 8-6: Lack of a scenario generator has kept this from getting to the table at all lately.  Finding a time and an opponent for a wargame isn't a common occurrence for me.  Making an army is an important part of the fun of a wargame, and extends the game beyond its two hour bounds.  I'm sick of playing other people's scenarios.  I want to be general and the commander.  This is like watching someone else play half the game.

Update 6-8: Yay scenario generator!

RATING: 8
Players control forces of Germany or the Soviet Union, fighting squad-level WWII battles.  Interesting squad level wargame, where players flip-flop "active" status between each other, and take actions with units to perform stuff (move, fire, rally, etc).  Each time an action is taken (which could be as little as move a unit one hex), the opponent can react with an action of their own.  This opens the game up into a continually changing puzzle of second guessing your opponent.  The whole thing screams "timing issues" but in reality, it doesn't happen.  I've only read through the rules to the second firefight, and played the first two firefights (low density stuff).  Early signs are good though - very interactive and very elegant.  Chunky, good looking maps, huge chunky counters too - albeit the graphics are very muddy on these.  Looking forwards to exploring it further.

RATING: 7
This extremely clever game manages to cover all the essentials of low-level tactics (50 metre hexes; individual vehicles and guns; infantry sections) in an incredibly short and playable set of rules. Then it adds beautiful and well produced components (that actually assist play) as icing on the cake. However, the cleverness is combined with wonky bits that really make me wonder about it as a simulation of WWII tactics.

'Conflict' uses an impulse turn sequence in which each unit, when activated, receives seven action points. Units are rated for how many action points it costs them to move or fire, neatly accounting for such things as slow turret rotation and the cramped, two-man turrets of early T-34s (clever bit). Russian AFVs tend to have great anti-armour values, but high AP costs to fire, limiting them to one shot a turn, unless they are augmented with Command Action Points - a Commander's pool of bonus points which becomes smaller as you lose units (even cleverer bit).

However, as you can freely mix actions, those tactically clever Germans (who often pay only two to shoot) can pop out of cover fire, and return to cover - all in one impulse. A gamey tactic that works even for infantry, who - oddly - pay the same one AP cost per hex of movement that vehicles do. This is way too much flexibility, especially early in the game, when each side still has plenty of Command Action Points.

"You just need to keep some units in reserve for opportunity fire," you might well say. But - at least in this early war game - ranged fire isn't that effective. Often you need the generous Plus 3 bonus for adjacent shots (applies to both anti-armour and anti-personnel fire) to have a reasonable chance for a hit. So, tactics do tend to consist of letting the enemy get close, and then, in a single impulse: running from cover to an adjacent hex (often looping around to the more vulnerable flank); loosing off a couple of shots; and moving away to reduce your vulnerability to return fire.

Hit results are determined by random chit draw (there is a separate pool for armour and infantry). This is another clever bit as it means oddball results (like mobility hits on vehicles) can be  incorporated without additional die rolls or charts. Where it gets wonky is that two hits always destroys a target (again, this rule applies equally to both infantry and armour). Combine this with the tactics above, and games tend to break down to close range dogfights with each side ganging up on any nearby unit, running adjacent to fire until it's eliminated.

That's not WWII combat except, perhaps, in Hollywood. Infantry in cover or dug-in was easy to suppress but very hard to kill (except in close combat). All movement was cautious and units left cover reluctantly. AFVs, equipped with long range weapons and vulnerable to close assault, preferred to support from a distance.

I think the designer's desire to avoid rules exceptions by using identical systems and modifiers for both infantry and armour has led to a lot of this weirdness. Thus, it should be easy to improve things without gutting the system. Here are my initial (and untested) thoughts:

*Reduce the adjacent fire modifier to +2 for anti-personnel fire and +1 for anti-armour (terrain modifiers should also be less for armour);

*Multiple suppression hits should not eliminate personnel units;

*Limit the number of Command Action Points you can assign per impulse so units don't run amuck (2 seems about right); and finally

*I would limit units to one type of action per impulse (they could fire OR move OR rally OR dig-in, but not combine actions).

RATING: 4
A thoroughly elegant design that incorporates many of the complicated tactical wargame concepts into a nice clean system. Each unit counter shows costs for movement and attack, firepower, range, front/flank defensive ratings, and a few other special things on certain units. This information, along with a small terrain effects chart, is all you need to make your decisions. There's no CRT, no other tables, no special rules for cross-unit combat. Players take turns taking actions/reactions until both pass. This handles the issues of simultaneity and defensive fire much better than other light wargames, and much cleaner than other heavy wargames.

Absolutely amazing how streamlined the gameplay is, and it's great you can finish a game within one sitting. 

No flipping of charts, no fiddly rules, and yet, is a thinking game that captures the tension of squad-level warfare without complete randomness (such as Combat Commander - yuck). 

Even LocknLoad, which I thought was a decent system, pales in comparison to CoH. After this experience, I wonder how I can go back to LocknLoad, with its gratuitous combat system. 

One thing though, the gameplay is so fluid I forget who is the active player sometimes! Wonder if this part of the game could be improved, i.e., why have an active player? Hmmm.... 

Anyway, CoH has piqued my interest to see how the Stalingrad expansion turns out.

Ah, the ever controversial topic of which tactical WWII game is best. There are so many great systems available these days that the problem is trying NOT to acquire them all and just focus on one. I think any of us who started wargaming in the 1970s can tell you it was not always like this. They all offer something interesting and most are worth investing in, but I’m at the point where I don’t want to overload myself with systems. And the truth is I don’t have the opponents for much regular play of any system anyway so it doesn’t make sense to invest in more than one. CoH is my choice over Band of Brothers and Combat Commander (in that order).

I was a Squad Leader/ASL player back in the day but ASL eventually burned me out. CoH offers me enough chrome for this type of experience without overloading me with rules. I’m impressed with how much they’ve been able to render with a modicum of pages. The back-and-forth impulse nature of the system provides good tension, all types of units (infantry, guns, vehicles) are represented, and the components can’t be beat. I can’t say enough about the large, easy to read and handle components. I wish other companies would follow suit! 

The basis of the system is individual action points (APs) for units and command action points (CAPs) for the player. Even if a unit is out of/low in APs, you can use CAPs to take actions which makes for excellent resource considerations. To pour it on or conserve? Action cards provide bonuses and free actions but are appropriately tuned such that they’re not annoying, game breaking surprises.

The system has evolved to the point where the strength of the game is really its flexibility. There are different ways to tailor this game to your tastes. Per the base rules, each activated unit (or group) gets 7APs to spend before being spent. However, a popular fog-of-war variant is to play with variable APs whereby players roll dice to see how many APs a unit will receive when activated so you can’t count on anything (especially if you keep them hidden!). 

Not only does the game play well face-to-face, but the solitaire expansion offers a wonderful player vs AI experience. As someone who does not play both sides, this innovation is a godsend. What’s subsequently evolved from the solo expansion is using the AI cards in the f-t-f game. Instead of set or variable APs even, you can use the AI deck to determine if a unit is spent after each and every action it takes. Now there's a push-your-luck aspect to taking actions for a different fog-of-war experience. That makes four different ways to play the action point system -- and they all work.

The weakness of the system (and every system has them, fanboys!) is that spent units can be approached without fear of reprisal. This is somewhat addressed via action cards that players get because you don’t know if your opponent has a “free action” card ready to use. But if out of cards and APs and CAPs, you know a spent unit is vulnerable. There’s no way around this but good players should not leave themselves vulnerable in this way very often. Still, I do see it as the game’s weak point but it’s nothing that torpedoes the game play. All in all, the game play, the system versatility, the state-of-the-art solitaire option, and the outstanding components make this game a 10 for me.

PS On a related note, if you haven’t seen[url=http://battlefieldswarriors.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/comparing-lower-complexity-tactical.html] this excellent blog on comparing WWII tactical systems, [/url] by all means check it out.

Sold off my first edition so I could get the 2nd.  Yes, sometimes tactics can get gamey, but the system is so mentally engrossing, the physical production to colorful and substantial, and the ease and speed of play so wonderful, that I have to rank this highly.  This is another one of those games you can recruit new players into historical board wargaming with.  I like it even better for that than the COMBAT COMMANDER series because the chaos is a bit more under player control and you have all the toys (AFVs, etc) to mess around with.

Light squad level game with an activation scheme that allows for plenty of interaction.  My rating is likely to change as I see how well the game holds up with repeats.  The first scenario seems pretty daunting on the Soviets but it does the job of introduction to the system.  I'm already pretty sold on Combat Commander for the same format, but we'll see.  I'm curious enough to try it again.
Update: knocked a point off my rating.  The second scenario is even more unbalanced than the first one.  I will wait for better scenarios to come out.  Playing the russians in the initial scenarios is a form of masochism that I do not abide by.

In my first few plays, I fell in love with this game. I thought it was the tactical wargame I've always dreamed of. Over time, I've soured a bit on it. It's still a very fun game, but I'd like to see a bit more detail. As a friend of mine once said, the armor seems to play a lot like infantry with a bigger gun. If I were a better or more experienced war gamer, I'd probably be able to speak more intelligently about the gameplay, for now all I can say is "something seems to be missing." Also, I'm not happy with the limited number of scenarios (firefights, in CoH terminology). Some of them seem a bit repetitive, some just seem like not a lot of fun. Considering the enthusiasm that's out there for this game, I'd have expected more user created scenarios and such. I wonder if the publisher is keeping that from happening in any way?

Still, the components are of extremely high quality, and that's to be commended. The designer seems very supportive and active in improving the game.

*Very easy to learn
*Very easy to teach
*Depth to rules-size ratio is huge.
*Level of chaos controlled via optional rules
*Quick playing - games are often 2 hours or less.
*Elegant rules - once you know how to use one type of unit, learning to use another type has little or no learning curve.
*Constant back-and-forth - absolutely no down-time.
*Hugely flexible - whatever you want, whenever you want, there's going to be away you can do it.
*Most of all, it's just plain FUN.

Dislike: Fairly luck based when it comes to combat.  Although the cap track provides for a lot of strategy in altering luck. 

Overall, I really liked this game. In my first place I got my butt handed to me as the russians. Rolled really poorely and struggled to utilize my caps well.  Second play I did better and had we played the last turn I believe I would have won. Both plays were a lot of fun.

This is a solid ingenious squad-level game of east front combat. It provides players with fog-of-war, faux-simultaneous movement and random events mechanisms. Its components are excellent and its rules are simple. You can think of it as a streamlined, boardgame, version of Squad Leader. Basically, players are given 4 levels of interlocking resources to manage as they work their forces across the map. They have Action (Green) points, Command (Blue) points, cards and opportunity actions. A unit’s green points are replenished only at activation and an operations blue points and cards are replenished when a new turn begins. But this is not a card-driven game as your squads are not really driven by their cards; they are at most only assisted by them. I guess you could call it a "card-assisted game." Action points allow one unit to move and/or fight in any order until exhausted. The high value blue points and the cards can however kick in when needed. So activations and player's turns end only when a player says they end or when his is totally out of all types of resources. This simple mechanism eliminates the old "that Tiger in front of us is no danger because it’s already moved" problem that make most squad level games unrealistic, as the Tiger can be reactivated at any time by using command (blue) points. Combined arms, unit cooperation and player interactions are also neatly handled, so that one gets the sense that the better player earned his victory in a realistic manner, a feeling that games like Combat Commander never produce.

However, like most human endeavors this game has problems. If you work at it long enough you will come to think of them as small problems. If you give up too soon, they will be considered show stoppers. 

First, the designer uses the word "action" and "activation" much too often. "Actions" can mean different things at different points in the game, causing new players to get lost. 

Second, "reaction" is a misleading word as enemy units that you are not technically aware of can react to you by moving or even attacking other of your units that have not yet fired or even moved. How is that a "reaction?" Perhaps it would have been better to call this alternating impulses or pulses.

Third, the rules book is unnecessarily unclear at times. For example, at one point it says that as the active player you can do only one of four things: Activate a unit, or perform an Opportunity action, or a Command action or a Card Action. And that's it. However, later on when you actually get to read some cards, they will tell you to use them during Actions. Where did that come from? It might have been better to have labeled these cards as "interrupts" and mentioned the fact.

CoH is quite a nice game. It feels like a solid wargame, but keeps things consolidated and compact enough that you don't feel entirely bogged down by rules. As such, it is a fun wargame without being overly heavy or AP-prone. I love that players can be extra reactionary with their turns, as each player takes only one action each turn- so this is no game where one player does all their movement and firing before the second player. Incremental build-up creates lots of tension and wide room for tactics and strategy.

I've seen this one since playtesting and is a solid design.  The rules are easy enough to explain to a new player, and the staged scenarios will walk you into the game slowly but without boring missions.

Seriously, this is the best squad level system I've seen.

2012 Update:  I'm back into ASL after 20 years off. I'm pretty sure that playing CoH was the first step in leading back "home" to ASL.  CoH is no longer played, but I'll let my enthusiastic comment stand.  My rating is dropped to a less stratospheric level though...

-----

For those of you who suffered through Memoir 44 and Tide of Iron looking to scratch that "ASL itch" and that you thought would never be satisfied again,  look no further!    Conflict of Heroes is the real deal.

I haven't been more excited about a game since I was 15 years old and played the first scenario of the Original Squad leader.  This game totally kicks butt: the components are fabulous, the rules are clean, well-written and not overly-complex.  It is a delight to play.  

I can easily understand how "traditional" wargamers will have a hard time accepting CoH for what it is.  Some of the systems characteristics don't feel anything like the player-turn based tactical wargames of the past.  In order to give this game a fair shake those guys will need to drop their expecations of what a tactical war game "should" be and just play.  About the closest experience I've had to the kind of "mental realignment" that is necessary here is playing the game: "Up Front".  Up Front was a "simulations" of tactical level combat that was done in the form of a card game.  It was a great (and extremely fun!) game, but was far from what wargamers expected from a wargame.  At least Up Front had the advantage of not having hexes and counters... which had the effect of removing a set of fixed expectations.  CoH does not.  It is a hex-and-counter war game of a whole new breed and pedigree.  Some traditionalists will not be able to make the leap.

This rating is using the current SoS rules. If you figure that each player has 10 units/groups that will take 3 actions each then they will take about 60 turns per round for a relatively small scenario. This makes me feel like the pace of the game is off. As this game emphasizes efficient use of action points, it starts to feel, to me of course, more like a min/max exercize where the story of the game's scenario and events is diminished.

At first I told my brother that this was a mistake buy, but it does such a good level of feeling connected to each unit. But now each time a unit dies I put my head down in frustration and feel the loss of each unit. Whether that is tanks dieing to invisible AT riflemen or running my infantry onto half-tracks.

RATING: 6
I see what the design is trying to do, I'm just not convinced I like the way it is doing it. There is much to like here -- the game is handsomely produced, and some of the mechanics (like differing action points costs to fire units, and the unknown nature of hit effects) are subtle and at times brilliant. Where I keep having trouble is with the activation points system. With two tiers of points (plus cards) this feels more like a resource management game than an infantry combat game. I suppose you could argue that infantry combat is a resource management experience (with command being the resource), but I'm not sure I agree -- and even if I did, I don't think this would be the way to show it, because in any discrete application of your command points I think the outcome is too measurable and deterministic. Our games didn't feel like combined arms or fire and maneuver -- they were piecemeal affairs with individual units booming and zooming around the map, temporarily elevated to supersoldier status through judiciously-applied attention of the CAP hivemind. You can tell me that "I'm playing it wrong" (although we were playing within the rules), and it could be a fair cop ... it could be that I'm just not appreciating the mechanics the way the designer intended. Lord knows I've seen players bounce off the side of my favorite game (Up Front) because they couldn't get their heads properly wrapped around the designer's intent, and maybe that's happening to me here. But I don't think I like the game enough to spend significant additional time with it. It's good, but not good enough to chase my tactical game of choice off the table ... the more I play games like Tide of Iron, Combat Commander, and now Conflict of Heroes, the more I come to appeciate just how much I really do like ASL.

2008 acquisition.

Provisional rating based on 1 play of the first firefight.  This is a tactical wargame, no doubt. The first firefight reminds me a little bit of how Space Hulk plays.  Simple combat resolution, small unit count, facing, LOS.  Map is functional but not really that pretty IMO.  The mounted maps (I don't like paper maps) and big counters are a big bonus.  Needs more plays.

RATING: 6
Rating based on two games. The first two firefights.

I have MIXED feelings for this one. I recognize this to be a very entertaining game, but the CAP mechanism is odd. In the sense that squads may easily cross open ground and destroy stronger units if you have enough CAPs and your adversary doesn't have any.

Looks like a "push your luck" game to me. I think there should be a limit on the number of CAPs a certain unit may use within the turn. 
Otherwise you'll have very unhistorical results. Not that you want a true simulation, but something that may be at least plausible. Of course my experience of tactical ww2 games comes from Squad Leader. 

The rating may change with future plays.

***UPDATE***
OK OK, I think I need to review my feelings and thoughts about this game. 
It is a very good game. Easy to learn, hard to master and this is the trademark of very good games for me. Still played only infantry, so this rating may even be better!

***UPDATE***
I'm afraid in the end this didn't really work for me. 
Some criticism: too few units and infantry fire seems seriously underpowered (it basically gets very often to close combat). 

I wouldn't suggest this but I could be convinced to play. 

Damn, I have to admit that the arrival of Fighting Formations has made me turn this down which is a pity since I can sense that there's certainly a well thought out game there... just I won't be investing my time in it. :|

I'll keep the rating to "7" because of that (otherwise it would have gotten to a "6").

UPDATE
Rock solid "6" from me. Not my cup of tea.

I picked this up at Origins from the Academy Games booth.  Buy it and play it.  Simple design and implementation that allows the players to develop and employ varied tactics.  This is rare in a lot of games.  This one gets a lot of things right - the big one is "feel."  The components are fantastic, but I'm a fan of cardboard so you plastic toy guys may be put off a little.  The art and heft of the boards and pieces is perhaps the best I've seen in a hex and counter wargame.  I have and play a variety of WWII tactical games, but with my current outlook on things, this game "gets it" better.  (I have a lot less time to commit to boardgames these days.)  ASL, ASLSK, ATS, TCS and CC:E are all great tactical WWII games, but one doesn't get much more from those, other than a lot of rules exceptions.  CoH gets a star here!

A solid, enjoyable and fundamentally simple system, I am afraid the CoH will live or die by its scenarios--and if that's the case, then things are troubling. With the victory points being not terribly granular (i.e., scores are low) and no victory point balancing mechanism (i.e., both sides start at 0), things might be too tough on the attacker. 
Although I don't think the comparisons with Combat Commander are fully apt, one thing CC does do is have a more granular scoring system coupled with a better balancing job (with both the pre-made and DIY scenarios). I love CoH's core system of actions and reactions, I'm just not sold on what they did with it. Time will tell.

2009-03-03 Dropped rating from 9 to 8.  The game mechanism is excellent and the best squad-level wargame I've played.  But, some of the scenarios are very unballenced which spoils the game.

2008-11-06 Scenario 3 (General Petrov) is my favorite so far.

2008-11-03 Rating is still holding up, although scenario 5 is very unbalanced in favour of the Russians.  Hope that does not continue in other scenarios.

2008-09-18 Increased rating from 8 to 9 after five plays of firefight 1.

2008-09-09 I like the fact that all units can be activated, and that the passive player can react to every action the active player takes.  Very good components.

Everything that is good in WWII squad level combat with none of the fat. The AP/CAP system is genius and makes even small firefights interesting and fun.

What I don't like is having to buy the counter-set for a third time (2nd time was in PoH) in order to refresh the maps from AtB 2nd Ed. So they match the latest art work of the rest of the series. This lack of support for long term customers rankles a bit.

I don't quite know what to make of this game. I really love its action-reaction basic dynamics and how the use of combined arms is implemented, but the more I play (even when using all the optional rules) the more gamey I find it. 

Op fire is way too expensive and pretty ineffective if you don't use some extra CAPs, both CAPs and some action cards are way too powerful and completely abstract, the lack of simultaneous fire in close combat feels plain wrong, and even without being too lucky you can kill almost any squad in cover if you have enough CAPs and/or cards.

Bottom line is that as most scenarios are so short and both sides can do almost anything anytime (especially with variable APs) there is no room for developing any kind of medium-term strategy and most games feel as a killing rush decided by the dice or some lucky card at the end of the last turn.

In any case, I will give it a try again and play the more advanced scenarios in case the game feels more coherent with more units available to both sides.
-----------------------------------------------------
UPDATE: I feel more and more disappointed with this game. The more I play, the more I find the options at my disposal are rather abstract and limited. Lethality is way too high, scenarios are too short, most units only manage to perform just a few actions during a whole game, hidden units are fiddly to manage, and both group activations and op fire seem to be completely unreal.

Most importantly, this game lacks the ebb and flow of other tactical systems. It feels more as some sort of puzzle that you need to solve against the clock but I don't get the impression of fighting a real battle while playing it.

Last but not least, I find all the overhype about the game in BGG truly burdensome. 

Nevertheless, it has some good design ideas and is a nice effort for a first-time designer, but IMHO is lightyears behind CC, LnL, PG or even SL in realism, tension and replayability .

This is a sharp little squad level game, with beautiful art, simple flow of actions and a lot of opportunity for counters to actions on the defender's side.

Coming from a background of Panzer Leader/Panzerblitz I was very pleased with the play of this one, even before I got the armor into play.

The quick back and forth and short timeframe of the firefight scenarios helps make this a very playable wargame, and for my schedule that is a terrific boon.

I'm starting this at a 7 after playing the 1st firefight, with plenty of room to adjust upwards if needed.

I haven't gotten real wargames to the table much recently, hopefully this helps turn the trend.

I really like the "programmed" manual. I don't know how common that is among wargames but it seems like a great idea. Keeps you from being overwhelmed. Excellent counters and maps.

I've only played the first scenario (once from each side) so my opinion only reflects the game elements you see there.

I'm not a wargamer but overall it seemed pretty solid.

I think, though, that I'm just not a huge fan of tactical wargames. I'm not overly devoted to WW2 or the Eastern Front either. If I had a regular opponent, though, I'd be more than happy to play this on a regular basis.

A mid-complexity, squad level wargame, very similar to Tide of Iron in many ways, but implemented with flat tiles rather than miniatures. Many aspects of the design seem a little off though. The AP mechanism encourages a whole world of gameyness, squads run to the flank of a target, shoot and then run into cover. Vehicles drive right up to AT guns that cannot fire back. OK, there is opportunity fire, but it comes at a high price in Action Points, so it isn't used as much as it ought to be. Scenario objectives can also be a little gamey (Why is the central hex in Fire Fight 1 so valuable?) and with less granularity in squad depletion, die rolls are much higher stakes than in ToI.
Although more abstract, I prefer Tide of Iron for its visual appeal and overall 'feel' of battle, but I consider this a reasonable second choice.

Aug08: Well, it's a pretty cool game.  It's still not *quite* as fast as I'd have liked, but it is very interactive.  I probably need to speed ahead and try some games with hidden units because that sounds like a real hoot.

The Command Points do add a whole heck of a lot of decision points to the game.  The biggest thing I was not prepared for is the really low probability of damages most of the time.  Unless you burn some resources to get some hefty combat bonuses, you just won't inflict much damage.

If you at all like tactical WWII games, this one is worth trying.

A very elegant system with outstanding maps and counters. Is it historically correct? Dunno, as this is my first venture into tactical WW2. The highly interactive gameplay is something I really love about this game. Would benefit of some more scenarios.

Really interested to play this one. I have played Tide of Iron and Lock 'N Load: Band of Heroes and I like both of those. Conflict of Heroes seems to be REALLY cool and I hope it pans out that way.

A friend of mine made a good point in reference to having more versatility in the make up of your individual squads in ToI (which I think is really cool). For instance, do you put all you elite troops on one base or spread them out among your regulars to increase firepower, etc.? I will miss that feature, but it's not a deal breaker by any means.

Excellent all around game and very well designed. Components actually rate a solid "10" as this was simply the best quality game I've ever purchased in terms of sheer quality of components. Game play is fun, tense, exciting, and scenarios play pretty briskly with almost no downtime. Slight criticism on the entire Action sequencing of the game, as there is somewhat of a learning curve on getting acclimated with this and some confusion, particularly with group activations and interplay of opponents reactions - but this just takes some getting used to, and once learned, gameplay is very enjoyable. I rate it the best WWII tactical game system I've played, having experience in both the ASL and LnL series of games. Overall terrific product - I highly recommend it!

RATING: 6
I expected to love this game (my geek buddies certainly do), but I am under whelmed.  The production values are fantastic, but the game play lacks the visceral excitement of ASL and Combat Commander.  There are some cool innovative features in the game system, for example, I particularly like that the effect of the first hit on a unit being random and secret (I play the optional rule that your opponant can't see the chit drawn).  And, I think the AP/CP system is interesting.  However, the pacing does not feel right to me, and I'm going to stick with ASL and CC, both of which I consider to be MUCH better games.  Still, COH is a good entry level wargame, which I would strongly recommend over Memoir 44 or Tide of Iron for example.

Marvellous game components and one of the best introductionary wargames I know. It plays fast, is fluid and tense and has a great replayability. Imho one of the best tactical wargames at the moment. It has lots of decisions to offer and CoH gives neither player the opportunity to lean back and watch the other player do his things. The action-reaction style of this game minimizes the downtime and both players (especially the reacting player) have to decide what to do and how to react at the instance.

Brilliant.  It takes a while to really feel both the mechanics (and possibilities it creates) and the atmosphere, but once it 'clicks' you are totally hooked.
The mechanics seems very very good - moderately simple rules recreate the battlefield amazingly accurately.  The gameplay is SMOOTH - you focus on resolving combat situations, not on the rules themselves. Great!

  I appreciate the feeling that events happen at the same time (even with different units/parts of the map involved).

RATING: 8
Very similiar to my favourite game Duel of Ages and also Combat Commmander.  Where this game shines is the way the rules were simplified and the way you have options with the CAPS.  

Very fun, fast and furious.  More comments later

[u]Tidbit[/u] - I liked using hidden APS but ONLY with a roll of ONE die plus 4, this way it reduces the luck since 5 is the lowest number (not 2) and 10 the highest (not 12) and keeps the intrigue. Also like the hidden damage effect.  

[u]Update[/u] - Damn. Played this again and the luck can really sting you. I mean rolling a 2 when you only need a 3 just sucks. It seems very few wargames have only a little luck and most have lots. Guess I have to put my rating back up a little on Axis and Allies LOL! 

Still a great fun game, luck probably evens out because there is lots of dice rolling and chit pulling but its still a little much for my liking. Might have to try a variant (3d4?) or maybe just design my own game. Maybe a wargame with almost no luck wont be as fun, surely its possible to make one also fun. NT is pretty good. Maybe I just like card driven over dice since you have more options and ways to mitigate the luck, ah I'm rambling.  

One thing is for sure, this is probably the best entry level wargame out there before going to actual serious titles with similiar systems, Eurogamers not scared of dice should give this a try.

The ruleset isn't overly complex, and the game's actually pretty intuitive.  Unfortunately it can't fix the fact that I suck at post-gunpowder squad-level combat.

There are reasons to favor each of this and Combat Commander over the other, but if you're into this sort of game you can't really go wrong with either.  As for me I'll stick to strategic wargames when I dive back into the genre at all.

Um...wow. My hopes are up on this. The rules are very nice (though mine were collated in an early printing flub--printers fault--they were replaced by Academy Games with grace), I simply can't wait to see how it blooms and how long it holds that bloom.

This may be the one I'm looking forward to most at the moment.

Update: it's held up good, the only thing missing is a scenario generator. The system has been fun and the production quality is major as friends with bad eyes and disabilities can play very easily with me.

RATING: 9.5
Initial rating based upon reading the rules and playing solo.  I'm not a real wargamer, so I have been looking for the perfect wargame for me that has a good balance between playability and complexity.  I think this is the one.  Just the fact that I could actually get through the rules and feel that I understood how to play is a good indicator for me (something I really couldn't do with the ASL "Starter Kit" or Lock & Load).  This is about the same complexity as Combat Commander and slighly more complex than Tide of Iron (both of which I enjoy as well).  I can't wait to play this at BGG.con.  I'll re-rate after playing against real opponents, but I doubt that my rating will decrease.

Played a few times now.  It's the perfect wargame for me.  Enough depth and meaninful decisions without being too complicated.

RATING: 7
CoH achieves complexity at high speed. Your squads each have a set of action points per turn that can be spent to moving, firing, and rallying (if pinned by enemy fire etc.). All squads have range, firepower, and two defense ratings (front/flank). There are combat rules for long range, short range, close quarters, etc. There are terrain advantages and disadvantages. All of this flows smoothly, and the game hums along at a palpable rhythm: for each action taken, there is an opportunity for your opponent's reaction. "Active player status" passes back and forth very quickly, so there is very little sense of who's turn it is and negligible downtime.

**I should also mention that Academy Games has superlative customer service, and was quick to send me a missing component free of charge. 

**Update: Squad-level combat in games is a strange beast. I'm not sure how well it works for me just at the general level, but CoH is a fine game either way. It's possible that Combat Commander: Europe is a superior alternative.

First four games proved enjoyable, though I much preferred the second firefight (which adds command cards and group actions).  The system manages to differentiate itself from other tactical WWII games (which is a good thing) and plays fairly cleanly.  The command action points present some tough choices.

The programmed instruction system works well here and the game isn't too hard to pick up, though experienced players may be a little bored returning to the first scenario over and over to "train up" new players.

Update: dropped it a point from frustration with the later scenarios, which are too puzzle oriented for my liking.  I don't find it very interesting to play a scenario where there's one right thing to do and a player must do it or lose.

Wargames are difficult for me. I want to try them. Especially the good ones or what is considered to be a good one. But in the end they are only ok games for me and this one is no exception. It's on par with CC:A. While the latter one plays quicker, this one offers more depth without too many rules. I have to play a few more scenarios and learn the additional rules.

RATING: 7
Provisional rating (7) based on rather truncated Firefight 1.

Components are generally exceptionally well done, especially the boards, although the cards and tracking sheets are of pretty poor stock and aren't all that attractive. The counters are huge, sturdy (more like Carc tiles than standard wargame counters), but, in my estimation, not particularly good looking. The rules are fairly simple, but even after at least one revision they still feel like they have some holes (e.g., what is the AP cost of the action that reinforcing units have to pay?). The firefight rules seem somewhat haphazardly written even after online revisions. For instance, the hex notation is always supposed to include the board number for multiboard scenarios, but the reinforcements for, say, Firefight 2 don't list the board.

I like the potential of the interactivity of the game, but it still feels to me more like a game than Combat Commander. While both have their gamey elements (card/hand management versus action point husbandry), CoH feels less like a consim or a narrative and more like a VP collection exercise.

Still, I mustn't judge too harshly or soon; there's a lot of the system for me to add in yet.

I had high expectations for Conflict of Heroes, but the game was a disappointment.  It is an approachable tactical WWII game with good components, relatively simple rules and a clean combat system; however, the system is simply too gamey for me.  It can be fun at times, but it feels too much like a puzzle rather than a simulation. 

The original rules for Conflict of Heroes allowed for the activation of only 1 unit at a time.  The opponent can react during the other player's turn.  However, reacting is expensive in terms of activation points and becomes increasingly difficult to impossible in latter stages of the turn and/or the scenario.  In practice one can expect to see units move across the map while the opposing player can do little more than watch.  The group activation movement and firing option also feels wrong.

I gave it another try recently using the new Storm of Steel rules.  The new rules are an improvement in that they allow both players to simultaneously activate 1 unit so some of the gaminess is mitigated.  An ok game, but one I find I like less the more I play it.

An absolutely marvelous game. Huge counters, heavy boards, a wonderfully concise and easy to understand rulebook with numerous examples of play. This game is simple to understand, but complex in the decision making-process. It has a depth to it that is a tactician's dream. The price might seem steep to some people, but if you look at the wargames that other companies are putting out for the same price or more, you'll realize that this is a wargame of great value. No more clipping counters and putting plexiglass over paper maps using tweezers to move units. This game opens up a whole new era of wargaming which rivals Eurogames in quality. This reminds me of when Squad Leader first came out, a seminal moment in wargaming.

RATING: 7
Update based on playing Storms of Steel:Kursk with the revised rules.  The alternating impulse rule really makes these games play much better.

Initial rating based on solitaire play of first scenario.

This is a fast-playing, intermediate complexity wargame.  It reminds me a lot of Panzer Grenadier, with the mechanics of action points instead of the leader activation mechanic used in PG.  The first scenario plays a lot like some of the scenarios from Panzer Grenadier, Airborne Introductory edition, which is one of my least favorites of the PG series.

I'm hoping that the remaining scenarios, or this one, after adding all the rules (once I learn them) will be more fun.

Provisional rating pending more plays. Easy and elegant rules, I really liked the unit ratings and how they seem to work. 

Unfortunately the combat rules seemed to reward charging up to the enemy one unit at a time and firing point blank far too much. I just hope this is due to the early war scenarios with small weapons and not a flaw in the game. Reminded me of Flames of War on that point which is a terrible game. 

Thank goodness you can actually defensively fire at an attacker unlike the luck driven Combat Commander game.

The Front and rear defense values on the counters are placed counter-intuitive backwards from what makes sense. 
Map has that too dark and unfortunately now common looked ok on the graphic designers backlit monitor.

I'm not crazy about the map or counter art, but the description of play on Academy's site (plus the endorsements from some other geeks here) was enough to make me want to order this.  I think the hidden damage markers are a great idea, and it sounds like, complexity-wise, it will sit in a really sweet spot between M'44 and CC:E--something I can enjoy with the burrito boy [i]and[/i] adults--and it also sounds like the unit activation will produce more satisfying results than WaW: Eisenbach Gap, which has left me feeling like the winner is determined by the order of the chit draws.  Also, I think that complexity level, the relatively short playing time, the flexible number of players, and the super-chunky 1" counters will all really appeal to the many BGG'ers who haven't quite realized they're wargamers yet.  [i]Uwe Eickert may be a genius![/i]

Fascinating Action/Reaction system in play here.

Light tactical WW2 for those who don't like the card play of Combat Commander?

While Card Play is the crux of that aforementioned game it seems that AP/CAP management is the crux of this game too.

Both of course, are great systems with their own merits and unique enough to warrant owning both without feeling like you're really covering the same territory.

Fairly accessible war game using command points (simulates commanders) and action points to activate, move, and fire units. Random drawing of damage chits held secretly unless unit is destroyed. Quality game with big counters. I like it very much.

RATING: 8
A striking blend of squad wargame elements that, along with the "interrupt" or opponent's mid-turn reactionary choices (CAPs Command Action Pts), makes me feel like I'm really involved in a war stratagem nearly all the time, all the way through - even when it's my opponents' turn.  CoH game play lies somewhere between ASL and Up Front/Combat Commander, with the right blend of war game aspects, that puts it over the top of both games b/c of it's (1) accessibility to all types of gamers, (2) shorter time frame with balanced mechanisms and (3) having the complexities and nuances that are found in many great wargames of it's ilk.

Originally for L2 publication.  Seems that it has been changed.  With the tactical level wargames in flux, seems that it might be an alternative to Combat Commander.  While Combat Commander is so akward in my mind, this game, as it said, "...was designed to create a tense and highly interactive game play experience. You must manage multiple command resources to move, attack, and take other actions with your units. This gives you great flexibility in executing your battle plans, but makes constant caution necessary as unit activations on either side can happen at any time."  Interactive and flexibility are the two key words here. I don't like Combat Commander lack of depth. Maybe this one can rectify that. 

Lost both as Soviet and German to my opponent in 2 games in "NKVD Defense at Mir" scenario. It was quite a surprise as the game quickly grew on me with a highly interactive turn sequence. I enjoy every tactical minute of it and suspect that it replaces my ASLSK, even Lock n' Load, time at a fraction of the rules duty. The scenario doesn't have tracks though. Despite I lost the first game significantly as the Soviet in the first game, and with 1 VP as German in the second, it is the best tactical experience I have ever indulged in recently.  

The game system rocks. I am kind of believing deeply that Conflict of Heroes had hit the "sweet spot" of balance between Advanced Squad Leader and Lock 'n Load. To take a comparison, the fiddle in some parts of the tactical rules of Lock 'n Load had been tightened up while the rigidity in Advanced Squad Leader sequence of play had been streamlined to be much more interactive - the orders given by you, the squad leader, would be responded by your men and guns much quicker as if your voice had been heard just next to them or via wireless radios loud and clear. In other word, you presence are felt, and you would have thought you were really been there. Both sides can edge out each other by any chance in tightly designed secnarios, just like in the real tactical situation where the larger operational picture doesn't matter. I love the tactical feel absolutely!

RATING: 7
* Game play (historical):

- The first two "plays" with my wife were disastrous: my wife was so uninspired by this game that we did not even go beyond set-up, the first time, and that we stopped before the end of the first turn, the second time.

- I was initially surprised to find game play quite dry and uninspiring, even though this game is one of the most thematic games I own.  You don't see the units as well, compared to Commands & Colors: Ancients, which has very clear-cut drawings, and where blocks that stand up like soldiers.  I even picture my galaxy in Race for the Galaxy better than the situation in CoH: AtB, thanks to the varied and detailed graphics of Race.  Plus, combats require you to add up various numbers (3, at a minimum), which takes away more time than using dice with symbols in Commands and Colors: Ancients, with the consequence that it's harder to get immersed in the CoH: AtB.

- After 2 complete games (scenarios 1 & 2), I'm very happy with CoH, as a wargame: the game flows well, is simple enough (no Combat Resolution Table!!), and is full of theme.  It's also nice to own a tactical-level wargame, in additional to broader-scale ones (Commands & Colors: Ancients, for instance).  However, I do prefer the depth and variety offered by a game like Race for the Galaxy.

- My solo games are always very interesting; I spend a long long time thinking about where to put the counters (same thing when I imagine a strategy for 2 de Mayo, at the very beginning).  They take more than twice as long as face-to-face games, as I always let myself think for as long as I want…

* Components:
- Overall, very good quality components: the boards are great, the manual and the firefight book look great.  The counters are perfectly cut.  But the quality is not top-notch, compared to many of my other games.
- The resolution of the drawings on the counters is not so great (compare to Taluva).
- Card quality is fine, but not top-notch (compare to Blue Moon, Caylus Magna Carta / Race for the Galaxy / Scarab Lords).
- Player mats are not very thick and look fragile.
- The box cover can unfortunately change shape easily: the sides of my cover don't lay flat anymore against the bottom of the box (never seen this with any box, including the China-made Through the Ages 2nd Edition).
- The art on the box cover is a matter of personal taste, but I thought that the game was an old games from the 80s, when I first saw the picture.  I like it, though.

* Rules:
- Great, progressive rule learning system.
- Some unclear points (more than in my typical Euro game, even with the same number of rule pages as what is required for Firefight 1).  BUT Uwe Eickert is quick to provide players with input and rule updates, and the BGG community is very helpful!

I have long waited for this wargame and finally got it about 10 days ago. Everything in this game is strange and uncommon.
The box is big and heavy, the counters are very big and incredibly easy to get out from the countersheet: just press them.
The format of the rules and scenario boolets are of big format.

I seldom have played a game like that, where there is ALWAYS action/reaction/reaction/reaction and so on..., only with cards game and not at that extent. In Coh we have also to pay full attention to the moves of your opponent, to guess what will he do next. Should I immediately move away, fire or just waiting for his next move?

A lot of questions.. this is, till now, what I’m eperiencing in the first three games of firefight 1.

Feeling is that I never experienced such a tense game before!
Somehow, it remembers me the furiois firefights of the movie "Cross of iron" with James Coburn.

See what happens in the other scenarios...

RATING: 7
[Played 2 times]

Tactical wargame with several points of interest:
-) accessible core set of rules (supposedly usable for the upcoming other games of the series as well);
-) not marred by "more exceptions than rules" just to add chrome;
-) both players are constantly involved due to the "reaction opportunities";
-) multiple scenarios allowing progressive learning of the rules and offering a variety of challenges and situations;
-) manageable lenght (based on scenario, can essentially be tuned at will from 1 hour upward);
-) production value on par with the average eurogame (e.g. mounted boards);
-) rules and scenarios for 3 and 4 players;
-) good online support (new scenarios, errata corrige, etc.);
-) excellent customer service.

Possible cons: 
-) luck has an undeniable impact (dice, cards, damage counters);
-) hidden units are cool but not comfortable to keep track of (it's wise to have only a few of them per scenario, as they did);
-) pricey (but I was willing to pay the extra to support a new publisher that chose to avoid manufacturing in China).

RATING: 7
Intriguing system of unit-specific and turn-specific action points and action costs.  Does a very good job of "design for effect" (German units, for example, cost fewer points to fire and thus may fire more often).  However, the idea of saving action points strikes one not as unrealistic (as all wargames are unrealistic in their own ways), but that one is playing a euro game.  This isn't the case, but so far it does take me out of the game a bit, lessening the effect of the narrative more so than say, cards in a card-driven game do.  This probably means that I just have to get past it and eventually I won't worry about it, but this effect is there now.

Considering the hype surrounding the game, I was a bit underwhelmed, but it is a solid game.  The early scenarios are too small not to be turned by a couple of lucky die rolls.  I expect the later ones are large enough that this effect is lessened.

First new traditional wargame for me in many years (over 20 for sure).

After two plays I am impressed.  Fills my yearning for some good WWII Tactical combat without a massive pile of rules and exceptions.  MUCH easier than ASL and handles the parts I am interested in and skips the painful detail that I don't have time for any longer.

Played and tinkered in soliataire.  The system works well.  Initial rating 8, probably will rise with more ftf.

Rating stands at 8 for awakening the bear.  Adding Storms of Steel - that's a 9.  Use the new rules, burn the original rulebook (j/k)

This game really shines, much better then Tide of Iron. Both players are engaged all the time as you can react to the oponents move all the time, so there is no downtime. Setup takes 5-10 min. You can really feel like planing a battle - grate climate! Components are top notch. I never liked counters in wargames (because of this I usualy didn't played them) but those are big and easy to read so flaw of the game is really fast as you don't have to check any statistics of units in instruction. It really filled my need for a good, fast and engaging war game based in WWII.

I stand amazed that this game actually manages to deliver on all its promises. Although not really "simple" it's a lot simpler than other tactical games and it is very intuitive to learn. The game strikes a great balance between history, random fun and serious brain teasing and the scenarios offer big re playability. It's a little slower than you might expect, and the games tend to take a little longer than advertised but are still capable of winding up in an evening.

Fantastic game play mechanics.  I played a couple of demos at Origins with Uwe.  Definitely had me sold.  Can't wait to show this one off at the FLGS.

I've got over 15 plays under my belt with this game.  I initially rated it an 8, but it's progressed up to a 10.  There may be more detailed, and more intricate wargames out there, but I defy them to let the owner sit down with a new player across the table and have the game explained and PLAYED in two hours.  It's simply fanstastic, and I know that it's introduced at least 4 other people at my local game store to the world of wargames.

Balance seems very pro-German. Amazing number of Russians attacking equal number of German scenarios for Barbarossa. German firepower considerably greater.

Worst moment, when we discovered a German HMG has as good a chance of hitting a BA-10 as a 37mm PAK, but longer range, and that Rifle fire could penetrate armour from the side. 

Took 3 hours to play 1 turn of the Bug River scenario. German player 1 passed every time, might just as well had a Russian movement, and then a German movement Phase.

The more I play this the more I like it...there are some small, seemingly fiddely ways to run your units, but this is rare.  I find that the game sometimes comes down to a lucky role to snatch defeat from victory or vise versa....I have a problem with some of the unit factors... the Russian armored car armor is way to strong, no AP for the German 75 short, which historically was one of the few guns the Germans found that could stop the early T34's.  The game is innovative and absorbing...

RATING: 8.75
A two to four person wargame focusing on unit-based combat in the eastern front of WWII.  On each turn each player alternately moves one unit at a time until all units are done moving, spending action points to move, turn, or shoot.  The game we played lasted a set number of rounds, with victory points earned based on occupying a specific region of the map and eliminating opponent units.  

The use of action points means commanders have full tactical control to move whichever unit they want to move first and can respond to their opponents quickly (as opposed to card-based conflict games like Battlelore, where a player's tactical options are limited by the cards in their hand).  Unit damage is dome brilliantly: when a unit is hit players draw a random damage tile that specifies what has happened to that unit (preventing movement, preventing attacks, doing nothing, etc.).  But the damage tile is kept secret from the opposing player, so the opponent has no idea if the unit can still shoot or move, leading to a great uncertainty.  Getting hit twice (or getting one very bad hit) results in the death of the unit.

The game has very little downtime, as each player has a number of action points that they can spend during their opponent's turn (i.e., shooting at units that move into an open space); this leads to many agonizing decisions as you decide when to spend those precious few points (and it also leads to more realistic tactics and standoffs, as a unit can be shot at as soon as it leaves the tree line, even if it hopes to end its turn in another tree line).  Overall the game is filled with strategic and tactical decision making yet isn't overly complex and is very easy to setup.  I thoroughly enjoyed my first game.

Regarding setup, the game uses beautifully printed maps that have pre-made scenarios specifying which units go where; unlike Battleore there's no placing of terrain, and each map has grid numbers that simplify placement of units (making setup a relative breeze).  

By default the game gives each unit 7 action points (to be used on movement, shooting, etc.).  We played with the optional rule to roll 3d6 secretly and add up the lowest and highest rolls to determine the number of action points a specific unit got.  This worked out wonderfully, and lent a much more dynamic feel to the game (as we never knew how much the opponent's unit could move/shoot).

[Update after my second game: In our second game we played with the action cards and hidden units; both are an excellent addition to the game, adding a lot of uncertainty and a much more dynamic feel.]

Has a miniature game feel to it without the miniatures but with the facing, range, line of sight etc. And with the caps and opportunity fire it resembles especially Space Hulk. Not a eurogame feel like some other BGG users  suggest. Learnable rules dont make a game a eurogame, it is more a quality every game should have.

But that said, I played one firefight and I liked it.
I even understood what the wargamers meant with saying that it is too gamy: in the middle of the firefight I started to count and predict victory points and calculate other stuff.
But wargamers wake up: It IS a game an luckily not the real thing,

One last thing: they should change the English title of the series that seems to send out a weird message about WW2.

Receieved my copy early October despatched from Canada. I'd been thinking of ordering board 6 and when i opened the box there it was!!! Fantastic customer service to also despatch a free board. Played scenario 1 solo and feels like a really great game (initial score of 9) The rules are really quite simple and the combat couldn't be more straightforward (Firepower+dice roll versus Defence value+cover modifier) This is a real wargame with clear simple rules (a first?)

Feels like a realistic battle unfolding in your mind as you play the game on the table.

Brilliant abstraction made this game realistic and simple enough to teach and understand.

The Germans are better trained than their Soviet counterparts but the Soviets improve with time and experience as represented by their growing CAP value in game. The Soviets have some excellent tanks too, technically but their level of training and doctrine and leadership negate their technical advantages to a degree. Still the KV-2 Heavy tank and T34s would frustrate most German players.

Facing, flank and front defense rating, fortifications, off board artillery, a smart hidden system and rules that could be adapted in many different situations made this an excellent war game.

A fun and realistic game if you're into war gaming or world war 2 history in general.

Great components and an interesting AP system with action-reaction; it's always great to have squad plus armored in the same system.

I'm not a great fan of the counters value display (front armor at the back?), chits facing (I understand that it's there for the armored), random elements and lack of scenarios: overall, it's another "game system" rather than an experience.

All of the above (and more) are wonderfully addressed by Combat Commander, for my tastes.

But I see that CoH does many things well, so I'm ok with the hype.

Demoed it at Pandemonium this weekend. It is still in final playtesting, but an impressive system, that is structured to ensure difficult choices, that players use units in historical manners to produce fire-and-move tactics -- or, at least, that they will fail miserably if they don't! It is perhaps even simpler in rules than Combat Commander, but with a more depth. The multiple forms of activation (unit action points, command action points, strategy cards, opportunity activation) force players to make difficult choices and shepherd their resources. This looks like it will be very good: much easier than ASLSK, but still with a lot of depth and many difficult choices. And Tanks! :)

Neither as simple nor as quick as advertised. I traded it away before the newer SK rules, which I hear are improved. The combat is more capricious and deterministic than I would like in a tactical war game. I don't like the chit pull for hits as an event with variance as much as I like how Combat Commander's events are less predictable.

Finally, the missions with hidden units are clumsy. It's impossible to keep that information secret with the materials provided (screens and mini maps should have been provided).

A very preliminary rating based on demoing and one game.  Very impressed with how easy to learn the system is, how much detail is handled in a very clean elegant way, and how interactive the gameplay is.  You are never just sitting there watching the other guy move.  Also, the components are absolutely fantastic.  Like nothing you've seen in a recent hex and counter wargame.  My ten year old son picked it up very quickly.

Raised my rating to 10 following repeated plays.

The best squad-based tactical WWII wargame I've ever played.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a great light wargame.  The components are so good they set a new standard for wargames.  The 1 inch counters with large pictures of three dimensional miniatures are as close to miniatures as you can get with a boardgame (which has the advantage of also having all the values on the counters).  The boards are also beautiful and are hard-mounted.

The rules are well-written, easy to understand, and come with a programmed instruction approach that introduces just part of the rules in each scenario.  Players start out with the rules for infantry and quickly add the rules for hills, mortars, artillery, smoke, bunkers and etc., and tanks!  There is a nice mixture of small and large scenarios.  The scenarios are all historical actions.

The game is fast playing and very exciting. The back and forth activations keep both players always involved, but it can cause the game to bog down if you play with someone who takes forever to make decisions.  It is good to put a rule in place that the opponent must decide whether to pass or activate within 10 seconds.  Players must learn to manage their Command Action Point resources well in order to do well in the game.

Despite the great simplicity, the game has a good degree of realism.

Demanding, but smartly introducing new rules with each scenario. The game is smooth and tense, and it's short.

Not-too-complex rules that still allow for a lot of strategy.  The components are excellent and I love the Eastern Front.  There was clearly a lot of time put into this game and it shows with the detail of the units.  The game designers are also very involved here on BGG and are quick to answer rules questions, provide rationale for decisions, provide info on future releases, etc.

The only problem is that most of our games have been pretty one-sided.

Clean and straightforward system, a bit of a cross between ASL and Combat Commander in a way.  Need to try Lock and Load and see how that compares.  Gift to KW.

A very nice presentation marred only by ugly, muddy, dark, computer-video-graphics-from-ten-years-ago maps.  Panzer Grenadier, Avalanche Press ugly.  Eh, you can't have everything.  I'm hoping this is "ATS: The Euro".

Update:  It IS "ATS: The Euro"!  Fun, simple, intro tactical game.

2nd update: Meh, not much staying power.  Too loosey-goosey regarding good tactics, the cards are too silly to bear, and it just doesn't have much depth as a game, except the command points management part.  Still a good intro to the wargaming hobby, though.

Hmmm, this one is a conundrum to me. I REALLY want to like it more than I do. maybe that will come in time.
The component quality is first class, but I have become so enamored with card-driven games such as Paths of Glory, that this just pales by comparison.

It also has to be said that I prefer strategic level games to squad level.

I would never turn down a game, but it doesn't have that must-play element for me.

It's no good, I had to give it up, cos the game was just SO dry and did not give me the richly thematic experience I demand from a game. I have traded it for Fields of Fire.

Excellent up and coming game.  I  think this game will be the war game that sees the most play at my house for a long time to come.  It is an excellent compromise between abstraction and playability.  Most importantly, the abstraction, instead of detracting from the theme, allows the player to focus strictly on tactics and strategy and gives the feel of fighting an actual combat instead of playing a game.  The system, once learned (which doesn't take long), is really very transparent.

With updated rules this is probably one of the best tactical level wargames around. The luck of the dice is nicely implemented here thanks to use of 2d6 - the probability curve works well and the attack values against defense values became very important and strategic. It makes a big difference whether your foot unit resides in heavy woods or on plain grounds for example. This leads to very interesting and also realistic strategic decisions of how to advance/attack and defend in the battle.

Excellent tactical wargame! This and Combat Commander: Europe really opened my eyes to this type of game. 

It's fast, has a lot of interesting decisions, excellent components which include several mounted maps and huge counters. 

The game system is pretty neat: players spend action points but after each action the opponent may react. Aditionally, there's a pool of command points (CAPs), which can be used to supplement the normal action points. All of this makes for a very fluid and interesting experience.

Pretty solid tactical wargame. I have limited exposure to the genre (CC:E, one play of Memoir, and this), but it feels fairly traditional - units move around on a hex map, have attack and defense ratings, reciprocal LOS, and all that. I like how units have a fixed number of action points to spend on movement and firing, rather than having distinct move and fire phases.

Wholly absorbing and enjoyable.  The usage of command generates very nuanced move optimization.  However, despite the analytical inputs, the outputs are chaotic situations that seem to provide a narrative not found with other tactical combat games.

Looking forward to my first game.

06/09:  Took me six months but finally played my first firefight.  Fun.  Took a sound beating by my opponent (my 11-year old son) despite an initial setup error in my favor (I placed all five of my units in the first round instead of four with one in reserve).  My first psuedo-grog game, so the counters were intimidating at first, but by the third turn we both felt we understood the basics.  Still a little fuzzy on opportunity attacks, but I'm sure it will make sense with subsequent plays.  Overall, very good.

Edit 08/14:  Dropped a point because I hate "second editions" of games with tons of fixes, particularly expensive games. 

Edit: For trade.  Open/punched, complete First Edition.  Good condition box, flawless components.

Excellent game that strikes a wonderful balance between being bogged down with rules and abstracting/simplifying tactical combat too much.  Plays fast, almost every moment is tense with decision, and the action/reaction mechanic almost makes it play like an RTS.  The random elements as far as damage and dice go are welcome and fit well with the game as a whole, not being too simplistic or too frustratingly complicated.  Love the way it eases you into the rulebook through scenarios that are actually fun to play.

Easy-flowing game. Only small issue is that the rule book, although should be learning the players, needed in the end some back-and-forth reading (f.i. cards, shooting ranges etc were described quite long after the game would have started as per rule book...).

An outstanding tactical game. The best I've seen since the original days of Squad Leader (and better than Squad Leader). All of the enjoyment without as much of the complexity.

The components are top notch. One of the better rule books with lots of examples.

Play emphasizes using cover, laying down fire, flanking, and last minute rushes. The interactive action/reaction sequence very well breaks the timing down so provide quasi real time. 
Game play is tense with a lot of decisions when to commit forces.

First impression: The main aspect of the game is knowing the strong and week point of all units and play the firefight strategy according to the unit on the board. You may want to regroup in order to benifit of the advantage of that type of combat. The rules could have been more explicit, specialy the play exemples, and it's still a wargame with it's multiple rules. I would say that COH rules are a little heavier than the ones of Memoir'44, but the game, compared to Memoir'44, is richer and more advanced. You will need multiple plays of the same firefight to fully understand the capacity of all units and the strategy in how to use them on the stage of the firefight. Definitly must be played several time to realy be enjoyed to the full extend.

Première impression: L'aspect principale est de connaitre les forces et faiblesses de chacune des unités et jouer les scénarios en fonction de ces unités. Le fait de se regrouper joue un rôle important en combat. Les règles auraient pu être mieux expliquées, spécialement les exemples de jeu, et ça reste un jeu de guerre avec sa multitude de règles. Les règles de COH sont légèrement plus complexes que celles de Memoir'44, mais le jeu est plus riche et avancé que ce dernier. Vous aurez besoin de jouer plusieurs fois les scénarios afin de comprendre les capacités de chaque unité et la façon de les utiliser dans le cadre du scénario. Doit être joué plusieurs fois avant de pourvoir apprécier COH à sa pleine capacité.

Rating went down, I do like it but not more than Lock n' Load. I was also a bit put off by the rules changing so often that now I have to relearn it. I know the changes are simple, but there are a lot of details to look up.

I'm not a big tactical fan except for pre-industrial era games but this game is very VERY good. It abstracts a lot of details to make the game run smoothly and it still gives realistic results. The game has BIG components and BIG hex maps that are both high quality. The rules are well structured and you can learn them sequentially absorbing the material as you play through the scenarios. It is highly recommended for beginners and people that are looking for simple rules. Simple doesn't mean simplistic because every game turn you are faced with difficult decisions to take. On that, I'll have my final words: Hourrra Pobieda!

Es en teoria un buen juego de guerra, que tiene potencial, solo he jugado el primer escenario, pero las reglas son claras y sencillas, sin  demasiada complicaciones a la hora del manejo de vehiculos de combate.

Es una pena que los componentes no esten a la altura.caja de juego no adecuada para meter todos los componentes, paginas del reglamento desordenadas supongo que por error de imprenta.

There is lots to like in this game. There are some great ideas on simple ways to simulate squad level battles. However, I've played an entire game without taking out an opponents piece due to the luck of the dice. I'm not averse to luck or dice but when a game goes this badly, it is hard to call it fun. That said, other plays were indeed fun and it's a game well worth playing.

The use of Command Actions results in a tense back and forth conflict simulation where resource management is emphasized.  Plays quickly (especially the smaller scenarios) and the system is not that difficult to pick up.  Excellent components just add to the appeal of playing the game.  Hopefully more firefights are forthcoming (both big and small) to expand on the systems potential.

Cool, it satisfies my Squad Leader nostalgia, albeit with a very different (but similar scale) system. Very interactive interleaved actions. Nice components too! (But board warp seems to be an annoying minor problem.)

I started a [[Conflict of Heroes FAQ]] wiki page.

I've since tried Combat Commander and find that CC grabs me more. Although CoH is still good, CC seems to create a better sense of drama and story to me, and has more scenarios and a random scenario generator unlike CoH.

Rating based on three plays and without playing all of the rules.

This is a case where programmed instruction is probably hurting my rating. It may go up as I see all of the rules work together.

As it is, it's fun but I'm not sure I like how the cards are implemented, not sure about how necessary the facing rules are, and the abstraction of the relative squad values, while understandable when explained in the rulebook, seem jarring.

And after playing Up Front, Combat Commander, Memoir '44 (yeah, you heard me) I think I'm less a fan of having complete control to order units. I like that 'command confusion' problem set that the other games offer. It's missing here, abstracted into the squad values and CAPs.

This may be the Wargame I've been waiting for.

This is simple like Combat Commander but not card driven...  This one stays at the tactical level I like and does that very well.  Maneuvering and Crisis managment are key and keep each match interesting.

While a get a little more of a 'squad' feel from Combat Commander, this has armor and vehicles and I no longer have a reason to keep lesser titles like Tide of Iron.

This is one game I never should have bought.

Instead I should have waited and gone for the 2nd game and the polish expansion. Save me some hard earned money.

The whole thing put me off buying more, had things not started like this I would have probably bought it all.

After years of being annoyed about this, I was than convinced that the game is not completely useless.

So I was actually considering buying more and what do they do, they go and bring a 2nd edition with loads of changes and nice expansion.

Now I'm really convinced, buying the 1st edition was the one of the most regretable purchases I made.

I probably should just throw it in the bin and buy all the new stuff. :-(

After a play of the first scenario, I can admit that COH is innovative and very interesting. It offers higher variety than TOI but, I still enjoy TOI more. I cannot explain why. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'm having difficulty making my mind up on this one. On the one hand, I like the idea of a streamlined tactical game in which lots of complicated details and options are represented in a few easy-to-use systems. CoH certainly does this, and I love the theory behind APs, CAPs and action cards. However, I'm beginning to worry whether the need to fit everything into a few distinct mechanics that cover all the various actions you can take creates situations which are silly. For example, in scenario two, I would have thought that the Red Army MMG in the stone building would be in a perfect position to mow down the German squads advancing towards it. However, it is the MMG which actually has reason to fear the enemy, and the best first move, it seems, for the Soviets is to pull out of the stone building and hide out of the German line of sight. Here, I feel, the result of all the systems I like (distinguishing units by AP costs for movement and firing, the simple combat resolution system, taking CAP and opportunity actions while your opponent is the active player etc.) come together to create something that in practice just feels wrong. 

In many situations I am quite prepared to sacrifice historical accuracy for playability (though I do like historical accuracy). I can also well understand that lots of people love this game because it works so well as a game. However, some of the decisions you are offered just don't seem right to me. For me, historical wargaming is at its best when a clear and simple set of rules (in which you are playing your opponent and not the system) offers you similar dilemmas to those faced by the historical participants. CoH does the first admirably, but I'm not sure if it does the second. 

Of course, all these comments must be taken with a pinch of salt as I know nothing about real warfare and CoH is the only tactical game I have played.


UPDATE: I have read about the new rules and hope that these will go a significant way towards overcoming my doubts.

I'm a fan of the CAP system as a way to encourage holding onto a reserve.  I also appreciate the lack of leaders, which is a tactical trope that I think needs to go the way of the dodo.  The components are of course lovely, though the counter set with the first edition leaves something to be desired.  My big issue with the system--and the updated rules don't really address this--is the tendency to see the combat devolve into something that looks more like aerial dogfighting than anything else, as you go back and forth with individual units so you don't waste any remaining APs if at all possible.  I'm also not a huge fan of the scenario design, which generally creates tension by keeping the turn limits unreasonably short.  I like the system more than some others, but I think it's been thoroughly eclipsed by Band of Brothers.

I didn't really understand what was so good about this game after reading the rules, and playing it through got me further mystified. It definitely has a lot of bells and whistles with units and objectives, and a nice system that keeps players engaged, with very little downtime. It just seemed really dry, moving pieces around the board, and trying to deduce what your opponent will do. Almost a game of not losing to your opponent and preying on his blunders and oversights, instead of actively trying to checkmate him. I don't get the oh-my-god-I'm-leading-troops-and-shitting-my-pants scale of grandness which other wargames offer in spades. Maybe I just don't like tactics. Or I wasn't playing right. I'll give this a couple more shots. I've only played FF1 so far, so maybe that's the problem.

It had to happen: a Euro-slant on a hex and counter wargame. In this case, units are given action points to move, attack, op fire etc. VPs are gained according to scenario conditions (usually killing opponents, capturing hexes).

The CAPs system is a clever way to not bog the game down in a dull repetitive 'I op fire you each time you move' way and provides some flexibilty in gameplay. The cards? Ok I guess but so many games use action cards as an easy 'out' to add flavour and randomness to the game. The I-go-you-go system is a nice touch as well.

However, not entirely sure about balance (Russian troops are underpowered). Not sure I like the random 'draw a hit counter' and the printing is simply too dull and muddy. For the next edition, consider having larger hexes and printing counters on glossy stock (the matt countersheets just soaks up the ink).

I think this is an excellent game for casual or novice war gamers, or generally for people who enjoy light war games and I know these people exist plenty. I have to give credit to the designer who admirably condensed huge antiquated war game rule systems into an easily playable game which still manages to capture all the flair of these systems, while also keeping the game 'realistic'. These things for example can't necessarily be said about [gameID=22825]. The game even incorporates a clever system for reacting to the opponent's moves and the components are awesome. However, it's just not my type of game, the resolution of attacks gives a too broad array of results, i.e. the game is very luck based and at least with the few units we had in our game you can't really stage a sophisticated attack or defense. For example breakthroughs in our game were generally only achieved by rolling high and having the right card which allows a unit to move extra fast. Maybe I'll still buy the German edition of the game, which will have a politically correct name, and by appearing next month will be the only German war game to be published in quite a long time. Or maybe I'll wait for one of the other titles in the series about conflicts I not yet have games about.

Az egyik legmagasabbra értékelt könnyedebb wargame. Nem véletlenül. Gyönyörű egységek, szép táblák, egyedül talán a pontvezető saját táblák sikerültek gyengére. Jól kidolgozott területi módosítók, könnyed találatszámolás és sérülés jelzés. Az egész játékmenet nem túl veszélyes. 2-3 játék után már a módosítók is fejből mennek véleményem szerint. Egyetlen baj van, a kocka. Hiába a jó stratégia, ha rosszakat dob az ember. Erre azért vannak jobb megoldások, bár tudom a legtöbb wargame kockás. 1-4 fősnek van hirdetve a játék, de teljesen egyértelmű, hogy 2 játékosra van tervezve. Nem ajánlom több személynek. Elsőre 6-os. Két játékossal még van esély pontszámnövelésre.

It seems like a really good squad level combat game, even for eurogamers like me! You get a lot of cardboard for your $70, including several boards and nice 1" rounded counters. Movement, attacking and reacting (opp fire etc) are nicely handled through a simple action point system. There will be a huge number of expansions (different theaters and wars) in the future ... it seems like a very cool system!

If a combat game were likely to see any table time around here I'd definitely buy this one.

I played this the first time against my sister who totally trashed me and then concluded that it was too much rules. I don’t think she enjoyed the war theme, because she can play games like "Puerto rico" and "Robo rally" without complain. The "war thing" is not an issue for me and I don’t experience the rule as an obstacle. The contrary, the rules are in my opinion slim and quite easy to understand and the reaction rule is the thing that makes this game good. After having played it with a more war-oriented friend, who isn’t so damned lucky as my sister, I have also conclude that I don’t totally suck on it. The length of the game is good and the possibilities to expand the firefights to 4 players are additional positive things.

The only other game I can really compare this one to is Commands & Colors: Ancients.  It takes a topic (tactical WWII warfare in this case) that has been covered pretty extensively and boils it down into an elegant system that captures most of the unique nuances with a minimum of rules, allowing you to play your opponent, not the system.  While there are games that might cover the topic more realistically (ASL), with better toys (Tide of Iron), or a better variety of scenarios (Combat Commander), none manages to do it without tradeoffs in complexity, game duration, or scope of coverage.  In the middle of all these sits CoH, with the perfect balance between components, difficulty and variety.  Some mild typo's mar this otherwise outstanding game, but the most important thing is that IT GETS PLAYED AGAIN AND AGAIN!

Rating based on one solo play, and study of the first part of the rules an several supplements here on the Geek.  Best wargame production values I've seen--components truly wonderful.  *Very* interesting system--fluid in a way I'm more used to seeing in "real time" computer wargames than a board game.  I strongly expect as I explore this system more, and get more comfortable with it, that the score will go up.  The very different nature of the system compared to traditional I-Go/U-Go mechanics may lead to some initial confusion (*especially* for more experienced wargamers--total newbies may actually have a slightly easier time because they don't have to adapt from older styles of wargaming).  The customer services is absolutely top-notch--had a problem with my rules, e-mailed the company, and had a response back from the designer himself in very short order!  Fully satisfied there--look forward to more!

Fun game. Beautiful components! Love the large counters. Not sure how much I am going to get it played but its a simple system that I can teach easily to my friends, so it will stick around.

RATING: 6.3
After the first two scenarios I am very much tempted to call it "Dice at the Eastern Front", but I will give it another try.

Update (Rating 5->6):
Scenario 3 was far more interesting, mainly because we actually played with hidden Soviet units. Still very dicey, though.

Played scenario 4. Quite some fun, but hardly any tactical gameplay. Units always try to close the range to adjacent hex or even close combat, because hits are very unlikely without the +3/+4 modifiers. Reacting opponent then has the first shot, but must spend his unit. Better die rolls win. That's about it.

RATING: 7
Well, I wanted this for ages, and now own it. The rules all make sense, the game flows along so much easier than Tide Of Iron, and the player has more control than C&C.
All I need to do is find a worthy opponent!
Stunning game though with plenty of tense moments, but without the headscratching. A game that makes me smile.
Update 9/16 - Haven't played in 7 years. Sold.

Played the first two firefights. Both as the Germans and won both easily. I wonder if this should have a warning to say play these scenarios twice, once as each side much like Memoir 44.

The first took an hour, the second about two hours.

    Despite the fact that I did the cover art this  is the one 'tactical' game that I've played in my life that apealed to me. Its not only a great system for a game but one gets the feel of realism in this game.  And the components for COH is some of the best around--- I look forward to future offerings in this system.

RATING: 8
Innovative squad-based wargame that uses a set number of action points allowing you to conduct your operations such as move units, fire etc. This mechanism is easy to understand and provides a very playable game. The production values are of the highest standard (exceptional in fact for a wargame) and the rulebook is clearly written, introducing extra rules as you progress through the game's 10 scenarios. The combat itself can feel a bit too simplistic but I guess that's due to the fact that this is such an accessible game in comparison to some of its contemporaries and some depth/complexity has had to be sacrificed in order to achieve this.

I cant stand games like this. You are purportedly a company level leader or some such and yet you can see all the forces arrayed around you. like the radar screen in a video game. What's the pt of all these machine gun effects and such if realism is shattered on that level? Does have an interesting use of activity pts or whatever. I find them non thematic here but interesting idea. Also you have like damage chits you toss on wounded guys. Again interesting, not good for this situation.

Possibly the most out of balance game in existence.  German units fire at 3x the rate of Soviet units. So if you play the Germans, you win unless you really don't know what you are doing.

As of now, one of the best games, let alone war games, that I have ever played.  Once you have a handle on the rules, play a game or two, the brilliance begins to emerge, and CoH becomes a clear choice as a preferred war game.  Short enough without feeling truncated, immersive gameplay, and components incredible to the point of embarrassing many Euro games.  Bravo to Mr. Eickert for both a great game, and for holding a good understanding of the common gamer.

I've never been a wargamer, but when I heard "Action Point Based tactical squad game," my brain immediately associated that with computer games of the same description (very specifically Jagged Alliance and X-Com) and I decided I had to check it out.  I definitely love how (relatively) simple the game is for a wargame, and how the system makes the games seem much more back and forth and play quite hard and fast relatively quickly.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This is a nearly excellent tactical wargame.

Play with the newest rules. It's a far better experience.
We easily added home rules to play with 4 players all the 2pl. scena
Missions of AtB  are well designed and, offer great variety and take hours to play through. (~35hours for us, double that if you switch sides then add the bonus missions...)

The AP/CP system does the job and allows significant unit variety, but ultimetely draws from the immersion as it leads to some ridiculous situations. 
Some missions are not completely balanced. I'd love to see a better campaign system. Unit balance is also constantly improved by the living rules, but still has some minor problems. (inf.guns work like poor hmgs, mg tanks can kill bunkers, infantry still poor vs tanks in urban terrain etc.)

Rating removed since the second edition is out

Enjoyed my first game.  I'd certainly be up for trying at least one more scenario.  I've come to the conclusion that this isn't my favorite game scale (I prefer a more strategic level) or type (I prefer blocks and/or CDGs), but this works well for me despite that.  I certainly see that this is a great introductory wargame.

I like this game, but the reason I don't rate it higher is that it isn't [gameid=21050].  That's not really fair to this game, but I am not sure I really want to take the time to get familiar with two different tactical WWII systems.  I know the Combat Commander system, and thus any other tactical WWII game is going to have to prove that not only is it as good as CC:E, it is good enough to supplant Combat Commander.  I've played CoH twice now, and while it's enough to get familiar with the system, it still mostly makes me wish I was playing CC:E.  The one advantage it has over the CC series is that it includes vehicles, but in my experience, the vehicles don't have enough flavor on their own to hold my interest.  They simply feel like better infantry.  Still, this is a good game in its own right, and deserves a shot by WWII aficianados, or people looking for a nice, fast tactical game.

Conflict of Heroes have incredible mechanics, very fast end intuitive. Gameplay is fantastic and simple enought that explanation takes about 15 minutes max. The only problem I see with this game is the scenarios - it's the usual case of attacker/defender, wher one side has weaker forces but better position. Playing as the defender can feel restrictive and unfun for some people. I will have to check other games from this series, maybe this is not the case there. Still, this is probably one of the best military systems out there.

I've only played this once. It was quick, tense and tactical. My two main gripes were the instant kill counter (although I kinda like the excitement it generates just by existing, I'm not sure it's very fun when it shows up, since it has the potential to make or break a game), and the overall randomness of the 2d6 dice roll. These things are easy enough to house rule: Remove the instant kill counter and change all dice rolls to 3d6, keep the highest and lowest. This should keep most results closer to the average.

Pretty good, but too mathy, too much godlike power. Prone to "solving" the scenarios. This is a wargame that appeals to some heavy eurogamers I know, which is impressive, and which explains why I don't like it as much as the Combat Commander series. I like the chaos and drama of CC, and the aforementioned eurogamers would probably hate it. So to each his own I guess.

RATING: 10
This is the "Squad Leader Lite" version of tactical WWII combat that I have been waiting on for years.  It sets a new standard for simplicity in tactical wargaming while retaining the historical feel of play and keeping both players actively involved with minimum downtime.

Way back when, I remember getting my hands on the game Squad Leader.  Try though I may have, I could not get into all the rules and expended effort required to get in a few moves and shots trying to take an objective while worrying whether the blisters on my troops feet would affect their morale.  Yet I admired the game.  It was WWII tactical combat at its best for the 70's.  Ever since then I've been looking for the holy grail of Squad Leader Lite.  Sure there have been games like Tide of Iron, Axis & Allies:Miniatures, Combat Commander, Panzerforce, and Memoir 44 that might have qualified but all they lacked something to link them to Squad Leader in a certain way.  Well this game just seems to do it right for me.  It's a slugfest for sure, but it plays out quick and keeps everyone in the action for the whole game.  Essentially, there's no down time for players.  You need to be watching your opponent and planning how best to command your troops to take advantage of situations.  The unit size is manageable and all the elements of a team's leadership and weaponry is distilled to the numbers on the chits.  The action cards throw in the chaos of war that keeps you on your toes, and the action point/CAP allocation is genius.  Plus, there's currently armor in the set, and aircraft coming in the next game so this is becoming THE tactical WWII game to own.  This will never replace Squad Leader to the afficionados that play that game.  If anything, it may get more folks interested in ASL and the like when they want more detail.  But for someone who's been trying to go the other way since SL first came out while retaining the feel of the battle, this is it.  A game well deserving not only in simplicity and fun for a wargame, but one that now sets the standard for components as well.  The boards are beautiful with a nice woven fabric texture.  The chits are 1 inch with rounded corners (no more clipping required), and the rulebook is well laid out with plenty of examples.  Anything bad I could say about this game just isn't worth mentioning.

Needs to be in the game design Hall-of-Fame.  There really ought to be one.  Beautiful to look at, incredibly fun to play.  Production values are so high your jaw begins to ache as you play the game in slack-jawed wonder.  

Love that the game instructions hold your hand along the way.  Early scenarios gently coax you onward until you desire more complex, immersive gameplay.  If so, read the next couple of instructional pages.  

The expansions and support you receive from both the designer and publisher are among the best in the industry.  A must-get game whether or not you are a wargame fan.  :)

A well-done application of action points to the wargaming field.

A minor caution: Those individuals suggesting CoH as an introduction to wargaming are severely overestimating the average gamer's tolerance for a lengthy, detailed ruleset.  I felt confident going in myself, and ended up being surprised at number of rules (albeit well-explained and exemplified rules) that I needed to take in.

CoH would make a good second or third wargame, maybe - but not the very first.  Unless you really think that the potential wargamer has sufficient stamina and interest.

Have played through the first five or six missions.  I feel like the game is a little unbalanced, but perhaps that is just because I've only played the missions one time each.

I am a student of War Studies at KCL in London. I can tell you this game rocks! In terms of incorporating real tactics used historically it is very professionaly designed.

A very nicely produced game.  The rules appear clear initially, but with play a number of ambiguities appear.  I don't like the action point model in general, and it doesn't really work for me in this game in particular.

Update (11/12/2010):  When played using the updated rules (from Storms of Steel) and counters (from Price of Honour), my complaints about this game go away.  In particular, the interleaved actions make the game much more interesting.  It's a solid, quick-playing, WWII tactical combat game.

I prefer Combat Commander to this, but my son likes this one from time to time, and I'm happy to play it.

Maybe I just suck so far - and assume that is the case. overall an excellent system. tense - quick moving - no down time - each scenario i have played goes to the wire. Wish i could afford to have all of the new versions that have come out but not yet... can't go wrong if you are interested in tactical WWII combat.

Owning and playing several basic wargames like Memoir '44, Battlelore and Tide of Iron, I have quickly discovered that CoH clearly beats them all for me. Every scenario is dense and thrilling, giving you the sensation that the every next action you make will be decisive for victory or loss of the complete game. In the end it often turns out that it wasn't, but this sensation really keeps you stressed and near a heart attack every single minute of the session. Lots of decisions to make and so little time... fast paced action/reaction makes you feel like if you are really "there". Clearly the best entry level wargame I have known since today.

What a fantastic game. It's a standard hex and counter, but with some eurogame influences. Such as the activation system, the 1" counters, and game boards. This is an excellent game system.

The best introductory wargame.
Not enough deep to properly simulate tactical fights.

Another contender for multiplayer war-game.  Though this one may be too tactical and micro level than I would like.  Would also be a good game for variety's sake since I have no tactical wargames and a good option for 4-player wargames when I usually prefer 6-player games.

NB.  I've already traded away the first edition and now own the second edition. The second Ed. is NOT for sale or trade.

I've now played a couple of scenarios solo and its a corker. I expect this to creep up to a 9 with more play as its my favourite wargame to date

Components .. well on the whole much, much better than any other wargame I own. Boards and chits are high quality. The map artwork could maybe feel a little fresher but I think thats down to the printing and textured board (but a gloss board would be baaaad).  The biggest let down are the cards that feel very amateur and not in keeping with the rest of the components.

Got to play my first f2f and it went better than expected. I'm terrible at explaining rules but its such a simple game to learn (except for the grouping rules) that it all went well and was enjoyed by both of us. We plan on going through the whole list of scenarios so it obviously went down well.

Update .. well after 5 f2f battles of the first 5 scenarios this really is a fantastic game. I love how it feels and how proper period tactics pay off. Its got an immediacy and sense of involvement that I find lacking in many other wargames. If I could afford it I'd get Storms of Steel but the price hike from £38 for AtB to £54 for SoS forces me out.

Now 7 f2f games and I couldn't recommend the game enough. Yes I could and have criticised some components but they've already been addressed in Storms of Steel and are much better. now we just need more scenarios. Can't wait for the campaign book.

edit: OK, so after playing through the entire game and some of Storms of Steel and several other series, do I still think it warrants the 9? Well yes, although it may drop a notch to 8.5. I think it sometimes feels a little too dry and gamey. The AP's and CAP's are a great mechanic but often decisions and options come down to saving or using them. Same with the cards, which often just refer to a loss or gain of them rather than a real world event that results in the loss or gain. That extra bit of chrome wouldn't cost much but would go a long way to improving the immersion. There can also be an issue with some missions feeling like they're more like puzzles and that once you've come up with the solution the scenario is used up. 

But that being said I still love the game and the real world tactics that can be essential towards winning. I'll keep buying the expansions, money permitting,


First Edition, including the Marsh map, are now for sale/trade

Not a bad game, and the components are some of the nicest I've seen in a wargame. Unfortunately, the system just didn't grab me - the chit pulls felt a bit artificial, and it didn't produce the feel of WWII tactical combat for me.

Gave my copy to a friend.

I like this one. Scratches exactly the same itch as ASL, though it is still different.

9/18/08 - Played 1st two scenarios and had a pretty bad time.  I acknowledge that I played terribly and that that might be influencing my rating to some degree.  Nevertheless, I have some pretty serious issues with certain design choices, and, unfortunately, I'm not at all interested in giving it another chance.

A few complaints:
- German LMG teams, with their low movement and fire costs and high damage modifier, are simply superior in every way to any other squad type (except that they are 1 point deficient on defense when attacked from a flank, which is a negligible penalty in comparison).
- Soviet SMG assault squads can fire farther than their rifle-armed counterparts.  WTF?!?
- CAPS, which are described as an abstract form of command and control, force the attacker to make the following ridiculous decision:  Do I expend all of my CAPS trying to do damage to the enemy, but leave myself vulnerable to the ludicrous threat of long-range, close combat attacks from the defender, or do I reserve all of my CAPS as a defensive precaution against this ludicrous threat but suffer my troops sucking too badly to accomplish anything otherwise?
- The more damage I inflict on my enemy in the form of damage counters, the more likely I am to draw the instant death counter when my own units are attacked.  ?!?!??!?!?!?!??!

I am not an ASL fan-boy by any stretch of the imagination, but, IMO, you will be far better served by picking up one of the ASL Starter Kits for 1/3rd the price of this game.
